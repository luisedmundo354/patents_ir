        "The present invention relates to a technique of laying out electronic components, and more particularly, to a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components which facilitates a user to select a desired electronic component number, so as to improve speed of laying out an electronic circuit.",
        "With a booming development of electrical technology, electronic products, such as mobile phone, digital camera, computers, and MP3 player have become popular in every family. However, a fabrication of printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the electronic products, which fabrication involves designing, circuit drafting, mechanical drafting, component placement, and drafting of a layout diagram for the printed circuit board, before fabrication of electronic products, is time-consuming. Accordingly, manufacturers continue to propose new techniques in hope of simplify the process of researching for the electronic products.",
        "Generally, the printed circuit board is accomplished with a co-operation of an electronic engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a layout engineer. FIG. 1 is a flowchart showing the design process for a printed circuit board as practiced in the prior-art. Firstly, in Step 101, a circuit diagram for an electronic product is designed by the electronic engineer and converted to an initial layout diagram. Secondly, in Step 103, a mechanical diagram for the electronic product is designed and drafted by the mechanical engineer. Thirdly, in Step 105, component placement is performed by the electronic engineer and the layout engineer, such that the electronic components are placed on the circuit board. Last, in Step 107, the electronic components placed on the circuit board are interconnected by a routing method so as to complete the design of the layout diagram. Finally, in Step 109, the printed circuit board is fabricated by a manufacturer according to the layout diagram of the circuit board.",
        "For the foregoing Steps 101 through 107, the designers design the printed circuit board for an electronic product by using drafting software installed in a computer. When the drafting software is employed to design the circuit diagram of an electronic product by an electronic engineer, a circuit diagram file is firstly converted to a layout diagram file and the placement of the electronic components is performed. FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing the placement procedure for electronic components of a prior-art printed circuit board design technique.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, in Step 201, the circuit diagram for an electronic product is designed by an engineer using the drafting software, and the circuit diagram file for the product being drafted is subsequently converted to the layout diagram file. In Step 203, rules for printed circuit board layout, to be stored in the layout diagram file, are set up by an engineer using the drafting software. Such rules would constrain the printed circuit board layout in certain ways based on certain design requirements. Then, in Step 205, electronic components and relevant connection circuitry contained in the drafted circuit diagram are added into the layout diagram file for the printed circuit board. In Step 207, important components determined in the mechanical diagram are initially placed on the circuit board. Finally, in Step 209, other electronic components which belong to the same page or area of the circuit diagram are located one by one in a manual manner and added to the layout plan for the printed circuit board. Afterwards, determination is made as to whether the external connection locations are congruent with the heights and positions of openings shown in the mechanical diagram in a one-by-one fashion until all of the electronic components have been placed onto the circuit board.",
        "During the placement procedure for the electronic components, however, engineers often need to search through the electronic components which belong to the same page of the circuit diagram, sometimes containing thousands of electronic components, to locate the circuit at hand. Such searching, in order to place the electronic components one-by-one into the printed circuit board layout, can be very time-consuming and placement errors can occur. Moreover, as the variety of electronic components has gradually increased and components have become extremely similar, if the designer decides to modify or replace an electronic component of the original circuit diagram, it is hard to immediately locate the electronic component from numerous pages of the circuit diagram, so as to slow down the design process.",
        "Accordingly, prior-art layout methods for electronic component layout are not optimized, particularly for electronic products with a short design cycle. The problem to be solved here, therefore, is to provide a method for improving layout efficiency for electronic components in the overall design process, so as to decrease both initial design and subsequent modification time required for electronic component placement. In the latter case, the goal would be to allow the electronic engineer to immediately search and locate electronic components to be modified or replaced, so as to accelerate the design process.",
        "In light of the above prior-art drawbacks, an objective of the present invention is to provide a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, whereby the electronic components contained in a circuit diagram can be rapidly and precisely placed in a printed circuit board.",
        "Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, so that subsequent placement of the electronic components in a printed circuit board no longer requires modifications to electronic circuits, so as to effectively shorten the research time.",
        "In accordance with the above and other objectives, the present invention proposes a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, applicable to the layout operation for the electronic components of a printed circuit board. Initially, a first two-dimensional planar view containing the various electronic components numbers therein is preset using a drafting software platform. Subsequently, the two-dimensional planar view is converted into a text file and all the data contained in the two-dimensional planar view are recorded in the text file. Then, all of the electronic component numbers contained in the first two-dimensional planar view are displayed in a second two-dimensional planar view, and a function selection menu is generated by an arithmetic process, such that a user can select electronic component numbers contained in the text file to perform placement of the electronic components.",
        "Using the method proposed in the present invention, the placement of the electronic components can be rapidly and precisely performed by an electronic engineer and a layout engineer so as to increase layout speed for electronic components and accelerate the design process. Furthermore, when the electronic engineer decides to modify the circuit or replace an electronic component, according to the method proposed in the present invention, the desired electronic component to be modified or replaced can be immediately located, so as to simplify the procedure required for changing electronic component layout.",

        "In Step 302, the circuit diagram file is converted into a text file. The text file is encoded with the various electronic component numbers contained in the circuit diagram shown in Step 301. The data is stored in a text format, such that a user is able to acquire the data of the circuit diagram being previously drafted via the text file. Next, Step 303 is performed.",
        "In Step 303, the electronic components and relevant layout circuitry comprised in the two-dimensional circuit diagram plan designed in Step 301 are displayed in a layout diagram for the printed circuit board prior to performance of Step 304, such that placement of the electronic components can be performed by a layout engineer.",

        "In Step 505, the electronic component selected by the user is placed in a predetermined location on the printed circuit board, prior to performing Step 506.",
        "In Step 506, it is determined as whether the circuit diagram for the electronic component in the sheet selected by the user is opened. If it is opened, Step 507 is performed to display all components and relevant circuits contained in the selected sheet, and then the process terminates, otherwise, the process terminates immediately.",
