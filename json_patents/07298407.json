        "The present application is also related to U.S. application Ser. No. 10/268,362, filed Oct. 10, 2002, by John P. Shepherd et al., and entitled, \u201cA CCD HAVING IMPROVED FLUSHING BY REDUCING POWER CONSUMPTION AND CREATING A UNIFORM DARK FIELD WHILE MAINTAINING LOW DARK CURRENT,\u201d in which reference is made to and priority claimed from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. U.S. 60/347,524, filed Jan. 11, 2002, entitled \u201cSLOW FLUSH CLOCKING.\u201d",
        "The invention relates generally to the field of image sensors and, more particularly, to such image sensors having continuous flushing of the sensor with a vertical transfer clocking time equal to or greater than its normal operating vertical transfer time.",
        "Typically, a true two phase CCD (charge-coupled device) refers to a device in which there are two physical gates over each pixel, with each gate formed in the silicon under it. In this regard, and referring to FIG. 1, there are two-phase voltage lines V1 and V2. This charge-coupling concept is used in frame transfer and interline transfer CCD image sensing.",
        "As is well known in the art, a CCD 1 includes a plurality of pixels 5 for capturing the incident light and converting it into electronic representation. A horizontal shift register 10 receives the charge passed vertically down from the pixels 5, and the shift register 10 eventually passes them out from the CCD 1 for further processing. When initiating image capture, the CCD 1 should be flushed to eliminate undesirable excess charge accumulated during idle periods. In prior art devices, the vertical clocking of the gates during flushing is such that there is a 50% duty cycle in which each clock spends an equal amount of time, tp, at the high and low gate voltage. In addition, the rising edge of V1 is coincident with the falling edge of V2 and vice versa. This provides the condition in which at no time are Vl and V2 at the low gate voltages at the same time until the end of flushing. For clarity of understanding, the vertical clocks (not shown) operate continuously for passing the charge via the horizontal shift register 10 from the CCD 1.",
        "For thoroughness of understanding and as understood by those skilled in the art, the CCD 1 may then capture an image during its integration time which is subsequently readout during image readout. The clocking for these cycles are not shown in their entirety, as they are well known in the art, and few exemplary times are shown for clarity of understanding.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown a prior art CCD 1 illustrating its dark field. As illustrated therein, such prior art devices include a non-uniform dark field 15 such that the outer or peripheral portions have a higher dark field than the central or inner potion.",
        "Although the presently known CCDs are satisfactory, they include drawbacks. Such prior art devices have high power consumption and require a relatively long latency period before a picture can be captured after pressing the image capture button. This is commonly referred to in the art as picture-taking latency. Further, the prior art CCDs produce non-uniform dark fields which will, in turn, create a non-uniform background for which correction is required.",
        "The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. Briefly summarized, according to one aspect of the present invention, the invention relates to a method for reducing shutter latency while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption in a digital camera, the method including the steps of (a) providing an imager operating in accumulation mode; and (b) continuous flushing of charges from the imager before capturing an exposure of an image with a time between vertical transfers greater than or equal to time between vertical transfers during normal image readout so that, if continuous flushing for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels has occurred, the exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency.",
        "These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and appended claims, and by reference to the accompanying drawings.",
        "The present invention has the advantage of minimizing power consumption by having a continuous slow flush implemented via modified vertical clocking while reducing the picture-taking latency.",
        "FIG. 1 is a drawing of a prior art image sensor and its typical associated timing diagram;",
        "FIG. 2 is an illustration of the non-uniform dark current of a prior art image sensor;",
        "FIG. 3a is a drawing of an image sensor of the present invention and its associated timing diagram;",
        "FIG. 3b is alternative timing diagram for the sensor of FIG. 3a; and",
        "FIG. 4 is an illustration of the uniform dark current of the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 5 is a perspective of a digital camera in which the sensor of FIG. 3a may be inserted for implementing the present invention.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3a, there is shown a two-phase CCD 20 having a plurality of pixels 25 of the present invention with its associated clocking scheme. The pixels 25 are arranged in an array of rows and columns, 4096\u00d74096 in the preferred embodiment for illustrating an exemplary embodiment, although other configurations are obviously also suitable. It is instructive to note that, although a two-phase device is shown, there may be more than two phases as long as the device can be operated in accumulation mode clocking. Accumulation mode is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,458, by Burkey et al., titled \u201cReducing Dark Current In Charge Coupled Devices,\u201d and in \u201cSolid State Imaging with Charge-Coupled Devices,\u201d by Albert J. P. Theuwissen and will not be discussed in detail herein.",
        "In regard to the operation of the present invention during flushing, the vertical clocking includes clocking V1 high for a predetermined time, preferably the minimum time necessary for good vertical transfer efficiency, and V2 is clocked high on the falling edge of V1 for a predetermined time, also preferably the minimum time necessary for good vertical transfer efficiency. The time the clocks V1 and V2 are low ranges from equal to or twice the normal operating readout duration for reducing power consumption while retaining minimum dark current. For example, in an Eastman Kodak Company KAF-16801CE sensor, the clocks are preferably clocked high for 10 microseconds. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that different lengths of time that the clock voltages are high will vary according to the specific image sensor. The time the clocks are high is substantially proportional to a square of a width of the CCD.",
        "The horizontal shift register 30 receives the charges passed as a result of the above clocking and subsequently passes them therefrom for further processing. It is instructive to note that the horizontal clock voltages H1 and H2 are continuously low during flush for further conserving energy. In this case, the horizontal shift register 30 functions as a drain to continuously drain charge therefrom (as indicated by the arrow) as they are continuously dumped into the shift register 30. The horizontal flushing clock voltages H1 and H2 are permitted to go active and start flushing the horizontal register immediately before and during the capture of the image.",
        "For thoroughness of understanding and as understood by those skilled in the art, the CCD 20 may then capture an image during its integration or exposure time which is subsequently readout during image readout. The clocking for these cycles are not shown in their entirety, as they are well known in the art.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3b, there is shown an alternative embodiment in which fast flushing 40 (the time between which vertical transfers is minimum) occurs preceding the continuous flush. In this case, the time between vertical transfers is substantially less than the time between vertical transfer during normal image readout.",
        "It facilitates understanding to note that the above-described CCD 20 creates an exposure that may be captured with substantially zero latency. In summary, the invention includes a method for reducing shutter latency while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption in a digital camera. The method includes providing an imager operating in accumulation mode; and continuous flushing of charges from the imager before capturing an exposure of an image with a time between vertical transfers greater than or equal to time between vertical transfers during normal image readout so that, if continuous flushing for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels has occurred, the exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency after the shutter button has been pressed because the sensor has been completely flushed.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a schematic of the CCD 20 of the present invention illustrating its substantially uniform dark current as illustrated by its uniform density. This is advantageous because this requires little correction of a captured image, and it also has lower noise in the image.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a digital camera 50 for implementing the present invention into a commercially usable embodiment. The CCD 20 described hereinabove is placed in the digital camera 50 and functions as the image capture device.",
        "The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. However, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications can be effected by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention.",
