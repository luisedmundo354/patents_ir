        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a process for producing nano-particles, capable of efficiently producing monodisperse nano-particles substantially uniform in particle size and composition and freely controlling the particle size and composition, and also to nano-particles.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Nano-particles, which may be of inorganic or organic compound or the like, mean particles of 500 nm or less in size, and are expected to go into various areas, e.g., cosmetics, perfumes/deodorizers, seasonings, ink jet materials, recording materials and catalysts. For example, they are expected to be applicable to highly active catalysts which can achieve a specific object in a small quantity, with their large specific area. They are also expected to exhibit functions different from those provided by the bulk materials, e.g., quantum effect, by utilizing their long light wavelengths, or their size smaller than mean free paths of electric conductors or than magnet domains.",
        "For nano-particles to exhibit their functions, it is essential to control their size and composition. In particular, it is essential to sharply control their size and composition for them to exhibit the quantum effect. Moreover, processes for stably producing nano-particles are needed for their commercialization. However, there are many problems to be solved before they are commercialized, e.g., those involved in stabilization, dispersion, film-making, bulk material production and handling. Still more, processes for stably producing nano-particles with well-controlled morphology and interfaces are needed.",
        "Processes for producing the nano-particles include evaporation/flocculation, vapor-phase processes, including vapor-phase reaction processes, chemical precipitation and liquid-phase processes, including solvent evaporation. Refer to Masaaki Koyama, New Ceramics, vol. 8, p. 79, 1990, Nobuyuki Kikugawa, Ceramics, vol. 34, p. 110, 1999, Hisao Suzuki, Ceramics, vol. 34, p. 76, 1999, and Advanced Technology for Nano-materials, edited by Mitsue Koizumi et al, CMC, for details.",
        "However, none of the above nano-particle production processes can sufficiently control sharp particle size and composition. Moreover, it is difficult for these processes to freely control particle composition. For example, even for the nano-particles expected to exhibit a catalytic function, which depends only on the surface composition, the whole particle and surface are required to have the same composition.",
        "On the other hand, a tree-shape, branched polymer has a completely uniform metal coordination number between the molecules. Therefore, it is expected that a sharp particle size and composition can be controlled, if a metal coordinated in each tree-shaped, branched polymer molecule is solidified to prepare a nano-particle. Nano-size metallic clusters which include a tree-shape, branched polymer having metal coordination capacity inside are disclosed by, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (JP-A) No. 2001-508484, D. A. Tomalia et al, J. Am. Chem., Soc., vol. 120, p. 7355, 1998, and R. M. Crooks et al, ACC. Chem. Res., vol. 34, p. 181, 2001.",
        "However, the process for preparing particles which include a tree-shape, branched polymer involves a practically serious problem, because the particle cannot be prepared in a controlled manner, when number of the metallic atoms it contains exceeds metal coordination number. In other words, it is difficult to obtain the particle having a size of 5.0 nm or more and containing 5000 or more metal atoms, knowing that a tree-shape, branched polymer has a metal coordination number of substantially below 5000.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to increase generation number of a tree-shape, branched polymer, in order to increase metal coordination number of the polymer and thereby increase size of the particle. Increasing its generation number, however, needs more reaction steps, which should greatly complicate the synthesis process. Moreover, increasing its generation number increases density of the atoms on the polymer surface, and is limited from the molecular structure. Still more, it is difficult to improve stability and functionality of the particle by forming therein a core-shell structure exhibiting a function of securing a composition on the particle surface different from that inside.",
        "Objects and Advantages",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing nano-particles, capable of efficiently producing monodisperse nano-particles substantially uniform in particle size and composition. It is another object of the present invention to provide nano-particles produced by the same process.",
        "The process of the present invention for producing nano-particles comprises 2 steps, one incorporating a liquid containing a particle precursor in another liquid containing dendritic branching molecules to capture the precursor by the dendritic branching molecule (particle precursor capturing step), and the other transforming the precursor captured by the dendritic branching molecule into the particle (particle forming step).",
        "In the particle precursor capturing step, a liquid containing the particle precursor is incorporated in another liquid containing the dendritic branching molecules to capture the precursor by the dendritic branching molecule. In the particle forming step, the precursor captured by the dendritic branching molecule is transformed into the particle. The dendritic branching molecule has substantially uniform focal sites (sometimes referred to as focal points). Therefore, the process of the present invention can produce the substantially monodisperse particles, because the individual metallic ion captured by the substantially uniform focal site is selectively allowed to participate in the reaction. The individual metal ion in the metal ion solution is reacted with at least one of a reducing reagent and specific reagent, after being captured by the dendritic branching molecule, to form the nano-particle.",
        "As a result, the process of the present invention for producing nano-particles can efficiently produce monodisperse nano-particles whose size and composition can be freely controlled.",
        "The nano-particles of the present invention are monodisperse ones whose size and composition can be freely controlled, because they are produced by the process of the present invention for producing nano-particles. As such, they are applicable to all areas which use nano-particles of metal, semiconducting crystal, metallic chalcogenide or metal halide.",

These molecules include not only a dendrimer consecutively branching regularly from a core as a branching center, but also a fan-shape, dendritic branching molecule (e.g., dendron) consecutively branching regularly from the core except for a substitute left in the molecule, which has no branch at the focal site, and hyper-branch polymer of lower regularity.",
        "The dendritic branching molecule may be contained in part of another material. More specifically, it may be bound to another polymer or material at its functional group on the surface, or an organic compound containing a dendritic branching molecule. For example, a molecule whose dendrimer is bound to a main polymer chain at the surface, and molecule whose fan-shape, dendritic branching molecule is bound to a main polymer chain at the branching center are also within the category of the dendritic branching molecule of the present invention.",
        "The dendritic branching molecule is not limited, so long as it has a dendritic (tree-shape), branched structure, and may be selected for a specific purpose. For example, these molecules include a dendritic (tree-shape), branched one, and fan-shape, tree-shape, branched one.",
        "Preferable examples of the tree-shape, branched polymers include a hyper-branch polymer, and endrimer consecutively branching regularly from a core as a branching center.",
        "Preferable examples of the fan-shape, tree-shape, branched polymers include a dendron.",

These dendrons are of the molecules (9) to (11). In this case, the particle precursor is captured by mercapto group at 2 or more focal sites. The resulting composite nano-particle is of reversed micelle structure and has improved dispersibility in a resin or the like.
