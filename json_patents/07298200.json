        "This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2003-68801, filed on Oct. 2, 2003, the contents of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to internal voltage generators for semiconductor devices.",
        "As semiconductor memory devices become more highly integrated, the size of the chips are reduced. The reduction in chip size generally acts to lower the operating voltages. With the increasing use of semiconductor memory devices in portable systems, such as, for example, notebook computers and mobile communication equipment, extensive efforts have been made to lower the operating voltage of semiconductor chips.",
        "With the tendency to smaller chip size, an internal voltage, instead of an external voltage, has generally been used as the operating voltage of the chip. An internal voltage generator for generating an internal voltage is mounted on the chip and supplies the operating voltage to an internal circuit.",
        "Such an internal voltage generator is designed to supply a constant internal voltage. The internal voltage generator generally includes a comparator and a feedback transistor. The comparator is configured to compare a reference voltage with the internal voltage. If the internal voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the comparator outputs, for example, a high (H) signal to turn off the feedback transistor. If the internal voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the comparator outputs, for example, a low (L) signal to turn on the feedback transistor. If the feedback transistor is turned on, an external voltage is supplied that increases the internal voltage.",
        "However, if current consumption of the internal circuit momentarily increases, a phenomenon may occur in which the internal voltage is temporarily lowered due to delays in response time of the comparator and the feedback transistor. If the internal voltage is lowered, the operating speed of the internal circuit may be reduced.",
        "For example, with a memory device, if the internal voltage is lowered due to high current consumption when the bit line is sensed, the sensing speed, and hence the speed of the operation, is reduced. In order to prevent this phenomenon, an external voltage may be supplied as an internal voltage by generating an overdriving pulse to momentarily increase the internal voltage. The overdriving pulse allows current to flow across the feedback transistor during a predetermined pulse period.",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an internal voltage generator, which is disclosed in Korean Patent Application No. 10-2001-0038817, and FIG. 2 is a graph showing how the internal voltage of FIG. 1 varies with application of an external voltage.",
        "In the internal voltage generator of FIG. 1, when the operating signal PS is activated to a high (H) level, a pulse generating circuit 20 generates a pulse P1. An NMOS transistor MN1 is turned on in response to the pulse P1. When this occurs, the voltage of node N1 becomes the ground voltage VSS (i.e., is set to a low (L) level). When the node N1 is set to a low (L) level, PMOS transistor MP1 is turned on, so that an external voltage VDD is supplied as an internal voltage to the internal circuit 30.",
        "As the width of the pulse P1 is fixed, the external voltage continues to be supplied as the internal voltage while the pulse P1 is at a high level. As a result, the externally supplied current may exceed the current that is consumed by the internal circuit 30.",
        "In addition, as shown in FIG. 2, a problem may occur in that the supplied current may exceed the consumed current, thus increasing the internal voltage. Further, there occurs a problem in that the internal voltage increases in a direction from V1 to V3 due to an accumulation of the supplied current in accordance with frequency of the operation signal PS below the increased external voltage.",
        "Pursuant to certain embodiments of the present invention, circuits for selectively supplying an external voltage to an internal circuit are provided that include (1) a pulse generation circuit that is configured to generate a pulse having a pulse length that is a function of an internal voltage and (2) a first driver circuit that couples the external voltage to the internal circuit in response to the pulse. In these circuits, the pulse generation circuit may generate the pulse in response to an input pulse, and the pulse generation circuit may terminate the pulse in response to the internal voltage falling below a first reference voltage. The first driver circuit may comprise, for example, a transistor that selectively couples the external voltage to the internal circuit.",
        "The above-described circuits may also include a second driver circuit that couples the pulse to the first driver circuit. The second driver circuit may be implemented, for example, as a transistor that selectively couples a second reference voltage to the first driver circuit in response to the pulse. The circuit may further include a comparator, and the first driver circuit may selectively couple the external voltage to the internal circuit responsive to the output of the comparator.

Pursuant to these methods, a control signal is activated in response to an operation of the internal circuit. The internal voltage generation circuit is overdriven in response to the control signal. The control signal is deactivated in response to the operating voltage reaching a predetermined level. The overdrive of the internal circuit may be terminated in response to deactivation of the control signal.",
        "In the above referenced embodiments of the present invention, the predetermined level that the operating voltage reaches may be the level of a first reference voltage. The overdriving of the internal voltage generation circuit comprises may be accomplished, for example, by coupling an external voltage to the internal circuit. This coupling may be accomplished by coupling a second reference voltage to a first driver circuit via a second driver circuit in response to the control signal, and then coupling the external voltage to the internal circuit via the first driver circuit in response to the second reference voltage. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the first driver circuit may be a PMOS transistor and the second driver circuit may be an NMOS transistor.

In these voltage generation circuits, the pulse generating circuit may generate a pulse having a pulse length that is a function of the operating voltage. For example, the pulse generating circuit may activate the pulse in response to an input signal and/or deactivate the pulse in response to the operating voltage falling below a reference voltage.",

        "The operation of the internal voltage generator 10 will now be described with reference to FIG. 3.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3, the external voltage VDD is supplied as the internal voltage VINT through the first driver. If the internal voltage VINT supplied to the internal circuit 300 drops so that it is lower than the reference voltage VREF, the comparator 100 compares the reference voltage VREF with the fed-back internal voltage to generate a low (L) signal. The low signal is input to the first driver, and the PMOS transistor MP1 is turned on to supply the external voltage.",
        "During normal operations, current consumption in the internal circuit 300 may be momentarily excessive. When this happens, a phenomenon may occur in which the internal voltage is temporarily lowered due to the response time and feedback time of the comparator 100. In addition, if the external voltage is supplied excessively, the internal voltage may be increased too much.",
        "This phenomenon may be avoided and an internal voltage having a relatively constant level may be provided by the variable pulse generating circuit 200 receiving the pulse P1 when the internal circuit 300 operates, and generating the variable pulse P2. The variable pulse P2 is set to a high level (1) when the pulse P1 set to a high level or (2) at a time period that is delayed from the time when the pulse P1 is set to a high level by a predetermined time. The variable pulse P2 is set to a low level when the internal voltage becomes lower than the reference voltage.",
        "While the variable pulse P2 is in a high (H) state, the second driver drops the input voltage of the first driver to the ground voltage VSS. When this occurs, the external voltage VDD is supplied as the internal voltage. If the internal voltage VINT becomes lower than the reference voltage VREF, the variable pulse P2 is set to a low level and the second driver is turned off. In this manner, a stable internal voltage having a relatively constant level is supplied to the internal circuit 300.",
