    "abstract": "In methods of forming an oxide layer and an oxynitride layer, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first pressure and a first temperature. The oxide layer is formed on the substrate using a reaction gas while increasing a temperature of the reaction chamber from the first temperature to a second temperature under a second pressure. Additionally, the oxide layer is nitrified in the reaction chamber to form the oxynitride layer on the substrate. When the oxide layer and/or the oxynitride layer are formed on the substrate, minute patterns of a semiconductor device, for example a DRAM device, an SRAM device or an LOGIC device may be easily formed on the oxide layer or the oxynitride layer.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method of forming an oxide layer and a method of forming an oxynitride layer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of forming a very thin oxide layer having excellent uniformity and characteristics on a substrate using a batch type apparatus, and a method of forming a very thin oxynitride layer by nitrifying the oxide layer on the substrate.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "As information processing systems such as computers have been widely utilized, semiconductor devices also have been rapidly developed. Thus, semiconductor manufacturing technologies have improved to produce semiconductor devices having large storage capacity, high response speed, high integration degree, good reliability, etc.",
        "As the design rule of the semiconductor device decreases, the sizes of patterns of the semiconductor device also greatly decrease. For example, in a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor, a gate insulation layer between a gate electrode and a substrate has exceedingly reduced thickness and width. Various semiconductor devices such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices, static random access memory (SRAM) devices, or flash memory devices demand an oxide layer having a thickness of several tens of angstroms (\u212b) as a gate insulation layer. In particular, a logic device for driving a memory circuit requires an extremely thin oxide layer of about 10 \u212b as the gate insulation layer. Therefore, it is required to form a very thin oxide layer on a substrate as the gate insulation layer.",
        "When the gate insulation layer of the semiconductor device is very thin, impurities doped in the gate electrode may diffuse into the substrate through the thin gate insulation layer. Hence, before forming the gate electrode on the gate insulation layer, an oxynitride layer may be formed on the gate insulation layer to prevent the impurities in the gate electrode from diffusing into the substrate.",
        "In a conventional semiconductor manufacturing method, the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer is formed using a single type apparatus such as a rapid thermal processing (RTP) apparatus since the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer may not have a precisely controlled thickness and may have poor uniformity and quality when a batch type apparatus is used. Additionally, a native oxide layer may be formed on the very thin oxide layer when the oxide layer is formed using the batch type apparatus. On the other hand, the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer formed in the single type apparatus may have poor electrical characteristics because thermal damage may occur to the very thin oxide or oxynitride layer.",
        "The present invention provides a method of forming a very thin oxide layer having greatly improved uniformity and electrical characteristics by oxidizing a substrate in a reaction chamber at a low pressure.",
        "The present invention also provides a method of forming an oxynitride layer for effectively preventing impurities from diffusing into the substrate using a batch type apparatus.",

Thus, the throughput of the process for forming the oxynitride layer can be increased and the oxynitride layer having a precise thickness can be obtained. In addition, when the oxide layer and/or the oxynitride layer are formed on the substrate, minute patterns of a semiconductor device, for example a DRAM device, an SRAM device or an LOGIC device can be easily formed on the oxide layer or the oxynitride layer. Further, the oxynitride layer prevents the diffusion of the impurities doped in the conductive layer of the semiconductor device, thereby improving the reliability of the semiconductor device.",

However, since the nitration process is performed in a single type apparatus such as a rapid thermal nitration (RTN) apparatus, the throughput of the nitration process may be reduced and the characteristics of the silicon oxynitride layer may be deteriorated due to a thermal damage thereto.",
        "U.S. Patent Application Publication number 2001-6842 discloses a method of forming a tantalum oxynitride (TaON) layer as a gate insulation layer instead of the silicon oxynitride layer. This tantalum oxynitride layer has several advantages such as improved stability, relatively high breakdown voltage, low leakage current, etc. Particularly, after a silicon nitride layer or a silicon oxynitride layer is formed on a substrate including a field oxide layer at a temperature of about 200 to about 0.600\u00b0 C. under a pressure of about 0.2 to about 10 Torr, a tantalum oxynitride layer is formed on the silicon nitride or a silicon oxynitride layer so as to form the gate insulation layer on the substrate. Here, the silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride layer is formed using an NH3 gas, an O2 gas or NO2 gas. In addition, U.S. Pat.

This oxynitride layer is formed at a temperature of about 800\u00b0 C. and at a pressure of about 0.5 to about 500 Torr. However, the above-mentioned methods have poor throughput because the oxynitride layers are formed using a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) apparatus.

        "Referring to FIG. 1A, in step S110, a substrate is loaded into a reaction chamber having a first temperature and a first pressure. The substrate is primarily oxidized while the first temperature of the reaction chamber is increased to a second temperature in step S120. Thus, a uniform primary oxide layer having a thickness of about 10 \u212b is formed on the substrate.",
        "In step S130, the primary oxidized substrate may be secondarily oxidized when the reaction chamber is at the second temperature and a second pressure larger than the first pressure.

The substrate 10 is placed on the boat 37 using a transferring member 20 such as a handler. The boat 37 may simultaneously load more than about 100 substrates 10 to improve the throughput of the process for forming the oxide layer.",
        "In step I-1 (step S110), the pressure of the reaction chamber 100 and the load-lock chamber 30 is reduced to about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr using a pressure control member 150 such as a vacuum pump. After a shutter 50 is opened, the boat 37 including the substrate 10 is loaded into the reaction chamber 100 in accordance with the movement of the boat loader 35.",
        "Although the load-lock chamber 30 is separated from the reaction chamber 100, the load-lock chamber 30 has a constant pressure of about 0.03 to 3.0 Torr while the shutter 50 is opened and the substrate 10 is transferred into the reaction chamber 100 because the pressure control member 150 maintains the pressure of the load-lock chamber 30 and the reaction chamber 100.",
        "Before oxidizing the substrate 10, the reaction chamber 100 is at the first pressure P1 about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr and the first temperature T1 of about 300 to about 500\u00b0 C. When the reaction chamber 100 has the first pressure P1 of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr before oxidizing the substrate 10, a native oxide layer may not be formed on the substrate 10. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of the reaction chamber 100 to below about 0.03 Torr. In addition, before forming an oxide layer having a thickness of about 10 \u212b on the substrate 10, the reaction chamber 100 having the first pressure P1 of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr is effective. On the other hand, when the reaction chamber 100 has a pressure of above about 3.0 Torr before oxidizing the substrate 10, a native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10. If the native oxide layer is previously formed on the substrate 10, a desired oxide layer having the thickness of about 10 \u212b may not be formed on the substrate 10. For example, since a native oxide layer of about 20 \u212b may be formed on the substrate 10 under atmospheric pressure, a very thin oxide layer of about 10 \u212b may not be formed on the substrate 10 when the native oxide layer is formed on the substrate 10.",

        "When the first temperature T1 of the reaction chamber 100 is below about 300\u00b0 C., the oxide layer formed on the substrate 10 may be disadvantageously thick because the time for increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 from the first temperature T1 to a second temperature T2 is exceedingly increased. On the other hand, when the first temperature T1 of the reaction chamber 100 is above about 550\u00b0 C., the native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10 before forming the desired oxide layer on the substrate 10. In this embodiment, the second temperature T2 of the reaction chamber 100 is advantageously selected so as to form a desired thin oxide layer on the substrate 10.",
        "In step I-2 (step S120), a reaction gas is provided onto the substrate 10 while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased. As a result, the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized to form a thin oxide layer having a thickness of below about 10 \u212b on the substrate 10. Particularly, after the pressure of the reaction chamber 100 is increased to about 0.3 to about 20 Torr, the reaction gas is introduced into the reaction chamber 100 to primarily oxidize the substrate 10 while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased. Alternatively, after the reaction gas may be provided onto the substrate 10 just before the pressure of the reaction chamber 100 is increased to about 0.3 to about 20 Torr, the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized to form the thin oxide layer on the substrate 10.",
        "The temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased using an energy supply member 120 such as a heater. Here, the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2. The difference between the first temperature T1 and the second temperature T2 may be advantageously adjusted so as to control the thickness of the thin oxide layer formed on the substrate 10. In one embodiment, the second temperature T2 of the reaction chamber 100 is in a range of about 550 to about 950\u00b0 C.",
        "When the second temperature T2 of the reaction chamber 100 is below about 550\u00b0 C., the difference between the first temperature T1 and the second temperature T2 is relatively small so that the oxide layer may have an insufficient thickness. Additionally, the reaction gas may be excessively provided onto the substrate 10 to form the oxide layer having a desired thickness. On the other hand, when the second temperature T2 of the reaction chamber 100 is above about 950\u00b0 C., the difference between the first temperature T1 and the second temperature T2 is too large so that the oxide layer may be disadvantageously thick. In addition, the characteristics of the oxide layer may be deteriorated because of a thermal effect due to a high temperature.",
        "However, in the case in which an oxide layer having a relatively thick thickness of above about 10 \u212b is required, the second temperature T2 of the reaction chamber 100 may exceed about 950\u00b0 C.",
        "The temperature of the reaction chamber 100 can be increased at a rate of about 2 to about 15\u00b0 C./minute. When the rate of increase in the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is below about 2\u00b0 C./minute, the time for increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 may be greatly extended to thereby reduce the throughput of the process for forming the oxide layer. On the other hand, when the rate of increase in the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is above about 15\u00b0 C./minute, the uniformity of the oxide layer may be deteriorated because of the rapid increase in the temperature although the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 may be rapidly increased to the second temperature T2. In addition, the thickness of the oxide layer may not be precisely controlled due to the rapid increase in the temperature.",
        "In one embodiment, the second pressure P2 of the reaction chamber 100 is in a range of about 0.3 to about 20 Torr while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2. When the second pressure P2 of the reaction chamber 100 is below about 0.3 Torr, the oxide layer may not be sufficiently grown on the substrate 10. However, when the second pressure P2 of the reaction chamber 100 is above about 20 Torr, the oxide layer may have an undesired thick thickness while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2. In addition, the uniformity of the oxide layer may be deteriorated relative to an entire surface of the substrate 10. As a result, the thickness difference among portions of the oxide layer positioned on the substrate 10 may be increased.",
        "While the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2, the reaction gas for oxidizing the substrate 10 is provided into the reaction chamber 100 through a gas supply line 140. The reaction gas may be varied in accordance with the kind of oxide layer formed on the substrate 10. For example, when an oxide layer has a high breakdown voltage, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas (O2) and a hydrogen gas (H2) is provided onto the substrate 10 to form the oxide layer of the high breakdown voltage by a wet oxidation process. Here, the volume ratio between the oxygen gas and the hydrogen gas is about 2:3. For example, the reaction gas includes oxygen gas of about 0.62 liter and hydrogen gas of about 0.9 liter when the first temperature T1 is about 550\u00b0 C., the second temperature T2 is about 950\u00b0 C., and the rate of increase in the temperature is about 7\u00b0 C./minute.",
        "When an amount of the reaction gas is increased, the oxide layer may be more rapidly grown on the substrate 10. Thus, the amount of the reaction gas is advantageously adjusted considering the first temperature T1, the second temperature T2, the rate of increase in the temperature, the desired thickness of the oxide layer, etc.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas is provided onto the substrate 10 by a dry oxidation process to form a buffer oxide layer on the substrate 10. In another embodiment of the present invention, a reaction gas including an oxygen gas and a hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas is provided onto the substrate 10 by a clean oxidation process to form another oxide layer on the substrate 10. Although the oxide layer may not have excellent characteristics using the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process, the oxide layer may be rapidly grown on the substrate 10 so that the oxide layer has the desired thickness for a very short time. Additionally, in the clean oxidation process, impurities may be completely removed from the oxide layer and the substrate 10 during the formation of the oxide layer.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, an oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10 using a combination process of a wet oxidation process, a dry oxidation process and a clean oxidation process. For example, the wet oxidation process is carried out at a temperature of about 800 to about 900\u00b0 C. whereas the dry and clean oxidation processes are performed at a temperature of about 850 to about 1,000\u00b0 C. Hence, after the oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10 at relatively low temperature using the wet oxidation process, the oxide layer is completely formed on the substrate 10 at a relatively high temperature using the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 1A and 1B, after the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized in step I-2 (step S120), the primarily oxidized substrate 10 may be additionally cooled in the reaction chamber 100 while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is decreased from the second temperature T2 to a third temperature T3 under a third pressure P3 in step I-4 (step S140). Here, the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is reduced using a cooling member 160. Additionally, the cooled substrate 10 may be unloaded from the reaction chamber 100 under the third pressure P3 in step I-5 (step S150). In steps I-4 and I-5, the third pressure P3 is higher than the second pressure P2. For example, the third pressure P3 can correspond to atmospheric pressure. Here, the third temperature T3 is substantially identical to the first temperature T1. Alternatively, the third temperature T3 may be higher than the first temperature T1 because the substrate 10 may be unloaded from the reaction chamber 100 although the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is relatively high.",
        "In step I-4, the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is reduced at a rate of about 2 to about 15\u00b0 C./minute. When the rate of decrease in the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is below about 2\u00b0 C./minute, the time for cooling the substrate 10 may be exceedingly increased to thereby reduce the throughput of the process for forming the oxide layer. On the other hand, when the rate of decrease in the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is above about 15\u00b0 C./minute, the characteristics of the oxide layer may be greatly deteriorated.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, when the second temperature T2 is relatively low, the substrate 10 may be unloaded from the reaction chamber 100 after the reaction chamber 100 has the second temperature T2. Here, the second temperature T2 can be in a range of about 550 to about 750\u00b0 C.",
        "Alternatively, after the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized while the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is increased in step I-2 (step S120), the substrate 10 may be secondarily oxidized in the reaction chamber 100 having the second pressure P2 and the second temperature T2 in step I-3 (step S130). The thickness of the oxide layer formed on the primarily oxidized substrate 10 may be varied in accordance with the first temperature T1, the second temperature T2, the first pressure P1, the second pressure P2 the rate of increase in the temperature, the amount of the reaction gas, etc. When the oxide layer may not have the desired thickness through the primary oxidation process, the substrate 10 may be secondarily oxidized to thereby form the oxide layer having the desired thickness on the substrate 10 through the secondary oxidation process. For example, when the oxide layer is formed on the substrate 10 under processing conditions that include the first temperature T1 of about 550\u00b0 C., the second temperature T2 of about 650\u00b0 C., the rate of increase in the temperature of about 7\u00b0 C./minute, the first pressure P1 of about 0.3 Torr, the second pressure P2 of about 3.0 Torr, the reaction gas including the oxygen gas of about 0.62 liter and the hydrogen gas of about 0.9 liter, the oxide layer has an insufficient thickness of about 3 to about 4 \u212b in accordance with the primary oxidation process. Thus, the oxide layer having the insufficient thickness is grown on the substrate 10 by the secondary oxidation process, thereby forming the oxide layer having the desired thickness of about 10 \u212b on the substrate 10.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, after the substrate 10 is secondarily oxidized, the temperature of the reaction chamber 100 is reduced from the second temperature T2 to the third temperature T3 under the third pressure P3 to thereby cool the substrate 10 in step I-4. The cooled substrate 10 is unloaded from the reaction chamber 100 in step I-5. When the second temperature T2 is relatively low, the substrate 10 may be unloaded from the reaction chamber 100 while the reaction chamber 100 has the second temperature T2 without cooling the substrate 10 (that is, step I-4).",
        "In addition, the primarily oxidized substrate 10 or the secondarily oxidized substrate 10 may be nitrified in the reaction chamber 100 having the second temperature T2 and the second pressure so that an oxynitride layer is formed on the primarily oxidized substrate 10 or the secondarily oxidized substrate 10.

        "Referring to FIGS. 5B and 5C, the reaction chamber 101 includes a remote plasma generating device 170 for activating a source gas including nitrogen.",
        "Before primarily oxidizing the substrate 10, the reaction chamber 101 is at the first pressure of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr and the first temperature T1 of about 300 to about 550\u00b0 C. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of the reaction chamber 101 to below about 0.03 Torr. Additionally, the reaction chamber 101 having the first pressure of about 0.03 to about 3.0 Torr so as to oxidize the substrate 10 is economical. On the other hand, when the reaction chamber 101 has a pressure of above about 3.0 Torr before primarily oxidizing the substrate 10, a native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10. In the case in which the native oxide layer is previously formed on the substrate 10, a desired oxynitride layer having the thickness of about 10 \u212b may not be formed on the substrate 10.",
        "When the first temperature T1 of the reaction chamber 101 is below about 300\u00b0 C., the oxide layer formed on the substrate 10 may be disadvantageously thick because the time for increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the first temperature T1 to the third temperature T3 is exceedingly increased. On the contrary, when the first temperature T1 of the reaction chamber 101 is above about 550\u00b0 C., the native oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10 before forming the oxide layer on the substrate 10.",
        "In step V-2 (step S520), the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized in the reaction chamber 101 using a reaction gas while the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2 under the second pressure. Thus, a primary oxide film is formed on the substrate 10. In step V-3 (step S530), the primarily oxidized substrate 10 is secondarily oxidized in the reaction chamber while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the second temperature T2 to the third temperature T3 under the second pressure. As a result, a secondary oxide layer having a desired thickness of about 10 \u212b is formed on the substrate 10. However, when the primary oxide layer has the desired thickness about 10 \u212b, the substrate 10 may not be secondarily oxidized to form the secondary oxide layer. That is, an oxide layer having the desired thickness of about 10 \u212b may be directly formed on the substrate 10 while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the first temperature T1 to the third temperature T3 under the second pressure. Here, the third temperature T3 can be in a range of about 550 to about 950\u00b0 C. The thickness of the oxide layer formed on the substrate 10 may be adjusted by controlling the difference between the first temperature T1 and the third temperature T3. When the third temperature T3 is below about 550\u00b0 C., the amount of the reaction gas may be greatly increased so as to form the oxide layer having the desired thickness. On the other hand, when the third temperature T3 is above about 950\u00b0 C., the oxide layer may be too thick and may be thermally damaged due to a high temperature.",
        "The rate in increase of the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 can be in a range of about 2 to about 15\u00b0 C./minute. When the rate in increase of the temperature of the reaction chamber is below about 2\u00b0 C./minute, the time for increasing the reaction chamber 101 may be too long so that the throughput of the process for forming the oxynitride layer may be reduced. When the rate in increase of the temperature of the reaction chamber is above about 15\u00b0 C./minute, the uniformity of the oxide layer may be deteriorated because of a rapid temperature increase.",
        "While the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 is increased from the first temperature T1 to the third temperature T3, the pressure of the reaction chamber 101 is maintained in the range of about 0.3 to about 20 Torr. When the reaction chamber 101 has a pressure of below about 0.3 Torr, the oxide layer may not be adequately grown on the substrate 10. However, when the reaction chamber 101 has a pressure of above about 20 Torr, the oxide layer may be too thick and portions of the oxide layer may have different thickness to thereby reduce the uniformity of the oxide layer.",
        "In this embodiment, the reaction gas for forming the oxide layer is provided onto the substrate 10 while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the first temperature T1 to the third temperature T3. The ingredients of the reaction gas may vary in accordance with the characteristics of the oxide layer formed on the substrate 10. For example, when an oxide layer has a high breakdown voltage, the reaction gas including an oxygen gas and a hydrogen gas is provided onto the substrate 10 to form the oxide layer of the high breakdown voltage by a wet oxidation process. Here, the volume ratio between the oxygen gas and the hydrogen gas is about 2:3. When the amount of the reaction gas is increased, the oxide layer may be more rapidly grown on the substrate 10. The amount of the reaction gas is determined in accordance with the first temperature T1, the third temperature T2, the rate in increase of the temperature, the desired of thickness of the oxide layer, etc. Additionally, an oxide layer may be formed on the substrate 10 using a reaction gas including an oxygen gas by a dry oxidation process, or using a reaction gas including an oxygen gas and a hydrogen chloride gas by a clean oxidation process. When the oxide layer is formed by the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process, the oxide layer is rapidly formed on the substrate 10 although the quality of the oxide layer may be relatively reduced.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, the oxide layer is formed on the substrate 10 by a combination process of the wet oxidation process, the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process. For example, the substrate 10 is primarily oxidized in the reaction chamber 101 by the wet oxidation process while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the first temperature T1 to the second temperature T2 under the second pressure in step V-2. Then, the primarily oxidized substrate 10 is secondarily oxidized by the dry oxidation process or the clean oxidation process while increasing the temperature of the reaction chamber 101 from the second temperature T2 to the third temperature T3 under the second pressure in step V-3. Here, the second temperature T2 may be properly selected in a range between the first temperature T1 and the third temperature T3 in accordance with the characteristics of the oxide layer. For example, when the oxide layer having a uniform quality on the substrate 10, the second temperature T2 may be relatively high so that the time of the wet oxidation process may be longer than that of the dry or the clean oxidation process.",
        "In step V-5 (step S550), the primarily or secondarily oxidized substrate 10 is nitrified in the reaction chamber 101 having the second pressure and the third temperature T3, thereby forming the oxynitride layer on the substrate 10.

        "The substrate 10 is nitrified in the reaction chamber 101 using a reaction gas including a nitrogen compound such as nitrogen (N2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), dinitrogen monoxide (N2O), etc. Here, the nitrogen compound is activated using the remote plasma generating device 170. When the nitrogen compound is activated using plasma in the reaction chamber 101, the substrate 10 including the oxide layer may be seriously damaged by the plasma. Thus, the remote plasma generating device 170 is separated from the reaction chamber 101 and the nitrogen compound is activated out of the reaction chamber 101, thereby preventing damage to the substrate 10.",
        "In one embodiment, the oxynitride layer may serve as a diffusion preventing layer that prevents a leakage current generated from a gate electrode of a MOS transistor. Particularly, a recent semiconductor device has an oxide layer of below about 10 \u212b as a gate insulation layer. For example, in a PMOS transistor having this gate insulation layer, P-type impurities such as boron (B) implanted into a gate electrode of the PMOS transistor may be diffused into a silicon substrate through the gate insulation layer although a voltage is not applied to the gate electrode. The diffused impurities may cause the leakage current from the gate electrode, thereby causing a failure of the PMOS transistor. However, when the oxynitride layer of the present invention is employed as the gate insulation layer of the PMOS transistor, the diffusion of the impurities may be prevented to reduce the failure of the transistor.",
        "In the present embodiment, the oxynitride layer is formed using one reaction chamber so that the throughput of the process for forming the oxynitride layer may be improved.
