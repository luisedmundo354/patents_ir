    "abstract": "In an embodiment of the invention an integrated circuit includes a memory array having a first plurality of decoded lines traversing across the memory array and a pair of dual-mode decoders, each decoder coupled to each of the plurality of decoded lines a respective location along said decoded lines, such as at opposite ends thereof. Both decoder circuits receive like address information. Normally both decoder circuits operate in a forward decode mode to decode the address information and drive a selected one of the decoded lines. During a test mode, one decoder is enabled in a reverse decode mode while the other decoder remains in a forward decode mode to verify proper decode operation and integrity of the decoded lines between the decoders.",

No. 11/026,470 filed on even date herewith, entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Hierarchical Decoding of Dense Memory Arrays Using Multiple Levels of Multiple-Headed Decoders\u201d by Luca G. Fasoli and Kenneth K. So, which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to decoder circuits for integrated circuit memory arrays.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Semiconductor integrated circuits have progressively reduced their feature linewidths into the deep sub-micron regime. Moreover, recent developments in certain memory cell technologies have resulted in word lines and bit line having an extremely small pitch. For example, certain passive element memory cell arrays may be fabricated having word lines approaching the minimum feature size (F) and minimum feature spacing for the particular word line interconnect layer, and also having bit lines approaching the minimum feature width and minimum feature spacing for the particular bit line interconnect layer. Moreover, three-dimensional memory arrays having more than one plane of memory cells have been fabricated implanting such so-called 4F2 memory cells on each memory plane. Exemplary three-dimensional memory arrays are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,882 to Johnson, entitled \u201cVertically Stacked Field Programmable Nonvolatile Memory and Method of Fabrication.\u201d",
        "Interfacing the word line decoders and bit line decoders to tightly spaced word lines and bit lines within very dense arrays has become extremely challenging, particularly if such array lines exist on more than one layer, as in a three-dimensional memory array having more than one plane of memory cells.",
        "A hierarchical decoder may be employed to help achieve tight pitch requirements for the array lines. For example, a hierarchical word line decoder may include a first-level decoder for selecting one of a plurality of global word lines, and a second-level decoder for selecting one of a plurality of local word lines associated with the selected global word line. Such a hierarchical decoder structure allows shorter local word lines in each sub-array (i.e., memory block).",
        "In some arrays, the global word lines traverse across all or a large portion of a memory array or sub-array. Such long lines running from one end of an integrated circuit (i.e., a \u201cchip\u201d) to the other end may be very resistive as well as capacitively heavily-loaded. As a result, the propagation delay for selecting and de-selecting a long, resistive, and heavily-loaded global array line may be significant.",
        "Rather than using a single decoder to generate the global word lines, two decoders may be employed to drive the global word lines, one decoder driving one end of each global word line, and the other decoder driving the other end of the global word lines. Since intrinsic wire delay is a quadratic relationship with wire length, this reduces the propagation delay to one fourth the previous amount. Normally both decoders are responsive to the same address signals, and would decode and drive the same individual global word line, but from opposite ends. Such operation may be viewed as a \u201cforward decode\u201d mode of operation.",
        "One implication of a hierarchical decoder structure concerns the number of local decoded array lines, such as local word lines, that may be affected by a defect in a global array line, such as a global word line. Such a defect could affect many local word lines in each on many array blocks. For example, an open in a global word line would traditionally affect all local word lines in every memory block located \u201cdownstream\u201d of the break in the global word line. But by driving each global word line from both ends, functionally, the global word line can still be selected fully across the entire physical line, and the selected local word line can still be driven to access the memory cells that are associated with the open global word line.",
        "Other potential defects in global word lines and local word lines, such as a shorted line, may require using a marching pattern to detect the failure, even with the use of dedicated test columns. Such a test sequence requires a long test time and is therefore expensive to implement.",
        "Test times may be substantially reduced by providing the global word line decoders with a reverse decode mode of operation in addition to the forward decode mode. In the forward decoding mode, the inputs of such a dual-mode decoder are row address lines (i.e., a partial row address) and the outputs are the global word lines. The decoder decodes the row address and asserts a single global word line. In the reverse decoding mode, the inputs are now the global word lines as well as the row address lines, and the output is a \u201chit\u201d signal. In the reverse decoding mode, the dual mode decoder compares the row address with the selected global word line (e.g., driven by another global word line decoder in the forward decoding mode). If it matches, the hit signal is asserted. Otherwise, it indicates a failure on that address.",
        "During an exemplary test mode, the first of the two global word line decoders is switched to the reverse decoding mode while the second of the two global word line decoders remains in the forward decoding mode. The second global word line decoder selects and drives one global word line. The first global word line decoder, which is now a reverse decoder, detects whether there is a \u201chit\u201d between the selected global word line and the input address, and drives the hit output signal accordingly. In some cases, the decoder may be configured to assert the hit signal whenever the selected global word line matches the address. In other cases, even when the selected global word line matches the address, the decoder may be configured to assert the hit signal only if the global word lines adjacent to the selected global word line are both deselected. For example, if there is a short between the selected global word line and one or both adjacent \u201cunselected\u201d global word lines, the dual-mode decoder may nonetheless detect a \u201cmiss\u201d rather than a \u201chit.\u201d The addresses provided to the global word line decoder may be sequenced through all possible values in a relatively short amount of time.",
        "Continuing with the exemplary test mode, the first global word line decoder may be switched to the forward decoding mode while the second global word line decoder is switched to the reverse decoding mode. The first global word line decoder now selects and drives one global word line, while the second global word line decoder detects whether there is a \u201chit\u201d between the selected global word line and the input address, and drives the hit output signal accordingly. The addresses provided to the global word line decoder may again be sequenced through all possible values in a relatively short amount of time. If the hit signal is asserted for all addresses, during both passes through the sequenced addresses, both global word line decoders may be then known to be fully functional. Moreover, if the two global word line decoders drive each global word line at the opposite ends of such global word lines, it is then known that none of the global word lines have an open somewhere along its length between the two decoders. In addition, if the dual mode decoders are configured to reject a \u201chit\u201d when an adjacent global word line is also selected (or even partially selected), then it may be also known that no such shorts exist between any of the global word lines.",
        "The above description of a hierarchical decoder structure using two dual-mode global word line decoders is presented as an illustrative introduction to the invention, but should not be viewed as limiting of the invention. Many other structures are contemplated, including non-hierarchical decoders, and decoders for other than global word lines, such as decoders for individual word lines or bit lines, decoders for global bit lines, and multiple decoders connected at locations other than at opposite ends of the decoded lines. In addition, the invention need not require dual-mode decoders. For example, a forward decoder at one end of a decoded line and a reverse decoder at the opposite end may be employed. Many other configurations, structures, and related methods of operation are contemplated.",
        "For example, in one aspect the invention provides an integrated circuit which includes a memory array having a first plurality of decoded lines traversing across the memory array in a first direction and a pair of decoder circuits, one decoder circuit coupled to each of the plurality of decoded lines at one respective location along said decoded lines, and the other decoder circuit coupled to each of the plurality of decoded lines at another respective location along said decoded lines, both decoder circuits coupled to receive like address information.",
        "In some embodiments, both decoder circuits may be enabled in a forward decode mode to decode the address information and drive a selected one of the decoded lines during a normal operating mode.",

During a first test mode, one decoder may be enabled in the reverse decode mode and the other decoder may be enabled in the forward decode mode. During a second test mode, the other decoder may be enabled in the reverse decode mode and the one decoder may be enabled in the forward decode mode.",
        "The pair of decoder circuits may be respectively coupled to each of the plurality of decoded lines generally at opposite ends of the decoded lines. The integrated circuit may include a three-dimensional memory array having more than one plane of memory cells formed above a substrate.",
        "The plurality of decoded lines may represent global word lines, and in some embodiments the global word lines may be coupled to multi-headed local word line drivers associated with memory blocks traversed by the global word lines.

        "The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary integrated circuit 200 includes two memory arrays, one organized as part of an upper stripe 202, and the other organized as part of the lower stripe 204. The upper stripe 202 includes a memory array 216, a first dual-mode global word line decoder 206 disposed at the left side of memory array 216, and a second dual-mode global word line decoder 208 disposed at the right side of memory array 216. Both dual-mode decoders 206 and 208 are responsive to row addresses conveyed on row address lines 230.",
        "The lower stripe 204 includes another memory array 217, a first dual-mode global word line decoder 210 disposed at the left side of memory array 217, and a second dual-mode global word line decoder 212 disposed at the right side of memory array 217. Both dual-mode decoders 210, 212 are also responsive to the row addresses 230.",
        "In the upper memory array 202, the global word lines traverse across the entire memory array 216. One such global word line 218 is shown, being driven by driver 222 within global word line decoder 206, and also driven by driver 224 within global word line decoder 208. The memory array 216 includes a plurality of memory blocks. One such memory block 214 is shown which includes interdigitated local word lines, one of which is labeled 228. In memory block 214, a four headed local word line driver is associated with global word line 218 and drives for local word lines exiting memory block 214 on the left side of the block. In addition, another four headed local word line driver is also associated with global word line 218 and drives four local word lines exiting memory block 214 on the right side of the block. In some preferred embodiments, the memory array includes a three-dimensional memory array of programmable anti-fuse passive element memory cells. Such a memory organization and structure is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2004-0190360 A1, entitled \u201cWord Line Arrangement Having Multilayer Word Line Segments for Three-Dimensional Memory Array\u201d, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "As depicted, the global word lines traverse across the entire memory. In the exemplary integrated circuit shown, such global word lines may run almost from one side of the integrated circuit to the other side. Moreover, in some exemplary embodiments incorporating a three-dimensional memory array, these global word lines may be routed in wiring layers below the memory array, and consequently may be implemented using materials, such as tungsten and polysilicon, which can withstand the high temperature processing of later fabrications steps necessary to fabricate the memory array layers above the global word lines. Since such materials are not as conductive as many common metals and metal alloys used in integrated circuit fabrication, such global word lines may be very resistive. In addition, each global word line is connected to a 4-headed local word line driver in every memory block. In the exemplary structure depicted, there are 64 memory blocks (such as memory block 214), and thus sixty-four 4-headed local word line drivers coupled to each physical global word line, so the total capacitive loading on each global word line is also very large. The time that it would take to charge and discharge these global word lines using only a single decoder would be relatively long (e.g., 2 \u03bcs), and would contribute to the overall reading or programming time.",
        "By using two logically-identical global word line decoders (i.e., decoding the same global word line for the same input row address), and driving each global word line at both ends, this delay may be reduced to approximately one-fourth as much (e.g., 500 ns). During normal operation such as read mode or write mode, both global word line decoders 206, 208 are enabled in a forward decoding mode to select and drive a single global word line. To read or write the selected byte in the memory array, only a single block gets enabled (e.g., block 214) and only a single local word line gets selected (e.g., one of the local word lines 228).",
        "The lower memory strip 204 is similarly configured. In the lower memory array 217, the global word lines traverse across the entire memory array 217. One such global word line 238 is shown, being driven by driver 232 within global word line decoder 210, and also driven by driver 234 within global word line decoder 212. During normal operation such as read mode or write mode, both global word line decoders 210, 212 are enabled in a forward decoding mode to select and drive a single global word line, such as global word line 238, from both ends.",
        "As can be appreciated in FIG. 1, a defect in a global word line may affect a great many local word lines. In the exemplary memory array depicted in FIG. 1, there are around 1024 physical global word lines in the entire memory array (i.e., both the upper stripe 202 and the lower stripe 204). These global word lines cover \u02dc12% of the total area of one particular interconnect layer on the entire integrated circuit (as well as some percentage of other interconnect layers). Any defects that land on this portion could potentially affect one or more global word lines. A single defective global word line could wipe out 256 pages of data!",
        "For example, an \u201copen\u201d (i.e., a broken line) in a global word line would traditionally affect all local word lines in every memory block located \u201cdownstream\u201d of the break in the global word line. But by driving each global word line from both ends, functionally the global word line can still be selected fully across the entire physical line, and the selected local word line can still be driven to access the memory cells that are associated with the broken physical global word line.",
        "Other potential defects in global word lines and local word lines, such as a shorted line, may require using a marching pattern to detect the failure, even with the use of dedicated test columns. For example, in certain embodiments each word line segment may include at least one test cell for use in confirming that the word line segment (and the memory cells coupled thereto) is functional. Exemplary use of such test cells is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,953 to Cleeves, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such a test sequence requires a long test time and is therefore expensive to implement.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, the exemplary integrated circuit 200 is depicted configured for use in a first test mode, in which one of the dual-mode decoders in switched into a reverse mode of operation. In the reverse decoding mode, the inputs are now the global word lines as well as the row address lines, and the output is a \u201chit\u201d signal. In the reverse decoding mode, the dual mode decoder compares the row address with the selected global word line (e.g., driven by another global word line decoder in the forward decoding mode). If it matches, the hit signal is asserted. Otherwise, it indicates a failure on that address.",
        "In the first test mode, global word line decoder 208 is switched to the reverse decoding mode while global word line decoder 206 remains in the forward decoding mode. Both decoders 206, 208 are provided the same row address 230, but whereas the global word line decoder 206 selects and drives one global word line (here again depicted as driver 222 driving selected global word line 218), in this mode the global word line decoder 208, which is now a reverse decoder, asserts a hit signal 252 if there is a \u201chit\u201d between the selected global word line 218 and the row address 230 (i.e., if the particular selected global word line corresponds to the particular row address). The driver 224 is depicted in a reverse orientation, responsive to the row address 230 and the selected global word line 218, for generating the hit signal 252. Exemplary embodiments of such dual mode drivers are described below. Such a hit signal 252 may be a shared hit signal for all reverse mode drivers in the global word line decoder 208, or may be shared by more or less portions of the decoders (e.g., hit signal line 254 in the lower stripe 204). In some preferred embodiments, the decoder 208 may be configured to assert the hit signal 252 only if the global word lines adjacent to the selected global word line are both deselected. In this manner, shorts may be detected between adjacent global word lines. The addresses provided to the global word line decoder may be sequenced through all possible values in a relatively short amount of time to test both the continuity of each global word line from the left side of the array to the right side of the array, as well as to determine whether adjacent line short are present. In this test the global word line decoder configured in the forward decoding mode (i.e., decoder 206) is checked, as well as the selected global word line and the unselected adjacent global word lines.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, the directionality of the two dual mode global word line decoders in each memory array are reversed. The global word line decoder 208 is switched to the forward decoding mode while the global word line decoder 206 is switched to the reverse decoding mode. Global word line decoder 208 now selects and drives one global word line, while global word line decoder 206 detects whether there is a \u201chit\u201d between the selected global word line and the input row address, driving a hit signal 256 accordingly. The addresses provided to the global word line decoders may again be sequenced through all possible values in a relatively short amount of time. If the hit signal is asserted for all addresses, during both passes through the sequenced addresses, both global word line decoders may be then known to be fully functional. Moreover, if the two global word line decoders drive each global word line at the opposite ends of such global word lines, it is then known that none of the global word lines have an open somewhere along its length between the two decoders. In addition, if the dual mode decoders are configured to reject a \u201chit\u201d when an adjacent global word line is also selected (or even partially selected), then it may be also known that no such shorts exist between any of the global word lines.",
        "Redundancy may be provided to cover defective global word lines or defects in one or both global word line decoders. For example, in an exemplary embodiment as depicted in FIG. 1, there may be provided 64 redundant local word lines, associated with 8 redundant global word lines. As an additional form of redundancy, one of the two global word line decoders (e.g., if defective) may be disabled during a normal operating mode, in which case the memory array would operate on just the other global word line decoder, albeit with some performance degradation.",
        "A multi-headed decoder circuit (e.g., the 4-headed local word line drivers on each side of each memory block 214) may be employed to help achieve tight pitch requirements for the array lines (e.g., local word lines). Generally, such a multi-headed decoder may include a group of array line driver circuits associated with a single decode node. Each array line driver circuit may be configured to couple its associated array line (e.g., a word line; a bit line) at times to a first associated bias node which may be generated to convey one of at least two possible bias levels (for example, a selected bias condition or an unselected bias condition) appropriate for the array line. The array line driver circuit may be configured to couple its associated array line at other times to a second associated bias node which is generated to convey at least one possible bias level (for example, an unselected bias condition) appropriate for the array line. As depicted in FIG. 1, a memory array may include many groups of array line drivers (i.e., \u201cdecoder heads\u201d) for each decode node. Each respective group of decoder heads may share bias nodes, which preferably traverse orthogonal to the decode nodes, with corresponding groups of decoder heads for other decode nodes. Additional details of useful multi-headed decoder configurations are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2003-0128581 A1, entitled \u201cMulti-Headed Decoder Structure Utilizing Memory Array Line Driver with Dual Purpose Driver Device\u201d by Scheuerlein, et al., which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "The global word line decoders 206, 208, 210, 212 may also be configured as multi-headed decoders. While certainly not essential to the present invention, this may be particularly helpful if the pitch of the global word lines is very small, such as might be the case for embodiments incorporating a three-dimensional memory array (i.e., having more than one memory plane). As described below, multi-headed decoder embodiments of the global word line decoders may provide an efficient structure for implementing both a forward and reverse decoding mode of operation. Viewed together with the multi-headed local word line decoders, such a structure may be thought of as a hierarchical decoder circuit using two levels of multi-headed decoders, additional details of which are described in \u201cApparatus and Method for Hierarchical Decoding of Dense Memory Arrays Using Multiple Levels of Multiple-Headed Decoders\u201d by Luca Fasoli, et al., which application is referenced above and already incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, and multi-headed global word line decoder 300 is depicted. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the global word line decoder 300 is associated with 512 global word lines (labeled GWL[0} through GWL[511]) and corresponds, for example, to the global word line decoder 206 at the left end of the upper memory stripe 202. The global word line decoder 300 includes M instances of a multi-headed global word line driver circuit GWL_Driver_\u00d7N, each for driving N global word lines. One of the global word line driver circuits is labeled 302. In the exemplary embodiment shown, assume that there are 512 global word lines, each global word line driver circuit drives 4 global word lines (i.e., N=4), and thus there are 128 global word line driver circuits (M=128). Additional redundant global word lines might add additional circuitry, and of course, such specific numbers are exemplary only and other configurations are contemplated.",
        "To describe the functionality of this global word line decoder, assume that GWL[7] is the selected global word line addressed by the row address information. This global word line GWL[7] is associated with the second global word line driver circuit GWL_Driver_\u00d7N, labeled 302, within which transistors 318, 320, and 322 form a three-transistor driver \u201chead\u201d associated with GWL[7].",
        "A portion of the row address is provided to a Stage 1 pre-decoder 236A, which generates an M-bit decoded address 304, a selected one of which is driven low, and which also generates a complement M-bit decoded address 306, a selected one of which is driven high. Each of the M instances of the multi-headed global word line driver circuits receives a corresponding one of true and complement M-bit decoded address signals 304 and 306. The \u201cselected\u201d multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302 thus receives a low signal on node 321 and a high signal on node 319. As a result, the N-channel transistor 318 and the p-channel transistor 320 are both on, and the GWL[7] is coupled to the bias node 316. Likewise, each of the individual global word line driver circuits within the multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302 couples its respective global word line to its associated bias line (i.e., GWL[4] coupled to node 314, GWL[5] coupled to node 315, etc.).",
        "Another portion of the row address is conveyed to a Stage 2 pre-decoder (not shown), which generates an N-bit decoded address 308, a selected one of which is driven high (i.e., a so-called \u201cone-hot\u201d decoded signal). In the forward decoding mode of operation, a forward mode signal 309 is asserted to enable a group of drivers 310 within the Stage 2 Drivers and Comparators Block 236B. When enabled, the drivers 310 drive each bias line 314, 315, . . . , 316 with a corresponding bit of the N-bit address 308. Each of the M instances of the multi-headed global word line driver circuits receives all N of these bias lines 314, 315, . . . , 316. The \u201cselected\u201d multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302 thus receives a low level on bias lines 314 and 315, and a high level on bias line 316.",
        "Since N-channel transistor 318 and p-channel transistor 320 are both on, and since bias line 316 is driven high, the selected global word line GWL[7] is driven high. Likewise, each of the \u201cpass gates\u201d within the other individual global word line driver circuits within the multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302 couples its respective global word line to its associated bias line (i.e., GWL[4] coupled to node 314, GWL[5] coupled to node 315, etc.), and so the non-selected global word lines GWL[4], GWL[5], and GWL[6] (not shown), are driven low. In the forward decoding mode, the Stage 2 drivers 310 are active and the hit signal 326 may be ignored by control logic. The high level conveyed by the selected driver 310, and which level is conveyed to the selected global word line, may be chosen in accordance with implementation specifics of the subsequent level(s) of decoding (e.g., the local word line drivers), and this \u201chigh\u201d level need not be a VDD level signal (i.e., the power supply voltage for the circuits) or even closer to VDD than VSS (i.e., ground).",
        "In each of the non-selected multi-headed global word line driver circuits GWL_DRV_\u00d7N, the four transmission gates (e.g., transistors 328/329) are off, and the four NMOS pull-down transistors (e.g., transistor 330) are on. Consequently, each of the four associated global word lines is pulled low, as is proper since all of these global word lines are non-selected.",
        "In the reverse decoding mode, the forward mode signal 309 is de-asserted, and the drivers 310 are disabled (i.e., a high output impedance). The transmission gate formed by transistors 318 and 320 is \u201con\u201d (because node 319 is high and node 321 is low) and drives bias node 316 to the level of node 317. Assuming that GWL[7] is selected and driven by the other decoder at the far end of the global word line, and further assuming that there is no break in the global word line, then node 317 within the multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302 will be driven high, and thus node 316 is also driven high.",
        "In each of the other individual global word line drivers within the multi-headed global word line driver circuit 302, the respective transmission gates are all enabled, and each of the bias lines 314, 315, . . . , 316 are driven to the respective level of the respective global word line associated therewith (i.e., GWL[4], GWL[5], GWL[7]). These bias lines are each coupled to an input of a respective one of a plurality of Exclusive-NOR gates 311 within the Stage 2 Drivers and Comparators block 236B. The other input of each respective XNOR gate 311 is a corresponding one of the N-bit addresses conveyed on bus 308. If the other global word line decoder at the far end is functioning correctly, then only one global word line is driven high and the remaining global word lines are driven low. For example, if GWL[7] is the selected global word line and is correctly driven high by the other global word line decoder, then bias line 316 is also driven high, and the remaining bias lines 314, 315, . . . are driven low. Each of the XNOR gates 311 receives identical inputs if the driven global word line matches the row address (including both the portion conveyed to the Stage 1 Pre-Decoder 236A, and the portion conveyed on bus 308), and each drives its corresponding output to a high level. These individual XNOR outputs form a corresponding bit of bus 312 and are conveyed to an AND gate 324, which drives the hit signal 326 high. Otherwise, the hit signal 326 is driven low to indicate that the driven global word line does not match the row address, or even that no global word line was driven at all.",
        "In the reverse decoding mode only one of the multi-headed global word line driver circuits GWL_DRV_\u00d7N is selected, and the levels of the associated global word lines are conveyed to the various bias lines by way of the transmission gates within the selected multi-headed global word line driver circuit GWL_DRV_\u00d7N. None of the transmission gates within the remaining non-selected driver circuits are enabled. As a result, a short between two adjacent global word lines, which are in different GWL_DRV_\u00d7N blocks, could be missed in the compare mode screening. Fortunately, the circuitry may be configured to prevent such a mis-compare. For example, the NMOS pull-down transistor 322 can be sized much larger than the transmission gate PMOS transistor 320 and NMOS transistor 318. Therefore, if an adjacent global word line is shorted to the selected global word line, the pull-down transistor 322 driving the non-selected \u201cadjacent\u201d global word line low would over-power the pull-up driving the selected global word line high, and both global word lines would have a level low enough to be interpreted by the XNOR gate 311 as unselected.",
        "For example, assume that the other global word line decoder (operating in a forward decoding mode) was selecting and trying to drive GWL[4] high, but a short exists between GWL[4] and the adjacent global word line GWL[3] (which is associated with the adjacent multi-headed global word line driver circuit GWL_DRV_\u00d7N). The transistor 330 pulling down GWL[3] may be sized large enough relative to the size of transmission gate 331/332 driving the selected GWL[4] to the bias line 314 level, so that neither GWL[3] nor GWL[4] is driven high enough to appear as a selected global word line to the other decoder operating in the reverse decoding mode. In addition, the XNOR gates 311 can be skewed to have larger size PMOS transistors than NMOS transistors for the bias line input (one of which, normally, is coupled to a single selected global word line). This would require the selected global word line to reach a higher voltage level for the XNOR gate 311 to sense that it is a selected global word line. In addition, one can increase N and decrease M to reduce the number of adjacent global word lines that are in different multi-headed drivers.",
        "It should be apparent that the additional circuitry utilized to implement the reverse decoding mode in FIG. 4 includes only a number N of XNOR gates 311 and a final N-input AND gate 324 (or equivalently, N XOR gates and a final N-input NAND gate). None of the additional circuits are located in pitch sensitive portions of the decoders. This is a truly remarkable achievement.",
        "While the embodiments described thus far are illustrative of the invention, there are many other embodiments that may incorporate various aspects, features, and advantages of the invention. Referring now to FIG. 5, a representation is shown of a pair of dual-mode decoders 402, 404, each responsive to a group of address lines for generating, in a forward mode of operation, a selected one of a plurality of decode nodes (one of which is shown and labeled 400), and for comparing, in a reverse decoding mode, the address to a selected decode line and generating a hit signal if they correspond (i.e., \u201cmatch\u201d). It may be implied by such a figure and by the compound adjective \u201cdual-mode\u201d that the dual-mode decoders 402, 404 are tightly integrated structures, but such is not at all required. Referring now to FIG. 6, a representation is again shown of a pair of dual-mode decoders 426, 427 as before. In this case, however, the dual mode decoder 426 is visually represented by a separate forward decoder 422 and a separate reverse decoder 423. Likewise, the dual mode decoder 429 is visually represented by a separate forward and reverse decoders 428 and 429. As used herein, a dual-mode decoder circuit is contemplated to include a range of implementations from wholly and completely separate forward and reverse decoders to extremely tightly integrated forward mode and reverse mode decoders.",
        "In many of the embodiments described above, a pair of dual-mode decoders is coupled to opposite ends of each of a group of global decoded lines. Other embodiments are contemplated in which a pair of decoders may be coupled to a group of decoded lines at different locations along the line. The decoders need not be dual-mode, and they need not be coupled at opposite ends of the decoded lines. In additions, such decoded lines need not be global lines, but may be local array lines as might be directly coupled to memory cells in the array.",
        "In FIG. 7 a forward-only decoder 442 is coupled to the approximate center of the decoded lines, and a respective reverse decoder 444, 446 is coupled at each end of the decoded lines 440. This configuration still achieves the decrease in propagation delay down the decoded line, and also allows for testing the forward decoder using two different reverse decoders, each of which also serves to verify that no opens exist in the decoded line in the respective half of the array served by the respective reverse decoder.",
        "In FIG. 8 a pair of decoders 482, 484 is coupled to opposite ends of each of a group of decoded lines 480, but only one of the decoders (i.e., decoder 482) is a dual-mode decoder. This configuration still achieves the decrease in propagation delay down the decoded line, and also allows for testing the forward decoder 484 using the decoder 482 in the reverse mode, which also serves to verify that no opens exist in the decoded lines 480 (and optionally, no shorted lines, adjacent lines, either).",
        "In FIG. 9 a single dual mode decoder 502 is coupled at some point along the decoded lines 500 (as shown here, at one end of the decode lines 500). If the dual-mode decoder 502 is implemented as a forward decoder 504 which can operate independently of a reverse decoder 506, then such a configuration may be thought of as two decoders respectively connected at respective locations along a group of decoded lines even though here such respective locations may both be at the same end of the decoded lines 500. Also shown is an optional second reverse decoder 508 coupled at the other end of the decoded lines.",
        "Most memory arrays are designed having a relatively high degree of uniformity. For example, usually every bit line includes the same number of memory cells. As another example, the number of bit lines, word lines, array blocks, and even memory planes is frequently an integral power of two in number (i.e., 2N), for ease and efficiency of decode circuitry. But such regularity or consistency is certainly not required for any of the embodiments of the present invention. For example, word line segments on different layers may include different numbers of memory cells, the memory array may include three memory planes, word line segments within the first and last array block may be different in number of memory cells or bit line configuration, and any of many other irregular variations to the usual consistency of memory array design. Unless otherwise explicitly recited in the claims, such usual regularity, even as shown in the embodiments described herein, should not be imported into the meaning of any claim.",
        "It should be appreciated that the designations top, left, bottom, and right are merely convenient descriptive terms for the four sides of a memory array. The word line segments for a block may be implemented as two inter-digitated groups of word line segments oriented horizontally, and the bit lines for a block may be implemented as two inter-digitated groups of bit lines oriented vertically. Each respective group of word lines or bit lines may be served by a respective decoder/driver circuit and a respective sense circuit on one of the four sides of the array. Suitable column circuits are set forth in \u201cTree Decoder Structure Particularly Well Suited to Interfacing Array Lines Having Extremely Small Layout Pitch,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/306,888, filed Nov. 27, 2002, which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "Word lines may also be referred to as row lines or X-lines, and bit lines may also be referred to as column lines or Y-lines. The distinction between \u201cword\u201d lines and \u201cbit\u201d lines may carry at least two different connotations to those skilled in the art. When reading a memory array, it is assumed by some practitioners that word lines are \u201cdriven\u201d and bit lines are \u201csensed.\u201d In this regard, X-lines (or word lines) are usually contemplated as being connected to the gate terminal of memory cell transistors, or the switch terminal of the memory cell switch device, if present. The Y-lines (or bit lines) are usually contemplated as being connected to a switched terminal of the memory cell (e.g., source/drain terminal). Secondly, the memory organization (e.g., data bus width, number of bits simultaneously read during an operation, etc.) may have some association with viewing one set of the two array lines more aligned with data \u201cbits\u201d rather than data \u201cwords.\u201d Consequently, the designations herein of X-lines, word lines, and row lines, and of Y-lines, bit lines, and column lines are illustrative of the various embodiments but should not be viewed in a restrictive sense, but rather a more general sense.",
        "As used herein, word lines (e.g., including word line segments) and bit lines usually represent orthogonal array lines, and generally follow a common assumption in the art that word lines are driven and bit lines are sensed, at least during a read operation. Thus, the bit lines of an array may also be referred to as sense lines of the array. No particular implication should be drawn as to word organization by use of such terms. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cglobal array line\u201d is an array line that connects to array line segments in more than one memory block, but no particular inference should be drawn suggesting such a global array line must traverse across an entire memory array or substantially across an entire integrated circuit.",
        "As used herein, a passive element memory array includes a plurality of 2-terminal memory cells, each connected between an associated X-line and an associated Y-line. Such a memory array may be a two-dimensional (planar) array or may be a three-dimensional array having more than one plane of memory cells. Each such memory cell has a non-linear conductivity in which the current in a reverse direction (i.e., from cathode to anode) is lower than the current in a forward direction. Application of a voltage from anode to cathode greater than a programming level changes the conductivity of the memory cell. The conductivity may decrease when the memory cell incorporates a fuse technology, or may increase when the memory cell incorporates an anti-fuse technology. A passive element memory array is not necessarily a one-time programmable (i.e., write once) memory array.",
        "Such passive element memory cells may generally be viewed as having a current steering element directing current in a direction and another component which is capable of changing its state (e.g., a fuse, an antifuse, a capacitor, a resistive element, etc.). The programming state of the memory element can be read by sensing current flow or voltage drop when the memory element is selected.",
        "In various embodiments of the invention described herein, many different memory cell technologies are contemplated for use. Suitable three-dimensional anti-fuse memory cell structures, configurations, and processes include, without limitation, those described in: U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,882 to Johnson, et al, entitled \u201cVertically Stacked Field Programmable Nonvolatile Memory and Method of Fabrication\u201d; U.S. Pat.

Each of these enumerated disclosures is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "The present invention is contemplated for advantageous use with any of a wide variety of memory cell technologies and memory array configurations, including both traditional single-level memory arrays and multi-level (i.e., three-dimensional) memory arrays, and particularly those having extremely dense X-line or Y-line pitch requirements. In certain embodiments, the memory cells may be comprised of semiconductor materials, as described in U.S. Pat.No. 6,034,882 to Johnson et al., and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,396 to Zhang. In certain embodiments, an antifuse memory cell is contemplated. Other types of memory arrays, such as MRAM and organic passive element arrays, can also be used. MRAM (magnetoresistive random access memory) is based on magnetic memory elements, such as a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). MRAM technology is described in \u201cA 256 kb 3.0V 1T1MTJ Nonvolatile Magnetoresistive RAM\u201d by Peter K. Naji et al., published in the Digest of Technical Papers of the 2001 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, ISSCC 2001/Session 7/Technology Directions: Advanced Technologies/7.6, Feb. 6, 2001 and pages 94-95, 404-405 of ISSCC 2001 Visual Supplement. Certain passive element memory cells may be used which incorporate layers of organic materials including at least one layer that has a diode-like characteristic conduction and at least one organic material that changes conductivity with the application of an electric field. U.S. Pat. No. 6,055,180 to Gudensen et al. describes such organic passive element arrays. Memory cells comprising materials such as phase-change materials and amorphous solids can also be used. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,751,012 to Wolstenholme et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,646,266 to Ovshinsky et al. In other embodiments, three-terminal memory cells may also be employed, rather than two-terminal passive element memory cells, and multiple X-lines (or row lines) selected to sum currents from more than one memory cell on a selected Y-line (or bit line). Such memory cells include flash EPROM and EEPROM cells, which are well known in the art. Moreover, other memory array configurations having extremely dense X-line and/or Y-line pitch requirements are also contemplated such as, for example, those incorporating tin-film transistor (TFT) EEPROM memory cells, as described in \u201cDense Arrays and Charge Storage Devices, and Methods for Making Same,\u201d by Thomas H. Lee, et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2002-0028541 A1, and for those incorporating TFT NAND memory arrays, as described in \u201cProgrammable Memory Array Structure Incorporating Series-Connected Transistor Strings and Methods for Fabrication and Operation of Same\u201d by Scheuerlein, et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2004-0125629 A1, and in \u201cIntegrated Circuit Including Memory Array Incorporating Multiple Types of NAND String Structures\u201d by Luca G. Fasoli and Roy E. Scheuerlein, U.S. application Ser. No. 11/026,492 filed on even date herewith, which applications are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The directionality of various array lines in the various figures is merely convenient for ease of description of the two groups of crossing lines in the array. While word lines are usually orthogonal to bit lines, such is not necessarily required. As used herein, an integrated circuit memory array is a monolithic integrated circuit structure, rather than more than one integrated circuit device packaged together or in close proximity.",
        "The block diagrams herein may be described using the terminology of a single node connecting the blocks. Nonetheless, it should be appreciated that, when required by the context, such a \u201cnode\u201d may actually represent a pair of nodes for conveying a differential signal, or may represent multiple separate wires (e.g., a bus) for carrying several related signals or for carrying a plurality of signals forming a digital word or other multi-bit signal.",
        "Based upon the teachings of this disclosure, it is expected that one of ordinary skill in the art will be readily able to practice the present invention. The descriptions of the various embodiments provided herein are believed to provide ample insight and details of the present invention to enable one of ordinary skill to practice the invention. Nonetheless, in the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It should, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.",
        "For example, decisions as to the number of memory cells within each array or sub-array, the particular configuration chosen for word line and bit line pre-decoder and decoder circuits and bit line sensing circuits, as well as the word organization, are all believed to be typical of the engineering decisions faced by one skilled in the art in practicing this invention in the context of developing a commercially-viable product. As is well known in the art, various row and column decoder circuits are implemented for selecting a memory block, and a word line and bit line within the selected block, based upon address signals and possibly other control signals. Nonetheless, even though a mere routine exercise of engineering effort is believed to be required to practice this invention, such engineering efforts may result in additional inventive efforts, as frequently occurs in the development of demanding, competitive products.",
        "While circuits and physical structures are generally presumed, it is well recognized that in modern semiconductor design and fabrication, physical structures and circuits may be embodied in computer readable descriptive form suitable for use in subsequent design, test or fabrication stages as well as in resultant fabricated semiconductor integrated circuits. Accordingly, claims directed to traditional circuits or structures may, consistent with particular language thereof, read upon computer readable encodings and representations of same, whether embodied in media or combined with suitable reader facilities to allow fabrication, test, or design refinement of the corresponding circuits and/or structures. The invention is contemplated to include circuits, related methods or operation, related methods for making such circuits, and computer-readable medium encodings of such circuits and methods, all as described herein, and as defined in the appended claims. As used herein, a computer-readable medium includes at least disk, tape, or other magnetic, optical, semiconductor (e.g., flash memory cards, ROM), or electronic medium and a network, wireline, wireless or other communications medium. An encoding of a circuit may include circuit schematic information, physical layout information, behavioral simulation information, and/or may include any other encoding from which the circuit may be represented or communicated.",
