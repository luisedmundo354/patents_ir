        "The present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to certain preferred and alternative embodiments. As described below, refinements and substitutions of the various embodiments are possible based on the principles and teachings herein.",
        "FIG. 1 is an overview of a spectrometer/spectrophotometer housing arrangement in accordance with an exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, spectrometer/spectrophotometer 1 in accordance with preferred embodiments preferably includes a housing includes body portion 6A and 6B that preferably houses the spectrometer or spectrophotometer (herein, the spectrophotometer generally consisting of a spectrometer and light source, and perhaps a power source such as a battery, while a spectrometer embodiment may provide light that is provided via an optical cable from an external light source). In the illustrated embodiment, the body portion 6A/6B consists of two parts, upper portion 6A and lower portion 6B, the two portions of which together define the body portion, and in the preferred embodiment the neck portion. Such a two or multi-part construction facilitates manufacture of the unit, as the upper portion may be removed, and the interior components such as the spectrometer may then be more readily installed or assembled in the interior of the housing, etc.",
        "In operation, the spectrometer assembly within body portion 6A/6B preferably is located in the palm of the user's hand, thus enabling the spectrometer assembly to be positioned close to the object under test, and preferably so that no optical fibers or the like that serve to couple light from the object under test to the spectrometer assembly will be bent or kinked by user of the instrument (the adverse affects, such as optical transmission changes, from bending or kinking optical fibers are described in greater detail in the Referenced Patent Documents). Extending from, and preferably integral with, body portion 6A/6B is neck portion 8 (in the illustrated embodiment, neck portion 8 is formed from the upper and lower portions 6A and 6B of the body portion, although the present invention is not necessarily limited to this construction. With neck portion 8 also consisting of upper and lower portions, the upper portion may be removed such as to facilitate assembly, such as positioning of fiber optics or light guiding members, etc., into the tip, etc. Preferably, the neck portion extends in a curved manner in a direction away from the body portion and toward the tip and the person whose tooth is to be measured (as more fully described elsewhere herein). As will be appreciated, the neck portion may extend in a direction and length so as to facilitate measurement of the target object, such as a tooth in a patient's mouth.",
        "Extending from, and preferably integral with, neck portion 8 is tip portion 10. Optics, such as light guiding fiber optics or the like, preferably carry light to tip end 12 at end of tip portion 10, at which point the light leaves the instrument in order to illuminate the tooth or other object or material, and return the light to the spectrometer for analysis. With such a probe configuration, with neck portion 8 and tip portion 10 configured such as illustrated, the instrument may more readily extend into the mouth of a patient and serve to facilitate the measurement of teeth and the like. Preferably, neck portion 8 and tip portion 10 together may serve as a form of cheek retractor, or have a length and shape, so as to enable measurement of posterior or inside/back teeth of a patient, as opposed to other techniques in which only anterior or front teeth may be measured. While the illustrated shape of FIG. 1 is exemplary, what should be appreciated is that body portion 6A/6B may house the spectrometer/spectrometer, while neck portion 8 and tip portion 10 extend away from body portion 6A/6B and carry source and receiver fiber optics or light guides to end 12 of tip portion 10, with neck portion 8 and tip portion 10 collectively having a length and/or shape to facilitate the measurement of desired samples, such as teeth, which may be located in difficult to reach places (such as posterior teeth in the mouth of a patient).",
        "In accordance with preferred embodiments, the neck portion is configured to have an upper portion that includes a location (such as location 4, as illustrated in FIG. 1) for placement of a user's index finger. This location may have an indented portion or other textured area or friction surface (such as small bumps, a rubber surface or the like that tends to increase the friction between the user's index finger and the instrument) such that a user's index finger may be securably be positioned at that location. With the user's index finger reliably positioned at such a location on the neck portion, the tip portion of the instrument may be more precisely moved towards a desired or predetermined location on the tooth or other object so that the tip may measure the desired or predetermined location.",
        "Also in accordance with preferred embodiments, one or a plurality of switches are provided for activation and/or control of the instrument, preferably located and operated in a manner such that the measurement is not adversely affected by undesired movement induced by the switch activation. One or more switches may be located on a lower surface of the body portion such that the switch may be activated by a squeezing motion of one or more of the user's fingers, while not pulling the instrument away from the desired or predetermined location on the tooth or other object. In addition (or alternatively), the tip may move respect to other parts of the tip portion or the neck and body portion such that the movement of the tip may be detected electrically, mechanically or optically. In one exemplary preferred embodiment, a membrane or spring activated-type switch is positioned within location 4, such that a movement of the user's index finger causes activation of the switch, which may be detected such as to initiate a measurement (which may be a measurement of the object under test, a calibration or normalization reference or standard, etc.). What is important is that body portion 6A/6B include an intuitive and nature placement for position of one or more of the operator's fingers, preferably in a manner that naturally and intuitively guides the probe tip towards a desired area for measurement, with a switch that may be activated with a slight and natural movement that does not tend to cause undesired motion of the probe tip from the desired area for measurement (as described in the Referenced Patent Documents, for example, movement away from such a desired area or at an undesired angle, etc., may be detected or quantified, with optical measurements either adjusted or rejected based on the movement or amount of movement, etc.).",
        "FIG. 2 is an interior view of a spectrometer/spectrophotometer housing arrangement in accordance with an exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 illustrates in greater detail general aspects of such an exemplary preferred embodiment, which other figures will illustrate preferred optical and spectrometer configurations, etc., that may be used with such exemplary arrangements as are illustrated in FIG. 2.",
        "Generally, implementations of such embodiments constitute spectrophotometers, which generally consist of a light source (e.g., light source 14) that provides light to the object under test (e.g., such as via light source member 16, which may constitute a fiber optic or fiber optic assembly). Light is returned from the object and received and carried (e.g., such as via light receiver member 18, which may constitute a fiber optic or fiber optic assembly or multiple fiber optics, as in preferred embodiments to be described hereinafter) to spectrometer assembly 20 for analysis. In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, however, spectrometer 20 is positioned inside of body portion 6A/6B so that the bulk of spectrometer assembly 20 is effectively positioned inside the operator's hand, with neck portion 8 and tip portion 10 extending away from body portion 6A/6B in a manner to facilitate measurement of objects such as teeth, which may be inconveniently located, such as inside of a person's mouth.",
        "As will be appreciated from FIG. 2, light source 14 may be located within or integral with body portion 6A/6B, and a suitable power source (such as battery 15 via power conductors 15A) may provide power for light source 14 and the electronics of spectrometer assembly 20. In such embodiments, the underside of body portion 6A/6B may carry a display device (such as generally illustrated by display device 6C in FIG. 1) that outputs data indicative of the optical characteristics of the object being measured (such as, as discussed in detail in the Referenced Patent Documents). This may be, for example, an output of a closest color or shade match (or closest match), such as a Pantone or Vita shade guide value, a paint or other pigment specifier or formulation, pass/fail indication, etc. Also as will be appreciated, spectrometer 20 may include a processing device (again, such as discussed in detail in the Referenced Patent Documents), which may include memory, input/output circuitry and the like, such that data generated by spectrometer assembly 20 may not only be used for color or shade prediction, but be displayed or transferred to another computer device as spectral or other data. Such data transfer from the handheld device may be by customer or standard serial or parallel interface, USB, etc., or may be wireless, such as using a wireless transceiver arrangement such as based on what are known as the Bluetooth or 802.11 or other wireless protocol, or may be a docking station-type data transmission (i.e., data is collected and locally stored within spectrometer assembly 20 or elsewhere within body portion 6A/6B, and subsequently transmitted via a wired or wireless connection by positioning body portion 6A/6B within a docking station or cradle, with electrical connectors for data transmission or battery recharging, etc., on body portion 6A/6B mating with corresponding electrical connectors on the docking station or cradle, etc.). What is important is that the handheld device include one or multiple spectrometers such as illustrated by spectrometer assembly 20, which spectrally analyze light returned from the object under test, with the data generated by the spectral analysis further processed, either with processing circuitry within spectrometer assembly 20 (or elsewhere within or integral to body portion 6A/6B, etc.) or external thereto, such as by a wired or wireless data connection to an external computer/processing device, which may further process the data, such as for shade or color or pigment prediction, display or color or spectral data, data storage, transmission to remote locations for processing or display or for production of articles based on data generated by spectrometer assembly 20, etc. Such exemplary uses of data generated by spectrometer assembly 20 are discussed in greater detail in the Referenced Patent Documents.",
        "In a similar manner, the light provided to the object under may be generated by a light source integral to body portion 6A/6B (such as via light source 14), or may be generated by a light that is not integral to body portion 6A/6B but is instead generated external to body portion 6A/6B and provided to body portion 6A/6B via an optical cable (such as a light source fiber optic). In one such embodiment, an external unit provides light to body portion 6A/6B via a fiber optic cable or cable assembly (e.g., collection of fiber optics), with data and/or power cables being provided along with the fiber optic cable/cable assembly from the external unit. With such embodiments, the external unit may include a power supply, light source, display and associated electronics/processing, such that body portion 6A/6B includes fiber optics to provide light to and from the object under test, with spectrometer assembly 20 generating spectral data, which may then be transferred to a processor in the external unit via the data cables. As will be appreciated, the light source optic cable/cable assembly and the data and/or power cables may be provided, for example, in a single monocoil, such as may be constructed with stainless steel, aluminum or other material known in the art. Such exemplary arrangements will be explained in greater detail hereinafter.",
        "FIG. 3 is an illustration of a user utilizing a spectrometer/spectrophotometer arrangement in accordance with an exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 3, hand 21 of a user or operator may grasp body portion 6A/6B such as by wrapping of fingers around body portion 6A/6B, preferably with index (or other) finger 21A being positioned in an extended or semi-extended manner (such as is illustrated) with finger tip 21B being positioned within or on a physical placement feature on neck portion 8 (see, e.g., location 4 discussed in connection with FIG. 1). A switch for initiation of a measurement, for example, may be located under finger tip 21B or under finger tip(s) 21C (such as previously described).",
        "What is important to note from FIG. 3 is that spectrometer assembly 20, within body portion 6A/6B is positioned generally within the volume created by hand 21 holding body portion 6A/6B, preferably with a natural and physically intuitive position for the index and other fingers of the user/operator, and preferably with a suitable membrane, spring or other switch located and configured in a manner that it may be activated by the user/operator without a significant tendency to cause movement of the tip end from the desired area for measurement on the object under test. Further, in embodiments where body portion 6A/6B is coupled to an external unit via an optical and/or electrical cable or cable assembly (such as described elsewhere herein), as illustrated in FIG. 3 cable/cable assembly 22 is positioned to exit body portion 6A/6B preferably from a rear portion of body portion 6A/6B, which tends to cause cable/cable assembly 22 to be below the arm of the user/operator as illustrated. With other instruments, a cable often times exits a probe or handpiece assembly so as to over the user's arm and/or hand and tend to pull down the user's arm and/or hand. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, however, it has been determined that desirable spectral/optical measurements may be made with a spectrometer positioned within a handpiece as described and illustrated, with any cable/cable assembly extending from the handpiece exiting the body of the handpiece at a position to be below the arm/hand of the user, such that the weight of any such cable/cable assembly does not tend to pull the hand or arm of the user during operation, or to cause forces that would cause the user to tire more easily from use of the instrument, etc. This has been determined to be particularly true when the present invention is applied to fields such as dentistry, when a dental professional may desire to carefully target the probe tip to one or more desired areas of a tooth or teeth (such as for measuring a plurality of anterior and posterior teeth, as described elsewhere herein), with the handpiece being configured to enable the dental professional to guide the probe tip to the desired area or areas, with a switch configured to initiate measurements in a manner not to cause movement of the handpiece tip from the desired area or areas, and without any cable/cable assembly tending to pull the dental professional's arm or hand in a manner that may likewise tend to cause movement of the handpiece tip from the desired area or areas, etc. Of course, as described elsewhere herein, a cable/cable assembly extending from the handpiece is optional, and in other embodiments wireless data transmission, docking station data transmission, etc., may be utilized (and in such embodiments there may be no cable/cable assembly extending from the handpiece, etc.).",
        "As described elsewhere herein and in the Referenced Patent Documents, in preferred embodiments spectral measurements are made with a highly miniaturized spectrometer assembly, which preferably consist of an array or other plurality of sensors (preferably consisting of light to frequency converters), with light coupled to at least certain of the sensors via filters or filter elements (which preferably are interference filters, and which may be discrete bandpass type filters, or which collectively may consist of a color gradient or linear variable type filter, etc.). Preferably, light is coupled from a light source to the object under test via one or more light sources, which may be fiber optics, and preferably light is received from the object under test and coupled to the sensors via the filters or filter elements. Embodiments of the present invention provide improvements and enhancements to concepts such as the foregoing, and enable improved systems and methods for measuring the optical properties of optically complex materials, including objects that are translucent, pearlescent, etc., and including objects such as teeth, dental restorations, gems, etc. In certain preferred embodiments, a multi-spectrometer design is utilized to provide multiple spectral-type measurements, preferably in parallel, and preferably with different source-receiver combinations that enable various complex materials to be optically measured.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary embodiment of such a multi-spectrometer design will now be described. Light from a light source (not shown in FIG. 4; preferably an incandescent lamp with generally known optical properties, such as color temperature) is provided via optical fiber 24 (e.g., which may be a 4.0 millimeter glass or other optical fiber bundle). Light from fiber 24 is coupled to fiber bundle 24A, three fibers of which (i.e., fibers 27, which may be 1.0 millimeter plastic fibers) are coupled to three sensors via filters (preferably three separate bands of predetermined wavelengths over the visible band; e.g., bandpass interference filters). Fibers 27 and the associated filters will be understood to constitute a first spectrometer or spectral measuring device, which preferably serve to track and monitor the output of the light source. As will be understood, the choice of three fibers and three bands to track the light source is exemplary; one, two, three, four or more bands could be similarly be used to track the light source, but three bands, along with some understanding of the properties of the light source, have been determined to provide a sufficient level of information regarding the light output of the lamp; as will be further understood, in the event of lamp drift, such may be detected and the sensed via fibers 27, and spectral measurements of the object under test either adjusted or rejected due to changes in the light source output, etc. In FIG. 4, elements 35 generally illustrate a ferrule coupled to the individual fibers, which may be utilized to couple the fiber to aperture plate 34, which serves to position the end of the fiber so as to couple light to filters/sensors 36 (in FIG. 4, the filters and sensors are shown as a combined item for discussion purposes; it is understood, based on the description elsewhere herein and in the Referenced Patent Documents, that the particular coupling details between the fiber ends and the sensors may be configured in a variety of ways and may include, for example, aperture plates, lenses, lens assemblies, spacers, etc.; what is important for this particular embodiment is that light from the lamp is coupled to sensors via filters in order to provide a lamp monitoring spectral sensing implement which monitors the lamp source output, etc.). Filters/sensors/electronics 40 of FIG. 4 generally refers to the filters and sensors, and associated electronics for reading the outputs of the individual sensors, for implementing multiple spectrometers and topology angle sensors, more details of which may be understood from the Referenced Patent Documents.",
        "Fibers 24B from fiber bundle 24A are provided to probe tip 26 as illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, fibers 24B constitute 12 fibers, which may consist of 1.0 millimeter plastic fibers. The arrangement of fibers 24B in probe tip 26, which serve to provide a plurality of light sources, or effectively a ring of light, are illustrated in FIG. 6 and will be described in greater detail hereinafter.",
        "Light returned from the object under test is received by probe tip 26 via a plurality of light receivers. Such light receivers preferably may consist of a center light receiver 30, preferably a 1 millimeter plastic fiber, and also a first set (preferably three) of light receivers 33 not from the center of the probe tip and a second set (preferably three) of light receivers 28 also not from the center of the probe tip.",
        "Center light receiver 30 is preferably coupled to a plurality of sensors via a plurality of filters, with the filters preferably providing bandpass filters spaced over the spectral band(s) of interference; for example, the filters may have bandpass characteristics such that the filters collectively span the visible band, such as described in the Referenced Patent Documents. In a preferred embodiment, center light receiver 30 is coupled to randomized fiber optic 31, which preferably has and input that receives light via light receiver 30 via optical coupler/splitter 30A (which may include a lens to collimate light from light receiver 30 to more optimally couple the light provided to randomized fiber optic 31), and has twelve outputs, each of which provides light that is coupled to a sensor through one of the filters. As described in the Referenced Patent Documents, the use of a such a randomized implement may help serve to destroy any angular or similar dependencies of the light received by light receiver 30, with the light provided to the twelve outputs being more or less equal or having reduced dependency as to where on light receiver 30 is the received light receiver (and at what angle, etc.) over the twelve outputs. Preferably, randomized fiber optic 31 is an optical implement which constitutes a large number of preferably glass fibers, with an input area that is randomly divided and apportioned to N (preferably 12) output areas, which in the illustrated embodiment constitute 12 fiber optic bundles each of which couples light to a sensor via a filter. As also described in the Referenced Patent Documents, such a randomized implement efficiently provides light to the filter/sensor combinations with less angular dependencies, etc. The N (preferably 12) outputs of randomized fiber optic 31, and the associated filter/sensors, preferably provide a first spectrometer/spectral sensing implement for generating spectral data based on the light received from the object under test.",
        "Light receivers 28 preferably are coupled to sensors via filters in order to provide a second spectrometer/spectral sensing implement for generating spectral data based on the light received from the object under test. In the illustrated embodiment, light receivers 28 constitute three fiber optics. While three fiber optics may be coupled to filters/sensors and provide a three band spectral sensing device, in the illustrated embodiment six spectral bands are utilized for the second spectrometer/spectral sensing device. In the illustrated embodiment, the three fibers of light receivers 28 are coupled to light pipe 29 (which may be a 2 millimeter plastic light pipe), which serves to couple and mix and diffuse light from (preferably) three input fibers 28 to (preferably) six output fibers 32. The preferably six output fibers are coupled to filters/sensors as illustrated. The preferably 6 output fibers, and the associated filter/sensors, preferably provide a second spectrometer/spectral sensing implement for generating spectral data based on the light received from the object under test.",
        "Light receivers 33 typically are coupled to sensors via neutral density filters (or no filters) and are preferably used to provide topology sensors (see, e.g., the discussion in the Referenced Patent Documents). In yet other alternative embodiments, light receivers 33 could be provided to sensors without filters, could be provided to sensors via fine bandpass filters and look at only particular spectral lines (for example, in order to detect the presence of specific materials that reflect or emit light in such particular spectral bands, etc.). In preferred embodiments, however, such light receivers 33 serve to provide positional or topology information (e.g., angle of the probe with respect to the surface of the object under test), such as described in the Referenced Patent Documents.",
        "FIGS. 5A-5D illustrate exemplary routing and mapping of fibers in such embodiments. As will be understood from FIGS. 5A-5D, the sensors and filters and fiber optic inputs to the assembly 40 are in two rows; as FIGS. 5A-5D provide only a top view, only the top row is shown. In the illustrated embodiment, a bottom row also exists, and thus 24 total sensors are provided in the illustrated embodiment. Of course, as will be understood to those of skill in the art, the particular number of filters and sensors may be readily adapted to the particular application, and the present invention is not limited to the particular numbers in the illustrated embodiments.",
        "In FIG. 5A, center light receiver 30 extends from probe tip 26 to coupler 30A, which preferably includes lens 30B, which serves to collect and collimate light from light receiver 30 and couple the light to the input area of randomized fiber optic 31, which serves to randomize and split the light into separate outputs, as previously described. The outputs of the randomized fiber optic 31 are coupled to filters/sensors/electronics 40 to provide a first spectrometer/spectral sensing implement, as previously described.",
        "In FIG. 5B, light source fiber bundle 24 is coupled to coupler 25. Fibers 27 of fiber bundle 24A are coupled to filters/sensors/electronics 40 for purposes of monitoring and tracking the light source, as previously described. Fibers of fiber bundle 24B are provided to probe tip 26 and provide a plurality of light sources, also as previously described.",
        "In FIG. 5C, light receivers 33, which preferably are inner ring fibers (see FIG. 6), extend from probe tip 26 and are coupled to filters/sensors/electronics 40 for purposes of, for example, providing topology or angle sensors, such as previously described. Also illustrated in FIG. 5C are bias lamp 41, power wires 42 and light conductor 43. As described in greater detail in the Referenced Patent Documents, in preferred embodiments bias light is provided to the sensors, which guarantee a minimal amount of light to the sensors (as will be understood from the Referenced Patent Documents, light from bias lamp 41 is not light that is provided to and returned from the object under test, but instead is a preferably separate light source that serves to bias the light sensors). Under power provided by wires 42 (with the power preferably obtained from the power supply providing power to the sensors, for example), bias lamp 41 generates bias light, which is controllably conducted to the sensors via light conductor 43.",
        "In FIG. 5D, light receivers 28, which also are preferably inner ring fibers (see FIG. 6), extend from probe tip 26 and are coupled to light pipe or coupler 29, which serves to couple/mix/diffuse light from light receivers 28 to fibers 32. The outputs of the fibers 32 are coupled to filters/sensors/electronics 40 to provide a second spectrometer/spectral sensing implement, as previously described.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary end view of probe tip 26. Center light receiver 45D is positioned generally at the center of probe tip 26. As will be understood, center light receiver generally may be considered the end of light receiver (fiber) 30, which is coupled to a first spectrometer/spectral sensing implement. A first ring is provided around center light receiver 45. In the first ring are arranged light receivers 45C and 45B, which generally may be considered the ends of light receivers 28 and 33, respectively. Light receivers 45C (preferably 3) provide light that is ultimately coupled to a second spectrometer/spectral sensing implement. Light receivers 45B (preferably 3) provide light that is coupled to sensors such as for purposes of sensing topology or angle. A plurality of light sources 45A perferably are provided in a circular arrangement in probe tip 26 (12 being illustrated in this exemplary embodiment). The plurality of light sources 45A generally constitute the ends of the fibers of fiber bundle 24B, as will be understood from the description elsewhere herein. The plurality of light sources 45A generally constitute a ring light source in probe tip 26.",
        "Based on the foregoing, it will be understood that an instrument may be provided that utilizes multiple spectrometers in parallel, including multiple spectrometers that may serve to make spectral measurements, preferably in parallel, of the object under test. As described in greater detail in the Referenced Patent Documents, the numerical aperture, diameters and spacing of the light sources and receivers define a \u201ccritical height\u201d below which light that is reflected from the surface of the object under test cannot be received and propagated by the light receivers. Measurements below the critical height thus are generally not dependent upon surface characteristics, as light reflected from the surface is not going to be received by the light receivers and thus sensed by the spectrometers. Light that enters the light receivers generally is light that enters the bulk of the material of the object, is scattered and displaced so that it can exit the material at a position and angle to be received and propagated by the light receivers (see the Referenced Patent Documents for a more detailed discussion of this phenomenon). Consider probe tip 26 being in contact with the surface of the object under test. In such a condition, the various source/receiver combinations provided by probe tip 26 each will be below the critical height. While conventional approaches tend to characterize optical properties that include surface reflected light (and thus tend to be more sensitive to surface irregularities, angle, etc.), it has been discovered that optically more complex objects such as teeth, which are highly translucent, may be more optimally quantified with such below the critical height measurements. With the multi-spectrometer approach of the present invention, multiple spectrometers may make multiple below the critical height measurements in parallel, and thus provide substantial optical data from which optical characteristics of the object under test (such as a shade or color prediction) may be determined.",
        "Without being bound by theory, a discussion of certain benefits and principles of the foregoing approach will now be described. As will be appreciated from FIG. 6, center light receiver 45D is generally equi-distant from the various light sources 45A. Thus, light that is received by light receiver 45D generally is light from light sources 45A that enters the object under test, penetrates some optical depth, gets scattered, displaced, etc., and is ultimately received by light receiver 45D. Generally, however, the light originates from a light source that is in essence the same distance away from the light receiver (as will be appreciated from FIG. 6, light receiver 45D is not precisely the same distance from all of the light sources 45A, but generally are about the diameter of the fibers of the inner ring away from the lights sources 45A). Each of light receivers 45C, on the other hand, is a varying distance from the various light sources 45A (i.e., some are closer to the light sources and some are further away from the light sources). Light receivers 45C, with its varying spacings from light sources 45A, collectively receive light that may be considered to be more of an \u201caverage depth\u201d or optical path length within the material of the object under test (again, some close and some far away). Again, without being bound by theory, it has been determined that light receivers 45C may be used to make spectral measurements that less sensitive to the thickness of the material under test, as compared to the center light receiver 45D, which has been observed to be more sensitive to thickness. In the case of materials such as teeth or dental restorations, the perceived optical characteristics may be a function of various layers constituting the materials. In attempting to characterize such complex optical materials, it has been determined that using multiple spectrometers to make multiple measurements, with varying spacings between the sources and receivers, varying average optical path lengths or effective optical depths of the measurements, etc., provide a much greater amount of information from which to make, for example, shade or color predictions.",
        "For example, for an instrument that is used to shade match teeth or dental restorations, the material may be a tooth or a ceramic restoration. The constituent materials generally have different optical properties, and may have different layers of differing thicknesses of differing materials in order to produce colors that are perceived to be the same by viewing human observer. Having only a single spectral measurement, for example, has been determined to provide less than sufficient data for a sufficient shade or color determination or prediction.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, the multiple spectrometers each make spectral measurements. Depending upon the type of material under examination, for example a natural tooth versus a dental restoration (and for example a denture tooth versus a porcelain-fused-to metal \u201cPFM\u201d crown), with the present invention different shade prediction criteria may be utilized. For example, user input may inform the instrument what type of material is under examination; alternatively, the instrument could collect data from the multiple spectrometers and predict the type of material (which could be confirmed or over-ridden by user input, etc.). In any event, after collecting spectral data, the instrument then desires to output a color or shade value. Typically, data is stored within the instrument in the form of lookup tables or the like, and measured data is compared in some form with the stored data of the various shades in order to predict and output the closest shade or color (see, e.g., the Referenced Patent Documents). In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, however, the measured data and lookup tables, or possible combinations thereof, may be more optimally utilized depending upon the type of material under test.",
        "For example, if a natural tooth is under examination, spectral data may be collected from the first and second spectrometers. Data from the first (center receiver) spectrometer, which generally is more sensitive to thickness, may be used exclusively for shade or color prediction, or weighted more heavily in the shade prediction as compared to data from the second (ring receiver) spectrometer, which generally is less sensitive to thickness. For a PFM restoration, which could consist of thin layers (as compared to a comparable sized natural tooth), thickness dependencies could present much greater problems with attempting to perform shade matching or color prediction for PFM samples. If a PFM restoration is under examination, spectral data may be collected from the first and second spectrometers. Data from the second (ring receiver) spectrometer, which generally is less sensitive to thickness, may be used exclusively for shade or color prediction, or weighted more heavily in the shade prediction as compared to data from the first (center receiver) spectrometer, which generally is more sensitive to thickness.",
        "As will be understood from the foregoing, depending upon the type of material under test, a different shade matching/prediction method or algorithm will be performed. In accordance with such embodiments of the present invention, a first type of material under test (e.g., a natural tooth) would utilize a first shade matching algorithm (e.g., weigh data from the first spectrometer more heavily than data from the second spectrometer), and a second type of material under test (e.g., a PFM restoration) would utilize a second shade matching algorithm (e.g., weigh data from the second spectrometer more heavily than data from the first spectrometer). In addition, depending upon the type of material under test, different optical parameters could be utilized, again with different weights. For example, a prediction based on the closest \u201cdelta E\u201d match between the stored shades or colors may be used for a first type of material under test, while a prediction that gives more (or less) weight to, for example \u201cdelta L\u201d or \u201cdelta c\u201d or \u201cdelta h,\u201d may be used for second type of material (it being understood by those of skill in the art that L, c and h refer to luminance, chroma and hue of the well-know L-C-H system for representing color). Moreover, a first combination of data from the first and second spectrometers (with first weights given to the first and second spectrometers) and a first set of parameters (e.g., delta E) may be utilized for shade or color prediction for a first type of material, while a second combination of data from the first and second spectrometers (with second weights given to the first and second spectrometers) and a second set of parameters (e.g., delta L and/or delta c and/or delta h) may be utilized for shade or color prediction for a second type of material. With the present invention, multiple spectrometers, and/or multiple shade/color prediction/matching algorithms based on data from multiple spectrometers, may be utilized depending on the type of material being measured in order to more accurately predict/match shades and colors for a wide range of materials.",
        "Other aspects of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 7A-7D, an explanation will be provided of an improved barrier infection control implement that is preferably utilized in accordance with the present invention. As fields of application for the present include the dental and medical fields, and fields in which wet pigments or other materials could be applied (such as painting, printing), the probe used to make spectral or other optical measurements may come into contact with the object under test. In the case of dentistry, for example, contamination between patients is a serious concern. As explained in the Referenced Patent Documents, a barrier infection control implement may be utilized to present such contamination.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 7A, a preferably pliant, stretchy, transparent barrier 50 fully encases and covers tip portion 10 of instrument 1. As illustrated, barrier 50 preferably is pulled up the length of tip portion 10 and over neck portion 8, preferably utilizing tab portion 50A, such that hole 50B slips over protrusion 8A. Protrusion 8A preferably is an implement that is added to neck portion 8 (either affixed to neck portion 8 or fabricated such as with a plastic molding process as an integral part of neck 8) such that a user may pull barrier 50 over the tip and neck portions such that hole 50B secures barrier 50 to the probe tip. The user preferably pulls the barrier into position tab portion 50A of barrier 50 (tab portion 50A preferably is integrally formed as a part of barrier 50, but which could be a separate material welded to the material of barrier 50). The act of pulling the stretchy material of barrier 50 such that hole 50B is over protrusion 8A also serves to pull the material of barrier to be closely conforming to end 12 of tip portion 10. In accordance with the present invention, optical measurements are made through barrier 50, and it is desirable that barrier 50 preferably provide a thin, wrinkle-free covering over end 12. As previously explained, in accordance with certain preferred embodiments, measurements are made \u201cbelow the critical height.\u201d Thus, the material of barrier 50 is selected to have a thickness below (preferably much below) the lowest critical height of the various source/receiver combinations provided at end 12. It is further noted that the improved barrier described herein may desirably be utilized with the multi-spectrometer measurement technique described elsewhere herein, but such an improved barrier may also be utilized with the peaking measurement technique described in greater detail in the Referenced Patent Documents.",
        "FIG. 7A also illustrates an improved switch/barrier control combination that is used in preferred embodiments of the present invention. As previously described elsewhere herein and in the Referenced Patent Documents, a user may initiate a calibration or measurement process by activation of a switch. An improved switch 51 is illustrated in FIG. 7A. Switch 51 preferably consists of an elongated bar, which may be a integral part of the switch, or may be a cap implement positioned over a switch type switch (with the spring providing an opposing force to the user's movement to activate the switch). The elongated bar of switch 51 may have ends on the distal and proximate ends (i.e., nearest to and furthest from end 12 of tip portion 10), which, for example, may fit into an indentation formed into neck portion 8. What is important is that the switch that the user activates to initiate a measurement have an elongated form factor, so that the switch extends a length down neck portion 8, so as to accommodate a variety of hand sizes. Thus, a user with a smaller hand size may just as easily activate switch 51 (by pressing on a lower portion of switch 51) as a user with a larger hand size (by pressing on a higher portion of switch 51). Also importantly, barrier 50, when in position on the instrument and secured thereon (such as by hole 50B over protrusion 8A), extends so as to completely cover switch 51. Thus, barrier 50 not only serves to prevent contamination, but also serves to provide a moisture or other contaminant barrier to switch 51.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7B, another perspective of a preferred embodiment of barrier 50 and instrument 1 is provided. As illustrated, barrier 50 extends up and over tip portion 10 and neck portion 8 of instrument 1. As illustrated, hole 50B serves to secure barrier 50 by being positioned over protrusion 8A. Also as illustrated, elongated switch 51 is positioned under barrier 50, and will be activated through barrier 50 by depression of a user's (preferably) index finger.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 7C and 7D, other perspectives of a preferred embodiment of barrier 50 is illustrated. While other constructions are within the scope of the present invention, barrier 50 preferably consists of a unitary material, which contains a suitable combination of properties such as strength, tear-resistance, transparency, pliability, stretchiness, etc. In a preferred embodiment, barrier 50 comprises polyurethane, but also may consist of a type of rubber, latex, or other material. Barrier 50 preferably is packaged with substrate 51 as illustrated in FIG. 7D. Substrate 51 may consist of paper or other suitable material that may protect barrier 50 prior to use, and may serve to facilitate application of barrier 50 to the instrument. Much like paper backing for a bandaid or similar instrument, the user may spread the opening of the pouch of barrier 50 by pulling the paper (desirably, the paper mildly adheres to barrier 50 during such application). As the pouch opens, the user inserts the probe tip into the pouch, and, with a combination of pulling the material of the barrier up and moving the probe tip down, the materials of the barrier stretches up and over the probe tip and neck, preferably so that hole 50B and protrusion 8A serve to secure the barrier onto the instrument. As a part of this operation, substrate 51 tears away from the material of barrier 50, and substrate 51 may then be disposed of. What is important is that the material of barrier 50 be provided to the user in a manner to secure its shape and to facilitate application to the instrument. As barrier 50 is desirably disposable, so desirably is substrate 51, which is disposed off after serving its purposes as described herein.",
        "In preferred embodiments, an inner surface of the barrier 50 is relatively smooth or \u201csatinized\u201d in order to facilitate guiding the tip portion of the instrument into the barrier as described above, an outer surface of barrier 50 has a degree of tackiness or stickiness, particularly as compared to the inner surface, such that upon contact with the object under evaluation the tip portion mildly adheres to the surface of the object. With such an outer surface, measurement of objects such as teeth are facilitated, as the tip of the instrument may be directed to a desired spot of the object for evaluation, with the stickiness, or \u201cnon-slipperyness,\u201d of the outer surface of barrier 50 serving to prevent movement of the tip from the desired spot on the object.",
        "Preferably, barrier 50 is manufactured by cutting or otherwise forming the material to be of the desired shape, which may include punching or otherwise forming hole 50B. This preferably is performed on substrate 51, and thus the material of barrier 50 and substrate 51 desirably may be formed of the desired overall shape in a single step. Preferably, the size and shape of hole 50B corresponds to protrusion 8A in order to reliably secure barrier 50 onto the probe. The material of barrier 50, and preferably substrate 51, is then folded, preferably in an automated manner. It should be noted that the fold is asymmetric in order to form an extended tab portion 50A of barrier 50, which may be utilized to pull barrier 50 into proper position, such as previously described. In preferred embodiments, weld 50C is formed via an RF (or other radiant energy process) or thermal type process, and preferably through substrate 51. It should be noted that the weld of the material of barrier 50 does not extend the full length of the material, but extends so as to define an inner pouch of barrier 50, while providing a substantially complete seal in order to provide a suitable contamination/infection control implement. It also should be noted that end portion 50D of barrier 50 consists of a portion not having a seam across end 12 of tip portion 10. In this regard, the width of the material used to form barrier 50 has a suitable width such that, when welded to form the pouch, and when stretched into position, a relatively flat, wrinkle-free and seam-free covering is provided over end portion 12 of tip portion 10.",
        "Other aspects of preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described.",
        "FIG. 8 provides an overview of an exemplary cabled implementation of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Spectrometer/spectrophotometer or handpiece 1 (such as previously described) preferably rests in cradle 55 when not in operation. Cradle 55 preferably is secured to base unit 60 via arm 55A. On/off switch 58 preferably is utilized to turn on or off base unit 60, although in preferred embodiments, as a safety feature, base unit 60 automatically turns itself off as a function of time (with a conventional timer circuit or processor that keeps track of on or inactive time, etc.), or as a function of temperature, with a temperature sensor included in base unit 60. As in the illustrated embodiment a light source or lamp in provided in base unit 60, such implements serve to prevent the lamp from staying on for an indefinite period of time, and reduce the risks of thermal damage, fire or the like. Display 59 preferably is provided to display color measurement data, predicted shades or the like, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.",
        "In operation, a use preferably first applies barrier 50 (which may be considered an \u201cinfection control tip\u201d), which is achieved by picking up handpiece 1 from its cradle and applying barrier 50, such as previously described. An exemplary screen shot of display 59, which reminds the user to apply barrier 50, and calibrate the instrument with the barrier in position, is illustrated in FIG. 9. What is important is that the user be provided a reminder, and preferably interlock, so that the instrument cannot be operated without calibration, and preferably without calibration with the barrier properly secured to the instrument. In preferred embodiments the instrument is calibrated by being positioned in cradle 55 with barrier 50 in position, and then being rotated about the axis of arm 55A so as to come into contact with calibration block 56. Guide 57 is optionally provided to more reliably guide the tip of handpiece 1 so as to land in a center portion of calibration block 56 (calibrating near an edge of calibration block 56 is undesirable, and guide 57 is provided to reduce this possibility).",
        "Preferably, an in contrast to typically opaque calibration standards of conventional systems, calibration block 56 is a translucent or semi-transparent material, and preferably is chosen to have optical properties (such as color, translucency or the like) that is substantially in a middle portion of the range of optical properties for the particular materials that are to measured. For example, for a dental application, the optical properties of calibration block 56 preferably are an off-white shade and translucent, roughly in the middle of color and translucency values of normal human teeth. Having such a calibration block, rather than calibrating at an extreme of an optical range (such as pure white or pure black, etc.), has been determined to give more advantageous results. This has been determined to be particularly true for translucent materials such as dental objects. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that calibrating with a translucent material, for example, can help calibrate out effects of \u201cedge loss,\u201d which is understood to be a problem with conventional measurement techniques for translucent materials, etc.",
        "Also in accordance with the present invention, calibration block 56 (it should be noted that calibration and normalization in this context may be generally considered synonymous) used for calibration may be removable and cleanable, such as by autoclave cleaning. Preferably, calibration block 56 is sufficiently durable, an exemplary material being porcelain, so as to be wiped clean or autoclaved repeatedly, without substantial degradation of optical properties. In certain embodiments and operative environments, where degradation of the optical properties of the calibration block may be of concern, a two step calibration/normalization process is applied. At a first point in time, a reference standard of known optical properties is measured. This \u201cgold standard\u201d, which may be provided with the known optical properties (which may be loaded into the instrument and stored), is measured with the instrument (the \u201cgold standard\u201d is then secured and stored in a manner to minimize any degradation of optical properties). Calibration block 56 is then measured. Based on the gold standard optical properties data (known/entered and measured), and based on the measurement of the calibration block, a first set of calibration/normalization data is created. During normal operation, preferably prior to each use of the instrument, the calibration block is measured again, and based on a comparison with the first set of calibration/normalization data, a second set of calibration/normalization data is created. This second set of calibration/normalization data is preferably used to adjust the data resulting from normal operational measurements. Periodically, such as after a period of months, the gold standard may be measured again, and an updated first set of calibration/normalization data is created, etc. With such a process, changing optical properties of the calibration block, which would not be expected to change rapidly, and also be calibrated out.",
        "It also should be noted that, in accordance with the present invention, a single calibration measurement may be used even though different types of materials may need to be measured. As previously described, for example, a dental professional may desire to measure a natural tooth and a restorative material tooth on the same patient. In accordance with the present invention, a calibration measurement is performed, which is independent of the type of material being measured. Thus, even though different shade prediction algorithms or the like may be utilized to carry out the shade prediction process (as previously described), a single calibration measurement may be conducted prior to measuring both types of materials. This is important in that, after measuring either the tooth or restorative material in the patient's mouth, a contamination risk is presented if the calibration block needs to be touched again prior to measuring the second material. In accordance with the present invention, only one calibration measurement needs to be made for measuring both types of materials.",
        "Returning again to the calibration process as part of the normal operation of the instrument, in preferred embodiments a switch internal preferably internal to base unit 60 is activated as handpiece 1 in cradle 55 is rotated in position for the tip to be positioned in the middle of calibration block 56. In such embodiments, the instrument automatically knows that it is to enter calibration mode, and thus take a calibration measurement and generate calibration data accordingly. In alternative embodiments, calibration mode is entered upon first turning on the system or before taking a measurement, and the user must start the calibration measurement by depressing the switch (such as switch 51 of FIG. 7A) on handpiece 1. This may be a dual switch mode, where a first switch activated by the rotation of cradle 55 about the axis of arm 55A indicates to the system that it is calibration mode, while the second switch (e.g., switch 51) is activated by the user when he/she has observed that the tip of the probe is positioned in a center portion of calibration block 56. In either case, in preferred embodiments, the instrument will not operate without calibration measurement having first been performed.",
        "It also should be noted that such a calibration measurement serves to normalize the instrument and calibrate out effects due to lamp drift, aging of fiber optics, optical couplers, filters and other optical components and the like, as well as to normalize the electronics and produce a \u201cblack level,\u201d such as described in the Referenced Patent Documents.",
        "It also should be noted from FIG. 9A that display 59 preferably is covered by a touchscreen so that \u201csoft switches\u201d may be provided, which are activated by the user touching the touchscreen over an icon or displayed button. In FIG. 9A, the presets button may be activated in order for the user to put the instrument into a mode whereby system settings (such as brightness, volume, data display options, etc.) may be changed.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 9B to 9G, additional exemplary screen displays will be described. FIG. 9B illustrates a screen display by which the user may inform the system of the type of material being measured. As previously described, in certain embodiments the operation of the system (e.g., the manner of making shade predictions, etc.), may be optimized depending on the type of material. This is accomplished by touching the touchscreen at the appropriate portion.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 9C, the results of a data measurement may be conveniently displayed on display 59 as illustrated. In preferred embodiments, the output, particularly for the dental application, consists primarily of a display of one or multiple shade guide values (examples of the well-known Vita Classical and 3D Master shade guides are illustrated in FIG. 9C). In such embodiments, whether one two (or other number) of closest match color or shade values is output is a user selectable feature, such as via the preset button discussed in connection with FIG. 9A). In preferred embodiments, the type of material being measured also is displayed, such as is illustrated. What is important from FIG. 9 is that, although a very sophisticated set of measurements were made as part of the process, the output may be a simple shade or color value (or values), in a form that is readily understand or useable by the particular user. For example, the display could display Pantone colors or shades, paint formulations, pass/fail results, etc.",
        "Also in preferred embodiments, while a standard display may show an output of reduced form (such as the simple color or shade value of FIG. 9C), additional color or spectral information also may be provided. For example, a spectral plot icon is displayed (such as illustrated at the lower left corner of the screen shot of FIG. 9C), and upon touching of the icon a reflectance spectrum of the object that was measured is displayed (see, e.g., FIG. 9F for such a spectral reflectance plot, which plots relative energy as a function of wavelength). In another example, a user may touch the Vita Classical shade guide value of FIG. 9C, and the display then presents additional information, such as the deviation from the \u201ctrue\u201d color of the displayed closest match. In another example, the Vita 3D Master shade guide value of FIG. 9C may be touched, and the user then additional information regarding the measurement result relative to value, chroma and hue in the Vita 3D Master system (see, e.g., FIG. 9E). In still another example, an \u201cL a b\u201d icon may be displayed (such as via the icon shown at the lower right corner of FIG. 9C), and upon touching an L a b plot may be displayed (see, e.g., FIG. 9G). What is important, and what may be appreciated from the foregoing, is that the results of the color measurement/spectral analysis process be presented in a form desired by the particular user, with a point and touch operation enabling particular users to \u201cget behind the data\u201d and be presented with more color/spectral data, and more color/spectral data of the form that is most desired by the particular user, etc.",
        "In certain alternative embodiments, whether the output is a single or multiple shade guide values or colors (such as the multiple shade guide system values illustrated in FIG. 9C), the closest match may be a value in one system or the other. In certain embodiments, a confidence barrier is displayed before the displayed shade guide or color values, as illustrated in FIG. 9C. In the particular illustrated example, the closest match of the 3D Master system was determined by the instrument to be a closer match than the closest match in the Vita Classical system, which is evidenced by the larger confidence bar below the displayed Vita 3D Master value. While the confidence bar display is exemplary, what is important is that, in such embodiments, a visual indicator be provided so that the operator may determine some degree of closeness of the match. With a low confidence indicator, for example, the user may then decide to get additional color data (such as previously described) to supplement the closest match value that is displayed, etc.",
        "As described in the Referenced Patent Documents, data from spectrometer/spectrometer may be combined with an image from a camera. This can particularly be true in the context of dentistry, where often a shade assessment is a precursor to getting a restorative tooth produced. While the shade information is of particular importance to producing an aesthetically pleasing restoration, supplementing the shade information via a camera image also be useful to the dental professional or technician or other person involved in the process. With the present invention, a single or multiple areas of a tooth may be measured. Via the touch screen the user, for example, may indicated to the instrument that one or multiple areas are to be measured. Thereafter, the user may then measure the one or multiple areas of the tooth. With a camera (such as a standard digital camera), an image of the tooth or teeth may be captured. Data captured with the image may be imported into a computing system that also receives the image from the digital camera. The measured shade data may then be superimposed onto the image from the digital camera, such as is illustrated in FIG. 10. Also as illustrated in FIG. 10, two images may be combined. One image may contain multiple shade values (or single shade values), which shows at which spot on the tooth (or teeth) the measurements (or measurement) were/was made. A second image may contain no superimposed shade data. With such a multi-image, superimposed display, the person preparing the restorative tooth, for example, may see an image with real shade/color data superimposed on the area of the tooth from which the data was collected, yet may also see an image with no superimposed shade or color data.",
        "In other embodiments, the shade or color data may be selectively superimposed or not superimposed (which may be performed with only a single image of the camera displayed, and which may be activated by mouse/click operation, pull down menus or the like). In yet other embodiments, a single or multi-image is displayed, with shade data superimposed, and with additional color or spectral data displayed (such as is illustrated in the displays of FIGS. 9E-9G) upon further command. In one example, the user may click the area of the tooth and a superimposed shade value is displayed; in a subsequent click of the shade value, additional color or spectral data is displayed. In such embodiments, for example, subsequent clicks scroll through the various shade/color/spectral data options so that the user may display the type and level of information that he/she may desire in the particular situation.",
        "As described in the Referenced Patent Documents and the foregoing description herein, various apparatus, methods and methodologies for measuring the optical properties of teeth and other materials may be provided in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The optical properties can consist of reflectance color, translucency, gloss, pearlescence and other optical parameters of materials that affect the manner in which incident light is reflected from or returned from a material to a light receiver or human eye. As a general matter, all of the optical properties of a material are utilized by the human eye and brain to distinguish a material from other materials and are used to identify or otherwise classify a material.",
        "One principal object of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention is to quantify the optical properties of, or to shade match, teeth. Thus, for purposes of convenience the following description focuses on shade matching of teeth or other dental object. It should be understood, however, that such embodiments of the present invention also may be applied to other materials, including, but not limited to, paint, ink, precious gems, glass materials, plastic materials, construction materials, etc.",
        "Traditionally, teeth are shade matched by visually comparing a tooth to a set of \u201cshade guides\u201d. The shade guides typically are constructed to visually appear the same as teeth and are constructed of materials that tend to simulate the appearance of teeth. There are a number of commercially available shade guides today, and the shade guides typically relate to or can be referenced to a recipe for producing a dental restoration. Typical examples of commercially available shade guides are the Vita Classical (16 shades), Vita 3D-master\u00ae (29 shades), Bioform\u00ae Truebyte\u00ae Color Ordered\u2122 Shade Guide (24 Shades), Ivoclar-Vivadent Chromascop (20 Shades). As a general matter, one determines the preferred \u201ccolor\u201d of a restoration by holding a shade guide sample next to a neighboring tooth and visually comparing and choosing the shade guide that most closely matches the tooth to be matched.",
        "Difficulties with traditional shade matching have been discussed in the literature. One difficulty is that of controlling the ambient light, which affects the color of both the shade guide and the tooth (often in a non-linear manner). Another issue is the variation in color perception of humans. Another issue is eye fatigue. Yet another issue is the variation in quality control of shade guides or the age or color deterioration of shade guides.",
        "In accordance with certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, methods and systems are provided to match the optical properties of teeth (or other object) and to choose a corresponding shade guide match, in which optical properties of the tooth are measured with a spectrophotometer (or other color measuring implement) and match the optical measurements with the optical measurements of shade guides or restorative dental materials. One such instrument that measures the optical properties of teeth is known as the Vita Easyshade\u00ae. Aspects of the operation of such an instrument have been disclosed in the Referenced Patent Documents and elsewhere herein.",
        "Traditionally, shade matching of optical measurements is made based upon \u0394E, where:\n\n\u0394E=\u221a{square root over ({\u0394L2)}+\u0394a2+\u0394b2}\n\nand where the parameters L, a, b are the tristimulus CIE L*a*b readings of a color measurement. The CIE L*a*b parameters typically are calculated for an optical measurement and a \u0394E typically is calculated for each shade. The best shade match typically is determined to be the shade with the lowest \u0394E.",
        "There are difficulties with such \u0394E shade matching, particularly for materials such as teeth which have low chromacity and small variations in hue (the polar coordinate angle of a chromacity a, b plot). The \u0394E calculation in general gives equal weight to value and chromacity variation. In certain cases, a variation in L of, for example, 3 units may be difficult to detect while a variation of 3 units of a, b may be quite distinguishable, and vice-versa. \u0394E shade matching also tends not to distinguish whether colors are more or less saturated from one another. Often when attempting to match the shade of a tooth to a shade system such as the Vita Classical shade system, several shades will be nearly equally spaced from the measurement, resulting in more than one \u201cbest shade match\u201d. \u0394E shade matching typically cannot resolve the conflicts under such circumstances.",
        "In accordance with such embodiments of the present invention, an optical measurement is made of a tooth or other dental (or other) object. Such a measurement may be made as described elsewhere herein and/or in the Referenced Patent Documents, but the presently described embodiments are not limited to such particular measurement techniques. The resulting measurement of the tooth is converted to a plurality of color parameters.

As an example, the Vita 3D-Master system is designed to report a Value (L), Chroma and hue. There are six levels of value ranging from the highest (0) to the lowest (5). Chroma ranges from 1 to 3 and hue is reported as L, M and R. It is possible to prepare ceramic restorations whose value and chroma are interpolated by 0.5 (\u00bd of a value or chroma group) by mixing 50% -50% proportions of materials from bottles of each shade group.",
        "In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, interpolation of Vita 3D Master shades (or other shade system shades) is done by first determining the best shade match, preferably as described elsewhere herein. Once a preferred shade match is selected, preferably the value and chroma parameters of the measurement are compared to the preferred parameters of the shade and are also compared to the preferred parameters of the neighboring 3D-Master shades. If the value parameter is greater than the value parameter of the preferred shade, then it is also compared to a value parameter calculated from the next higher value shade with the same or comparable chroma and hue. Thus, if 3M2 is the selected shade and the measured value is determined to be higher than the preferred value for 3M2, then it is compared to the average of (or mid point of) the values of 3M2 and 4M2. If the measured value is greater than the mid point value, then the reported value is increased by 0.5, or the value will be 3.5.",
        "A similar calculation preferably is made for chroma. The measured chroma preferably is compared with the preferred chroma of the selected shade and the chroma is increased or decreased by 0.5 if the measured chroma is greater than or less than the chroma average of the neighbor shades. In other shade systems where hue may be quantified numerically, a similar calculation preferably is made for hue.",

Preferably, the user indicates that he/she desires to make a plurality of measurements by user input to the system, and the system operates in a mode in order for multiple measurements to be made. In other embodiments, the system enters into a multiple measurement mode by default, factory setting or the like.",
        "In accordance with such embodiments, the system via the display device provides a graphic indication that multiple areas are to be measured. Thereafter, the user makes a measurement of a predetermined area, and preferably the unit then displays the predicted best match of the shade of the measured area. The user may then proceed to measure other areas, with each measurement preferably being followed by a display of the closest match to a shade in a shade guide type of system.",
        "FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary screen display for a dental application/embodiment. In the illustrated example, the system measures three areas of the tooth, from top to bottom; in alternative embodiments, there may be a different number of areas, and they could be a arranged in a different manner, such as a grid pattern, for example, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. Continuing with the illustrated example, in accordance with preferred embodiments, the system compares the data from the measurement to a plurality of shade guide systems; in the illustrated example, utilization of two shade guide systems is illustrated, the Vita Classical system, and the Vita 3D Master system. In accordance with such embodiments, after the first/top area is measured, the system confirms whether the measurement is valid, and if so predicts and displays the best/closest match for the two shade systems. In FIG. 12, this is illustrated by the top most A2 (Vita Classical) value displayed on the left of the screen display, and the top most 1M2 (Vita 3D Master) value displayed on the right of the screen display. In preferred embodiments, such display is accompanied by a visual indicator of which of the best/closest matches of the multiple shade guide systems is the best match. In the illustrated example of FIG. 12, for the first/upper area measurement, the closest Vita Classical shade was determined to be an A2, and the closest Vita 3D Master shade was determined to be a 1M2. The arrow in the upper area of tooth illustration pointing towards the 3D Master shade guide value 1M2 provides an indication that, in this example, the 1M2 shade is predicted to be a closer match to the measured area as compared to the closest Vita Classical shade, which is A1. As a result, a user or practitioner (dental lab technician or otherwise), can be presented visually with multiple shade guide values of the closest matches to the measured area in a concurrent manner, while also being presented visually with an indication of which of the multiple shade guide system values represented the best match.",
        "Continuing with the example of FIG. 12, a second measurement of the tooth, in this example, the central area, resulted in a best/closest match prediction of A1 in the Vita Classical system, and a best/closest match prediction of 0.5M2 in the Vita 3D Master system. In the illustrated example, again the 3D Master value of 0.5M2 was predicted to be a closer match than the closest Vita Classical system value of A1 (again, this is exemplary only, and for other exemplary measurements a Vita Classical shade could have been the closest match). The process may then continue for the third area of the tooth to be measured, in this example the bottom area, with the closest match values being displayed after the third measurement. In the exemplary screen display of FIG. 12, however, the third area has not yet been measured, and the displayed dot or circular area presents a visual indication of the area to be next measured.",
        "What is important from the foregoing is that multiple areas of a tooth or other dental object (or yet other object) may be measured, with a prediction of the closest match in multiple shade guide or color systems being concurrently made, and preferably with an indication of which of the shade guide or color system values represented the closest match for each of the particular measurements. It will be understood, however, that such a multiple shade guide/color system technique could be applied for a single measurement, or for plural measurements of a different number or positional arrangement of measured areas, etc.",
        "While not expressly illustrated in FIG. 12, if it is desired to re-measure a particular area, in accordance with preferred embodiments the particular area on the displayed tooth may be touched, with the exemplary arrow being replaced by the exemplary dot or circular area (or other visual indicator of the particular area to be re-measured). This may thereafter be followed by a re-measure of the particular area, which is preferably followed by a display of the closest matches and best match, such as previously described. In addition, as described elsewhere herein and in the Referenced Patent Documents, additional color or other optical characteristics data could be displayed, which could be achieved by touching the touchscreen, for example, on the displayed shade data, which may then be followed by presentation of additional color information, etc.",
        "In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, a tooth or other dental object (or other object) may be measured (in a single or multiple areas), with the resulting shade guide value or color data used to fabricate another object of similar optical characteristics. In the field of dentistry, this typically is referred to as a \u201cdental restoration.\u201d While the present invention is not limited to dental restorations, the following description of certain alternative embodiments will be made with respect to a dental restoration.",
        "One way to check the quality of a dental restoration is to simply measure the dental restoration with an instrument, which may be the same or different instrument that measured the original tooth to which the restoration is to be a match. For example, if the original tooth that was measured was a 3M2, a restoration that was produced and intended to match this original tooth could be measured; if the closest match for the restoration was a 3M2, then it could be considered a good match; if the closest shade for the restoration was not a 3M2, then it could be considered not a good match.",
        "One problem with this approach is that it could result in false reporting of \u201cnot a good match,\u201d for example. In many shade guide systems, the particular shades may be close together when considered in view of the shade perception abilities of a typical human observer. In accordance with the present invention, even though a restoration may be measured and have a different closest shade guide value as compared with the originally measured tooth, it may still be a very acceptable match to the original tooth to a human observer, and may be recognized or predicted as such by the system.",
        "In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a user such as a dental technician or doctor may extra-orally verify that a shade restoration is an acceptable match to the prescribed or intended intra-oral shade. Referring to FIGS. 13A-13D, exemplary screen displays for such a process will now be described.",
        "To verify a restoration, a user may select \u201cRestoration\u201d such as via touchscreen input, as illustrated in FIG. 13A. Rather than simply have the user measure the restoration, however, the system, as illustrated in FIG. 13A, prompts the user to input the shade that the restoration is intended to match. Thus, in accordance with such embodiments of the present invention, a first step in verifying a restoration is selecting the prescribed or intended shade.",
        "In certain embodiments, touching the \u201cShade\u201d selection area of the screen of FIG. 13A causes the display of FIG. 13B to be displayed. As will be appreciated, the screen of FIG. 13B provides for the input of exemplary shade guide values from the Vita 3D Master system, but other shade guide systems similarly could be utilized; for example, with the illustrative screen provided in FIG. 13B, a box is provided labeled \u201cClassical,\u201d activation of which would enable a user to input a shade via the Vita Classical shade system. It should be understood, however, that other shade systems could be utilized, and other implements for selecting a particular shade guide system also could be utilized.",
        "The screen illustrated in FIG. 13B allows the selection of a particular prescribed or targeted Vita 3D Master shade, preferably including interpolated shades, as illustrated (it being understood, for example, that intermediate shades could be achieved by mixing Vita 3D Master porcelains, such as in a manner known in the art). Preferably, this particular shade guide value selection is achieved by touching the screen and moving a finger either to a particular Vita 3D Master shade or over points midway between two or four shades in the manner illustrated. In the exemplary illustrated screen of FIG. 13B, a user may first touch one of the three boxes in the top left of the screen to select a particular hue (L, M or R). In the illustrated example, the M hue has been selected. Then the user may touch the screen at a point that corresponds to the target interpolated 3D Master shade guide value. Removing the finger from the touch screen preferably will select that shade. In the illustrated example, the selected position is midway between value groups 2 and 3, yielding a 2.5 value group. Similarly, the selected chroma position is midway between 2 and 3, yielding a 2.5 chroma.",
        "What is important is that the user be provided an intuitive, easy manner to input a shade guide value which represents the closest shade guide value of the original measurement (i.e., the prescribed or target shade for the restoration); in accordance with the present invention, however, it has been determined that, in environments such as dental operators, the graphical touch screen method provides substantial benefits, as the dentist or other user may be wearing gloves, etc., and may find it undesirable to manipulate typical computer data entry devices, such as a keyboard or mouse, etc. In alternative embodiments, however, the prescribed or target shade guide value may be made available to the system via other user input, may have conveyed to the system electronically via a data connection, or may have been stored in the system from the original measurement (in the later alternatives, color data in addition to or in lieu of a shade guide value may be conveyed to or stored in the system for purposes of assessing the restoration acceptability, etc.).",
        "Assuming that a Vita 3D Master shade has been entered as the prescribed shade for the restoration, the screen illustrated in FIG. 13C preferably is displayed. This screen provides visual feedback to the user of the prescribed or intended shade of the restoration, while also prompting the user to measure the restoration. After measurement of the restoration, a screen such as illustrated in FIG. 13D preferably is displayed. In the illustrated example, the horizontal lines under \u201cValue\u201d, \u201cChroma\u201d and \u201cHue\u201d preferably indicate the nominal values for the target shade. The exemplary illustrated screen indicates that the restoration is a good match to the prescribed shade (2.5M2.5), with the Value (or lightness) of the restoration being slightly lighter than the target shade, the Chroma (the saturation of the color) of the restoration being slightly lower than the target shade, and the Hue (color) of the restoration very closely matching the target shade. Touching the shade match quality predictor button, which is illustrated as \u201cGood\u201d in the example of FIG. 13D, in certain embodiments preferably causes the display of additional information on the accuracy of the measurement in color space (exemplary color space screens have been previously described herein).",
        "While the example of FIG. 13D predicted that the restoration would be a good match to a 2.5M2.5, in accordance with the present invention other predictive labels may have displayed, depending on the closeness of the measured shade of the restoration as compared with the prescribed or target shade. In one exemplary embodiment, the predicted shade match quality could have been evaluated as, for example, Good, Fair, or Adjust. In accordance with such embodiments:\n\n    1. \u201cGood\u201d means that an expert at shade matching may see little or no difference between the restoration and the target shade to which it has been verified.\n    2. \u201cFair\u201d means that an Expert at shade matching may see a noticeable but acceptable difference between the restoration and the target shade to which it has been verified. For an anterior restoration, this may not be acceptable.\n    3. \u201cAdjust\u201d means that an Expert at shade matching may see a noticeable difference between the restoration and the target shade to which it has been verified, and that the restoration should be adjusted to be an acceptable shade match.",
        "What will be appreciated from the foregoing is that, in accordance with such embodiments, rather than having a user make a judgment as to the visual acceptability of a restoration based on whether a measurement of the restoration results in precisely the same shade guide value as the original measurement of the tooth, the present invention instead assists the user by making a prediction as to acceptability of the restoration based on an input of the prescribed or target shade guide value (or data from the original color measurement, which was conveyed to or stored in the system, etc.). Such a prediction of visual acceptability could be implemented, for example, by an algorithm similar to that previously described with respect to shade prediction, with the label \u201cpoor\u201d being changed to \u201cadjust,\u201d etc. What is important is that, in accordance with such embodiments, the system attempt to predict visual acceptability, as opposed to simply outputting a shade guide value of the restoration, which may result in, for example, visually acceptable restorations being rejected as a result in a difference between a reported shade guide value for the restoration (as compared to the original tooth, etc.).",
        "Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific preferred and other embodiments, it is evident that many substitutions, alternatives and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, the invention is intended to embrace all of the alternatives and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, it should be understood that, in accordance with the various alternative embodiments described herein, various systems, and uses and methods based on such systems, may be obtained. The various refinements and alternative and additional features also described may be combined to provide additional advantageous combinations and the like in accordance with the present invention. Also as will be understood by those skilled in the art based on the foregoing description, various aspects of the preferred embodiments may be used in various subcombinations to achieve at least certain of the benefits and attributes described herein, and such subcombinations also are within the scope of the present invention. All such refinements, enhancements and further uses of the present invention are within the scope of the present invention."
