        "Filtering Method Overview",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a method of filtering data 400, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 405, the user enters a filtering request (e.g., a request to navigate the data\u2014translated as a request to use the data as a delimiter, or as a constraint object). In step 410, a start table and an end table in the database are determined. The start table is determined by the module the user was in when the user started navigating, and the end table is determined by the requested module (where the user wants to end navigating). In step 415, it is determined if the start table and the end table are closely related. The start table and end table are closely related if there exists a direct relationship in the data model. If the start table and the end table are not closely related, in step 420, it is determined if the start and end tables are loosely related. The start table and end table are loosely related if there is no direct relationship in the data model, but there is an indirect relationship (i.e., there is a route in the data model from one table to another table via an interim table or tables). In one embodiment, the maximum number of interim tables is set to two, or another function exists to related items from one table to another (e.g., the function is strictly case oriented, or specific for certain tables and built using external knowledge). If the start table and the end table are not loosely related, in step 421, the filtering algorithm cannot be used because there is no utilizable information. In this case, all items from the end table are displayed and the process ends. If the start table and the end tables are loosely related, in step 422, a factor is set to \u201clow value\u201d. The process then moves to step 430.",
        "If the start and end tables are closely related, in step 425, the factor is set to \u201chigh value\u201d. The process then moves to step 430, where it is determined if the end table contains any unprocessed items. This algorithm processes all items, one after another, in a sequential manner (i.e., one item at a time, one after another). If the end table does not contain any unprocessed items, data from the end table that meet the filtering criteria are displayed in step 435.",
        "If the end table does contain any unprocessed items, in step 440, the next item is taken from the end table. In step 445, the relations data and items from the start table are used to adjust the degree of how the item meets the filtering criteria, multiplied by a factor. In this process, the overall degree of item compatibility is calculated. The degree is defined as a sum of particular compatibilities with particular tables (e.g., filtering criteria). Each particular compatibility is computer first. Then the computer compatibility is multiplied by a factor, so the proximity of relation (e.g., its importance) is taken into account. In step 455, it is determined if there is any preclusive conditions that are met. For each table, a defined set of preclusive conditions is set. If any of these conditions is met, the filtering algorithm knows that the considered item is not acceptable as a compatible result. The preclusive conditions are defined strictly for specific tables and typically uses specific data in items and specific external information (e.g., from a suer's profile). If there are any preclusive conditions that are met, in step 460, the item is not considered to meet the filtering criteria. The process then returns to step 430.",
        "If there are not any preclusive conditions that are met, in step 465, it is determined if the degree is higher than the specified threshold. A specific threshold value is set for a particular solution. The threshold value is determined experimentally, in some cases. If the value is too high, few items are considered to be compatible. If the value is too low, too many items are considered to be compatible. If yes, in step 470, item is considered to meet the filtering criteria, and the process returns to step 430. If no, in step 475, it is determined if there is a table deeper in the history that has not been processed. The history contains a list of tables that were used during navigation in the past. This program determines a level of compatibility for each item in the end table for each table in the history. Tables in the history are stored in an array and are taken one after another If there is not a deeper table in the history, in step 460, the item is not considered to meet the filtering criteria, and the process returns to step 430. If there is a deeper table in the history, in step 480, this table is designated as the new start table, the factor is decreased in step 485, and the process returns to step 415.",
        "Additional Features",
        "Adaptive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Rather than using a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d GUI, the adaptive GUI personalizes the GUI's \u201clook and feel\u201d, using the user's characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and maturity) to maximize the user's experience. For example, a GUI for adolescent females may be chosen that displays videos of women in the workplace.",
        "The adaptive GUI adapts to the user's profile in at least two ways: it optimizes the layout of the GUI for optional user experience in performing tasks, and it optimizes the function of the GUI.",
        "To optimize the layout of the GUI elements that are identified as profile-relevant by the personal agent factor (PAF), a layout appropriateness (LA) method is used. The LA method computes the layout appropriateness of an interface by assigning frequencies and costs to task descriptions (i.e., sequences of user transitions between GUI elements) involved in performing specific tasks with the interface. The costs are derived from the distance a user must travel between GUI elements and also to an index of difficulty (e.g., Fitts Index of Difficulty).",
        "The LA method enables the in-situ generation of a user-tailored, user-optimal layout, until the system again recognizes an off-tolerance user profile change. User profile information (e.g., for user behavior during application use, as captured by the assessment manager; from assessment scores; or from direct user input), if within the norm, will add no changes to the functionality of the base GUI components, and thus the GUI display. However, new user profile elements (e.g., use behavior), once outside the set norm references, will effect functional changes to the base GUI components, and potential layout changes to GUI display.",
        "In optimizing the adaptive GUI function, to better provide the user with tailored resources, the present invention uses a personal agent framework (PAF). The PAF coordinates numerous user profile files. Thus, the user's application user behavior is evaluated continuously during interaction with the application, and the user's profile could change accordingly.",
        "Optimizing the function takes place by linking GUI objects to user profile elements using the PAF. The PAF links the GUI elements with the dynamic repository of user profiles. The PAF also stores objects in a multimedia solution database. After the multimedia solution database has been populated via pilot test and continuous user data capture, PAF uses its case-based learning module to improve and speed up the rate at which it generates user profile-GUI element combinations by matching the profile of the new user with those for which combinations exist in the solution repository. A PAF profile manager acquires and stores user profiles (e.g., user-input personal data, interest topics, assessment results, user habits) and manages user interest hierarchy.",
        "The adaptive GUI can be used for, for example, adaptive learning products, involving intelligent tutoring, self-paced, self-directed education, computer based educational and career assessment tools, and adult learning tools and products.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates a method of using the adaptive graphical user interface 500, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 505, output results from an advanced self-concept assessment instrument (or multimedia questionnaire), as well as results from other appropriate assessment instruments are fed into an assessment manager in step 510. In step 510, the assessment manager serves to organize the assessment results and user behavior parameters into profile elements. In step 515, the profile elements for the user are then categorized and classified into norm-referenced user profiles, and stored into a \u201cuser profiles\u201d database. In step 520, a comparison of a current user profile is made with the norm. In step 525, if the profile is within the norm, the base GUI components are activated, and if already activated previously, then the GUI display remains as is in step 550 and there is no change to the GUI. If the user profile is outside of the norm, step 530 activates the personal agent factor (PAF). The PAF innovation serves two key purposes: first, it will use a knowledge base of user profiles and AI techniques to mine, organize and report useful, individualized information or solutions back to the user. Secondly, the PAF will assign GUI component parameter values to user profile elements, thus providing the basis for changes to base GUI components. In step 535, those changes are implemented in the base GUI components. Step 540 determines whether the changes to the function of the base GUI components have resulted in changes to the frequencies of key tasks of the application. If so, then a new GUI layout is generated in step 545 and displayed in step 550, and if not, the GUI remains the same in step 550, with no changes to the current GUI setting.",
        "The adaptive GUI continuously monitors and captures user behavior during application use, and continuously compares that application use behavior to stored values of the norm. In step 555, if user behavior is within the norm, there is no change to the nominal base GUI components of step 525, and the display remains the same in step 550. If user behavior is outside of norm however, that information is passed to the assessment manager step in 510 for processing and subsequent generation of new user profile elements.",
        "Assessment Combinator. The objectives of the assessment combinator are two-fold: (1) Create relevant combinations of assessment items across assessment batteries (i.e., new assessment scales obtained by combining question items from different assessment instruments) and (2) Assign inferences on combination results to choice options. The assessment combinator will thus be an efficient match-enabler for integrated education-career options by providing a searchable \u201clibrary\u201d of new combinator result-to-choice option assignments. The assessment combinator will resolve the issue of the systematic assignment of new cross-instrument measures to attributes, and the systematic assignment of such attributes to choice options. If successful, the value-added here will be the generation of a large number of additional cross-instrument sub-scales, with a minimal number of their associated measures able to point users to choice options that existing instruments are currently inherently unable to do. For example, in the case of two conventional instruments (or questionnaires) A and B, each with three assessment components (each requiring a \u201cYes\u201d/\u201cNo\u201d response), the maximum number of intra-instrument sub-scales from each instrument would be {3C1+3C2+3C3}, or seven, for a total of fourteen (14) sub-scales from both instruments. However, the maximum additional number of component combinations from both instruments, to create new possible cross-instrument sub-scales would then be the square of {3C1+3C2+3C3}, or forty-nine (49) sub-scales, for a sub-scale total of 63.",
        "The successful use of measures from some of the new sub-scales as new predictive decision pointers will be a significant extension of the state-of-the-art. Such a development will open up new possibilities for decision support, enhance the efficiency and utility of existing decision tools, and maximize the usefulness to the user of user-supplied assessment information.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates a method of using an assessment combinator 600, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 605, at least one question from instrument #A is entered. In step 610, at least one question from instrument #B is entered. Instrument #A and instrument #B are, for example, questionnaires related to preferences, skills, abilities, temperment, self-concept, decision-making ability, etc. The questionnaires can be on paper or computerized. An example of a question from instrument #A is \u201cDo you like working in a team?\u201d. An example of a question from instrument #B is \u201cDo you like math?\u201d. In step 615, at least one answer from instrument #A and at least one answer from instrument #B are combined. In step 620, it is determined if the #A and #B combination translates into at least one user attribute by searching a database of user attributes to see if there is a match. In this example, if a person likes working on a team and likes math, a user attribute can be, for example, that the person is a technical team player. If not, in step 625, the #A and #B combination is discarded. If yes, the #A and #B combination is assigned to the at least one user attribute in the database of user attributes. Thus, in this example, the combination is assigned a user attribute of a technical team player. In step 635, it is determined if the user attribute combination translates to a decision option. Thus, in the example, the choice would be an engineer. If not, in step 625, the user attribute combination is discarded. If yes, in step 650, the user attribute combination is assigned to the at least one decision option.",

The present invention provides a self-concept assessor that captures direct user feedback that is not masked. The present invention does not require substantial verbal skills, inherently reminds a user of his/her own perceptions, and requires a low \u201csocial desirability\u201d response.

It uses a criterion-referenced approach, where a user's self-concept beliefs are assessed repeatedly in reference to an external criterion of accuracy, built around video clips, rather than an approach that compares a user's response against a set of norms.

Stage III dynamically creates new objects to obtain \u201ceducation-career-user profile objects\u201d. These integrated objects are then instantly available to the front-end as display-ready information, improving query efficiency and accuracy.
