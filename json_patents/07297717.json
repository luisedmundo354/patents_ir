    "description": [
        "This invention relates to an oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic which can include a large amount of oily components, has high transparency and gives an emulsion system stable within a broad temperature range.",
        "In order to include an oily component transparently in an emulsion cosmetics, there is a method in which the oily component is solubilized in micelles formed by a surface active agent. However, since the amount of the oily component to be solubilized is extremely small, its effects in sufficiently exerting functions of the oily component and improving touch to the skin are not satisfactory.",
        "Also known are micro-emulsion methods which use surface chemical properties of surface active agents, such as liquid crystal emulsification, D-phase emulsification and phase inversion emulsification, but these methods also have a limitation regarding the amount of oily component which can be involved transparently (JP-A-63-126542; the term \u201cJP-A\u201d as used herein means an \u201cunexamined published Japanese patent application\u201d). They also have other limitations, e.g. the kinds of surface active agents are limited because the surface chemical properties thereof are spoiled in some cases depending on the kinds of an oily component to be jointly used.",
        "On the other hand, a high pressure emulsification method is known in which a refined emulsion having an average emulsion particle size of 0.2 \u03bcm or less is obtained by making use of a high pressure emulsifier (e.g., JP-A-63-126543, JP-A-4-48925).",
        "The refined emulsion obtained by high pressure emulsification method generally has a low viscosity of between 10 and 100 mPa\u00b7s, so that its use is limited. Though a gelatinous emulsion which has relatively high viscosity can be applied to various cosmetics such as moisturizing lotion, body lotion and hair treatment, the refined emulsion cannot be used as such due to its low viscosity, so that there is a method to increase the viscosity using a water-soluble thickener. However, a product thickened with a thickener frequently becomes sticky just as it dries after its application, so that there is a great demand for an emulsion cosmetic which is transparent and high in viscosity and has good feeling in use.",
        "The object of the invention is to provide an oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic which can include stably with a large amount of oily components within a broad temperature range, can efficiently exert effects of the touch such as moist feel and oiliness and of the oily components and also has high transparency.",
        "The present inventors have found that an emulsion cosmetic in which a large amount of oily component is dispersed stably within a broad temperature range can be obtained by emulsifying a hydrophilic surface active agent, an oily component and water using an emulsifier having strong shearing force.",
        "The inventors have found also that the emulsion cosmetic which also has a characteristic of high viscosity can be obtained by emulsifying an oily component containing solid fatty material and water together with a hydrophilic surface active agent using an emulsifier having strong shearing force.",
        "The invention is to provide an oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic which comprises (A) a hydrophilic surface active agent, (B) an oily component and (C) water, wherein weight ratio of the component (B) is 10 or more based on 1 of the component (A).",

        "The nonionic surface active agent preferably has an HLB value of 9 or more, more preferably from 10 to 17, most preferably from 12 to 17, in order to provide a stable emulsion system. The term HLB means an index which shows hydrophilic-lipophilic balance and is defined by the following formula of Oda, Teramura et al.",

        "It is desirable that the oil-in-water type cosmetic of the invention contains from 5 to 99.85% by weight, particularly from 10 to 98.9%, of the water phase, and from 1 to 99.85%, particularly from 2 to 98% by weight, of water.",
        "It is desirable that the water phase has a surface tension of 58 mN/m or less, particularly 57 mN/m or less, at 25\u00b0 C. (measured using a full automatic surface tension meter CBVP-Z mfd. by Kyowa Surface Science).",
        "In order to reduce surface tension of the water phase, the emulsion cosmetic of the invention may include water-soluble alcohols. Examples of the water-soluble alcohols include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 400 to 20,000), sorbitan, sorbitol, maltose, maltotriose and sodium hyaluronate.",
        "It is desirable that the emulsion cosmetic of the invention contains these alcohols in an amount of from 0.2 to 66% by weight, preferably from 1 to 33% by weight.",
        "It is desirable that the emulsification with a high shearing force is carried out using an emulsifier which can provide a maximum shearing force of 10,000 s\u22121 or more, particularly a shearing force of from 10,000 to 100,000,000 s\u22121.",
        "Such a high shearing force can be obtained by a commercial high pressure emulsifier such as Filmix (mfd. by Tokushu Kika), Creamix (mfd. by M Technique), Microfluidizer (mfd. by Microfluidics) or DeBEE 2000 (mfd. by B.E.E. International). For example, a micro-emulsion of interest can be obtained by setting the injection pressure to 300 to 3,000 kg/cm2 and the temperature to 5 to 50\u00b0 C. However, these operation conditions such as injection pressure and temperature are not particularly limited, because they vary depending on the technical specification of each apparatus.",
        "Alternatively, a desired emulsion can also be obtained more efficiently, by applying the same high shearing force treatment to a preliminary emulsion obtained by a usual emulsification method. As occasion demands, this high shearing force treatment may be carried out repeatedly.",
        "The oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic obtained in this manner contains the oily component in a large amount and forms stable micro-emulsion. Average particle size of the emulsion particles is, for example, from 0.01 to 1.0 \u03bcm, and more preferably, an emulsion having high transparency can be obtained within the range of from 0.01 to 0.2 \u03bcm. The average particle size is measured by a laser diffraction/scattering method. Also, transparency of the emulsion can be evaluated by an ultraviolet and visible region absorption photometer and judged transparent when the light transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm is 50% or more.",
        "When a liquid oily component is used alone as the oily component, the resulting emulsion has a relatively low viscosity, but an emulsion having high viscosity can be obtained by the use of a solid fatty material in addition to the liquid oily component as the oily component. In this case, an emulsion having a viscosity within a range, for example from 200 to 1,000,000 mPa\u00b7s at 25\u00b0 C., can be obtained by adjusting the solid fatty material.",
        "According to the oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic of the invention, stable dispersion can be effected in an emulsion having good transparency, by also including a solid fatty material in microscopic oil droplets in this manner.",
        "In addition, when the oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic is applied to the skin, it exerts an effect to improve percutaneous absorption of the solid fatty material component in comparison with generally known cosmetics including similar solid fatty material.",
        "Also, an emulsion in which its oil phase content and viscosity are adjusted can be obtained by firstly producing an oil-in-water type emulsion having high oil phase content, also preferably having high viscosity, and then further diluting it with water or an aqueous medium.",
        "The term \u201caqueous medium\u201d as used herein means a mixture of water and water-soluble alcohols, and examples of the water-soluble alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 400 to 20,000), sorbitan, sorbitol, maltose, maltotriose and sodium hyaluronate.",
        "In this case, viscosity can also be adjusted by adding a water-soluble high polymer. Adjustment of a predetermined viscosity can be effected by its kind, mixing amount and neutralizing degree.",
        "Examples of the water-soluble synthetic high polymer include a polyvinyl alcohol, a sodium polyacrylate, a carboxyvinyl polymer, a polyacrylamide, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a polyvinyl methyl ether, a polyvinyl sulfone, a maleic acid copolymer, a polyethylene oxide, a polydiaryl amine, a polyethylene imine, a water-soluble cellulose derivative (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, methylhydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or cellulose sulfate sodium salt) and a starch derivative (e.g., oxidized starch, dialdehyde starch, dextrin, British gum, acetyl starch, starch phosphate, carboxymethyl starch, hydroxyethyl starch or hydroxypropyl starch).",
        "Examples of the water-soluble natural high polymer include gum arabic, tragacanth gum, karaya gum, guar gum, tara gum, locust bean gum, tamarind gum, sodium alginate, alginic acid propylene glycol ester, carrageenan, pharcellulan, agar, high methoxy pectin, low methoxy pectin, chitin, chitosan, starches (e.g., starch derived from corn, potato, wheat, rice, sweet potato or tapioca, \u03b1-starch and soluble starch), fermentation polysaccharides (e.g., xanthan gum, pullulan, curdlan and dextran), proteins (e.g., casein sodium, gelatin and albumin), chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid.",
        "Preferred among these water-soluble high polymers are polyethylene oxide (molecular weight, 100,000 to 5,000,000), polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate, carboxyvinyl polymer, water-soluble cellulose and carrageenan.",
        "These water-soluble high polymers can form aqueous gel, for example, by adding to and dissolving in a stirred water phase heated at 60\u00b0 C., spontaneously cooling to about room temperature and then adding a neutralizing agent as occasion demands. The content in the oil-in-water type emulsion cosmetic of the invention is generally from 0.01 to 30% by weight, but since it varies depending on the kind and neutralization degree of each water-soluble high polymer, it is optionally selected in such an amount that viscosity of the formulated product is adjusted to a value within the range described above.",
        "In addition to the above, water-soluble or oil-soluble components such as a chelating agent, a pH adjusting agent, an antiseptic, a thickener, a drug component and a plant component can be formulated optionally.",
        "The emulsion cosmetic of the invention can be used as hair cosmetics such as hair liquid, hair mousse, shampoo and rinse; shaving cosmetics such as after-shaving lotion; skin cosmetics such as body lotion, face lotion, toilet lotion, moisturizing lotion and bath liquid, and body shampoo. The components to be optionally formulated depending on each purpose may be formulated after obtaining the micro-emulsion or contained in advance before the high speed shearing treatment.",
        "The components shown in Table 1 excluding water and ethanol were mixed in advance with heating at 80\u00b0 C., and the thus dissolved phase was mixed with water of 80\u00b0 C. to carry out preliminary emulsification under propeller stirring. After cooling to 25\u00b0 C., ethanol was added (if necessary) and an emulsion cosmetic was produced using a high pressure emulsifier (DeBEE 2000, mfd. by B.E.E. International), by passing through the solution 10 times at a shear rate of 1,000,000 s\u22121. In the Comparative Examples, each cosmetic was produced by cooling the preliminary emulsion to room temperature and then passing through the emulsion 10 times at a shear rate of 5,000 s\u22121 using the same high pressure emulsifier.",
        "The appearance, average particle size and periodical stability of the thus produced emulsion cosmetics are shown in Table 1.",
        "In this connection, the appearance was evaluated by measuring light transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm in a 1 cm cell using an ultraviolet and visible region absorption photometer (UV-160, mfd. by Shimadzu). A light transmittance of 50% or more was judged transparent. The average particle size was measured by a laser diffraction/scattering type particle size distribution measuring machine (HORIBA-500, mfd. by Horiba). Regarding the periodical stability, changes after one month of storage at a temperature of \u22125\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C. or 40\u00b0 C. were observed.",
