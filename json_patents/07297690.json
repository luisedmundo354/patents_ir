    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a novel complex comprising a substituted 2quinolinol and a lanthanide ion, more specifically, to a novel long-life luminescent complex comprising a substituted 2-quinolinol and a lanthanide ion, the luminescence intensity of which can be controlled using a photo-induced electron transfer (PET).",
        "Luminescent lanthanide complexes are known to have luminescent characteristics starkly different from those of ordinary luminescent organic compounds and have long life luminescence, sharp luminescence spectra and large Stokes shifts. (Richardson, F. S.; Chemistry Review, 1982, 82, 541-552; Ginya Adachi \u201cRare Earth Story, Magicians Among Leading Edge Materials,\u201d Sangyo Tosho; Ginya Adachi \u201cRare Earth Chemistry,\u201d Kagaku Dojin.) By utilizing the characteristics of this luminescence and measuring the luminescence using a time resolved measurement, the luminescence emitted solely by a lanthanide complex can uniquely be detected upon eliminating the luminescence from other organic compounds having short luminescence lifetime. This approach allows the background noise to be suppressed, and highly sensitive detection having a greater S/N ratio than that of a luminescence detection system based on the luminescence of an ordinary organic compound becomes possible. A variety of luminescent lanthanide complexes have been developed previously as labeling reagents and were used in time resolved immunoassays and time resolved DNA hybridizations, and an increase in detection sensitivities has been reported. (Morton, R. C., et al. Anal. Chem. 1990, 62, 1841; Seveus, L. et al., Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994, 28, 149; Mathis, G. Clin. Chem. 1993, 39, 1953-1959.) A probe capable of detecting a target analytical material with high sensitivity can be developed by using the luminescence of the luminescent lanthanide complex having the characteristics mentioned above.",
        "Recently an attempt was made to utilize a luminescent lanthanide complex itself as a sensor, and lanthanide complexes that change their luminescence characteristics depending upon the presence or absence of a target analytical material are being developed. (DeSilva, A. P. et al., Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 1515; Bissell, R. A. et al. \u201cIn Luminescent Chemosensors for Ion and Molecule Recognition\u201d; Garnik, A. W., Ed.; ACS Symposium Series 538; American Chemical Society; Washington, D.C., 1993; Chapter 4.) The main luminescence controlling methods involve either a change in the number of water ligands on lanthanide or a change in the chromophore itself.",
        "Up to now, many luminescent probes have been developed in ordinary organic compounds, in which photo induced electron transfer has been used to control luminescence. The photo induced electron transfer principle is widely accepted as the mechanism for luminescence quenching and is caused by the transfer of electrons from electron donating locations to luminescent dye locations. If the luminescence from a luminescent lanthanide complex can be controlled using photo induced electron transfer, a probe capable of high sensitivity detection can be designed and developed using photo induced electron transfer as the luminescence controlling principle.",
        "Several attempts to control the luminescence from lanthanide complexes such as the one shown by the formula below (chemical formula 4) using photo induced electron transfer have been reported. (Chem. Comm. 2000, 473-474; Chem. Comm. 1997, 1891-1892.)",
        "Problems to be Solved by the Invention",
        "However, the previously reported lanthanide complexes that exhibit luminescence controlled using photo induced electron transfer (PET) do not have adequate quenching mechanisms and not enough change in luminescence could be achieved due to large levels of background luminescence. In addition, the lanthanide complexes emitted luminescence only in organic solvents due to inadequate coordination of the complexes on a lanthanide metal. By overcoming the deficiency, a probe based on a luminescent lanthanide complex having practical applications in many actual systems can be developed.",
        "The objective of the present invention is to present a luminescent lanthanide complex utilizing photo induced electron transfer as the luminescence controlling principle. This complex needs to form a stable complex with lanthanide in water and to function in water. In addition, this complex must be completely controllable and emit no luminescence at all when quenched.",
        "Means to Solve the Problems",
        "The inventors discovered that the problems described above were solved by a complex comprising a lanthanide ion and a substituted 2-quinolinol containing a sensor group and a complex group, and the present invention was completed.",
        "That is, the present invention is a luminescent lanthanide complex comprising a lanthanide and a substituted 2-quinolinol having a sensor group and a complex group on any two of the positions 3-8 in the 2-quinolinol represented by the formula below (chemical formula 1)",
        "wherein the sensor group is represented by the formula below\n\n\u2014CnH2(n-m)\u2014(C6H5-o)(\u2014NR1R2)o \n\n(wherein n is an integer of 1-5, m is an integer of 0-2 and smaller than n-1, o is 1 or 2, R1 represents H, alkyl, \u2014COX (wherein X represents alkyl or peptide) or \u2014CH2CH2(NYCH2CH2)pNY2 (wherein Y independently represents H, alkyl or a group having the formula below (chemical formula 2)",
        "and p represents an integer of 0-3), and R2 represents H or alkyl), and said lanthanide ion is complex bonded to said complex group, and the molar ratio of said substituted 2-quinolinol: said lanthanide is 1:0.9 to 1.1. The lanthanide means any one of the elements of 58Ce to 71Lu.",
        "The complex group is derived from any one of the chelates (chemical formula 3) shown below",
        "(in the formula, IDA indicates iminodiacetic acid, MIDA indicates methyliminodiacetic acid, NTA indicates nitrilotriacetic acid, EDTA indicates ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, HEDTA indicates 2-hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, HMDTA indicates hexamethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, DTPA indicates diethylenetrinitilopentaacetic acid, TTHA indicates triethylenehexanitilopentaacetic acid, DOTA indicates 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid and NOTA indicates 1,4,7-azacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) and one of the N atoms in the chelate is preferably bonded to said 2-quinolinol through \u2014CH2(CONH)q\u2014 (wherein q represents 0 or 1, preferably 1).",
        "As the chelate, (iv) DTPA and (vi) DOTA are preferred.",
        "An amino group is added using a known method to positions 7, 3 or 4 of 2-quinolinol, and a chelate containing a carboxylic acid can form an amide linkage through the amino group to bond the chelate to 2-quinolinol.",
        "A substitution location for the sensor groups and complex groups is preferably at positions 7, 4 or 3 in the 2-quinolinol. Furthermore, the positions 7, 4 and 3 are preferred in this order as the substitution sites for the sensor groups and complex groups in the 2-quinolinol, and the positions 4, 3 and 7 are preferred in this order as the substitution sites for the sensor groups in the 2-quinolinol. In addition, it is preferred that the complex group is bonded to position 7 of said 2-quinolinol while said sensor group is bonded to position 4 or 3 of said 2-quinolinol, or said complex group is bonded to position 4 of said 2-quinolinol while said sensor group is bonded to position 3 or 7 of said 2-quinolinol, or said complex group is bonded to position 3 of said 2-quinolinol while said sensor group is bonded to position 4 or 7 of said 2-quinolinol.",
        "Furthermore, it is preferred that, in the sensor group, at least one amino group (\u2014NR1R2) is positioned para to a divalent hydrocarbon group (\u2014CnH2(n-m)\u2014) on the benzene ring (C6H5-o), and the alkyl is methyl. It is more preferred that n is 1 and m is 0.",
        "A complex of the present invention commonly can be prepared by mixing about equal amounts of a substituted 2-quinolinol and lanthanide in a polar solvent such as acetinitrile, methanol, water and the like and agitating them for about an hour or by heating and allowing them to reflux for about one to twelve hours.",
        "Furthermore, the present invention is a method to measure the nature of a sample comprising allowing any one of the above luminescent lanthanide complex to be co-present in a liquid phase with said sample and measuring the luminescence of the complex.",
        "As the solvent, polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, methanol and the like is preferred and water is more preferred. The concentration of the complex, in the solvent, is preferably 0.1 nM to 0.1 mM and the concentration of a sample to be measured is preferably 0.1 nM to 0.2 mM.",
        "For example, when a complex of the present invention is used with a hydrolase enzyme and the like as a sample to be measured, the sensor segment of the complex is decomposed by the sample to be measured resulting in a change in the luminescence intensity of the complex. Alternately, the sensor segment of a complex of the present invention is covalently bonded with Ca2+, Zn2+ or H+ resulting in a change in the luminescence intensity of the complex. Also alternately, the sensor segment of a complex of the present invention undergoes a chemical reaction with NO or singlet oxygen with a subsequent change in the luminescence intensity of the complex. Therefore, a complex of the present invention functions as a probe for these samples to be measured.",

        "FIG. 3 shows a reaction mechanism example of a complex of the present invention. (1) shows an example wherein a reaction group that reacts with a hydrolase enzyme such as caspase is incorporated into the PET sensor section; (2) shows an example wherein a reaction group that forms a coordinate bond with a zinc ion is incorporated into the PET sensor section; (3) shows an example wherein a reaction group that adds a hydrogen ion is incorporated into the PET sensor section; (4) shows an example wherein a reaction group that reacts with nitrogen monoxide is incorporated into the PET sensor section.",

        "A complex of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 1, comprises a sensor section composed of sensor substituents and a chromophore section composed of a substituted 2-quinolinol, containing a complex group, and a lanthanide.",
        "This complex is allowed to co-exist with a sample to be measured in a liquid phase, particularly in water. When the sample reacts with the amino groups in the sensor section, a change in the luminescence of this complex occurs. By observing the change, the nature of the sample can be characterized.",
        "For example, when the electron donating nature of the amino group is high (for example, when the sensor section is aniline), no luminescence is emitted from a chromophore as shown on the left of FIG. 2(a). When such a reaction induces a change in the amino group to a group having low electron donating nature (for example, into acetanilide), luminescence is emitted by the chromophore as shown on the right of FIG. 2(a). In a reverse situation, luminescence is quenched according to the reaction with a sample as shown in FIG. 2(b). By studying such luminescence, one can find an interaction between the complex of the present invention and the target sample. (Refer to DeSilva, A. P. et al., 1997, 97, 1515 for information on such a PET sensor principle.)",
        "Based on such a principle, some examples can be shown below as examples in which a complex of the present invention is utilized as a probe. However, the applications are not restricted to the examples. The reaction mechanisms involved in each example are shown in FIG. 3.",
        "(1) A reaction group (a peptide: DEVD) capable of reacting with a hydrolase enzyme such as caspase is incorporated into a PET sensor.",
        "This enables that the hydrolase enzymes such as caspase and the like can be specifically detected. The intra-cellular formation of a hydrolase such as caspase can be visualized. This application is very effective in analyzing the mechanisms of life related phenomena such as apoptosis. The tool can be applied to measuring the activity of a hydrolase such as caspase and can also be applied to the high throughput screening of interfering agents for a hydrolase such as caspase.",
        "No example of an application to a conventional organic luminescence probe has been published, but a complex of the present invention is an application target since it can definitely induce a change in luminescence intensity.",
        "(2) A reaction group forming a coordinate bond to a zinc ion is incorporated into the PET sensor section.",
        "This example makes the unique detection of Zn2+ possible. The intra-cellular formation of Zn2+ can be visualized. An example in which the Zn2+ measurements are applied to an organic luminescence probe has been published. (Hirano, T., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 12399.)",
        "(3) A reaction group containing added hydrogen ions is incorporated into a PET sensor section.",
        "Changes in pH can be measured using intensity changes in long life luminescence. An example in which measurements of changes in pH are applied to an organic luminescent probe has been published. (Sellinger, B. K, Aust. J. Chem. 1977, 30, 2087.)",
        "(4) A reaction group containing nitrogen monoxide is incorporated into a PET sensor section.",
        "Unique detection of NO is possible. Intracellular NO formation can be visualized. Such an example can be applied to measure the activation of NO synthetase and can also be applied to high throughput screening of NO synthetase interfering agents.",
        "Refer to Kojima, H. et al., Anal. Chem., 1998, 70, 2446. for an example in which a reaction with NO was applied to an organic luminescent probe.",
        "Advantages of the Invention",
        "Although a PET mechanism has previously been used to control luminescence in ordinary organic compounds, a complex of the present invention offers a novel feature of being able to control a long life luminescence with about one million times longer lifetime compared to previous organic compounds by using a PET control on a lanthanide complex. Therefore, a time resolved luminescence measurement is made available which enables more precise measurement. Up to now, some examples of time resolved measurements using a lanthanide complex have been published, but no example in which the intensity of long life luminescence was controlled using a reaction with a target sample has been published. The present invention provides the first example in which a measurement of a long life luminescence according to a target sample becomes possible, and more extensive application is anticipated for the complex of the present invention.",
        "The examples of the present invention below are provided to illustrate the present invention, but they are not provided with the intention of restricting the scope of the invention.",
        "In the examples below, DTPA that forms a stable one to one complex with lanthanide ions (Ln3+) was used as the chelate, and DTPA-cs124, a 2-quinolinol derivative, containing cs124 as a chromophore, represented by the formula (chemical formula 5) shown below,",
        "was used as the foundation skeleton. Then a lanthanide complex was designed and synthesized by incorporating a PET sensor to this skeleton. Aniline, which has a highly electron donating character, and acetanilide, which has a low electron donating nature, were selected as the PET sensors.",
