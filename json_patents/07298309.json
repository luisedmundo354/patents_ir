        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and more particularly, to a DAC that is realized by a plurality of pulse width modulation (PWM) units, and a method thereof.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is a device that converts a digital input value into a corresponding analog output voltage, which is then supplied to a backend circuit. For example, in a television (TV) system, after the user has chosen a TV channel, the TV system determines a digital input value according to the chosen TV channel. A DAC is utilized to convert the digital input value into an analog output voltage, which is then supplied to a TV tuner and allows the TV tuner to process received TV signals accordingly.",
        "With technological advances, electrical products demand higher and higher resolutions on DACs. More specifically, a DAC is required to generate an accurate analog output voltage according to a digital input value with increased bit counts. However, the cost of a high resolution DAC is usually much higher than that of a low resolution DAC. Since cost is always a critical concern when manufacturing electrical products, reducing the costs of high resolution DACs has becomes a desire of manufacturers of electrical products.",
        "One of the objectives of the present invention is to provide high resolution DACs with low costs.",
        "The invention discloses a DAC for generating an analog output voltage according to a digital input value. The digital input value comprises a plurality of bit segments. The DAC comprises a plurality of PWM units and a voltage generating unit. The plurality of PWM units generates a plurality of PWM signals according to the plurality of bit segments. The voltage generating unit is coupled to the plurality of PWM units and generates the analog output voltage according to the plurality of PWM signals.",
        "In the aforementioned DAC, a first and a second PWM unit of the plurality of PWM units generate a first and a second PWM signal of the plurality of PWM signals according to a first and a second bit segment of the plurality of bit segments, respectively. In the digital input value, the first bit segment is a predetermined number times the significance of the second bit segment.",
        "The invention also discloses a method for generating an analog output voltage according to a digital input value. The method comprises segmenting the digital input value into a plurality of bit segments, generating a plurality of PWM signals according to the plurality of bit segments, and generating the analog output voltage according to the plurality of PWM signals.",
        "In the aforementioned method, the step of generating a plurality of PWM signals according to the plurality of bit segments comprises generating a first and a second PWM signal of the plurality of PWM signals according to a first and a second bit segment of the plurality of bit segments, respectively. And in the digital input value, the first bit segment is a predetermined number times the significance of the second bit segment.",
        "These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a DAC according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2 shows an example of the DAC of FIG. 1.",
        "Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technology that can be applied to realize DACs. Generally speaking, a high resolution PWM unit should be used to make a high resolution DAC. For example, if a DAC with 16-bit resolution is required, a PWM unit with 16-bit resolution should be used to realize the DAC. However, a high resolution PWM unit is much more expansive than a low resolution PWM unit. Moreover, the cost-resolution ratio of a high resolution PWM unit is always larger than that of a low resolution PWM unit. Therefore, the overall cost of two 8-bit resolution DACs is much lower than the cost of a single 16-bit resolution DAC.",
        "To reduce the costs of high resolution DACs, this disclosure proposes an idea of using a plurality of PWM units, each of which has relatively low resolution, to realize a single high resolution DAC. FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the proposed DAC. The resolution of the DAC 100 shown in FIG. 1 is M*N bits, where both M and N are positive integers. In other words, the DAC 100 generates an analog output voltage VOUT according to a digital input value DI that is M*N-bit-long. The binary form of the digital input value DI is BM*N\u22121BM*N\u22122BM*N\u22123 . . . B2B1B0, where BM*N\u22121 is the most significant bit (MSB) and B0 is the least significant bit (LSB).",
        "The DAC 100 comprises M PWM units 120_1\u02dc120_M and a voltage generating unit 140. The resolution of each of the M PWM units 120_1\u02dc120_M is N bits. For an integer K between 1 and M, a Kth PWM unit 120_K generates a Kth PWM signal PWMS_K according to a Kth bit segment of the digital input value DI. The binary form of the Kth bit segment of DI is BK*N\u22121BK*N\u22122BK*N\u22123 . . . B(K\u22121)*N+2B(K\u22121)*N+1B(K\u22121)*N. The duty cycle of the Kth PWM signal PWMS_K is determined by the value of the Kth bit segment BK*N\u22121BK*N\u22122BK*N\u22123 . . . B(K\u22121)*N+2B(K\u22121)*N+1B(K\u22121)*N. Since there are N bits included in the Kth bit segment, the duty cycle of the Kth PWM signal PWMS_K is selected from 2^N possible duty cycles. The difference between a largest and a smallest duty cycles of the 2^N possible duty cycles is (2^N)\u22121 times the size of a step. For example, when N equals 8, the step is approximately 0.3922%.",
        "When the value of the Kth bit segment BK*N\u22121BK*N\u22122BK*N\u22123 . . . B(K\u22121)*N+2B(K\u22121)*N+1B(K\u22121)*N is increased by 1, the duty cycle of the Kth PWM signal PWMS_K is increased by one step, and the voltage generating unit 140 elevates the analog output voltage VOUT by a Kth voltage step VS_K. Since in the digital input value DI, a K1th bit segment is 2^[(K1\u2212K2)*N] times the significance of a K2th bit segment, a K1th voltage stepVS_K1 should be 2^[(K1\u2212K2)*N] times the size of a K2th voltage stepVS_K2.

        "The resolution of the DAC 100 is M*N bits, however, no PWM unit with M*N bits resolution is required. Relatively, M PWM units, each of which is N bits in resolution, are used to make the DAC 100. Since the overall cost of the M N-bit-resolution PWM units is much lower than that of a single M*N-bit-resolution PWM unit, the DAC 100 is more cost effective than the M*N-bit-resolution DACs of the prior art.",
        "FIG. 2 shows an example of the DAC 100 of FIG. 1. In the example shown in FIG. 2, M is equal to 2 while N is equal to 8. The binary form of the digital input value DI is B15B14B13 . . . B2B1B0, the binary form of the first bit segment is B7B6B5 . . . B2B1B0, and the binary form of the second bit segment is B15B14B13 . . . B10B9B8. The first bit segment can be referred to as a low portion of the digital input value DI, and the second bit segment can be referred to as a high portion of the digital input value DI. The resolution of both the first PWM unit 120_1 and the second PWM unit 120_2 is 8 bits. The second resistor R_2 has 2^8=256 times the resistance of the first resistor R_1.",
