        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/350,488, filed Nov. 13, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/357,288, filed Feb. 15, 2002, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to phenoxy amine compounds for delivering active agents, such as biologically or chemically active agents, to a target. These compounds are well suited for forming non-covalent mixtures with active agents for oral, intracolonic, pulmonary, and other routes of administration to animals. Methods for the preparation and administration of such compositions are also disclosed.",
        "Conventional means for delivering active agents are often severely limited by biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Typically, these barriers are imposed by the environment through which delivery occurs, the environment of the target for delivery, and/or the target itself. Biologically and chemically active agents are particularly vulnerable to such barriers.",
        "In the delivery to animals of biologically active and chemically active pharmacological and therapeutic agents, barriers are imposed by the body. Examples of physical barriers are the skin, lipid bi-layers and various organ membranes that are relatively impermeable to certain active agents but must be traversed before reaching a target, such as the circulatory system. Chemical barriers include, but are not limited to, pH variations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and degrading enzymes.",
        "These barriers are of particular significance in the design of oral delivery systems. Oral delivery of many biologically or chemically active agents would be the route of choice for administration to animals if not for biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Among the numerous agents which are not typically amenable to oral administration are biologically or chemically active peptides, such as calcitonin and insulin; polysaccharides, and in particular mucopolysaccharides including, but not limited to, heparin; heparinoids; antibiotics; and other organic substances. These agents may be rapidly rendered ineffective or destroyed in the gastro-intestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes, and the like. In addition, the size and structure of macromolecular drugs may prohibit absorption.",
        "Earlier methods for orally administering vulnerable pharmacological agents have relied on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin. However, broad spectrum use of such drug delivery systems is precluded because: (1) the systems require toxic amounts of adjuvants or inhibitors; (2) suitable low molecular weight cargos, i.e. active agents, are not available; (3) the systems exhibit poor stability and inadequate shelf life; (4) the systems are difficult to manufacture; (5) the systems fail to protect the active agent (cargo); (6) the systems adversely alter the active agent; or (7) the systems fail to allow or promote absorption of the active agent.",
        "Proteinoid microspheres have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,401,516; 5,443,841; and Re. 35,862.

Particularly, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for orally administering active agents, especially those that are not ordinarily orally deliverable, or those for which improved delivery is desired.",
        "The compositions comprising the compounds and active agents have utility in the delivery of active agents to selected biological systems and in an increased or improved bioavailability of the active agent compared to administration of the active agent without the delivery agent. Delivery can be improved by delivering more active agent over a period of time, or in delivering the active agent in a particular time period (such as to effect quicker or delayed delivery), or in delivering the active agent at a specific time, or over a period of time (such as sustained delivery).",

        "Dosing solutions of delivery agent compound and interferon alfacon-1 (IFN) (available as Infergen\u00ae from InterMune, Inc. of Brisbane, Calif.) were prepared in deionized water. The free acid of the delivery agent compound was converted to the sodium salt with one equivalent of sodium hydroxide. Typically, a solution of the delivery agent compound was prepared in water and stirred, adding one equivalent of sodium hydroxide (1.0 N) when making the sodium salt. This mixture was vortexed and placed in a sonicator (about 37\u00b0 C.). The pH was adjusted to about 7.0 to 8.5 with aqueous NaOH. The mixture was vortexed to produce a uniform suspension or solution, also using sonication and heat if necessary. Additional NaOH was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and the pH re-adjusted to about 7.0 to 8.5. The delivery agent compound solution was mixed with an IFN stock solution (about 22.0 to 27.5 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline) and diluting to the desired volume (usually 3.0 ml). The final delivery agent compound and IFN doses, and the dose volumes are listed below in Table 6.",
        "The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250 g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing group of five animals was administered one of the dosing solutions. An 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. The dosing solution was administered by pressing the syringe plunger.",
        "Blood samples were collected serially from the tail artery, typically at time=0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes. Serum IFN concentrations were quantified using Cytoscreen Immunoassay Kit for human IFN-alpha (catalog # KHC4012 from Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif.). Previous studies indicated baseline values of about zero. Results from the animals in each group were averaged for each time point. The maximum of these averages (i.e., the mean peak serum IFN concentration) is reported below in Table 6.",
