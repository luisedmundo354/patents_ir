In first position 36, switching device 24 engages and seals port 28 provided in switching device 24 to port 32 provided in a first valve block 50 adjacent one limit of travel of switching device 24, and seals port 34, provided in a second valve block 51, to port 30 provided in switching device 24.

Nos. 5,632,816; 5,787,928; 5,746,831; and, 5,944,045. The switching device is moved to its first position 36 and coating material is provided from the source 16 through conduit 56 to port 28, and through the switching device 24, port 32 and conduit 58 to reservoir 22a. Controller 64 and motor 66 then switch device 24 to its second position 38. Coating material is provided from source 16 through conduit 56, port 28, switching device 24, port 34 and conduit 60 to reservoir 22b. As reservoir 22b is being filled, reservoir 22a is being emptied through port 32, switching device 24, port 30 and conduit 62, supplying coating material to the dispensing device 12 from which the coating material is dispensed, coating article 18. As reservoir 22a reaches empty, controller 64 and motor 66 switch device 24 back to its first position in which coating material is provided from the source 16 through conduit 56, port 28, switching device 24, port 32 and conduit 58 to reservoir 22a. As this is occurring, reservoir 22b is being emptied, supplying coating material through conduit 60, port 34, switching device 24, port 30 and conduit 62 to dispensing device 12 from which the coating material is dispensed, coating article 18, and so on.",

Nos. 5,944,045; 5,787,928; 5,746,831; and, 5,632,816. Illustratively, molecular sieves 80 are placed on the floor 48 of the reservoir 40 underneath switching device 24. The sieves 80 can be recycled and/or replenished as necessary to maintain their drying action on any water or the like which finds its way into the blocking medium in tank 42."
