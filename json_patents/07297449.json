        "This is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/123,168, filed Apr. 17, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,060,393.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to an optical recording medium, in particular, an optical recording medium having a recording layer where a space charge field is designed to be formed by the irradiation of beam, and also to an optical recording apparatus which is designed to record information through such an optical recording medium.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "As a recording medium which is capable of recording data which requires a large memory capacity such as an image of high density, an optical recording medium is known to be useful. Conventionally, as an optical recording medium, a photomagnetic recording medium and an optical phase change recording medium have been developed. However, there is still increasing demands for an optical recording medium having a capacity for recording a more increased density of information.",
        "There has been proposed a holographic memory as an optical recording medium for realizing the recording of such an increased density of information. In this holographic memory, a page data where an optical intensity, polarization, or the phase thereof is two-dimensionally modulated is interfered with a reference light beam so as to enable information to be stored as a hologram in a recording layer. This holographic memory is designed such that the thickness of the recording layer is made large so as to enable a large quantity of holograms to be recorded in the same overlapped region by slightly changing the incident angle of the reference light beam or by slightly displacing the recording position.",
        "As for the materials useful for the recording medium of such a holographic memory, the employment of inorganic materials have been studied in the past. In recent years however, a photorefractive medium employing an organic polymer compound is now being extensively developed because of the reasons that it no longer necessitates to manufacture a crystalline material or that it is possible to obviate the difficulties in the control of characteristics of the crystal (For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,264).",
        "This photorefractive medium is provided with a recording layer containing a charge-generating material, a charge-transport material, a trapping material and a nonlinear optical material. As a signal beam and a reference beam, both beams interfering with each other, are simultaneously irradiated onto this recording layer, information is enabled to be recorded therein in the form of interference fringes of both beams. When the same reference beam that has been employed in the recording is irradiated onto the recording layer, a reconstructed beam having the same spatial characteristics as those of the signal beam is enabled to be read.",
        "Specifically, in the portion of the recording layer that has been irradiated by the beams, an electric charge is generated from the charge-generating material and then isolated by the charge-transport material. By enabling this isolated electric charge to be retained by the trapping material, a space charge field is formed inside the recording layer. Due to this space charge field, the refractive index of the nonlinear optical material is caused to change. Therefore, when a pair of beams interfering with each other are irradiated onto the recording layer, an intensity pattern of the beams thus irradiated is enabled to be recorded, as a change in refractive index, in the recording layer.",
        "However, when a difference in molecular orbital energy is increased between the trapping material and the charge-transport material so as to prevent the thermal elimination of recorded data due to the thermal de-trapping from the trapping material, it becomes increasingly difficult to permit the hopping of electric charge from the charge-transport material to the trapping material. The reason for this is explained by the charge transport theory based on the small polaron hopping (D. Emin, Adv. Phys. vol. 24, 305-347 (1975)). Therefore, it would take a long time for enabling an electric charge to be trapped by the trapping material, thus necessitating a long time for recording information. On the contrary, when an electric charge is enabled to be easily hopped from the charge-transport material to the trapping material, a difference in energy between the trapping material and the charge-transport material is caused to minimize, thereby enabling the thermal elimination of recorded data. Namely, the life of record would be shortened.",
        "On the other hand, as an alternative optical recording medium for realizing the recording of high density of information, there is known a multi-layer optical recording medium (D. A. Parthnopulous and P. M. Rentzepis, Science vol. 245, pp. 843-844 (1989)). This optical recording medium is featured, as shown in this publication, in that a recording beam is converged at an optional portion within a uniform optical recording medium to bring about a change in optical characteristics only in the vicinity of the focused point, thus recording information. Therefore, this optical recording medium differs from those where a recording layer and a non-recording layer are alternately laminated.",
        "In this multi-layer optical recording medium also, the employment of inorganic materials has been studied (Y. Kawata, H. Ishibashi, and S. Kawata, Opt. Lett. vol. 16, pp. 756-758 (1998)). In recent years however, a photorefractive medium employing an organic polymer compound is now being extensively developed, as mentioned above, because of the reasons that it no longer necessitates to manufacture a crystalline material or that it is possible to obviate the difficulties in the control of characteristics of the crystal. According to this photorefractive medium, the optical characteristics thereof changes in proportion to the intensity of beam. However, in a recording medium where the optical characteristics thereof changes in proportion to the intensity of beam, the recording region is expanded depthwise. Therefore, the recording regions neighboring to each other are required to be sufficiently spaced apart from each other, thereby obstructing the enhancement of densification of information. As a method for narrowing the distance depthwise between the recording regions, there has been studied a method of generating electric charge by two-photon absorption (D. Day, M. Gu, and A. Smallridge, Opt. Lett. vol. 24, pp. 288-290 (1999)). However, since this method requires a very strong light source for generating electric charge by two-photon absorption, an ordinary semiconductor laser can be no longer useful in performing the recording using this method.",
        "Therefore, an object of this invention is to provide an optical recording medium wherein information is enabled to be recorded as a hologram, and the time required for the recording can be shortened while ensuring a practical recording life.",
        "Another object of this invention is to provide an optical recording apparatus which is designed to record information through such an optical recording medium.",

        "First of all, the recording and reading of information will be explained with reference to FIG. 1 wherein an optical recording medium according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. At first, a laser beam is irradiated onto an optical recording medium having a recording layer 2 to record information therein. At this moment, a transparent electrodes 1 and 3 may be formed in advance on the opposite surfaces of the recording layer 2 to make it possible to perform the recording while applying a voltage between these electrodes 1 and 3. The laser beam is separated into a signal beam 4 accompanying therewith information which has been shaped into a spatial intensity distribution, polarization distribution, or a phase distribution, and a reference beam 5, this couple of beams being permitted to interfere with each other in the recording layer. In this manner, the information is recorded, as interference fringes, in the recording layer 2. When the reading beam 5 is irradiated onto the recording layer 2 under the same condition as that of the reference beam 5, a reconstructed beam 6 having the same spatial characteristics as those of the signal beam can be reconstructed. Therefore, by detecting the intensity distribution or phase distribution of the reconstructed beam 6, the information can be read. Even in the case where a voltage is applied to the optical recording medium at the time recording, the voltage is not necessarily required to be applied to the optical recording medium on the occasion of reading the information.",
        "The photorefractive material is a material wherein electric charge is enabled to be generated through the irradiation of beam and to be spatially isolated, thus generating a distribution of electric charge and the space charge field at this irradiated region, through which the refractive index of the material is caused to change. Next, the principle of recording hologram will be explained with reference to FIGS. 2A to 2D. When a beam having an intensity distribution as shown in FIG. 2A is irradiated onto an optical recording medium, a distribution of electric charge is generated in a recording layer as shown in FIG. 2B. In ordinary organic photorefractive materials, only the hole is permitted to be transported, and the distribution of hole becomes spatially uniform as shown in the dotted line in FIG. 2B, provided that the following conditions are met. Specifically, the condition is that the mean free path in the direction of wavenumber vector of this interference fringes is not less than about a half of A shown in FIG. 2A. As a result, the distribution of total electric charge would become a state as shown in FIG. 2C. Since an external electric field is generally applied to the photorefractive medium, the distribution of electric field would become a state as shown in FIG. 2D. Further, in a case where a nonlinear optical material is incorporated in the photorefractive medium, the refractive index of the medium is caused to change in accordance with the intensity of electric field shown in FIG. 2D. As a result, the changes of refractive index corresponding to the distribution of the intensity of beam irradiated would be caused to be generated. In this manner, the spatial intensity distribution, polarization distribution, and/or the phase distribution of the signal beam 4 are enabled to be recorded as a form of hologram in the recording layer.",
        "The principle of the re-distribution of the electric charge that has been generated from the irradiation of beam is consisted of two processes, i.e. the transport of electric charge and the retention of electric charge. The charge-transport material is designed to transport the optically generated electric charge by hopping conduction which can be effected through the drift and diffusion of electric charge to be enhanced by an external electric field. Further, the trapping material is designed to capture the electric charge that has been transported by the charge-transport material. The probability that the electric charge is hopped from the trapping material to the charge-transport material should be smaller than the probability that the electric charge is hopped from the charge-transport material to the trapping material. In order to realize this, a difference in molecular orbital energy between the charge-transport material and the trapping material has been taken advantage of in the past in general. In this case, the molecular orbital to be compared with each other differs depending on the polarity of electric charge to be transported by the hopping. Namely, when electron is to be transported, it is LUMO (Lowest Unocculied Molecular Orbital), whereas when hole is to be transported, it is HOMO (Highest Occulied Molecular Orbital). Therefore, when electron is to be transported, the LUMO of the charge-transport material should have a larger energy than the LUMO of the trapping material, whereas when hole is to be transported, the HOMO of the charge-transport material should have a smaller energy than the HOMO of the trapping material.",
        "The probability that the electric charge hops once from a given charge-transport material to another charge-transport material differs greatly depending on the manner in which an electron clouds of molecules overlaps with each other as well as on the energy required for forming a polaron. This overlap integral is relatively large between the groups where the electron-donating/accepting property thereof is of the same structure with each other, but is relatively small between the groups where the electron-donating/accepting property thereof is quite different in energy and structure from one another. Therefore, in order to enable electric charge to be rapidly transported from the charge-transport material to the trapping material, it is preferable to provide both of the charge-transport material and the trapping material with a group having the same kind of electron-donating/accepting property.",
        "As for the trapping material, it is possible to employ a compound wherein at least one nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group is bonded to a conjugated system.

In FIG. 3, the curve \u201ca\u201d denotes the energy of the neutral state, and the curve \u201cb\u201d denotes the energy of the ionized state. When the molecular geometry is prominently altered due to the ionization of molecule, the energy of the molecule will be lost in the form of lattice vibration due to the alteration of molecular geometry. Further, there is a great difference in molecular geometry between the neutral state and the ionized state, so that when the conjugated state is enhanced throughout the molecule, the dependency of the energy of electric charge on the molecular geometry would be further increased in the ionized state as compared with that in the neutral state as shown in FIG. 3. Namely, since the trapping material of ionized state is enabled to return to the neutral state thereof by releasing electric charge, much more energy is required in that case. Because of this, the molecular geometry is caused to alter when the molecule is ionized, so that it is possible, by using a trapping material which is capable of enhancing the conjugated state throughout the molecule, to stably retain the electric charge. Namely, the trapping material exhibiting such features has a prolonged charge retention life. In order to bring about such a structural change, the trapping material according one embodiment of the present invention is required to have a conjugated system.

The alteration of absorption in this manner accompanies, according to the relation of Kramers-Kronig, the alteration of refractive index.

Generally, when a structural change is caused to occur, electric charge is deprived of its energy and, therefore, is stably retained by the trapping material. Occasionally, the electric charge may be transported to another electron-donating group before the structural changes are taken place. Otherwise, the electric charge may be transported over a plurality of trapping materials. Therefore, the separation of electric charge to be generated from the charge-generating material may happen to be generated only from the trapping material too. Of course, it is preferable, for the purpose of effectively generating the dissociation of electric charge, to incorporate a charge-transport material in separate from the trapping material.",
        "When a couple of coherent beams are irradiated onto the recording layer containing such a trapping material, changes in optical constant and having the same cycle as the interference fringes would be generated provided that the mean free path of the interference fringes of electric charge in the direction of wavenumber vector is sufficiently smaller than the . Therefore, when one of the beams generating the interference fringes is shut off, a diffracted beam can be observed.",
        "Further, when a recording beam is converged on this recording layer, a large quantity of electric charge would be generated in the vicinity of the focal point, so that when the mean free path of electric charge is not larger than the beam diameter at the beam waist, a greater number of the trapping material are enabled to retain electric charge in the vicinity of the focal point. Especially, since the electric charge is permitted to generate all at once in a very narrow region in the vicinity of focal point in this recording method, the probability of enabling a single trapping material to retain a couple of electric charges will be increased. This probability of enabling a single trapping material to retain a couple of electric charges would be proportional to a square of the density of electric charge, if it is considered in a most simple way. On the other hand, since the number of electric charge to be generated by the irradiation of beam is proportional to the intensity of beam, the probability of enabling a single trapping material to retain a couple of electric charges would become proportional to a square of the intensity of beam. For this reason, it become possible to bring about changes of the optical constant only in a narrower region.",
        "The mixing ratio of the trapping material in the optical recording medium may be determined in such a way as to enable an average distance between trapping property-provided units to fall within a desired range. The density of the optical recording medium can be determined from the weight and volume of the medium. The amount of the trapping material in the optical recording medium can be determined from the molecular weight and mixing ratio of the trapping material. On the basis of above-mentioned factors, an average distance between trapping property-provided units can be determined.",
        "In the case where the recording layer contains a non-linear optical material, the mean transport path of electric charge is required to be not less than about /2. Therefore, an average distance between trapping property-provided units (hereinafter referred to as average inter-unit distance) should preferably be within the range of 1.0 nm to 4.0 nm. Although it depends on the kinds of trapping material, if the average inter-unit distance is 1.0 nm, the content of the trapping material would become about 40% by weight based on the entire weight of the recording layer, and if the average inter-unit distance is 4.0 nm, the content of the trapping material would become about 1% by weight. If the content of the trapping material is too small, it would take a long time for enabling optically generated electric charge to be captured by the trapping material, thus requiring a long time for the recording. On the other hand, if the content of the trapping material is too large, the optically generated electric charge would be trapped before the electric charge is sufficiently isolated, so that it would become difficult to establish a sufficient magnitude of space charge field.",
        "On the other hand, if it is desired to employ the recording layer as an optical recording medium where the mean transport path of electric charge is sufficiently smaller than the , an average inter-unit distance should preferably be within the range of 0.9 nm to 1.3 nm. Although it depends on the kinds of trapping material, if the average inter-unit distance is 0.95 nm, the content of the trapping material would become about 60% by weight based on the entire weight of the recording layer, and if the average inter-unit distance is 1.3 nm, the content of the trapping material would become about 20% by weight If the content of the trapping material is too small, the mean free path of electric charge would be enlarged, so that it would be difficult to generate a sufficient degree of changes in optical characteristics in conformity with the distribution of the intensity of beam. On the other hand, if the content of the trapping material is too large, the aggregation and crystallization among the trapping materials would be caused to generate, so that it may become impossible to form a recording layer containing uniformly dispersed molecules. The optically generated electric charge is transported by hopping from a charge-generating material to a charge-transport material, and from one of the charge-transport materials to another one, thus enabling it to be ultimately captured by the trapping material. If the content of the charge-transport material is too large, the mean free path of electric charge would be enlarged, so that it would become difficult to generate a sufficient degree of changes in optical characteristics in conformity with the distribution of the intensity of beam.",
        "By the way, when the trapping material is incorporated into the recording layer so as to enable an average inter-unit distance to fall within the range of 1.0 nm to 1.3 nm, the mean transport path of electric charge can be adjusted by adjusting the mixing ratio of the charge-transport material relative to the content of the trapping material.",

As a result, by the diffraction grating that has been recorded in the optical recording medium 7, a virtual image which is opposite in direction from that forwarded by the signal beam 4 will be reconstructed. After being passed through the lens 16, the virtual image is permitted to reflect by the beam splitter 23 so as to be read by the reading device 19. In the same manner as on the occasion of recording, the distance between the lens 16 and the reading device 19 should preferably be made equal to the focal distance of the lens 16. It is also possible in this phase conjugated reading to employ a coherent beam having a slightly different wavelength from that employed in the recording. In that case, the incident angle of the reading beam should preferably be slightly adjusted so as to make the beam axis of the virtual image completely align with the axis of signal beam 4.",
        "If the reference beam 5 is not converged on the occasion of recording, it is possible to omit the beam splitter 21 and the lens 22 even in this phase conjugated reading.",
        "The information recorded in the optical recording medium may be erased if desired. For example, by irradiating a beam having a uniform intensity distribution all over a larger region as compared with the recording region, or by heating the optical recording medium up to a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature thereof, the recorded information can be erased. Alternatively, the recorded information can be erased by uniformly irradiating a beam having a wavelength against which the trapping material is incapable of absorbing if it is in the neutral state but is capable of absorbing if it is in the ionized state.",
        "The methods of recording and reading information in the optical recording medium according to one embodiment of the present invention are not confined to the aforementioned examples but can be variously modified. For example, the signal beam 4 and the reference beam 5 may be introduced into the optical recording medium 7 from the different side thereof, respectively.",
        "If the information is recorded as a digital data, a plurality of pixels of the image display element 15 may be represented as a single data.",
        "If the information is to be supplied by the intensity distribution of signal beam, the intensity of beam at the bright portion and at the dark portion may not be uniform throughout the diameter of beam. Namely, the transmittance of beam in the image display element may be lowered at the central portion thereof and enhanced at the marginal portion. It is possible in this manner to preliminarily correct the phenomenon that the reconstructed beam is weakened at the marginal region as compared with the central region. Alternatively, a beam intensity modulating element having a higher absorption coefficient at the central region and a lower absorption coefficient at the marginal region may be disposed in front of the reading device 19 so as to obtain the same effect as mentioned above.",
        "Next, the method of recording information in a plurality layers of the recording medium and the method of reading information therefrom in the multi-layer optical recording medium according to one embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 7.",
        "The beam emitted from a semiconductor laser 31 is turned into a parallel beam by a collimator lens 32, and then, converged in the recording layer by using an objective lens 33. By increasing the injection current to the semiconductor laser 31 for a suitable period of time on the occasion of irradiating laser beam, the information can be recorded as a change in optical constant at only the vicinity of focal point. By locating the position of focal point at a desired portion within the medium, the information can be recorded as the region 34 where the optical constant is altered, which can be distinguished from the region where the optical constant is not altered.",
        "The information thus recorded can be read by a process wherein an iris 35 is disposed on the axis of beam and the intensity of beam that has passed through the iris 35 is measured by a beam detector 36. Namely, the reading beam is irradiated so as to enable the axis of reading beam to pass through the region where the optical constant is altered, and the focal point is scanned in the depth-wise of the recording layer. As a result, the intensity I of transmitted beam to be observed can be expressed as a function of the focus position Z in the direction of depth (herein, the center of the region where the optical constant was altered is defined as Z=0) as shown in FIG. 8. The reason for this can be attributed to the fact that the refractive index of the medium is altered in the vicinity around Z=0, thereby generating the lens effect. Even if the region where the optical constant is not altered is scanned, the intensity of transmitted beam would not be changed. Therefore, by determining if there is a change in intensity of the transmitted beam, it become possible to determine the region where the optical constant is altered. Therefore, if the region to be recorded has been determined in advance, it is possible to read the recorded information by knowing the fluctuation of intensity of transmitted beam in the vicinity of that predetermined region.",
        "However, in order to prevent the optical characteristics from being newly altered on the occasion of reading information, the injection current should preferably be controlled so as to confine the intensity of reading beam to about \u00bd to 1/100 of the recording beam.",
        "Alternatively, as a more simple reading method, the recorded data on the recorded position may be read by detecting the intensity of the transmitted beam in the vicinity of the recorded position. Namely, the recorded information can be read by detecting the intensity of the transmitted beam of the position which is displaced in depth-wise by a distance Z0 (shown in FIG. 8) from the data-recorded position. When the focal point of reading beam is existed at the position which is displaced in depth-wise by the distance Z0 from the region where the information is not recorded, the intensity of the transmitted beam would indicate a value I0, whereas when the focal point of reading beam is existed at the position which is displaced in depth-wise by the distance Z0 from the region where the information is recorded, the intensity of the transmitted beam would be I0+\u0394I, so that, by detecting this intensity of the transmitted beam, the recorded information existing at the position which is displaced by the distance Z0 from the focal point of the reading beam can be read.",
        "In the case where the film thickness is sufficiently large or where the glass plate is disposed on the objective lens side of the recording layer, a lens which is long in operating distance such as CF IC LCD Plan CR (tradename, NIKON Co., Ltd.; magnification: 100 times) can be preferably employed as an objective lens. Further, in the case where the substrate is disposed at the top and bottom surfaces of the recording layer, the thickness of the substrate to be disposed on the objective lens side should preferably be 0.5 mm or less. Alternatively, the substrate may not be disposed on the objective lens side of the recording layer. In that case, the recording layer may be housed inside a diskette in order to prevent the recording layer from being scratched.",
        "The method of recording information to the optical recording medium according to one embodiment of the present invention as well as the method of reading the information therefrom are not limited to the aforementioned examples, but may be variously modified. For example, reading information may be performed in the same manner as in the case of a confocal microscope. Alternatively, a reflector may be provided on the side of optical recording medium which is opposite to where the objective lens is disposed, thereby making it possible to read information by using a reflected beam.",

Therefore, the optical recording medium of one embodiment of the present invention is advantageous in that the response speed thereof is faster and the recording time is shorter as compared with the conventional optical recording medium.",

Therefore, if a light source of 633 nm or 532 nm is to be employed as a light source for the recording beam, it would give rise to the defect that, when the thickness of the recording layer of optical recording medium is enlarged, the intensity of diffracted beam is caused to decrease due to the absorption of the trapping material. Even in the case of the compound wherein an electron-donating group having a heterocyclic structure is coupled, through a conjugated system, with an electron-accepting group, it frequently exhibits a strong absorption at the visible range (for example, \u201cEffect of the chromophore donor group and ferrocene doping on the dynamic range, gain, and phase shift in photorefractive polymer\u201d, E.

On the other hand, an ITO film 112 and an Al film 113 are successively evaporated on the surface of a glass plate 111. Then, the sample is deposited on the Al film 113 by using a spinner to form a measuring film 114. Thereafter, the surface of the measuring film 114 is positively charged by corona discharge, and then, beam is irradiated to the surface of the measuring film 114. The electric charge generated by the irradiation of beam is then transported to an earthed counter electrode side. If electron is retained by the charge-generating site after electric charge has been generated in the vicinity of the surface of measuring film 114, the electric potential of the surface of sample will be attenuated in proportion to the number of hole that has been transported. More specifically, as indicated by the curve \u201ce\u201d in FIG. 11, the electric potential will be attenuated. On the other hand, if the trapping material for retaining hole is dispersed inside the sample, the transported distance of hole will be shortened as the hole is retained by the trapping material. Therefore, the surface potential would not be attenuated down to zero, but is gradually shifted to a constant value as represented by the curve \u201cf\u201d in FIG. 11. Therefore, the value of surface potential thus shifted would become a hint for knowing the number of trapped hole. On this occasion, the dark attenuation of the surface potential after the finish of irradiation may be considered as being caused by the de-trapping of hole that has been once trapped.",

One of the beams which was reflected by the beam splitter 12 was passed through a beam expander 11 to expand the diameter of the beam and then, permitted to pass through a liquid crystal filter 15 functioning as an image display element. This liquid crystal filter 15 was designed such that the transmissivity thereof was modulated in advance in conformity with the information to be recorded, and that the transmitted beam was turned into a signal beam 4, which was then converged by a lens 16 (focal length: 150 mm).

        "When the recording of information was performed under the same conditions as employed in Example 1, it took 30 seconds for performing the recording. The reason for this may be attributed to the fact that since there was a large difference in ionization potential between the charge-accepting group of the PVK and the charge-donating group of the DEH, it was more difficult for a hole to be transported from PVK to DEH. In spite of this, the information thus recorded was found impossible to be reconstructed 30 minutes after the recording. This may be attributed to the fact that since a couple of phenyl groups in the DEH were directly bonded to amino group having electron donativity, it was impossible to bring about a sufficient change in molecular geometry inside the polymer, so that the retention life of electric charge was not sufficiently long.",

        "By using a recording apparatus constructed as shown in FIG. 5, the recording and reading hologram were performed as follows. In the operation of this recording apparatus shown in FIG. 5, the beam emitted from a He\u2014Ne laser (output: 30 mW) 10 was at first split into two by a beam splitter 12. One of the beams which was reflected by the beam splitter 12 was passed through a beam expander 11 to expand the diameter of the beam and then, permitted to pass through a liquid crystal filter 15 functioning as an image display element. This liquid crystal filter 15 was designed such that the transmissivity thereof was modulated in advance in conformity with the information to be recorded, and that the transmitted beam was turned into a signal beam 4, which was then converged by a lens 16 (focal length: 150 mm). The distance between the lens 16 and the optical recording medium 7 was set to 135 mm.",
        "On the other hand, the other beam passed through the beam splitter 12 was converged by a lens 17 (focal length: 150 mm) to produce a reference beam 5. In this case, the distance between the lens 17 and the optical recording medium was set to 70 mm, and the path of the reference beam 5 was adjusted so as to enable the reference beam to cover the converged region of the signal beam 4 on the surface of the optical recording medium. When the angles of incidence of the signal beam 4 and the reference beam 5 irradiated onto the surface of the optical recording medium 7 were measured outside the optical recording medium 7, the angles of incidence relative to the normal line of the optical recording medium 7 were found 30 degrees and 60 degrees, respectively.",

After permitting this reconstructed beam to pass through a lens 18 (focal length: 150 mm) of the same construction as the lens 16, this reconstructed beam was permitted to enter into a CCD 19 functioning as a reading apparatus. As a result, a reconstructed beam having the same intensity distribution as that of the signal beam 4 was detected. In this case, the lens 18 was disposed perpendicular to the axis of beam and at a position which was spaced 300 mm away from the lens 16 so as to enable the axis of beam to align with the center of the lens 18. The CCD 19 was also disposed perpendicular to the axis of beam. The distance between the lens 18 and the CCD 19 was set equal to the focal length of the lens 18.",
