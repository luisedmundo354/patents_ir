        "The merging of information from images obtained from mammography, ultrasound, and MRI is an important problem in breast cancer diagnosis. Breast images of a given patient can provide complementary information regarding an abnormality. Moreover, comparing the images also improves their interpretation.",
        "Radiologists frequently compare breast images taken at different times for identifying and evaluating lesions. Also, diagnostic mammography and breast sonography are routinely performed to evaluate breast abnormalities that are initially detected with screening mammography or on physical examination.",
        "However, comparing multiple images taken by the same modality, but in different views or according to different configurations of parameters, is a nontrivial task that requires considerable expertise and experience on the part of radiologists. Indeed, there is considerable difficulty in comparing multiple breast images or fusing information from multiple breast images. This difficulty is due in part to the images themselves, which provide non-identical, but complementary information concerning the lesion. In addition, whereas more than one lesion may be present in a patient in some cases, the totality of the lesions may not be represented on all images obtained in a study. Furthermore, lesions of the same abnormality can exhibit different characteristics in different images due to differences in view projection, imaging time, and/or contrast mechanism.",
        "In light of these difficulties, computer-based techniques are needed to correlate lesions observed on breast images acquired for a given patient either using different modalities, such as mammography, breast sonography, and MRI, or using a single modality, but different views, times, or protocols for that modality. In fact, such techniques are acutely needed since such correlations arise in numerous applications, including applications using multi-view mammograms, sonograms, or multi-modal images for breast cancer diagnosis. Such correlations also arise in applications comparing breast images in longitudinal studies for evaluation of disease diagnosis, prognosis, or patient management for both human interpretation as well as CAD methods.",
        "It is known that using at least two views of mammograms allows radiologists to better detect and evaluate breast abnormalities [1,2]. Studies have attempted to develop computer algorithms determining geometrical transformations that can establish a one-to-one mapping between two mammographic images.",
        "Image registration techniques that have been considered for matching mammogram pairs include identifying and matching control points [3] and identifying and matching inherent image landmarks, such as curves [4], regions [5], breast skin line [6,7] and nipple position [8,9] to minimize energy functions defined by intensities and contours of regions of interest [10].",
        "Several image registration techniques have been applied to detect lesions in temporal pairs of mammograms [11]. The purpose of such registration methods [12], often used to compensate for differences in breast compression, positioning and acquisition protocols on mammograms, is to aid radiologist in detecting and analyzing changes in the breast that may have occurred between the mammograms as well as new asymmetries observed between the left and right breast.",
        "Recent ultrasound-to-ultrasound breast image registration studies [13,14] have concentrated on 3-D compound images. The volumes reconstructed therein typically have deteriorated spatial resolution because of the presence of refraction artifacts and tissue mis-registration between sequential 2-D scans. Both studies use voxel-based intensity correlation coefficients between two sub-volumes to implement a deformation energy function and mutual information.",
        "There is also a need for automated classification and computer-aided diagnosis of mass lesions in breast. That is, one would like to determine as reliably as possible whether breast lesions are benign or malignant using computer-extracted features of the lesions found on mammograms or sonograms [15,16,17,18].",
        "Further, correlating lesions from two different breast mammogram views of a given modality using CAD is generally accepted as a second opinion to that of radiologists. It is highly desirable, when attempting to differentiate between benign and malignant breast lesions using a two-view mammogram or sonogram analysis, to have corresponding lesions arranged in pairs to merge information. Due to the elasticity of the breast tissue, deformation in the positioning and compression of the examination procedure vary from one examination to the other. As a result, finding the geometric relationship between breast images poses a rather daunting task.",
        "Consequently, deformable registration techniques typically require a sophisticated model to obtain consistent deformations both locally and globally. Iterative optimization techniques are often needed to estimate geometric transformation parameters. However, the similarity measurement or fitness function defined to that end is often highly non-linear and contains many local maxima. Further, these optimization techniques do not guarantee convergence to the global maximum. In addition, these techniques are often computationally very expensive and thus difficult to use in a clinical setting.",
        "Accordingly, to overcome the problems of the related art, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method, system, and medium for performing feature-based correlation of lesions in multiple images.",
        "According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method, system, and medium for correlating medical images, comprising: (1) obtaining a first medical image including a first lesion; (2) obtaining a second medical image including a second lesion; (3) determining at least one feature value for each of the first and second lesions using image data of the first and second medical images; (4) calculating, based on the determined feature values, a likelihood value indicative of a likelihood that the first and second lesions are a same lesion; and (5) outputting the determined likelihood value.",

        "According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method, system, and medium for characterizing whether lesions from a plurality of images correspond to the same lesion.",
        "According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method, system, and medium for automatically characterizing abnormalities using features that are traditionally used by radiologists in the clinical evaluation of breast masses as well as lower-level features that may not be as intuitive to the radiologist's eye-brain system. These radiographic image features emerge within embodiments of the present invention as mathematical descriptors of characteristics of mass lesions and automatically correlate, i.e., match, lesions observed on multiple breast images of the same patient.",

        "The aforementioned difficulties are mitigated by using image features associated with the lesions and developing a classification scheme for establishing lesion correspondence. That is, given two breast images, lesions are first automatically segmented from the surrounding breast tissues and a set of features (feature vector) is automatically extracted from each identified lesion. Subsequently, for every two indicated lesions that are not in the same image, a classifier will examine their features and yield the likelihood that the two lesions correspond to the same physical lesion.",
        "Image features produced by automatic segmentation that have been successful in developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancers are also useful for the task of lesion matching. An appropriate subset of features useful for discriminating corresponding and non-corresponding lesion pairs will need to be determined. The features will then be used to develop discrimination methods for automated correlating of lesions from multiple breast images.",
        "Canonical correlation is a statistical analysis for identification and quantification of associations between two sets of variables. Canonical correlation works by finding linear combinations of variables from each set, called canonical variables, such that the correlation between the two canonical variables is maximized. The advantage of this technique is to concentrate a high-dimensional relationship between the two sets of variables into a few pairs of canonical variables. According to an embodiment of the present invention, canonical correlation analysis is performed to identify a subset of features for the discrimination task.",
        "To identify useful features for discrimination, one selects features that have a higher canonical correlation coefficient generated by the same physical lesion and have a lower correlation generated by different lesions.",

These databases will now be described to facilitate an understanding of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that the use of these databases does not limit the scope of the invention in any way and the correlation analysis can be implemented for other types of medical images, such as chest radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.",

        "Dataset A contains lesion pairs obtained from patients who had two or more lesions shown on different image views. One lesion from one view was paired with the other lesion in another view, of the same patient, as a non-corresponding lesion pair. The sonographic database comprises 35 patients who had two or more lesions shown on transverse and longitudinal views, which leads to 53 non-corresponding lesion pairs. The mammographic database comprises 11 patients who had two or more lesions shown on transverse and longitudinal views, which leads to 25 non-corresponding lesion pairs.",

        "There are few patients having two or more lesions in the same breast in the non-corresponding database. The non-corresponding dataset must therefore be extended by generating lesion pairs across patients.

        "One approach to constitute these \u201cnon-matching lesion\u201d datasets is to generate all possible lesion combinations across patients with the same lesion pathology, or with the different pathology, and then randomly select 300 pairs among all possible pairs.",

        "Conventional approaches for matching lesions generally begin with an attempt to spatially align two images in order to establish a one-to-one pixel correspondence between the images. Once the images are aligned, establishing lesion correspondence can be relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, an adequate spatial alignment between two breast images is often very difficult to achieve due to the non-rigid morphology of the breast and the differences in imaging protocols. For example, breast compression is applied in obtaining mammograms but not in breast ultrasound. Moreover, it is also rather impractical to exactly reproduce the compression applied in a mammography. Therefore, a breast can exhibit significantly different shapes on two images. In addition, while an entire breast is typically imaged in mammography, only a portion of the breast is usually scanned in ultrasound, further complicating the task of spatially aligning two such breast images. These difficulties associated with the spatial alignment of breast images can be mitigated by using local image features associated with the lesions for establishing lesion correspondence. To achieve this, one can use image features produced by automatic classification schemes. These image features have been successful used in developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancers and are also suitable for the task of lesion matching.",
        "Classification has been widely applied in CAD and image analysis. Typically, once a suspicious region is detected, features characterizing the region are extracted. These features, or a subset of them, are then employed in an automatic classifier to yield an estimate of the probability of malignancy.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates generally a method for lesion matching. Instead of a geometric transformation establishing the correct one-to-one mapping between (x, y) locations in two image, an embodiment the method uses lesion characteristics automatically extracted from lesions in the two images to distinguish between corresponding and non-corresponding lesion pairs. In FIG. 3, two images are acquired in steps 301a and 301b, respectively. In steps 302a and 302b, lesions are extracted from the images by automatic segmentation from the surrounding breast tissues. This can be done using any conventional segmentation technique. Naturally, any kind of segmentation approach could also be used within the scope of the present invention. In steps 303a and 303b, feature vectors are extracted corresponding to the automatically segmented lesions. Subsequently, in step 304, a classifier evaluates the similarity between the features of the lesions. In step 305, the likelihood that the two lesions correspond to the same physical lesion is determined.",
        "The lesion-matching step performed in step 304 will now be described in more depth. Let {right arrow over (x)}1 denote the feature vector extracted for a lesion seen in one image, and let {right arrow over (x)}2 denote the feature vector extracted for a lesion seen in another image. A classifier examines the \u201csimilarity\u201d between the feature vectors {right arrow over (x)}1 and {right arrow over (x)}2 to yield an estimate of the likelihood that the two lesions correspond to the same physical lesion seen on two different images. An appropriate \u201csimilarity\u201d measure is learned from two datasets of the feature pairs, one derived from the same physical lesions seen in different images, the \u201ccorresponding dataset,\u201d and the other derived from physically different lesions seen in different images, the \u201cnon-corresponding dataset.\u201d",
        "In general, the two images can be generated either using the same imaging modality or using different imaging modalities. In both cases, the images can be taken in different views and/or using different imaging parameters. In addition, the classification task can consider multiple image features. Consider a single image feature for each image, denoted x1 and x2, respectively, in designing the classifier. Extensions to multi-element feature vectors and multi-modality lesion matching naturally fall within the scope of the present invention. The two-dimensional (2D) distributions of the feature pair (x1, x2) show that the feature pair derived from corresponding datasets exhibit a linear relationship. Therefore, in designing a classifier, applying linear regression is appropriate. Subsequently, one obtains the likelihoods for a given feature pair based on the distance from the derived regression line for pairs corresponding to the same physical lesions and for those from physically different lesions. Classification of whether two lesions seen on two images correspond to the same physical lesion is based, for example, on a likelihood ratio test. The performance of the proposed classification scheme is evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis [23].",

        "FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate the two-dimensional distribution of an image feature generated from sonographic images taken in the transverse and longitudinal views for corresponding and non-corresponding datasets. FIG. 4A relates to the sonographic image feature posterior acoustic behavior extracted from lesions seen on the transverse and longitudinal views. FIG. 4B relates to the mammographic image feature average gray value extracted from lesions seen on the MLO and CC views.",
        "A linear relationship is observed for feature pairs extracted from the corresponding dataset. In comparison, feature pairs derived from the non-corresponding dataset show a much wider spread in distribution.",
        "This difference between the spread of the distribution for the two populations can be utilized for classification. To that end, one can compute a correlation coefficient r for the 2D feature distribution generated from the corresponding dataset and a correlation coefficient r\u2032 for the distribution generated from the non-corresponding datasets. The correlation coefficient may be, for example, Pearson's coefficient.",
        "One can also obtain p-values of the derived correlation coefficients. This procedure allows the identification of a number of candidate features that may be useful for the proposed lesion-matching task. For example, one may select features that yield r\u22670.5 with p\u22660.05 while r\u2032\u22660.5.",
        "Principal component analysis (PCA) provides a useful means for identifying the linear relationship observed in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Given the joint distribution of n zero-mean random variables, z1, . . . , zn, PCA identifies the orthonormal vectors \u00ea1, . . . , \u00ean (called the principal axes) so that the distributions of {circumflex over (z)}i={right arrow over (z)}\u00b7\u00ea1, i=2, . . . , n, where {right arrow over (z)}=(z1, . . . , zn), are mutually uncorrelated. Furthermore, the distribution of {circumflex over (z)}1 has the largest variance among all unitary transforms of {right arrow over (z)}, i.e., the 1D subspace spanned by \u00ea1 contains the most significant statistical variations of the distribution.",
        "Similarly, for i=2, . . . , n, {circumflex over (z)}1 is the unitary transform of {right arrow over (z)} that has the largest variance while are statistically uncorrelated to {circumflex over (z)}1, . . . , {circumflex over (z)}i\u22121; i.e., the 1D subspace spanned by \u00ea1 contains the most statistical variations of the distribution in the subspace orthogonal to the subspace spanned by \u00ea1, . . . , \u00eai\u22121. Consider now the application of PCA to the 2D distributions of the feature pair (x1, x2) derived from the corresponding database.",
        "Before applying PCA, the mean of the distribution ( x1, x2) is calculated and subtracted from the data thereby yielding a zero-mean population ({tilde over (x)}1, {tilde over (x)}2), where {tilde over (x)}1=x1\u2212 x1 and {tilde over (x)}2=x2\u2212 x2. The most significant statistical variations of the distribution of ({tilde over (x)}1, {tilde over (x)}2) will therefore appear in the first principal axis \u00ea1. Conversely, the spread of the distribution of the feature pair derived from the corresponding dataset along the second principal axis \u00ea2 is minimized among all possible axes in the {tilde over (x)}1\u2212{tilde over (x)}2 space. However, the spread of the distribution of the feature pair derived from the non-corresponding dataset is not necessarily minimized along this axis.",
        "Therefore, a large difference in the spreads of the distributions of the two populations is likely to be observed along \u00ea2. Let \u00ea1=(e11, e12), e11\u22600.

        "After identifying the correlated feature vectors, one first uses the features from the corresponding dataset to determine \u03b20 and \u03b21 for the linear regression model. The corresponding and non-corresponding datasets are used to train the classifier.",
        "FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate the relationship between a feature obtained from two different views for the three datasets in the mammographic database and the sonographic database. FIG. 5 shows the likelihood distribution of the corresponding and non-corresponding pairs in terms of the sonographic feature posterior acoustic behavior. From these two distributions, one can calculate the likelihood ratio as a function of the distance to the regression line. Pairs of the corresponding dataset tend to have a larger likelihood ratio, yielding a likelihood ratio histogram skewed to the right, whereas pairs of the non-corresponding dataset tend to have a smaller likelihood ratio, yielding a likelihood ratio histogram skewed to the left. One can then classify whether a pair of images corresponds to the same actual lesion by performing the discrimination according to this likelihood ratio. By varying the decision variable threshold \u03a9, an ROC curve can be computed from the training process for the discrimination task. From the ROC curve, one can determine an optimal threshold value of the classifier to yield some prescribed sensitivity and specificity in the task of distinguishing between corresponding and non-corresponding pairs.",
        "The performance of this lesion-matching method can be evaluated for individual computer-extracted features by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) value of the ROC curve. ROC curves were generated for both re-substitution and round-robin analysis. The round-robin evaluation was performed to provide a more realistic estimate of the performance. In a round-robin evaluation, one of the patients is excluded from the database. That is, lesions from this patient are removed from the database and classified according to a classifier trained with the remaining lesions. This process is then repeated for each patient. For datasets generated by lesions across patients, one assumes lesions have been corresponding to a lesion and its counter-part are from the same patient and eliminates them from the training process.",
        "Tests using the corresponding dataset paired with the non-corresponding datasets A, B, and C were conducted to assess the performance of the method in distinguishing between corresponding and non-corresponding pairs. The results of the four features that yielded the four highest AUC values are summarized in Tables IV and V which displays the performance in terms of AUC of individual features for the sonographic and mammographic databases, respectively, in the task of distinguishing between corresponding and non-corresponding pairs. Independent validation was performed 11 times by randomly selecting 300 non-corresponding pairs for datasets B and C. The performance lists for these validations are average AUC values resulting from ROC analysis of each of the 11 independent trials. The standard deviations on the AUC values are given in parentheses. The posterior acoustic behavior outperformed the other features in differentiating corresponding and non-corresponding lesions identified on sonograms, yielding an AUC value ranging from 0.73 to 0.79 (0.72 to 0.78 in round robin). The average gray value outperformed others for the mammographic database, yielding an AUC value ranging from 0.68 to 0.71 (0.66 to 0.70 in round robin).",

        "FIG. 9 illustrates that the calculated canonical correlation coefficient for four sonographic features (filtered ARD, filtered margin sharpness, posterior acoustic behavior, and texture) derived from the two lesions corresponding to the same physical lesion is 0.85. In comparison, the calculated canonical correlation is 0.37 for the same features when derived from different lesions. A linear relationship can be observed for the canonical variables for features extracted from the two lesions correspond to the same physical lesion. On the other hand, the canonical variables for features derived from different lesions show a much wider spread in distribution. The observed difference in the spreads of the distributions for the two populations can be utilized for classification.",

        "Alternatively, the image data of interest may be stored in an image archiving system, such as Picture Archiving Communications System (PACS), and retrieved therefrom for processing according to the present invention. Either way, the present invention obtains the image data for subsequent processing as described before.",
        "Embodiments of the invention can modify and improve upon a system for a multimodality display workstation that displays the images as well as information derived from the images. The novel workstation can incorporate multimodality images of the same patient, automatically assess whether the same lesion is being considered across the images, and automatically relate the information calculated from one modality to that from another. For example, the lesion seen on multiple images may be characterized by mammographic feature, sonographic features, MRI features, as well as combination features. Similar lesions across modalities can be automatically retrieved from on-line multimodality reference atlases. In addition, the physical lesion can be represented on single and multi-modality distributions of malignant, benign, and other states. Further, besides presentation of computer calculated and/or generated data, novel means to display image data can also be incorporated.",

        "For the purposes of this description, an image is defined to be a representation of a physical scene, in which the image has been generated by some imaging technology. Examples of imaging technology include television or CCD cameras, or X-ray, sonar, nuclear, or ultrasound imaging devices. The initial medium on which an image is recorded could be an electronic solid-state device, a photographic film, or some other device such as a photostimulable phosphor. That recorded image could then be converted into digital form by a combination of electronic (as in the case of a CCD signal) or mechanical/optical means (as in the case of digitizing a photographic film or digitizing the data from a photostimulable phosphor). The number of dimensions that an image could have could be one (e.g., acoustic signals), two (e.g., X-ray radiological images), or more (e.g., tomosynthesis or nuclear magnetic resonance images).",
