        "The present application claims benefit of U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/586,891, filed 10 Jul. 2004. The present application is related to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/586,891, filed 10 Jul. 2004, U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,068 filed 22 Aug. 2000, U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,722 filed 19 Apr. 2002, U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,945 filed 19 Apr. 2002; all of these patents are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by this reference.",
        "This invention relates to methods and apparatus for measuring substantially correct parameter data for processing workpieces, more particularly, to processing workpieces for electronic device fabrication.",
        "The processing of workpieces for the production of high value products requires accurate measurements of the process parameters for optimization and precise control of the processing steps. The accuracy and reliability of the parameter measurements are critical factors in determining the process capability and product yield.",
        "Descriptions of some of the available technologies and sensor apparatuses for measuring process parameters are available in the technical and patent literature. Examples of some of the technologies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,945, U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,722, U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,068, U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,835, U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,121, U.S. Pat.

No. 5,907,820; all of these patents are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by this reference.",
        "Some of the available technologies use an electronics module that is coupled to the detectors on a support; the sensors and electronics module are part of a single unit that is exposed to the process conditions that are to be measured. The electronics module is necessary for a sensor apparatus with capabilities such as autonomous information processing capability, wireless communication capability, and other electronically controlled on-board capabilities. For some applications, the presence of the electronics module can produce distortions in the parameter measurements.",
        "Of course, the module distortion effect may be ignored if a high degree of measurement accuracy is unnecessary. However, some of the critical process steps required for processing high-value workpieces such as semiconductor wafers for electronic devices and optical devices and substrates for flatpanel display fabrication do indeed require high accuracy for the measurements of the process parameters. For such applications, measurements of a parameter such as temperature need to be extremely accurate, particularly for temperature uniformity across the area of the workpiece. Furthermore, applications involved with the manufacture, calibration, research, and development of process equipment for processing high value substrates require high accuracy measurements since the operation of the equipment can be limited by the accuracy of the measurements. Inaccurate data can result in the loss of millions of dollars of product in some instances. Alternatively, the inaccurate data can result in the production of products having poorer performance because the process conditions were optimized based on the inaccurate data.",
        "There are numerous applications requiring high accuracy methods and apparatuses for obtaining data such as spatially resolved and/or time resolved process parameter measurements with low parameter distortion. An example of an important application is the uniform processing of workpieces such as semiconductor wafers, flatpanel displays, and lithography masks. Furthermore, there is a need for high accuracy methods and apparatus capable of collecting process data in a substantially nonperturbing manner on process equipment running realistic process conditions.",
        "This invention seeks to provide methods and apparatus that can improve the accuracy of measured parameter data used for processing workpieces. One aspect of the present invention includes methods of measuring process conditions with low distortion of the measurements caused by the measuring apparatus. The measurements include data for applications such as data for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing processes and process tools. Another aspect of the present invention includes apparatus for measuring substantially correct data for applications such as generating data for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing processes and process tools.",
        "It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. In addition, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.",
        "As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods, and systems for carrying out aspects of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.",

        "Reference is now made to FIG. 1 where there is shown a block diagram for a sensor apparatus 100 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Sensor apparatus 100 is configured so as to be capable of measuring parameter data for processing a workpiece. Sensor apparatus 100 includes a base 110, a sensor, preferably a plurality of sensors 120 supported on or in the base, and an electronics module 130. Electronics module 130 includes electronic components 134 and an electronics module support structure 138. In a preferred embodiment, electronic components 134 contain an information processor and additional electronic components that may be needed for the operation of the information processor. In general, electronics module 130 may contain a power source for the information processor. Electronics module 130 may also contain components for transmitting and receiving information such as, for example, components for wireless communication. Preferably, electronics module 130 comprises a printed circuit board for interconnecting the components of the electronics module and connecting the electronics module to the at least one sensor or sensors 120. Sensors 120 are connected with the information processor so as to allow signals generated by sensors 120 to be provided as input to the information processor. In other words, one embodiment of the present invention is an electronics module obtained using a method of interconnecting the components of the electronics module and connecting the electronics module to sensors 120.",
        "Optionally, for some embodiments of the present invention for semiconductor processing applications, base 110 comprises a semiconductor wafer. Similarly, for flatpanel display applications, base 110 may comprise a flatpanel display substrate; for lithography mask applications, base 110 may comprise a lithography mask substrate. In preferred embodiments, base 110 is a structure such as a semiconductor wafer, a lithography mask substrate, and a flat panel display substrate. Generally, based 110 is configured so as to substantially mimic the workpiece; more preferably, base 110 comprises the workpiece.",
        "Sensors 120 are designed to provide an electrical signal proportional to some basic, local process parameter that is representative of the process and process tool. Examples of process parameters of importance for applications such as semiconductor processing and flatpanel display processing include temperature, bow, stress/strain, etch rate, deposition rate, radio frequency (RF) field, plasma potential, thermal flux, ion flux, electromagnetic flux such as light, and any process parameter that is a function of temperature or is affected by temperature of the sensor apparatus.",
        "Examples of typical sensor types include: Resistance Temperature Device (RTD) sensors for temperature measurement; thermistors for temperature measurement; defined area probes for measuring plasma potential and measuring ion flux; Van der Pauw crosses for measuring etch rate; isolated field transistors for measuring plasma potential; and current loops for measuring ion flux and measuring RF field. The numbers and types of sensors are selected based upon the specific application and process requirements.",
        "For the case of measuring temperatures using a sensor apparatus, the presence of the electronics module will distort the temperature field being measured. It is possible to reduce the distortion by reducing the amount of energy flow into the electronics module from base 110, by reducing the thermal capacity of the electronics module and increasing the thermal resistance between base 110 and electronics module 130. The reduction of thermal capacity of electronics module 130 can be implemented by a) using very small components in the electronics components 134, thereby reducing module's overall size and hence thermal capacity, b) reducing the surface area and thickness of the electronics module support 138, again reducing thermal capacity, c) providing for open sides in the electronics module support 138, providing for no trapped gas and allowing convective heating of the exposed components. Additionally, convective heating of the electronic components 134 reduces the amount of energy drawn directly from base 110. The increase of the thermal resistance between base 110 and electronics module 130 can be implemented by a) reduction of surface contact area and elimination of adhesives between electronics module support 138 and base 110, b) reduction of the surface contact area between the electronic components 134 and the electronics module support 138. In reality, the module distortion effect cannot be entirely removed. However, embodiments of the present invention provide methods and apparatus for minimizing the distortion effect.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, electronics module support structure 138 is configured so as to have a low thermal capacity and high thermal resistance relative to the base 110 for temperature equilibration for electronics module 130. As a consequence, electronics module support structure 138 is configured so as to maximize the time constant for the temperature equilibration for electronic components 134. Configuring electronics module 130 so as to have a low thermal mass minimizes the possible magnitude of the temperature distortion. Configuring electronics module 130 so as to have a longer time constant for temperature equilibration reduces the amplitude of the distortion and reduces the rate of heating of electronic components 134. This means that by lengthening the time constant one can improve the sensor performance during the early transient heating phase, and typically conclude the entire measurement cycle before electronic components 134 have reached undesirably high temperatures. In other words, the impact of the temperature distortion is suppressed so as to leave the transient temperature or temperature related information substantially unperturbed.",
        "In another embodiment of the present invention, electronics module support structure 138 is configured so that the support structure has at least one of: a thermal resistance so that the measurements are substantially unperturbed by the presence of the electronics module and the electronics module is substantially undamaged by heat transferred from the base to the electronics module; and a thermal mass so that the measurements from the sensors are substantially unperturbed by the presence of the electronics module. The electronics module is configured so as to have heat transfer properties and heat capacity properties sufficient to substantially prevent thermal distortion of measurements made by the sensors.",
        "For some applications, there may be a consequence as a result of the high thermal resistance between base 110 and electronics module 130 caused by the increased time constant for temperature equilibration of electronic components 134. More specifically, the electronics module may remain at temperatures that are different from those of the base. This temperature difference may be undesirable for some applications. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the properties of the electronics module are selected so that the electronics module reaches an equilibrium temperature that is substantially the same as the temperature of the base while exchanging a minimum amount of heat with the base. In one arrangement, the electronics module may draw heat by convection from surrounding gas.",
        "For one embodiment of the present invention, electronic components 134 include a battery for providing power to the information processor and other electronic components needing power. Some commercially available batteries suitable for use in embodiments of the present invention are temperature sensitive. For example, some batteries cannot operate at high temperatures; the performance of some batteries is eroded by rapid temperature variations of the battery. Other elements of electronic components 134 may also be temperature sensitive. In other words, it is preferable in sensor apparatus technology to avoid high temperatures or rapid temperature excursions for electronics module 134. Configuring electronics module 130 so as to have a long time constant for temperature equilibration helps to alleviate some of the problems with the temperature sensitivity of electronic components 134; this benefit is achieved in addition to reducing the temperature distortion of the measurements as a result of the presence of the electronics module. This also means that a temperature sensitive battery is now only slowly heated and cooled, thus prolonging the battery lifetime and reducing the cost of ownership for the sensor apparatus.",

This arrangement provides a substantially flexible connection with the base that would be difficult to achieve using a rigid circuit board or a rigid housing for the electronics module. Consequently, the substantially flexible connection with the base reduces the amount of thermal stresses generated between the base and the electronics module. The reduced thermal stresses also reduce effects such as warpage of the base that could occur for a rigid electronics module for which the thermal expansion does not match that of the base.

For applications that involve a gas flow across the surface of a workpiece, the sides without walls can be oriented so as to minimize the disruption of gas flow across the surface of the sensor apparatus; as a result, the sensor apparatus will have surface gas flow dynamics that are more closely matched to the surface gas flow dynamics of a workpiece, which does not have an electronics module.

Elongated ribbon cable 224 is extended so that flexible circuit board 226 can be disposed away from substrate support 244; for this embodiment, flexible circuit board 226 is supported on robot arm 252.",
        "In this configuration, flexible circuit board 226 is sufficiently far away so that base 112 can be heated to high temperatures or subjected to possibly other process conditions that would be harsh for commonly used electronic devices without causing significant damage to electronic components on flexible circuit board 226. The sensor apparatus can be used to measure process conditions without significant modifications to the process tool; the sensor apparatus is fully contained within the process tool while the measurements are being made. Alternative methods of using embodiments of the present invention will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art. Some of the available alternatives will be determined by the configuration of the process tool and the requirements for performing the measurements. For other configurations, a sufficiently large process chamber may allow circuit board 226 to be placed in the process chamber during the measurements and still allow for circuit board 226 to be placed sufficiently far from exposure to harsh process conditions.",

For some technologies, this methodology is referred to as chamber matching. Specifically, it is typically preferable for multiple process chambers performing the same process to provide substantially the same process results. This means that each chamber needs to produce substantially the same process conditions for workpieces.
