In this liquid crystal display apparatus, on the inner side face (i.e., the face on the side of a liquid crystal layer) of one of two opposite substrates with a liquid crystal layer between them, there are formed post spacers for retaining a cell gap from the other substrate.",
        "In the liquid crystal display apparatus disclosed in the publication of the related art, however, when the liquid crystal layer between the two substrates expands with the heat coming from a back light, a variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer may occur to cause the mura defect.",
        "Therefore, the invention helps provide a liquid crystal display apparatus which can suppress the mura defect.",
        "According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid crystal display apparatus comprising: a first substrate including a first film formed; a second substrate confronting the first substrate and including a second film having first protrusions formed on a face facing the first substrate to contact with the first film; a frame-shaped sealant interposed between the first and second substrates and along the edges of the first and second substrates; and a liquid crystal layer enclosed by the frame-shaped sealant and formed in regions between the first and second films. The sealant fixes the first and second substrates such that the first substrate bulges toward the liquid crystal layer.",
        "According to the invention, it is possible to suppress the mura defect effectively during the operation of the liquid crystal display apparatus.",

        "First of all, a liquid crystal display apparatus according to the embodiment will be described in the following.",
        "The image display apparatus according to the embodiment is provided with a liquid crystal panel LCD, which displays an image, as shown in FIG. 4.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, this liquid crystal panel LCD includes: a pair of opposite transparent substrates (of glass, plastics or the like) 10 and 20; a sealant 30 which fixes the frame-shaped edge region in the inner face (i.e., the face on the side of the substrate 20) 10A of the transparent substrate 10 on the inner face (i.e., the face on the side of the substrate 10) of the other transparent substrate 20; drivers (or terminals, to which signals from a driver chip are inputted) 50 formed in the edge regions along two sides of the inner face of one transparent substrate 20; and a liquid crystal 40 which is sealed between the transparent substrates 10 and 20.",
        "In the sealant 30, there are fitted fibers (e.g., glass fibers) 31 of a suitable diameter, which extend along the sealant 30 so as to control the spacing between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20.",
        "At least one of the paired transparent substrates 10 and 20 is fixed on the sealant 30 so that it stay a state in which it has been bended convexly to the liquid crystal 40 by the pressure applied at a substrate assembling step. Specifically, the sealant 30 existing on at least one of the four sides of the liquid crystal panel constrains the edge portions of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 so that the spacing between the inner sides 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 may become gradually narrower from the edges of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 toward a interface 30A between the sealant 30 and the liquid crystal layer 40 (i.e., so that the spacing may satisfy the following Relation (1)):\n\nh3a<h3b\u2003\u2003(1).",
        "Here, h3b designates the spacing between the inner faces 10A and 20A at the edge position of the transparent substrates, and h3a designates the spacing between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates at a position closer to the interface 30A between the sealant 30 and the liquid crystal layer 40 than the edge position of the transparent substrates.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, one transparent substrate 10 of the two transparent substrates is provided on its inner face 10A with a multi-layered film 11 including a color film, and the other transparent substrate 20 is provided on its inner face 20A with a multi-layered film 21 containing the TFTs. Here, the structures of the multi-layered films 11 and 21 are omitted in FIG. 2.",
        "The multi-layered film 21 of one transparent substrate 20 is provided with a plurality of protrusions 21A which function as a spacer for restricting the deformations of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 toward the liquid crystal 40, in image display regions A (i.e., the regions in which pixel regions 54 enclosed by drain lines 51 and gate lines 52 and passed by common electrode signal lines 53 and a color filter exist in a matrix shape so that the image is displayed by the transmission of light) and in an image non-display regions B (i.e., the regions which are located between the image display regions A and the sealant 30 so that the image is not displayed). Moreover, the multi-layered film 11 of the other transparent substrate 10 is so formed that a film thickness t1 at positions facing the individual protrusions 21A in the image display regions A is smaller than a film thickness t2 at positions facing the individual protrusions 21A in the image non-display regions B.",
        "Here, the plural protrusions are formed on the multi-layered film 21 containing the TFTs and the thickness of the multi-layered film 11 including the color filter layer is made smaller in the image display regions A than in the image non-display regions B. However, it is not necessary to do so.",
        "For example, to the contrary of FIG. 2, the plural protrusions may be formed on the multi-layered film 11 including the color filter layer, and the thickness of the multi-layered film 21 containing the TFTs may be smaller in the image display regions A than in the image non-display regions B. Moreover, the protrusions in the image non-display regions B and the image display regions A may also be formed on the multi-layered film 11.",
        "The thicknesses of those multi-layered films 11 and 21 have the following Relations (2):\n\nt1+T1<t2+T2<t3+d+T3\u2003\u2003(2).",
        "Here:",
        "T1: the thickness of the multi-layered film 21 at the protrusion positions in the image display regions A;",
        "T2: the thickness (=T1) of the multi-layered film 21 at the protrusion positions in the image non-display regions B;",
        "T3: the thickness of the multi-layered film 21 in regions C forming the sealant 30;",
        "d: the diameter of the fibers 31; and",
        "t3: the thickness of the multi-layered film 11 in the regions C forming the sealant 30.",
        "As a result, the spacing between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 is so gradually narrowed from the edges of the transparent substrates 10 and 20 toward the image display regions A as to satisfy the following Relations (3), and is substantially constant in the image display regions A:\n\nh1<h2<h3\u2003\u2003(3).",
        "Here:",
        "h1: the spacing in the image display regions A between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20;",
        "h2: the spacing in the image non-display regions B between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20; and",
        "h3: the spacing in the regions C forming the sealant 30 between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the transparent substrates 10 and 20.",
        "The structure thus made can suppress the variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer 40 for the following reasons so that it can prevent the mura defect, as might otherwise be caused by the heat coming from a back light.",
        "Under pressure applied at the substrate assembling step, the individual transparent substrates 10 and 20 are deformed convexly toward each other using the fibers 31 of the sealant 30 in the regions C as a support point, as indicated by a broken curve in FIG. 3. However, this deformation is restricted at the positions of the protrusions in the image display regions A and in the image non-display regions B. As the sealant 30 becomes hardened, the edge portions of the two transparent substrates 10 and 20 are restrained while keeping their shapes under pressure by the sealant 30. As a result, the two transparent substrates 10 and 20 put the forces in the directions to compress the protrusions 21A to each other, after the pressure is released.",
        "As indicated by a solid curve in FIG. 3, therefore, the variation in the positions of the inner faces of the transparent substrates within the image display regions A is suppressed, so that variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer 40 can be resultantly suppressed.",
        "In the image non-display regions B in which the spacing between the inner faces 10A and 20A of the two transparent substrates 10 and 20 are larger than in the image display regions A, the multi-layered film 11 of the transparent substrate 10 is accordingly thicker. In the image non-display regions B, therefore, the multi-layered film 11 of the transparent substrate 10 will not be excessively away from the protrusions 21A of the multi-layered film 21 of the transparent substrate 20. As a result, the thickness fluctuation in the liquid crystal film 20 can be prevented, which is caused by the partial deformation of the transparent substrate, even if the image non-display regions B are touched by the user, for example.",
        "In a case the percentage of width of the image non-display regions B to that of the image display regions A is equal or smaller than a predetermined value, it is not necessarily essential that the thickness of the multi-layered film 11 be made larger in the image non-display regions B than in the image display regions A.",
        "According to the liquid crystal panel of this embodiment, therefore, the mura defect can be suppressed, as described above.",
        "A method for manufacturing a liquid crystal panel having such structure above will be described.",
        "FIG. 13 is a flow chart showing a process for manufacturing a liquid crystal display apparatus having the liquid crystal panel of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, from a sealant printing step to a sealing step.",
        "Two transparent substrates (hereinafter, called to as \u201cmother substrates\u201d) 100 and 200 capable of taking the one-side substrates for the four liquid crystal panel are prepared, as shown in FIG. 5, and are subjected to a predetermined pretreatment such as a rinsing treatment to these mother substrates 100 and 200. In FIG. 5: broken lines 50 designate cutting plane lines for defining the regions (hereinafter, called to as \u201cpanel regions\u201d) to become one-side substrates of the individual liquid crystal panels; regions d other than the panel regions are the regions (hereinafter, called to as \u201ccut regions\u201d) to be cut off at a panel cutting step; regions a in the individual panel regions are the regions to become the image display regions A of the individual liquid crystal panels; regions b are the regions to become the image non-display regions B of the individual liquid crystal panels; and regions enclosing the regions b in the individual panel regions are the regions to become the sealant forming regions C of the individual liquid crystal panels.",
        "Here, the dotted lines and the broken lines shown in FIG. 5 are virtual lines which are not actually formed in the mother boards. Moreover, here is enumerated an example, in which the four transparent substrates for the liquid crystal panels are taken from the mother substrates 100 and 200. The number of the substrates to be taken from the mother substrates 100 and 200 are determined according to the aspect ratios of the mother substrates 100 and 200 and the aspect ratios (or the screen sizes) of the liquid crystal panels.",
        "On the one-side face (hereinafter, called to as \u201cpattern forming face\u201d) of one mother substrate 200, there is formed a multi-layered film 21\u2032, as shown in FIG. 6. This multi-layered film 21\u2032 is composed of: (1) RGB color filter films 22 disposed for individual sub-pixels in the individual regions a; (2) grid-shaped black matrix films 23 formed in the individual regions b between the color filter films 22; (3) an overcoat film 24 covering the pattern forming face side of the mother substrate 200 entirely as the upper layer film above the black matrix films 23 and the color filter films 22; (4) post-shaped films 25 of an organic substance (or an inorganic substance) formed at positions confronting the black matrix films 23 across the overcoat film 24 and at positions in the cut regions d; and (5) an alignment layer 26 covering the overcoat film 24 in the regions a and b.",

        "On the one-side face (hereinafter, called to as \u201cpattern forming face\u201d) of the other mother substrate 100, there is formed a multi-layered film 11\u2032, as shown in FIG. 7. Thus multi-layered film 11\u2032 is composed of: (1) gate lines 12; (2) drain lines (not shown); (3) an insulating film 13 covering as the upper layer above the gate lines 12 the pattern forming face side of the mother substrate 100 entirely; (4) an amorphous silicon film 14 of the TFTs formed at positions confronting the terminals 12A of the gate lines 12 in the regions a across the insulating film 13; (5) an amorphous silicon film 14A formed at positions confronting the terminals 12A of the gate lines 12 in the regions b across the insulating film 13; (6) an organic film (or an inorganic film) 15A interposed only between the amorphous silicon film 14 and the insulating film 13 in the individual regions b; (7) a protective film 19 covering as the upper layer above the amorphous silicon film 14 the pattern forming side of the mother substrate 100 entirely; (8) transparent electrodes 18 formed at positions confronting the amorphous silicon film 14 across the protective film 19; (9) an alignment layer 16 covering as the upper layer above the transparent electrodes 18 the regions a and b; and (10) an organic film (or an inorganic film) 15B formed in the cut regions d along the individual sides of the regions b so that the film thickness t4 in the cut regions d is larger than that t2 in the regions b.",
        "This multi-layered film 11\u2032 contains the organic film (or the inorganic film) 15A existing only in the regions b so that its film thickness is larger in the regions b than in the regions a. Moreover, the multi-layered film 11\u2032 contains the organic film (or the inorganic film) 15B formed only in the cut regions d so that its thickness is far larger in the cut regions d than in the regions b.",
        "Here, the organic film (or the inorganic film) 15A may have a frame-shaped pattern (excepting the liquid crystal injection port) enclosing the regions a, as shown in FIG. 8, or may have a circular or rectangular pattern formed only at positions confronting the individual post-shaped films 25 of the other mother substrate 20\u2032.

        "Next, the sealant 30 of a thermoset or UV-set type containing the fibers 31 kneaded is applied (at S1) to the individual regions c (although the portion for the liquid crystal injection port is excluded) in the pattern forming face of either of those two mother substrates 100 and 200. The fibers 31 to be used have the diameter d satisfying the following conditions:\n\n(t2+T2)\u2212(T3+t3)<d\u2266(T4+t4)\u2212(T3+t3).",

        "After this, the individual panel regions are positioned, as shown in FIG. 9, to superpose the pattern forming faces of the two mother substrates 100 and 200. Moreover, the sealant 30 is set (at S2) by heating it or by irradiating it with an ultraviolet ray while applying a load to the two superposed mother substrates 100 and 200 in the direction to press the contact face between the multi-layered films 11\u2032 and 21\u2032 . As a result, the two mother substrates 100 and 200 are fixed, as indicated by a broken curve in FIG. 10, such that the individual image display regions A or the like bend convexly to the other substrate and such that cut regions D bend convexly outward.",
