        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having an SOI structure isolating elements from each other by an isolation film such as a partial insulator film partially leaving an SOI layer and a method of manufacturing the same.",
        "2. Description of the Background Art",
        "For example, each of \u201cY. Hirano et al., IEEE 1999 SOI conf., p 131\u201d (Reference 1), Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-243973 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/466934: Reference 2) and Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-39484 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/639953: Reference 3) discloses a semiconductor device having a conventional SOI structure (may hereinafter be referred to as \u201cpartially isolated body fixed SOI structure\u201d) isolating elements from each other by an isolation film such as a partial insulator film partially leaving an SOI layer and fixing the potential of a body region.",
        "In such a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure, however, it is difficult to form a semiconductor element such as a MOSFET while precisely controlling body resistance. The reason therefor is now described in detail.",
        "FIG. 33 is a sectional view for illustrating a problem of the conventional partially isolated body fixed SOI structure. As shown in FIG. 33, an SOI layer 3 is formed on an embedded oxide film 2 present on a silicon substrate (not shown), and subjected to element isolation by a partial oxide film 31. The partial oxide film 31 is formed to leave a well region 11, which is a lower part of the SOI layer 3, under the same.",
        "A channel forming region 7 is formed in a transistor forming region of the SOI layer 3, so that a gate oxide film 8 and a gate electrode 9 are successively formed on the channel forming region 7.",
        "On the other hand, a body region 10 is provided oppositely to the channel forming region 7 through the partial oxide film 31, and this body region 10 is electrically connected with the channel forming region 7 through the well region 11 located under the partial oxide film 31 since the well region 11 is in contact with the body region 10 and the channel forming region 7 respectively.",
        "In order to form a source/drain region of a MOS transistor, S/D impurity ions 19 are implanted through the gate electrode 9 etc. serving as masks as shown in FIG. 33, while no mask is provided (no resist film is formed) on the partial oxide film 31 in general.",
        "When forming the source/drain region, therefore, the S/D impurity ions 19 may be partially implanted into the well region 11 located under the partial oxide film 31 to increase the resistance value of body resistance, which is the resistance of the well region 11 reaching the channel forming region 7 from the body region 10, disadvantageously resulting in unstable high-speed operation of the MOS transistor.",
        "As the S/D=purity ions 19 for forming the source/drain region, As (arsenic) ions are implanted under conditions of 50 keV (injection energy) and 4\u00d71015/cm2 (dose), for example.",
        "FIG. 34 is a graph showing the impurity profile of As implanted under the aforementioned conditions. As shown in FIG. 34, the impurity profile has standard deviation a (=8.5 nm) with reference to 26 nm, reaching a range of 51.5 nm (=26+3\u03c3(nm)).",
        "When the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 is reduced to about 50 nm, therefore, the impurity ions 19 of As disadvantageously reach the well region 11. Also when the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 is slightly larger than 50 nm, the As ions may still be implanted into the partial oxide film 31 since the tail part of the impurity profile is deeper than 51.5 nm.",
        "In order to reduce a leakage current from a silicide region of CoSi2 (cobalt silicide) or the like, P (phosphorus) is implanted under conditions of about 30 to 50 keV and about 1\u00d71013/cm2. However, P has a higher possibility of reaching the well region 11 than As, due to a range deeper than that of As.",
        "When trench isolation is employed, the partial oxide film 31 is formed by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Therefore, the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 is remarkably dispersed by about \u00b130 nm, for example, depending on pattern density or the position in a wafer surface.",
        "Therefore, the partial oxide film 31 must be formed while setting a margin in consideration of the aforementioned dispersion. When the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 is so set that the As ions 19 for forming the source/drain region are not implanted into the well region 11 located under the partial oxide film 31, however, an isolation step 32 between the surface of the SOI layer 3, which is the surface of the SOI substrate, and the surface of the partial oxide film 31 reaches an unignorable level, as shown in FIG. 35.",
        "Consequently, a residue 33 may be left on a side surface of the partial oxide film 31 as shown in FIG. 35. If an etching time for gate formation is increased for preventing formation of the residue 33, the gate oxide film 8 is disadvantageously damaged and reduced in reliability.",
        "FIG. 36 is a plan view of a semiconductor device having the conventional partially separated body fixed SOI structure. FIG. 33 is a sectional view taken along the line C-C in FIG. 36. When an N-type impurity is implanted for forming the source/drain region, an N+ block region 40 covering the overall body region 10 is masked with a resist film or the like, so that the N-type impurity is not implanted into the P-type body region 10.",
        "As shown in FIG. 36, the N+ block region 40 is generally formed in the minimum necessary size for reliably covering the body region 10, so that the gate oxide film 8 is not charged and statically damaged by a charge-up phenomenon.",
        "When a P-type impurity is implanted into the body region 10, on the other hand, a P+ block region 39 entirely covering an N-type drain region 5 and an N-type source region 6 is masked with a resist film or the like, so that the P-type impurity is not implanted into the drain region 5 and the source region 6.",
        "As shown in FIG. 36, further, the P30  block region 39 is generally formed in the minimum necessary size for reliably covering the drain region 5 and the source region 6, for a reason similar to that for the N+ block region 40.",
        "As hereinabove described, the source/drain region and the body region 10 are formed while masking the N+ block region 40 and the P30  block region 39 respectively, and hence it follows that both of the N- and P-type impurities are implanted into regions other than the N+ block region 40 and the P30  block region 39.",
        "Consequently, the impurities are implanted into the well region 11 electrically connecting the body region 10 with the channel forming region 7 (not illustrated in FIG. 36 but present in the SOI layer 3 located under the gate electrode 9 as shown in FIG. 33), to cause such inconvenience that the resistance value of the body resistance RI of the well region 11 reaching the channel forming region 7 from the body region 10 is increased or dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to precisely control the body resistance RI.",
        "When the resistance value of the body resistance RI is increased, the threshold voltage of the transistor fluctuates to disadvantageously resulting in unstable operation. This problem is disclosed in \u201cS. Maeda et al., IEEE Transaction on Electron Devices, vol. 45, No. 7, pp. 1479 to 1486 (1998)\u201d, for example.",
        "The body resistance serves as a noise source increasing noise of the transistor. When a circuit such as a PLL (phase locked loop) circuit is formed by a transistor having unstable body resistance, therefore, phase noise (phase jitter) is disadvantageously increased.",

Referring to FIG. 12, side walls 13 are formed on the side surfaces of a gate electrode 9.",
        "Considering dispersion in CMP treatment (the step of FIG. 6), the isolation step of about \u00b130 nm fluctuates. Therefore, the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 changes in the range of 80\u00b130 nm, i.e., 50 to 110 nm, to reach 50 nm at the worst so that an N-type impurity is disadvantageously implanted into the partial oxide film 31 to reduce body resistance. According to the manufacturing method of the embodiment 1, however, no N-type impurity is implanted into the well region 11 located under the gate-directional extension region 41a also in this case, and hence the aforementioned inconvenience can be avoided.",
        "FIG. 13 is an explanatory diagram showing a collapse phenomenon of the partial oxide film 31. In general, a region of the partial oxide film 31 into which both of N- and P-type impurities are implanted is scraped in advance of the remaining region in wet etching, and hence the thickness of this region is reduced by a collapse phenomenon as shown in FIG. 13. Referring to FIG. 13, an oxide film 4a and a silicon nitride film 4b form an interlayer isolation film 4, and a silicon nitride film 13b forms the side wall 13.",
        "Exemplary wet etching is dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment or APM (ammonia-hydrogen peroxide mixture) cleaning employing a mixed solution of ammonia (NH4OH), aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pure water (H2O), and the dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment is carried out for removing a TEOS oxide film forming the side wall 13 or the like, for example.",
        "Consequently, the effective thickness of the well region 11 is reduced due to extension 37 of a depletion layer, and hence the body resistance is disadvantageously increased. Therefore, the collapse phenomenon is preferably suppressed to the minimum.",

        "As shown in FIG. 14, only the N+ block region 40 is masked against implantation of an N-type impurity, and hence the N-type impurity is disadvantageously implanted into most parts of the partial oxide films 31 to cause the aforementioned collapse phenomenon in regions A5 to A7.",
        "FIG. 15 is a sectional view showing a sectional structure of the semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure manufactured by the method according to the embodiment 1. The section shown in FIG. 15 is taken along the line C-C in FIG. 10.",
        "As shown in FIG. 15, the N+ block region 41 wider than the N+ block region 40 by the gate-directional extension region 41a is masked against implantation of an N-type impurity, to result in the aforementioned collapse phenomenon in regions AS and A7, similarly to the prior art. However, the collapse phenomenon can be avoided in a region A6, which is masked by the gate-directional extension region 41a against implantation of the N-type impurity. In other words, the partial oxide film 31 located under the N+ block resist film 51 is an N-type impurity-free region containing no N-type impurity, and hence no collapse phenomenon takes place in the region A6.",

        "In a well region 11, a body resistance path 36 on a longitudinal extension of the gate electrode 9 has substantially no high resistance forming region into which both of N- and P-type impurities may be implanted, as shown in FIG. 17. In other words, the well region 11 reaching a channel forming region 7 forming a transistor forming region from the body region 10 defines a P-type impurity region mixed with no N-type impurity.",
        "The gate electrode 9 generally having a thickness of about 200 nm can reliably block implantation of an impurity such as As implanted at 50 keV or P implanted at 40 keV. Therefore, the well region 11 located on the longitudinal extension of the gate electrode 9 is reliably blocked against implantation of the N-type impurity by the N+ block resist film 52 and the gate electrode 9.",

        "According to this method, reduction of the thickness of a partial oxide film 31 can be prevented in the overlapping portions of the gate extension region 9f and the P30  implantation region 46, for stabilizing body resistance at a low value.",
        "Also when the gate extension region 9e is formed, the thickness of the partial oxide film 31 located under the gate extension region 9e is not reduced by wet etching performed after formation of the gate electrode 9, whereby the degree of fluctuation of the body resistance due to influence exerted by a gate voltage on a well region forming a body resistance path 36 can be reduced.",
        "FIG. 32 is a plan view showing a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure according to an embodiment 12 of the present invention.",
        "As shown in FIG. 32, an N+ implantation region 60 is provided on the minimum necessary region for implanting an N-type impurity into source/drain regions 5 and 6, while a partial region located on a longitudinal extension of a gate electrode 9 is extended toward a gate contact region 9c for forming a P30  implantation region 47 in addition to the minimum necessary region for implanting a P-type impurity into a body region 10.",
        "Further, a dummy N+ implantation region 71 is provided on the minimum necessary region for implanting an N-type impurity into a P30  dummy region 73, and a dummy P30  implantation region 72 is provided on the minimum necessary region for implanting a P-type impurity into an N+ dummy region 74.",
        "The N+ implantation region 60 and the dummy N+ implantation region 71 indicate open regions of a first resist film in implantation of the N-type impurity ions 17 shown in FIG. 8, while the P30  implantation region 47 and the dummy P30  implantation region 72 indicate open regions of a second resist film in implantation of the P-type impurity ions 18 shown in FIG. 9.",
        "In the manufacturing method according to the embodiment 12, a precisely controllable semiconductor device having a partially isolated body fixed SOI structure can be obtained without increasing the resistance value of body resistance due to an effect similar to that of the embodiment 7.",
        "In addition, the number of manufacturing steps is not increased beyond that of the prior art, similarly to the manufacturing method according to the embodiment 7.",
        "Further, a resist film forming area can be further reduced due to the dummy N+ implantation region 71 and the dummy P30  implantation region 72. The possibility of statically damaging a gate oxide film 8 etc. by a charge-up phenomenon can be more suppressed than the embodiments 7 to 11.",
        "Further, the dummy N+ implantation region 71 and the dummy P30  implantation region 72, which may be automatically rectangularly formed similarly to a formation rule for the P30  dummy region 73 and the N+ dummy region 74 (formed for homogenizing pattern density for CMP, for example), can be relatively readily designed.",
        "While the dummy N+ implantation region 71 and the dummy P30  implantation region 72 are separately provided for the first and second resist films in the example shown in FIG. 32, the dummy implantation regions may alternatively be provided on the same position in the same shape between the first and second resist films, to be shared as a dummy N+P30  implantation region.",
        "If both of N- and P-type impurities are implanted into this dummy region, inconvenience such as separation of a silicide region may take place. Therefore, the dummy N+ implantation region 71 and the dummy P30  implantation region 72 are preferably separately provided without overlapping with each other as shown in FIG. 32, so that only one of the N- and P-type impurities is implanted into each dummy region.",
        "While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention."
