    "description": [
        "Computer systems may have main memory operated in a mirrored mode, meaning that two sets of main memory contents may be maintained within the computer. Should one of the sets of main memory contents fail as indicated, for example, by an uncorrectable error, the computer system may continue operating using the mirrored or second set, rather than experiencing a computer system failure. Computer systems operating mirrored main memory may implement the mirroring feature across two independent memory boards. Thus, if memory on one memory board experiences a failure, the computer system may continue to operate (in a non-mirrored state) using the remaining functional memory board while the failed memory board may be removed, repaired and/or replaced.",
        "After initial insertion of a new or repaired memory board in a computer system designed to operate in mirrored mode, the newly inserted board may not have a complete copy of the main memory contents. The computer system may copy the data and programs, on a location-by-location basis, from the active memory board to a corresponding location in the new memory board. Because of the location-by-location copying, it may be necessary to operate main memory boards having the same amount of memory. Expanding the amount of main memory in a computer system designed to operate mirrored main memory may therefore require powering down the computer system and adding memory to the memory boards. Thus, it may not be possible to add main memory to a computer system while in operation, because at some point one of the memory boards may have a different amount of memory.",

        "The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. The embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted or otherwise used as limiting the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, unless otherwise specified. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application. The discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to these embodiments.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a computer system 100 implemented in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In particular, the computer system 100 may comprise a plurality of central processing units (CPUs or processors) 2A-D coupled to a main memory, which may be implemented using memory arrays on one or more memory boards 4, 6. The processors 2 may couple to the memory array on each memory board 4, 6 by way of a bridge logic unit 8. In the exemplary computer system 100, the bridge logic unit 8 may be termed \u201cNorth Bridge\u201d based on its location in computer system drawings. The processors may be Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae 4 XEON processors, or Itanium\u2122 processors; however, any suitable processor or array of processors may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The system 100 may be implemented using only a signal processor, if desired. The processors 2 may couple to the North Bridge 8 by way of a host bus 10.",
        "The main memory on memory boards 4, 6 may couple to the North Bridge 8 through a memory bus 12. North Bridge 8 may comprise a memory control unit (not shown) that controls transactions to the main memory on memory boards 4, 6 by sending the necessary control signals during memory accesses. The main memory on the memory boards 4, 6 may function as the working memory for the processors 2 and may comprise, on each memory board, a conventional memory device or array of memory devices in which programs, instructions and data may be stored. Thus memory boards 4, 6 may each contain any suitable type of memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or any other various types of DRAM devices such as synchronous (SDRAM), extended data output DRAM (EDO-DRAM), double-data-rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), and the like. In at least some of the embodiments, however, the main memory on memory boards 4, 6 may be implemented using DDR SDRAM packaged in dual in-line memory modules (DIMMS).",
        "The computer system 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 may also comprise a second bridge logic device 14 that bridges a primary expansion bus 16 to various secondary buses, such as a low pin count (LPC) bus 18, a read only memory (ROM) bus 20, and a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus 22. Much like the North Bridge 8, the bridge device 14 may be referred to as a \u201cSouth Bridge\u201d based on its location in computer system drawings. In at least some embodiments, the North Bridge 8 and South Bridge 14 may be part of a chipset produced by Server Works, Inc., such as the Grand Champion\u2122 HE Chipset.",
        "In embodiments such as those illustrated by FIG. 1 utilizing the Grand Champion\u2122 HE chipset, the primary expansion bus 16 may comprise a Thin Intermodule Bus, which is a proprietary bus of Server Works, Inc.; however, the computer system 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 is not limited to any particular type of chipset, and thus the primary expansion bus 16 may comprise other suitable buses such as a PCI bus, or a Hub-link bus (which is a proprietary bus of Intel Corporation).",
        "Referring still to FIG. 1, a ROM device 24 may couple, by way of the ROM bus 20, to the South Bridge 14. The ROM 24 may contain software programs executable by the processors 2. The programs on ROM 26 may be basic input/output system (BIOS) commands, stackless code executed during power-on self test (POST) procedures, as well as dedicated programs that are executed based on the issuance of system management interrupts (SMIs) by various computer system devices, discussed more fully below.",
        "Still referring to FIG. 1, the computer system 100 may also comprise a input/output (I/O) controller 26 that may couple to the South Bridge 14 by way of LPC bus 18. The I/O controller 26 may couple a keyboard 28, mouse 30 and various other input/output devices to the computer system 100.",
        "The computer system 100 may further comprise a hard disk or hard drive (HD) 32 that may couple to the South Bridge 14 by way of PCI bus 22. While only a single hard disk is illustrated in FIG. 1, there may be multiple hard disks 32 operated as individual storage devices, or possibly in a redundant array of independent devices (RAID) configuration.",
        "The computer system 100 may also comprise an advanced server management (ASM) device 34. The ASM 34 may couple to the South Bridge 14, and remaining computer system components, by way of the PCI bus 22. The ASM 34 may be a microcontroller programmed to act as a gateway between the internet, or other network systems, and components of the computer system 100. The ASM 34 may also couple to the processors 2 by way of a SMI# signal line 35. Assertion of the signal line 35 by the ASM 34 may act as a system management interrupt (SMI) to the processors, which in response may temporarily cease execution of an operating system and user level programs, and execute SMI routines to perform a variety of hardware level functions.",
        "The memory boards 4, 6 may be selectively removed and added to the computer system without requiring the computer system 100 to shut down. Programmable array logic 36, which may couple to quick switch (QS) devices 38, may assist the computer system 100 in continuing to operate as the memory boards 4, 6 are removed and added to the system. In particular, the PAL 36 may assist with insertion and removal of the memory boards such as moving a latch prior to removal, opening the quick switch devices, detecting removal, detecting insertion, closing quick switch devices, communicating with the ASM 34, and the like. Co-pending patent application Ser. No. 10/179,001 filed Jun. 25, 2002 titled \u201cComputer System Architecture With Hot Pluggable Main Memory Boards,\u201d incorporated by reference herein as if reproduced in full below, illustrates computer systems having the ability to accept hot pluggable main memory boards.",
        "Embodiments of the invention, such as computer system 100 shown in FIG. 1, may utilize the main memory on memory boards 4, 6 in a mirrored fashion. That is, memory board 4 may contain a set of data and programs utilized by the processors 2. Likewise, memory board 6 may also contain a duplicate set of the data and programs used by processors 2\u2014mirrored main memory. While one of the memory boards 4, 6 may be designated as the primary board for memory reads, each data write may take place to each memory board 4, 6. Should the memory board designated as \u201cprimary\u201d experience a memory error, computer system 100 may remain operational by reading and writing to the memory board that did not experience the failure. In such a circumstance, the computer system 100 may also notify a computer system user of the fault, allowing the user to correct the problem with the faulty memory board, such as replacing or repairing the board.",
        "Situations may exist where additional memory is desired in a computer system operating mirrored main memory. For example, computer system 100 operating in a mirrored mode may have four gigabytes of main memory, two gigabytes on each memory board 4, 6. Because of the mirrored operation, the processors 2 may only have an operational amount of two gigabytes of main memory. If it is desired to increase the operational amount of main memory, for example to four gigabytes, the memory capacity of each memory board 4, 6 may be increased to four gigabytes (eight gigabytes total).",
        "In various embodiments of the present invention, memory may be added to the computer system 100 while it is in an operational state, even if the computer system 100 has no further available slots for insertion of memory boards. A first act in adding main memory may be removal of one of the memory boards 4, 6. Co-pending application Ser. No. 10/179,001 titled \u201cComputer System Architecture with Hot Pluggable Main Memory Boards,\u201d incorporated by reference above, may describe the acts the computer system 100 may utilize in powering-down, disconnecting, and allowing removal of a memory board. The first step in this process may be notifying. The computer system first may be notified that a memory board is to be removed. This notification may take place electronically, or may take place by changing the position of a latch or switch on the memory board. Once the computer system is notified that the board is to be removed, the computer system may \u201cbreak the mirror,\u201d forcing the computer system to operate in a non-mirrored state using the remaining memory board. Thereafter, the computer system may power-down the board to be removed and notify a user that removal is possible. Once the memory board has been removed, main memory may be added to the removed memory board, such as by installing additional main memory devices or replacing existing devices with devices of larger capacity. Once the computer user has completed the memory upgrade on the removed memory board, the memory board may be inserted into the computer system 100.",
        "Insertion of the memory board with additional memory may invoke BIOS routines which may apply power, and configure and initialize the memory on the newly inserted memory board. Once initialized, in at least some embodiments, the North Bridge 8 may copy data and programs to the newly installed memory board from the memory board that remained in the system. The copying may be in preparation for returning to mirrored operation.",
        "Embodiments of the invention copy data from the memory board 4, 6 that remained to the newly installed memory board, possibly on a row-by-row basis within each memory bank. A memory board 4, 6 in accordance with embodiments of this invention may comprise a plurality of sockets (not specifically shown) for accepting main memory packaged in memory modules, such as dual inline memory modules (DIMMS). The main memory on each DIMM device may be divided logically into a plurality of banks, and the data within each bank may be accessed on a row and column basis. Copying data from the memory board that remained in the computer system to the newly installed memory board may take place by copying, on a row-by-row basis within each bank, to a corresponding bank in the newly installed memory board. Main memory may be added to the memory board by installing additional memory modules in empty sockets on the memory boards 4, 6. Alternatively, the additional main memory may be installed by replacing memory modules on the memory boards 4, 6 with memory modules having larger memory capacity, i.e., longer rows, greater number of columns, or both.",
        "Once the memory contents of the memory board that remained in the computer system are copied to the newly inserted memory board, mirroring may again be implemented with either memory board designated as \u201cprimary\u201d for read purposes. The newly installed memory board may have a larger memory capacity than the memory board that remained; however, because the computer system 100 may be operating in a mirrored state without the memory board that remained in the system having a corresponding set of additional memory, the operating system may not be notified that additional memory is available.",
        "The next step in adding memory to the computer system 100 may be removal of the second memory board in the computer system. Implementation of the removal of the second board may be similar to that of the first memory board. Once removed, the amount of memory on the removed memory board may be increased, such as by installing additional memory modules, replacing existing memory modules with modules having larger capacity, or a combination of both.",
        "Upon insertion of the second memory board having an expanded memory capacity into the computer system 100, the BIOS may recognize the insertion, and power and initialize the memory on the newly inserted board. Thereafter, the BIOS may copy memory contents from the memory board that remained (and which has an expanded, but partially unused, memory capacity in this exemplary discussion) to the newly inserted board, and enable mirroring. Finally, once both memory boards 4, 6 have additional main memory, the BIOS may notify the operating system that additional memory may be available, possibly through Advanced Configuration Power Interface (ACPI) methods. Co-pending application Ser. No. 10/179,001 titled \u201cComputer System Architecture With Hot Pluggable Main Memory Boards\u201d may discuss making available the additional memory to the operating system.",
        "In the embodiments described with respect to FIG. 1, the chipset, in particular the North Bridge 8, may be responsible for implementing mirroring as well as copying memory contents from board to board after insertion of a new memory board. FIG. 2 illustrates alternative embodiments of the invention in which a North Bridge 50 may not directly support main memory operating in a mirrored mode. In the alternative embodiments, a programmable array logic 52 may couple between the memory boards 54, 56 and the North Bridge 50 on the memory bus 12. In the alternative embodiments, the North Bridge 50 may not be aware that memory mirroring is utilized in the computer system. In this situation, the North Bridge 50 may make memory writes, which the PAL 52 may accept and convert such that each memory write takes place to both memory board 54, 56. For memory reads, the North Bridge 50 may assert various control signals to the PAL 52, which may in turn read the requested data from either memory board 54 or memory board 56, whichever may be designated as primary.",
        "Increasing the amount of memory in the embodiments illustrated in FIG. 2 may involve removal of one of the memory boards 54, 56, and to facilitate removal, PAL 52 may control the quick switches 58 in a manner similar to PAL 36 of the embodiments illustrated of FIG. 1. After reinsertion of the upgraded memory board, PAL 52 may invoke, or cause to be invoked, system management interrupts (SMIs) by communicating with ASM 34, which in turn may assert the SMI# signal line 35. The SMIs may invoke BIOS routines to perform the copying of memory contents from the memory board that remained in the computer system to the newly inserted memory board. This may be accomplished, for example, by reading memory locations on the memory board that remained, then writing the same location (with PAL 52 directing the writes to both memory boards). Data may be copied in small portions using numerous SMIs to avoid staying in the SMI mode too long, which may adversely affect computer system operation. Once copying is complete, either the North Bridge 50 or the PAL 52 may designate the newly inserted board as the primary memory board in the system, thus allowing removal of the other memory board, upgrading of the memory of the other memory board, and re-installation. Once the memory contents have been copied to the re-installed board, the computer system 100 again may operate in a mirrored mode. The BIOS may then notify the operating system, possibly through ACPI methods, of the newly available main memory.",
        "The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications."
