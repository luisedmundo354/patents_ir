        "(1) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a setting technique of reference value (slack value) for determining delay in data path, which is suitably used for timing check for estimating whether or not an electronic circuit operates normally.",
        "(2) Description of Related Art",
        "Generally, in designing process of electronic circuit, in order to determine whether or not the circuit operates normally, timing check for determining whether or not the delay between FF (Flip-Flop) for transmitting data falls within the setup/hold restriction conditions (over delay, racing) is carried out (for example, refer to patent document 1 below).",
        "In electronic circuits, when a plurality of branch paths are formed by providing branching pins on a data path, there are cases where extra delay is afforded or no delay is afforded depending on the branch path. Designers determine whether or not the related branch path should be corrected depending on the extra/no delay in the branch path. In order to detect the degree of the extra delay, slack value is used.",
        "The slack value is a difference between the maximum delay, which is possibly generated up to a device on a data path and an arriving time (allowable arriving time), which is allowed to the device. The slack value indicates the margin of timing in the device. The slack value is set up to the pins on the data paths. It is arranged so that, when a data path is branched, a delay difference between a worst delay and the slack value is passed on (set up) to each of the transit pins on the branch path as the slack value. In conventional calculating technique of slack value, before passing on the slack value, it is necessary to obtain a slack value before branching and to detect unprocessed branching pins.",
        "In accordance with the flowchart (steps S10-S250) shown in FIG. 16, a conventional setting technique of the slack value is described.",
        "First of all, a forward trace is carried out from the feeding side FF toward the receiving side FF (step S10); thereby, every path route between the feeding side FF and the receiving side FF is recognized, and gate delays in the gates (occasionally referred to as cell or element), which are disposed on these path routes, are acquired. The gate delays are stored in a database (for example, a table in the memory). Based on the gate delays, a worst path, which has the largest path delay, is selected from all of the path routes between the feeding side FF and the receiving side FF.",
        "Every branching pin (branched pin) in all path routes is detected and registered (stored) in a table T. The table T is used for registering every branching pins on an electronic circuit as the objects to be evaluated connecting to predetermined flags. Various kinds of flags in the table T are all initialized (step S20).",
        "The initial slack value s0 is calculated (step S30), and with respect to the worst path, the backward trace starts from the receiving side FF toward the feeding side FF (step S40). Hereinafter, in the figure, the backward trace will be referred to as back trace.",
        "With respect to the worst path, after checking whether or not the backward trace has completed (step S50). When the backward trace has not been completed (refer to NO route in step S50), an initial slack value s0, which is calculated in step S30 is set up (step S60) to the transit pin x.",
        "It is determined whether or not the transit pin x has been registered in the table T (step S70). When the transit pin X is registered in the table T (refer to YES route in step S70), assuming that the table of the transit pin x is t1, \u201con\u201d is set to the flags set up with slack value in t1 (step S80), and the next transit pin is set to x (step S90). When the transit pin x has not been set up in the table T, (refer to NO route in step S70), the process proceeds to step S90. In the table t1, it is arranged so that flags set up with slack value and flags of selected branch path are stored being connected to each other.",
        "When the backward trace has completed (refer to YES route in step S50), the branch path processing flag B is set up with \u201coff\u201d (step S100), the first element in the table T is set to t1 (step S110). The branch path processing flag B is a flag for determining whether or not every process has completed.",
        "It is determined whether or not that the t1 is the last element in the table T (step S120).
