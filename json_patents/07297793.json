        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to retroviral protease inhibitors and, more particularly, relates to novel compounds and a composition and method for inhibiting retroviral proteases. This invention, in particular, relates to bis-sulfonamide-containing hydroxyethylamine protease inhibitor compounds, a composition and method for inhibiting retroviral proteases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease and for treating a retroviral infection, e.g., an HIV infection. The subject invention also relates to processes for making such compounds as well as to intermediates useful in such processes.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "During the replication cycle of retroviruses, gag and gag-pol gene transcription products are translated as proteins. These proteins are subsequently processed by a virally encoded protease (or proteinase) to yield viral enzymes and structural proteins of the virus core. Most commonly, the gag precursor proteins are processed into the core proteins and the pol precursor proteins are processed into the viral enzymes, e.g., reverse transcriptase and retroviral protease. It has been shown that correct processing of the precursor proteins by the retroviral protease is necessary for assembly of infectious virons. For example, it has been shown that frameshift mutations in the protease region of the pol gene of HIV prevents processing of the gag precursor protein. It has also been shown through site-directed mutagenesis of an aspartic acid residue in the HIV protease active site that processing of the gag precursor protein is prevented. Thus, attempts have been made to inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the action of retroviral proteases.",
        "Retroviral protease inhibition typically involves a transition-state mimetic whereby the retroviral protease is exposed to a mimetic compound which binds (typically in a reversible manner) to the enzyme in competition with the gag and gag-pol proteins to thereby inhibit specific processing of structural proteins and the release of retroviral protease itself. In this manner, retroviral replication proteases can be effectively inhibited.",
        "Several classes of compounds have been proposed, particularly for inhibition of proteases, such as for inhibition of HIV protease. Such compounds include hydroxyethylamine isosteres and reduced amide isosteres. See, for example, EP O 346 847; EP O 342,541; Roberts et al, \u201cRational Design of Peptide-Based Proteinase Inhibitors, \u201cScience, 248, 358 (1990); and Erickson et al, \u201cDesign Activity, and 2.8 \u212b Crystal Structure of a C2 Symmetric Inhibitor Complexed to HIV-1 Protease,\u201d Science, 249, 527 (1990). Sulfonamide-containing, aminosulfonamide-containing and urea-containing hydroxyethylamine compounds and intermediates useful as retroviral protease inhibitors have been disclosed in WO94/05639, WO94/10136, WO94/10134, WO94/04493, WO94/04492, WO 93/23368, and WO93/23379.",
        "Several classes of compounds are known to be useful as inhibitors of the proteolytic enzyme renin. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,198; U.K. 2,184,730; G.B. 2,209,752; EP O 264 795; G.B. 2,200,115 and U.S. SIR H725. Of these, G.B. 2,200,115, GB 2,209,752, EP O 264,795, U.S. SIR H725 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,198 disclose urea-containing hydroxyethylamine renin inhibitors. EP 468 641 discloses renin inhibitors and intermediates for the preparation of the inhibitors, which include sulfonamide-containing hydroxyethylamine compounds, such as 3-(t-butoxycarbonyl)amino-cyclohexyl-1-(phenylsulfonyl)amino-2(5)-butanol. G.B. 2,200,115 also discloses sulfamoyl-containing hydroxyethylamine renin inhibitors, and EP 0264 795 discloses certain sulfonamide-containing hydroxyethylamine renin inhibitors. However, it is known that, although renin and HIV proteases are both classified as aspartyl proteases, compounds which are effective renin inhibitors generally cannot be predicted to be effective HIV protease inhibitors.",

        "The HIV inhibition assay method of acutely infected cells is an automated tetrazolium based calorimetric assay essentially that reported by Pauwles et al, J. Virol. Methods, 20, 309-321 (1988). Assays were performed in 96-well tissue culture plates. CEM cells, a CD4+ cell line, were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with a 10% fetal calf serum and were then treated with polybrene (2 \u03bcg/ml). An 80 \u03bcl volume of medium containing 1\u00d7104 cells was dispensed into each well of the tissue culture plate. To each well was added a 100 \u03bcl volume of test compound dissolved in tissue culture medium (or medium without test compound as a control) to achieve the desired final concentration and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. A frozen culture of HIV-1 was diluted in culture medium to a concentration of 5\u00d7104 TCID50 per ml (TCID50=the dose of virus that infects 50% of cells in tissue culture), and a 20 \u03bcL volume of the virus sample (containing 1000 TCID50 of virus) was added to wells containing test compound and to wells containing only medium (infected control cells). Several wells received culture medium without virus (uninfected control cells). Likewise, the intrinsic toxicity of the test compound was determined by adding medium without virus to several wells containing test compound. In summary, the tissue culture plates contained the following experiments:",

Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted into tissue culture medium so that the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 1.5% in any case. DMSO was added to all control wells at an appropriate concentration.",
        "Following the addition of virus, cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 7 days. Test compounds could be added on days 0, 2 and 5 if desired. On day 7, post-infection, the cells in each well were resuspended and a 100 \u03bcl sample of each cell suspension was removed for assay. A 20 \u03bcL volume of a 5 mg/ml solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each 100 \u03bcL cell suspension, and the cells were incubated for 4 hours at 27\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO2 environment. During this incubation, MTT is metabolically reduced by living cells resulting in the production in the cell of a colored formazan product. To each sample was added 100 \u03bcl of 10% sodium dodecylsulfate in 0.01 N HCl to lyse the cells, and samples were incubated overnight. The absorbance at 590 nm was determined for each sample using a Molecular Devices microplate reader. Absorbance values for each set of wells is compared to assess viral control infection, uninfected control cell response as well as test compound by cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy.

Thus, the subject compounds are effective HIV protease inhibitors. It is contemplated that the subject compounds will also inhibit other retroviruses such as other lentiviruses in particular other strains of HIV, e.g. HIV-2, human T-cell leukemia virus, respiratory syncitial virus, simia immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, feline immuno-deficiency virus, hepadnavirus, cytomegalovirus and picornavirus. Thus, the subject compounds are effective in the treatment and/or proplylaxis of retroviral infections.",

Both human and animal cell cultures, such as T-lymphocyte cultures, are utilized for a variety of well known purposes, such as research and diagnostic procedures including calibrators and controls. Prior to and during the growth and storage of a cell culture, the subject compounds may be added to the cell culture medium at an effective concentration to prevent the unexpected or undesired replication of a retrovirus that may inadvertently or unknowingly be present in the cell culture. The virus may be present originally in the cell culture, for example HIV is known to be present in human T-lymphocytes long before it is detectable in blood, or through exposure to the virus. This use of the subject compounds prevents the unknowing or inadvertent exposure of a potentially lethal retrovirus to a researcher or clinician.",
        "Compounds of the present invention can possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers as well as in the form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting compounds of Formula I with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate. The synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure compound. The optically active compounds of Formula I can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials. These isomers may be in the form of a free acid, a free base, an ester or a salt.",
