        "E.g. compounds of the formula [(RSn)12O14(OH)6]2+ are described mainly in connection with their interesting structure in: H. Puff, H. Reuter, J. Organomet. Chem. 1989, 373, 173-184; D.

Jurkschat, Organometallics 2000, 19, 3220-3223.",
        "Compounds of said type [(RSn)12O14(OH)6]2+ are further described to show a poor performance in catalyzing or activating reagents and compounds within the acetylation reaction of acetic anhydride with an alcohol (S. Durand, K. Sakamoto, T. Fukuyama, A. Orita, J. Otera, A. Duthie, D. Dakternieks, M. Schulte, K. Jurkschat, Organometallics 2000, 19, 3220-3223.)",
        "It is known for compounds of the formula [(BuSn)12O14(OH)6]2+ when stored in methanol, that a replacement of two structural important \u03bc2-bridged OH groups of the cluster against OCH3 units can occur (D. Dakternieks, H. Zhu, E. R. T. Tiekink, R. Colton, J. Organomet. Chem. 1994, 476, 33-40).",
        "Furthermore is known that during the production of polyesters for some applications for example wrappings and technical yarns, a crystallization and polycondensation in the solid state is carried out (U.S. Pat. No. 4,064,112, U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,425, U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,844). In other applications, fibers or filaments are spun directly and direct preforms are produced in a process wherein an intermediate transfer into the solid state and a repeated remelting is not applied.",
        "Conventional polyester compositions are connected with a series of disadvantages (general summary in: Handbook of polyester thermoplastics, 1st edition, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002). Among these disadvantages are in particular:\n\n    Necessity of high temperatures for the synthesis\n    High catalyst concentration (100-500 ppm [as metal])\n    Degradation processes under processing and polycondensation conditions; for example formation of vinyl esters and due to the formation of acetic aldehyde in polyethylene terephthalate (PET), formation of acrolein in polypropylene terephthalate (PPT) and tetrahydrofuran formation in polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).\n    Limited use of the catalyst systems, dependent on the technology of the process and the chemical structure of the substrate; classic titanium based catalysts cannot be added for example during the esterification- and/or pre/condensation step, as these are readily hydrolyzed to inactivate titanium oxides.\n    Application of the catalyst system only in selected process stages for example only during the esterifications- or only during the transesterification- or only during the polycondensation stage.\n    Optical turbidity of the produced polyester for example by deposits of elementary metal impurities as this can occur by the use of antimony based catalyst systems.\n    Discoloration of the polyester by the catalyst itself, for example titanium based catalyst systems cause a yellow coloring of the polymer or formation of chromophor by-products, respectively.\n    Problematic metering and addition of catalysts and catalyst formulations.",

The bath temperature was preset so that the desired Internal temperature of 280\u00b0 C. was reached in the polycondensation vessel. After the reaction mixture was melted, the stirrer was started and the vessel evacuated within 15 min onto a vacuum of 2\u00d710\u22121 mbar. The time of the first formation of glycol at the wall of the glass was regarded as t0. The attainable final pressure for this equipment of approximately 4 to 5\u00d710\u22122 mbar, was reached after approx. 1 h experimental time, depending on the progress of the polycondensation. Through the sampling device samples could be taken by means of a VA steel wire, maintaining a nitrogen counter flow. At the end of the reaction up to 5 g could be taken from the vessel for further analysis. During the polycondensation, an average sampling required one minute, from breaking the vacuum to re-applying the vacuum.

        "The equipment consisted of a stainless steel double jacket mixing tank reactor with 15 liters nominal volume and with conical bottom equipped with bottom discharge. The mixer was a double lever mixer, which fitted to the conical bottom, with speed control and torque measurement. A glide ring seal with ethylene glycol formed the mixer lock as a sealing-liquid. The preheating of the mixing tank reactor was performed through a liquid circulation heating. The control of the temperature of the heat carrier was performed through a high temperature controller depending on the preset temperature In the reactor Interior. At the lid of the reactor a feed hopper, gas dispersion tube, pressure gauge, thermometer (dipping tube), Inspection window, light, overflow valve, reflux condenser and a Liebig condenser were Installed next to the mixer. A pipe condenser and a condensate receiver were downstream to the reflux condenser, the Liebig condenser ended in a second condensate receiver. The condensate receiver had gassing/degassing valves, pressure gauge, overflow valve as well as a vacuum equipment at the lid next to the feeding means.",
        "For the generation of the primary vacuum of approx. 20 mbar a membrane pump was used and a rotary valve vacuum pump was used up to the final vacuum. The pressure control was done by means of vacuum controller in connection with a magnetic valve in front of the sucking-nozzle of the pump. The exits of the condensate receiver were combined at the pressure point of measurement and connected through two cold traps switched in series and filled with liquid nitrogen.",
        "By means of data printer following measuring data could be registered continuously:\n\n    \n    \n        temperature at the lower inside wall in the reactor\n        temperature in the melt (dipping tube in the lid)\n        reflux condenser head temperature\n        reactor internal pressure\n        torque at the mixer shaft",
        "Esterification, prepolycondensation and polycondensation were carried out in one experimental step. 20 mol terephthalic acid (TPA) were premixed intensely with 28 mol ethylene glycol (EG) until homogeneous. To this mixture the tin based catalysts were added. This mixture was filled into the reactor having been flushed with nitrogen before. The reactor was shut (time t0), a mixer rotation speed set to 60 min\u22121 and heated up to 230 to 240\u00b0 C. internal temperature. The temperature rise was followed by an increase of pressure up to approx. 4.5 bar. The generated water was distilled off via the reflux condenser, which was tempered at 115\u00b0 C. The head temperature in this case was kept between 170 and 190\u00b0 C.",
        "The end of the esterification (time t1) was indicated by a drop of the head temperature and the internal pressure. For the catalyst dosing the esterification product was cooled to approx. 180\u00b0 C. for a short moment. Then primary vacuum was applied and the reactor heated up to an internal temperature of 270 to 275\u00b0 C. Upon reaching the primary vacuum (approx. 20 mbar) the rotary valve vacuum pump was started. At a final pressure <0.1 mbar the polycondensation started (time t2), recognizable by the Increasing torque. With high melt viscosities it was necessary to reduce the mixer rotation speed since the mixer shaft was equipped with a shear-pen with a 60 Nm upper limit to protect the shaft. At the end of the polycondensation (time t3) the mixer was disconnected and the evacuated vessel was flushed with nitrogen. The product was discharged from the reactor by the bottom discharge under nitrogen pressure. It was either poured onto a steel sheet to cool down in pellets, or the melt was led through a water bath, granulated and the product dried subsequently.",
        "The material was dried in a vacuum oven at 130\u00b0 C. for 6 h, then examined with respect to the Intrinsic viscosities, and the color values were determined as described before.",
        "The polycondensation starting out from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol were carried out in presence of the catalysts of examples 1l, 1n, and 3p.",
        "Test conditions and results are shown in tables 16a and 16b.",
