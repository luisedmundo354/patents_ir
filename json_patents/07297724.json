        "Photoinitiators for free radical polymerization reactions are provided that include triarylsulfonium ions and arylsulfinate ions.",
        "Free radical polymerization reactions can be photoinitiated. The photoinitiator system can be based on various chemical approaches. For example, free radical polymerization reactions can be photoinitiated using a three-component photoinitiator system that includes an electron acceptor, an electron donor, and a sensitizing compound. The sensitizing compound usually absorbs actinic radiation resulting in the formation of an excited sensitizing compound. The electron donor can donate an electron to the excited sensitizing compound. That is, the sensitizing compound is reduced and the electron donor is oxidized. The reduced sensitizing compound is a radical anion that can donate an electron to an electron acceptor to yield an initiating free radical for the polymerization reaction. The initiating free radical is the reduced electron acceptor. In some instances of a three-component photoinitiator system, the oxidized electron donor is a radical species that also can function as an initiating free radical.",
        "Other photoinitiator systems include a sensitizing compound and an electron donor but no electron acceptor. The sensitizing compound is usually an organic dye, an organic pigment, or an inorganic pigment. The sensitizing compound can absorb actinic radiation to form an exited sensitizing compound. The electron donor typically donates an electron to the excited sensitizing compound resulting in the oxidation of the electron donor. The oxidized electron donor is a radical species that functions as an initiating free radical for polymerization reactions.",
        "In other free radical photopolymerization reactions, a salt such as a triarylsulfonium salt can generate an initiating free radical. Triarylsulfonium salts typically absorb ultraviolet radiation to form an excited triarylsulfonium ion. The excited triarylsulfonium ion can then photodegrade, abstract a hydrogen atom from another species present in the composition, and ultimately form a radical that can function as an initiating free radical for a polymerization reaction.",
        "Compositions are provided that include a photoinitiator system for free radical polymerization reactions. More specifically, the photoinitiator includes an arylsulfinate ion and a triarylsulfonium ion.

        "Triarylsulfonium salts, in the absence of a sensitizing compound, typically cannot generate an initiating free radical for polymerization reactions when exposed to visible radiation. A photoinitiator system that can be activated using visible radiation is desirable for some applications. Visible light sources are typically less expensive and less hazardous than ultraviolet light sources. Additionally, compared to ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation can typically transmit more readily through various substrates such as polymeric materials.",

The excited arylsulfinate salt can transfer an electron to the triarylsulfonium salt resulting in the formation of an arylsulfinate radical. The arylsulfinate radical can initiate free radical polymerization reactions. In some instances, the reduced triarylsulfonium salt can photodegrade to produce other initiating free radicals.",

        "The triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salt can be activated by exposure to actinic radiation having a wavelength in the range of 250 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 300 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 350 to 1000 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 850 nanometers, in the range of 250 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 400 to 800 nanometers, in the range of 425 to 800 nanometers, or in the range of 450 to 800 nanometers. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the arylsulfinate ion typically absorbs actinic radiation to form an excited arylsulfinate ion. The excited arylsulfinate ion can transfer an electron to the triarylsulfonium ion resulting in the formation of an arylsulfinate radical. The arylsulfinate radical typically can photodegrade and form a radical that can initiate free radical polymerization reactions.",
        "In some embodiments, the triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salts can be stored as a neat compound at room temperature without undergoing oxidative degradation. For example, some of the triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salts can be stored for greater than one day, greater than 2 days, greater than 1 week, greater than 2 weeks, or greater than 1 month. The time required to oxidize 50 percent of the compound (t1/2) at room temperature (i.e., 20\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C.) can be used to compare the relative ease of oxidative degradation of various triarylsulfonium arylsulfinate salts. The t1/2 is calculated based on pseudo-first order kinetics as described in K. A. Connors, Chemical Kinetics: The Study of Reaction Rates in Solution, chapter 2, VCH, New York, 1990.",

The signal was digitized using a Model DI-151R5 Waveform Recording System (available from DATAQ Instruments, Inc., Akron, Ohio) and then stored and analyzed on a Dell OptiPlex XM 590 pc. Scans were run at 100 mV/sec scan rate.",
        "The electrochemical measurements were made using a three-electrode configuration: a reference electrode, a working electrode, and a counter electrode. The reference electrode was a fritted electrode (obtained from Sargent Welch, Buffalo Grove, Ill.) that was filled with 0.01M AgNO3 in acetonitrile and fitted with a silver wire 1 mm in diameter by approximately 19 cm in length. The counter electrode was a platinum wire 1.0 mm in diameter and approximately 16 cm long (overall length) formed into a coil having a coil diameter of approximately 10 mm and a coil length of about 7.5 cm. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode, approximately 3.5 mm in diameter (obtained from BAS, Inc., West Lafayette, Ind.).

The TBA PF6 was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80-90\u00b0 C. before each experiment. The solvent was N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and it was used as received without further purification. The solvent was transferred to the electrochemical cell via syringe under an argon atmosphere to minimize atmospheric moisture uptake.",
        "Electrochemical measurements were made by first preparing a 0.1 molar solution of TBA PF6 in DMF. This solution was added to the cell, which contained a small magnetic stir bar, as argon gas was flowing through the cell. After the reference and counter electrodes were connected to the instrumentation, the working electrode was polished as described above and was then inserted into the cell. A background scan was conducted before the exemplary compounds were added to the cell. Then, approximately 10 mg of the compound was added to the cell and, after it had dissolved, the measurement was made to record the oxidation potential. The potential was determined as the voltage at peak current on the first scan. In this configuration, the oxidation potential of ferrocene in an identical electrolyte solution appeared at +0.1 volts versus the reference electrode.",
        "Preparation of Triarylsulfonium Salts",
        "Triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate and triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate were prepared using a metathesis procedure in which the commercially available aqueous triarylsulfonium chloride solution was mixed with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal or an ammonium hexafluorophosphate or antimonate.

The flask was slowly heated to 60\u00b0 C. in an oil bath and was held at 60\u00b0 C. for 5 hours as the mixture was stirred. The hose adapter was then connected to a water aspirator through a trap that was cooled with dry ice and the temperature of the oil bath was increased to 110\u00b0 C. while the flask was evacuated and liquid distilled into the trap. When the rate of distillation slowed, the hose adapter was again connected to the nitrogen source and the temperature of the oil bath was raised to 155\u00b0 C. After an additional 13 hours, the hose adapter was again connected to a water aspirator through a trap and more liquid was distilled. The reaction flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature, during which time the brown product solidified. The crude product was vacuum distilled, using a Kugelrhor distillation apparatus at a temperature of 150\u00b0 C. and a pressure of 0.07 mmHg, into a collection bulb that was cooled in an ice bath. The solid yellow distillate was washed from the collection bulb with CH2Cl2 and that solution was concentrated to dryness with a rotary evaporator to afford 167.4 g of product.",
