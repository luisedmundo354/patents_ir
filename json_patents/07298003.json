        "This application is a DIVISION of application Ser. No. 10/114,473, filed April 3, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,855,591.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a nonvolatile memory device having a shallow trench isolation (STI) structure and a method of fabricating the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "As the trend in the field of semiconductor devices continues toward higher density integration, the demand and need for decreasing the fine linewidth of a gate and the width of a device isolation layer also grows. Shallow trench isolation (STI) technology has become more widely adopted and used than local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) technology because a narrower and deeper device isolation layer can be formed. However, STI technology requires the use of a diffusion barrier layer to prevent deterioration of an interface between a semiconductor substrate and a device isolation layer, and a groove is formed between the device isolation layer and an active region. This results in generation of a leakage current and deterioration of a gate oxide layer. In order to overcome such problems, a self-aligned trench technology has recently been employed in which a gate oxide layer is formed during formation of a trench isolation layer to simplify the process. Since the trench isolation layer is formed after formation of the gate oxide layer and ion implantation, the conventional problems associated with STI technology can be solved. Unfortunately, in spite of the foregoing advantages, the self-aligned trench technology suffers from several problems that occur while fabricating semiconductor devices.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a top, plan view for explaining a general nonvolatile memory, in which region \u201ca\u201d represents a cell array region and region \u201cb\u201d represents a peripheral circuit region.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1, device isolation layers 108 (208) are disposed over a semiconductor substrate in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d along one direction. A plurality of control gate electrodes 112 is located across an active region 106 between the device isolation layers 108 (208). A floating gate \u201cF\u201d is disposed between the control gate electrode 112 and the active region 106. A transistor in the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d includes a gate electrode 114 crossing an active region 107 defined by the device isolation layers 108 (208).",
        "FIGS. 2 through 4 illustrate flow diagrams for explaining problems of a conventional memory device, which are taken along a line I-I\u2032 of FIG. 1.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, a gate oxide layer 102, a lower conductive layer 104, and a hard mask layer 105 are sequentially formed on a semiconductor substrate 100 with a cell array region \u201ca\u201d and a peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d. Thickness of the gate oxide layer may be different in the cell array region and the peripheral circuit region. The hard mask layer 105, the lower conductive layer 104, and the gate oxide layer 102 are sequentially patterned to form a lower conductive pattern 104 and a hard mask pattern 105 that are sequentially stacked in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d and the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d. The cell gate oxide layer (tunnel oxide layer) 102 is disposed between the lower conductive pattern 104 and the semiconductor substrate 100 in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d. Also, the gate oxide layer 102 is disposed between the lower conductive layer pattern 104 and the semiconductor substrate 100 in the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d. Using the hard mask pattern 105 as an etch mask, the semiconductor substrate 100 is etched to form a trench area \u201cT\u201d and to define first and second active regions 106 and 107 in the regions \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d, respectively.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, a device isolation layer 108 is formed in the trench area \u201cT\u201d by first forming an insulating layer to fill the trench area \u201cT\u201d. The insulting layer is then etched to expose the hard mask pattern 105 using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technique and thereafter recessed to form the device isolation layer 108.",
        "Prior to the formation of the insulating layer, defects in the semiconductor substrate that formed during formation of the trench area \u201cT\u201d are recovered by a process whereby a thermal oxide layer is formed. In this process, a sidewall of the lower conductive pattern 104 is also oxidized, and an edge of the lower conductive layer pattern 104 is bent by a tensile stress applied thereto. Thus, the lower conductive pattern 104 has a structure where the width at a lower portion is larger than the width at an upper portion. Also, the device isolation layer 108 protruding into the semiconductor substrate 100 has a structure where the width at an upper portion is larger than the width at a lower portion.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, hard mask patterns 105 on the first and second active regions 106 and 107 are removed. Generally, the hard mask layer is made of silicon nitride, and the hard mask patterns 105 may be etched by wet etch using the solution of phosphoric acid. An upper conductive layer is formed over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate from which the hard mask patterns 105 have been removed. The upper conductive layer is then patterned to form a floating gate pattern, which comprises the upper and lower conducive layer 104, on the first active region 106. A gate interlayer dielectric film and a control gate conductive layer are formed to cover the cell array region \u201ca\u201d. In the cell array region \u201ca\u201d, the control gate conductive layer, the gate interlayer dielectric film, and the floating gate pattern are sequentially patterned to form a control gate electrode (112 of FIG. 1) crossing the first active region 106 and a floating gate (\u201cF\u201d of FIG. 1) disposed between the gate electrode (112 of FIG. 1) and the first active region 106. The gate electrode 114 consists of a lower gate electrode 104 and an upper gate electrode 111. In the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d, the upper conductive layer and lower conductive layer 104 are sequentially patterned to form a gate electrode 114 crossing the second active region.",
        "In the prior art, an upper width of the device isolation layer 108 protruding into the semiconductor substrate is larger than a lower width thereof. This causes a stringer 113, which remains along a boundary of the first and second active regions 106 and 107 in a process for forming a control gate (not shown) in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d and a gate electrode 114 in the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d. Since the stringer electrically connects adjacent floating gates \u201cF\u201d (see FIG. 1) in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d to each other, it is difficult to program one cell transistor independently.",
        "With a view towards avoiding the shortcomings and problems of the prior art, the present invention provides a nonvolatile semiconductor memory having a device isolation layer structure for preventing the formation of a stringer along a boundary of a device isolation layer and an active region, and provides a method of fabricating the same.",

        "A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described herein below with reference to FIG. 6 through FIG. 8, taken along line II-II\u2032 of FIG. 5.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, an oxide layer 102, a lower conductive layer 204, and a hard mask layer 105 are sequentially formed on a semiconductor substrate having a cell array region \u201ca\u201d and a peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d. The thickness of the oxide layers in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d and in the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d may be different. The lower conductive layer may be made of polysilicon, either doped or undoped. The hard mask layer is made of a material having an etch selectivity with respect to the semiconductor substrate 100, e.g., silicon nitride or silicon nitride and oxide that are stacked.",
        "The hard mask layer 105, the lower conductive layer 204, and the oxide layer 102 are patterned to expose a device isolation area 101. In the process of exposing the device isolation area 101, a photoresist pattern (not shown) is formed on the hard mask layer 105. Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the hard mask layer 105 is etched to form a hard mask pattern 105. Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the lower conductive layer 204 is etched to form a lower conductive layer pattern 204. In this case, the lower conductive layer pattern 204 has a sloped sidewall profile where the width at an upper portion is larger than the width at a lower portion.",
        "Specifically, after formation of the hard mask pattern 105, CF4 gas of 40 sccm is introduced to remove native oxide as well as particles on the exposed lower conductive layer 204 in a chamber under a pressure of 25 mT and at a plasma power of 300 W for about five seconds. After changing the chamber pressure to 30 mT and applying a plasma power of 250 W, HBr of 90 sccm, Cl2 of 30 sccm and a mixture gas of He and O2 of 8 sccm are introduced to suppress production of polymer in the etching process. Then, the lower conductive layer 204 is etched. If a mixed gas of He and O2 increases in amount, a lower conductive layer pattern 204 has a sidewall profile where a difference between the width at an upper portion and the width at a lower portion becomes greater. As the ratio of Cl2 to HBr is increased, the difference between the width at an upper portion and the width at a lower portion also increases.",
        "Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the oxide layer is etched to expose a device isolation area 101. As a result, a tunnel oxide layer 102, a lower conductive layer pattern 204, and a hard mask pattern 105 are formed which are sequentially stacked on the cell array region \u201ca\u201d, and a gate oxide layer 102, a lower conductive layer pattern 204 having a sloped sidewall profile, and a hard mask pattern 105 are formed which are sequentially formed on the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, using the hard mask pattern 105 as an etch mask, the semiconductor substrate 100 is anisotropically etched to form a trench area \u201cT\u201d and define first and second active regions 106 and 107 in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d and the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d, respectively.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, an insulating layer to fill the trench area \u201cT\u201d is formed on an entire surface of the semiconductor substrate where the trench area \u201cT\u201d is formed. This insulating layer intended for device isolation is made of O3-tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) oxide or high-density-plasma (HDP) CVD oxide. The insulating layer is etched by CMP to expose a top surface of the hard mask pattern 105 and form a device isolation layer 208 in the trench area \u201cT\u201d. As a result, a protruding portion of the device isolation layer 208 has a sidewall profile where the width at a lower portion is greater than the width at an upper portion.",
        "In order to recover a defect of the semiconductor substrate 100 which occurs during an etch process for forming the trench area \u201cT\u201d, it is more preferable to further form a thermal oxide layer on a surface of the trench area \u201cT\u201d before formation of the insulating layer. Also, the top surface of the device isolation layer 208 is preferably recessed to decrease a height of the device isolation layer 208 protruding on the semiconductor substrate, after formation of the device isolation layer 208.",
        "Although not shown in the drawing, the hard mask pattern 105 on the first and second active regions 106 and 107 is removed to expose the lower conductive layer pattern 204. Subsequent processes are conventionally carried out to form a control gate electrode crossing the first active region 106 in the cell array region \u201ca\u201d and a gate electrode crossing the second active region 107 in the peripheral circuit region \u201cb\u201d.",
        "According to the present invention, the sidewall of the protruding portion of a device isolation layer is obliquely formed. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a stringer from remaining along a boundary of the device isolation layer and an active region while forming a gate electrode in a cell array region and a gate electrode in a peripheral circuit region.",
        "In summary, the present invention makes it possible to prevent errors caused by a stringer formed at a boundary of a trench isolation layer and an active region, while writing, erasing, and reading a cell transistor. As a result of the present invention as disclosed and described above, production yield may be improved.",
        "Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed herein and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purpose of limitation. Accordingly, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims."
