        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a data distribution device for a memory device, and more particularly to a data distribution device which determines a scheme for distributing data applied when a write command is activated.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "As generally known in the art, a synchronous memory device (such as a DDR SDRAM, a DDR2 SDRAM, etc.) receives and outputs data in synchronization with a clock signal. For example, in the case of a write operation in the DDR2 SDRAM, a write command and a column address are applied in synchronization with the rising edge of a clock signal, first data and second data are inputted in synchronization with the rising edge and the falling edge of the next clock signal, respectively, and then in a similar way, data as long as a burst length are continuously applied in synchronization with the rising edges and the falling edges of the clock signals consecutively following. Data continuously-applied as described above are inputted through each of data pins. For convenience of description, it is assumed that a memory device discussed in this document has a burst length of \u20184\u2019.",
        "Generally, in a write operation, 4-bit data (e.g., din0r<0>, din0f<0>, din1r<0> and din1f<0>), which have been sequentially (serially) applied through a specific data pin in synchronization with rising and falling edges of clock signals, are stored in four registers in one-to-one correspondence, and then are inputted to four input lines in one-to-one correspondence in synchronization with a clock signal. That is, the four registers function as a serial-to-parallel converter. The data din0r<0>, din0f<0>, din1r<0> and din1f<0> applied to the four input lines are transferred to four global input/output lines, respectively, and are then stored in a memory cell array. Herein, the data din0r<0>, din0f<0>, din1r<0> and din1f<0> represent data applied sequentially through a data pin DQ0 in synchronization with rising and falling edges of clock signals.",
        "Meanwhile, before the four pieces of data are transferred to the global input/output lines, an operation of determining the sequence and positions for storing the four pieces of data in the memory cell array is performed. In this document, this operation is called \u2018data distribution operation\u2019 for convenience of description. Generally, the data distribution operation is determined according to a burst type and a starting column address. Herein, the burst type includes a sequential mode and an interleave mode, which are modes for determining a data application sequence. A starting column address used in this document represents the lowest two bits (A1 and A0) of a column address, which is also defined in the JEDEC standard. As generally known in the art, the above-mentioned four global input/output lines corresponds to the decoding values 0, 1, 2 and 3 of the starting column address, respectively. Therefore, data are transferred to the four global input/output lines in one-to-one correspondence according to the starting column address and the burst type.",

Herein, the input data q0 to q3 inputted commonly to the switching sections represents 4-bit data inputted sequentially through one data pin. Therefore, in the case of X4 as shown in FIG. 2, it should be noted that three circuits equal to that shown in FIG. 3 are further included.",
        "The switching section 304 selects one of the input data q0 to q3 and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_r0. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section 304 is determined by signals a1_00 and a0_00. The switching section 304 operates in synchronization with a clock signal dinclk. The switching sections 305, 306 and 307 described later in this document also operate in synchronization with the clock signal dinclk.",
        "The switching section 305 selects one of the input data q0 to q3 and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_f0. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section 305 is determined by a signal a0_01 and an output signal a1_01_out of the control section 302.",
        "The switching section 306 selects one of the input data q0 to q3 and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_r1. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section 306 is determined by signals a1_10 and a0_10.",
        "The switching section 307 selects one of the input data q0 to q3 and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_f1. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section 307 is determined by a signal a1_11 and an output signal a1_11_out of the control section 303.",
        "The operation of the circuit shown in FIG. 3 will now be described in detail.",
        "According to an embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q0, q1, q2, q3) are (1, 0, 1, 1), the burst type is the sequential type, and a starting column address (A1, A0) is (1,0).",
        "In this case, as shown in Table 1, the starting column address (A1, A0) has a value of \u20182\u2019, and a data access sequence is a sequence of 2, 3, 0 and 1. Therefore, the switching section 304 selects and outputs \u2018q2\u2019, the switching section 305 selects and outputs \u2018q3\u2019, the switching section 306 selects and outputs \u2018q0\u2019, and the switching section 307 selects and outputs \u2018q1\u2019. Accordingly, data q2, q3, q0 and q1 are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1 are (1,1,1,0), respectively.",
        "According to another embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q0,q1,q2,q3) are (1,0,1,1), the burst type is the interleave type, and a starting column address (A1, A0) is (1,0).",
        "In this case, as shown in Table 1, a data access sequence is equal to that in the case of the sequential type. Therefore, data q2, q3, q0 and q1 are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1 are (1,1,1,0), respectively.",
        "According to still another embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q0,q1,q2,q3) are (1,0,0,1), the burst type is the sequential type, and a starting column address (A1, A0) is (0,1). In this case, data q1, q2, q3 and q0 are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1 are (0,0,1,1), respectively.",
        "In contrast, when the input data (q0,q1,q2,q3) are (1,0,0,1), the burst type is the interleave type and a starting column address (A1, A0) is (0,1), data q1, q0, q3 and q2 are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r0, gio_f0, gio_r1 and gio_f1 are (0,1,1,0), respectively.",
        "FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram illustrating a control section 302 or 303 shown in FIG. 3.",
        "As shown in FIG. 4, the control section outputs either a signal having the logic level equal to that of an input signal (e.g., a1_01 or a1_11 in FIG. 3) applied to its input node D or a signal having the inverted logic level of the input signal (e.g., a1_01 or a1_11 in FIG. 3) through its output node Q, depending on the logic levels of control signals in1 and in2. The reason will be described with reference to table 1. Referring to Table 1, when a burst length is \u20184\u2019 and a starting column address is \u20180\u2019, data are distributed in a sequence (access sequence) of 0, 1, 2 and 3 regardless of burst types. Also, when a burst length is \u20184\u2019 and a starting column address is \u20182\u2019, the data are distributed in a sequence of 2, 3, 0 and 1 regardless of burst types.",
        "However, when a burst length is \u20184\u2019 and a starting column address is \u20181\u2019, the data are distributed in a sequence of 1, 2, 3 and 0 in the case of the sequential type, and the data are distributed in a sequence of 1, 0, 3 and 2 in the case of the interleave type. It can be understood in this case that the data distribution sequence changes depending on the burst types. Similarly, when a burst length is \u20184\u2019 and a starting column address is \u20183\u2019, the data distributed in a sequence of 3, 0, 1 and 2 in the case of the sequential type, and the data are distributed in a sequence of 3, 2, 1 and 0 in the case of the interleave type. That is it can be understood in this case that the data distribution sequence changes depending on the burst types. As described above, the control section is a circuit for compensating a data distribution sequence which changes depending on burst types. For reference, in FIG. 3, each of the switching sections 305 and 307 receives an output signal of a corresponding control section 302 or 303, and selects and outputs one of the data q0, q1, q2 and q3 by using a starting column address.",
        "FIG. 5A is a block diagram illustrating one of the switching sections 304 to 307 shown in FIG. 3, and FIG. 5B is a circuit diagram illustrating one of switch elements 51, 52 and 53 shown in FIG. 5A.",
        "Since the operation of the switching section as shown in FIG. 5A is described above, an additional description thereof will be omitted. For reference, a clock signal dinclk applied to the switching section functions to determine a time point at which selected data is transferred to global input/output lines.",
        "FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram illustrating an amplifier 54 shown in FIG. 5A. The amplifier shown in FIG. 6 is only an example, and those skilled in the art may use various amplification circuits to achieve the same function as that of the amplifier.",
        "Also, FIGS. 4 to 6 show only examples of circuits for achieving the function of the data distribution section shown in FIG. 3. Those skilled in the art may use various types of circuits to achieve the same functions as those of circuits shown in FIGS. 4 to 6.",
        "According to the method described with reference to FIG. 3 in the present invention, 4-bit data applied sequentially through one data pin are transferred to global input/output lines by using 4 control signals A1, A0, seq_intb and dinclk.",
        "As described above, the present invention discloses a configuration for distributing input data to global input/output lines by using only four control signals A1, A0, seq_intb and dinclk.",
        "According to an embodiment of the present invention, the number of control signals required in a device, which determines a distribution sequence of data inputted through one data pin, is reduced, thereby significantly reducing the layout area for disposition of control lines.",
        "Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims."
