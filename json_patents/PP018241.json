        "Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Impatiens walleriana.",
        "Varietal denomination: \u2018Imdosaor\u2019.",
        "The present invention comprises a new distinct cultivar of Impatiens, botanically known as Impatiens walleriana.",
        "The new Impatiens is a product of a planned breeding program conducted in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The new Impatiens cultivar is upright growing, early flowering, floriferous with large, double flowers and has attractive foliage.",
        "The present cultivar originated from a pollination made in 2001, of a proprietary Impatiens selection identified as \u2018S3244-1,\u2019 not patented, as the female, or seed parent, with a proprietary Impatiens selection identified as \u2018S3163-1,\u2019 , not patented, as the male, or pollen parent.",
        "The present cultivar has been repeatedly asexually reproduced by cuttings in Enkhuizen, Netherlands, in Angers, France, in Gilroy, USA over a four year period. The distinctive characters of this new Impatiens are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction. It takes 6 to 8 weeks to produce a finished plant, depending on the temperature.",
        "This new Impatiens plant is an annual in most climatical zones in the US, only in zones 9 and 10 it is a perennial plant.",
        "This new Impatiens plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographic drawing which shows blooms, buds and foliage of the plant in full color, the color showing being as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures.",
        "The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of this new Impatiens. The data which defines these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The plant history was taken on 25 week old plants, blossomed under natural light in the field.",
        "Color readings were taken in the office under ambient light. Color references are primarily to The R.H.S. Color Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London.",
        "Plants of the new Impatiens differ primarily from the plants of the female parent selection in the following characteristics:",
        "Plants of the new Impatiens have orange, double flowers and flowers only have petals, whereas the plants of the female have orange flowers and flowers have a pollen cap and stigma.",
        "Plants of the new Impatiens differ primarily from the male plant selection in the following characteristics:",
        "Plants of the new Impatiens have orange colored flowers, whereas the plants of the male have salmon colored flowers.",
