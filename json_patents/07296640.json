        "The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/476,272, filed Jun. 5, 2003, titled \u201cSolids Control System,\u201d and hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.",
        "Not applicable.",
        "The embodiments of the present invention relate generally to systems for removing and controlling solids suspended in a liquid slurry. More particularly, the embodiments provide a mobile system for storing and processing drilling fluids.",
        "Rigs used for drilling hydrocarbon wells are large, complex assemblies of machinery. While drilling rigs used offshore are often integrated into a single platform, almost all rigs used to drill wells on land are designed to be disassembled, transported between drilling sites, and reassembled. Although some rigs may be designed to be moved by helicopter or airplane, the majority of rigs are moved by trucks and trailers. Thus, many land rigs are designed to disassemble into components sized so as to be quickly and easily loaded onto, transported by, and offloaded from a trailer.",
        "The process of assembling a land rig for drilling operations is known as \u201crig up.\u201d During rig up, all of the various components of the drilling rig are assembled and tested prior to any drilling activity taking place. The rig up procedure may last anywhere from a couple of days to more than a week, depending on the type of rig being assembled and any problems encountered during the process. Because drilling the well can not commence until rig up is complete, it is desirable to minimize the time spent assembling the drilling rig.",
        "The entire rig up process must be performed in reverse order to \u201crig down,\u201d the process used to disassemble the rig for transportation to another location. During rig down, the individual rig components are disconnected and loaded, by cranes or winches, onto trailers for transport. The rig down procedures further add to the downtime that the rig spends between drilling wells, and are therefore conducted as quickly as safety permits.",
        "The amount of downtime spent between drilling wells is often limited by the contract under which the rig is operating. These contracts often specify the time permitted for rig up and rig down, and that any time beyond the permitted limits will not be paid for by the rig lessee, but will be paid for by the rig operator. Thus, any equipment or procedures that may be available to lessen the amount of time needed for rig up and rig down activities are desirable and would be welcomed by the industry.",
        "One key component of a drilling rig is the drilling fluid circulation system or mud system, which circulates drilling fluid (mud) through the wellbore. The circulation system is also used to maintain the density of the drilling fluid by removing drilled cuttings from the fluid, and adding other solids to the fluid as may be desired. The density of the drilling fluid is critical to hole cleaning, rate of penetration, and pressure control in the well. Hole cleaning and rate of penetration are important factors in the efficiency of the drilling process, while pressure control is critical to safely drilling a well.",
        "In general operation, drilling fluid is pumped by high-pressure mud pumps through the drill string and into the wellbore. The fluid exits the drill string at the bit and returns to the surface through the annulus between the drill string and the wellbore, carrying cuttings from the hole to the surface. The hydrostatic pressure from the column of drilling fluid prevents fluids from the surrounding formation from entering the wellbore and potentially causing a loss of well control.",
        "At the surface, the drilling fluid is then processed, in order to maintain the desired density, before it is pumped back through the drill string into the hole. Solids control equipment such as shakers, degassers, desilters, desanders, and centrifuges may be used to process the drilling fluid at the surface by removing solids and entrained gases from the fluid. The density of the drilling fluid may be increased by adding a higher density fluid or select solid materials to the fluid. The drilling fluid, including a reserve volume is typically stored in tanks or pits at the surface before being recirculated through the well.",
        "For land-based, mobile drilling rigs, the circulation system is often subdivided into skid-mounted modules that can be easily transported by truck between well sites. These skid-mounted modules are normally designed to be lifted by cranes onto trailers or pulled onto flatbed trailers by winches. Common modules include mud tanks, solids control equipment, jetting equipment, and a gravity fed manifold. A common circulation system may include more than one module of each type, but every module employed in the system increases the time needed for rig up and rig down operations.",
        "The mud tank modules provide a reservoir of drilling fluid for use during circulation. Most conventional mud tank modules include open top, rectangular tanks, but round tanks are also occasionally used. At one end of the typical mud tank module is a \u201cporch\u201d for mounting pumps and other equipment that is used to move fluid into and out of the tanks. The mud tanks also preferably have access hatches or manways through the sides of the tanks designed to provide access into the tank to facilitate cleaning, since solids tend to accumulate in the tanks. The tanks are usually cleaned periodically during operations, and also between well drilling operations. The mud tanks may also have agitators or stirrers provided to keep the fluid circulating within a single tank in order to minimize settling of the solids.",
        "An assortment of other modules are also used in conjunction with the mud tanks and are thus in fluid communication with the tanks. The solids control module includes the shakers, desilters, desanders, mudcleaners, agitators, mud hoppers, centrifuges, degassers, etc. and may include one or more skids, to which the equipment is mounted. Jetting equipment is used to supply high pressure fluid to clean or remove deposits from the inside of the mud tanks. Jetting equipment may also be used in conjunction with a tanker truck or vacuum truck to clean out the mud tanks and remove unwanted fluids. The gravity fed manifold is used to control and route the supply of drilling fluid from the mud tanks to the triplex pumps, which are used to circulate the drilling mud down the wellbore and throughout the system. The jetting equipment, and manifold all require one or more skids each.",
        "With all of the different equipment that has to be integrated into a typical fluid circulation system, it can be seen that the effort required to transport and assembly such a system is considerable. Thus, there remains a need in the art for systems that decrease the time needed for rig up and rig down of a fluid circulation system. Therefore, the embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and apparatus for providing a mobile fluid circulation system that seeks to overcome certain of the limitations of the prior art.",
        "The preferred embodiments provide a mobile solids control system for the processing of drilling fluids. The solids control system includes a suction tank skid, a suction platform skid, a shaker tank skid, and an equipment platform skid. The suction tank skid and shaker tank skid include the drilling fluid storage tanks, pumps to effectuate the flow of fluid through the system, and agitators to circulate fluid within the tanks. The pumps are preferably centrifugal pumps mounted vertically within notches or recesses built into the sides of the tank skids. The suction platform skid and the equipment platform skid are installed on top of the tank skids, and include solids control equipment used to process the drilling fluid.",
        "The vertically mounted, centrifugal pumps are preferably connected in fluid communication with at least two fluid tanks and are suited for use in transferring fluid between tanks, moving fluid through the solids control equipment, supplying fluid for jetting and cleaning the tanks, and providing a fluid supply for priming the triplex pumps. The use of the centrifugal pumps for priming the triplex pumps eliminates the need for a gravity manifold for priming and simplifies the operation of the system. The jetting and cleaning fluid supplied by the centrifugal pumps may be dispersed into the tanks through cleaning nozzles, which may by integrated into the rotating shafts of the agitators or disposed within the tanks separately. The centrifugal pumps may also be used to empty the tanks when required without requiring the use of a vacuum truck.",
        "The multiple operations performed by the centrifugal pumps provide for a substantially self-sufficient solids control system that can be used interchangeably with similar systems of different fluid capacities with the same drilling rig. Likewise, the preferred system provides a solids control system that is easily integrated into new or existing drilling rigs.",
        "In the preferred embodiments, the solids control system reduces the number of trucks and crane lifts required to move the system between locations. Each platform skid is lifted by a crane and loaded onto a truck for transport. The tank skids can then also be loaded onto trucks and the entire system can be transported in four truckloads. Once in the new location, the tank skids are offloaded and the platform skids are lifted into place on top of the tank skids.",
        "Thus, the present invention comprises a combination of features and advantages that enable it to provide for a modular, mobile solids control system. These and various other characteristics and advantages of the preferred embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description and by referring to the accompanying drawings.",

Platforms 108 are preferably removable or hinged to shaker tank skid 40 so that they can be collapsed during transport of the skid. Top view FIG. 3C also shows rail system 104 and access hatch 110 through roof 32, which allows access to lifting points on equipment platform skid 30.",
        "FIG. 4 shows mud tanks 200 in plan view, with a partial hydraulic schematic of system 10 imposed thereon. Shaker tank skid 40 and includes five mud tanks 200, which are connected by three pumps 100 controlled by valves 202. Agitators 106 are provided for three mud tanks 200. Shakers 34, degasser 35, desander 36, and desilter 37 draw fluid from the mud tanks 200, process the fluid, and return it to the tanks 200. Suction tank skid 50 provides four additional mud tanks 200, pumps, 100, valves 202, and agitators 160. Suction tank skid 50 also includes a mud hopper 204 that is used to add solids to the drilling mud. Tanks 200 may also include cleaning nozzles (not shown) for jetting, or cleaning, the tanks. These cleaning nozzles may be suspended in the tank on a rotating shaft or may be integrated into agitators 160. Cleaning nozzles integrated into agitators 160 may be preferred in order to reduce the equipment that is suspended in a tank because each interference with circulation in a tank may have detrimental effects on the fluid stored in that tank.",
        "Pumps 100 can be used to provide the fluid pressure needed for moving fluid through the solids control equipment, for jetting and cleaning the tanks, and transferring fluid between tanks 200. Each pump 100 is preferably in fluid communication with at two tanks 200 so that the number of pumps can be minimized. Pumps 100 allow cleaning and jetting to be performed while drilling operations are ongoing since, unlike conventional systems, the high-pressure triplex pumps are not required in system 10 for cleaning and jetting operations. Pumps 100 supply can supply fluids to the cleaning nozzles or can be used to draw fluid out of the tanks, thus eliminating the need, in conventional systems, for vacuum trucks to be used to empty the tanks.",
        "Pumps 100 may also be used to supply pressurized fluid for priming the high-pressure, triplex pumps. In most conventional systems, a separate manifold is used to supply the fluid that is needed to prime the triplex pumps 300. System 10 can be connected to the triplex pumps 300 via an easily installed flexible hose 302, and pumps 100 can supply sufficient fluid to prime the triplex pumps 300. This eliminates the need for a special manifold and the corresponding equipment, transportation, and rig up/rig down costs associated therewith.",
        "Another key advantage to solids control system 10 is the simplicity of rig up and rig down. From the fully assembled position shown in FIG. 1, suction platform skid 20 and equipment platform skid 30 are lifted, one at a time, by a crane and placed onto trailers for transport. The crane attaches to lift points on the base structure of the skid 20, 30, which can be accessed by opening hatch 28 in the roof. This configuration eliminates the need for any personnel to be on top of the roofs of the skid to attach to the crane, and allows the roof structure to be designed for smaller loads than would be necessary if the skid were lifted through the roof structure. Once the suction platform skid 20 and equipment platform skid 30 are removed, suction tank skid 50 and shaker tank skid 40 can be loaded onto trailers for transport. Each of the skids 20, 30, 40, and 50 requires a single truck load to transport. Thus, system 10 can be transported in four loads and only requires two crane lifts (or picks) for rig up or rig down.",
