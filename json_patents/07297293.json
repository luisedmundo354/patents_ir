        "The present invention relates to an illumination such as a light emitting device, a fluorescent lamp and the like, and relates to a display, a back light for liquid crystal and the like which is used for a semiconductor light emitting element, and specifically relates to a nitride phosphor which is used for the light emitting device.",
        "A light emitting device using a semiconductor light emitting element has advantages that it is a small size, has good electrical efficiency and can emit a bright color, and there is no fear of burning out an electric bulb because the light source is a semiconductor element. Further, it has characteristics that it is excellent in initial driving property and tough in vibration and the repetition of on-off lighting.",
        "Further, for the light emitting device using a semiconductor light emitting element, there is developed a light emitting device which has a light emitting color which is different from the light of the light emitting element by carrying out a wavelength conversion of the portion of the semiconductor light emitting element by a phosphor, and by mixing said wavelength-converted light and no wavelength-converted light to be emitted. Specifically, the light emitting device which emits light in a white color can be used in wide fields such as a general illumination, a display and a back light for liquid crystal, by the constitution.",
        "In the white color light emitting device, a blue light emitting element using an InGaN-base material is used as a light emitting element, a YAG-base phosphor which is represented by the composition formula of (Y, Gd)3(Al, Ga)5O12 is used as a phosphor, and a white light emitting color is obtained by the theory of color mixture of light. Namely, after blue light which was discharged from a light emitting element is emitted in the phosphor layer, it is discharged outside after repetition of absorption and scattering in the layer. On the other hand, the blue light absorbed in the phosphor works as an excitation source and emits yellow fluorescence. The yellow light and the blue light are mixed and the mixture is recognized as a white color by human eyes.",
        "However, the above-mentioned white color light emitting device has defects that there is little red component in luminescence, color temperature is high, and only illumination light having low color rendering property which is deficient in red is obtained.",
        "Namely, a conventional light emitting device which emits white light can hardly obtain a long wavelength side luminance at a visible light region, therefore it has been a light emitting device which exhibits a slightly bluish white color. On the contrary, there has been strongly required a light emitting device which exhibits a slightly reddish warm color-base white color, in the illumination for a window display, illumination for a medical spot and the like. Further, there has been strongly required a light emitting device which exhibits a white color which is soft for human eyes and near to an electric bulb color, also for general illumination.",
        "However, since a conventional phosphor emitting reddish light has low efficiency caused by near ultra violet to blue light excitation and low chemical and thermal stabilities, durability is not adequate, therefore it is not practically used. Further, human eyes feel that the wave length region of a reddish component is dark. Accordingly, it is required that a red color region has higher brightness so that eyes feel the same level brightness as a green region and a blue region.",
        "Under these circumstances, in the pamphlet of International Open Patent No. 01/40403, there is disclosed an MxSiyNz:Eu nitride phosphor (wherein M is at least one of alkali earth metals at least selected from a group of Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. z=(2/3)x+(4/3)y) which increased a red component in comparison with a conventional phosphor.",
        "However, the nitride phosphor disclosed in the pamphlet of International Open Patent No. 01/40403 obtains a slightly reddish white color light, for example, by combination with a blue light emitting diode, but the improvement of brightness is further required.",
        "Further, a conventional phosphor emitting red light has inadequate efficiency caused by near ultra violet to blue light excitation and inadequate durability, therefore it is not practically used.",
        "Accordingly, it is the first purpose of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems and to provide a phosphor containing a comparatively much red component and having high light emitting efficiency, high brightness and further high durability; and a production process thereof.",
        "Further, it is the second purpose of the present invention to provide a light emitting device which can emit reddish warm color-base white color light and can emit light having the color rendering property.",
        "In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor (base nitride phosphor) which is represented by the general formula LXMYN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y):R or LXMYOZN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y\u2212(2/3)Z):R (wherein L is at least one or more selected from the Group II Elements consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn, M is at least one or more selected from the Group IV Elements in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge, and R is at least one or more selected from the rare earth elements in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu.), and absorbs at least the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum in which a peak wave length is 500 nm or less and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more of peaks at a range of 520 to 780 nm; and further contains the elements (hereinafter, referred to as different elements) below.",
        "Namely, the first nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in further containing at least one or more of different elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs.",
        "The first nitride phosphor containing the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs has a higher luminescence efficiency in comparison with a nitride phosphor not containing the Group I Element. This is considered because the above-mentioned Group I Element works as a flux during synthesis and then the Group I Element which worked as the flux exists between phosphor particles, or the luminescence itself of the phosphor is hardly inhibited because the Group I Element is scattered during its production steps. Further, the particle diameter of the nitride phosphor can be controlled by containing the Group I Element in the nitride phosphor.",
        "Further, the second nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in further containing at least one or more of elements selected from the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru, in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor.",
        "When the second nitride phosphor related to the present invention to which the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element were added is compared with a nitride phosphor to which those elements are not added, the second nitride phosphor has an effect capable of shortening afterglow. Further, these elements can adjust brightness. Hereat, it is preferable that the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element which are different from the elements contained in the above-mentioned nitride phosphor composition are 100 ppm or less based on the weight of the elements contained in the above-mentioned nitride phosphor composition. This is because the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element are killer elements inhibiting the luminescence of the present nitride phosphor therefore they are preferably removed to the outside of a system. To the contrary, since Cr, Ni and the like have an effect of shortening afterglow, about 0.1 ppm to several tens ppm may be contained.",
        "Further, in the first nitride phosphor too, it is preferable that elements which are different from the elements contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor are 1000 ppm or less based on the weight of the elements contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor. When they are within this range, high brightness can be kept while adjusting luminescence properties. The luminescence properties in the specification are color tone, brightness, afterglow, light output property for excitation intensity, luminescence efficiency and the like.",
        "Further, elements (the second different elements) which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R may be contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor, other than at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru, or together with those elements.",
        "The nitride phosphor which is represented by the general formula LXMYN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y):R or LXMYOZN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y\u2212(2/3)Z):R is a nitride phosphor which emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at a yellow to red region and the like when light having the first luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at an ultra violet to blue region is irradiated. The luminescence intensity can be changed by containing the second different element in said nitride phosphor, without changing the color tone. The nitride phosphor having desired brightness can be provided thereby. Further, the adjustment of the brightness can be easily carried out.",
        "The above-mentioned different element and the second different element may be contained in raw materials when the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor is prepared. The nitride phosphor having desired brightness can be provided thereby, irrespective of whether those different elements and the second different element remain in the phosphor after preparation, or not. Further, the adjustment of the brightness can be easily carried out. Furthermore, the adjustment of the brightness can be carried out by controlling the kinds and contents of the above-mentioned different elements or the second different elements in the raw materials of the nitride phosphor of the present invention, for example, strontium nitride, calcium nitride, silicon nitride, europium oxide or europium nitride. Further, the purification step of the raw materials can be abbreviated when the contents of various elements which are contained in the raw materials are within the range capable of realizing the objective luminescence properties, and the simplification of the production step can be designed.

        "Then, after moisture in the concave of the base 105 was adequately removed, it is covered with a lid 106 made of covar which has a glass window portion 107 at the central part, and sealed by carrying out seam welding. Hereat, a color conversion portion 109 (a coating portion containing the phosphor 108) is preliminarily provided at the back face of the glass window portion 107. The phosphors 108 such as Ca2Si5N8:Eu, (Y0.8Gd0.2)3Al5O12:Ce in which B was added, are preliminarily contained in a slurry consisting of 90% by weight of nitrocellulose and 10% by weight of \u03b3-alumina, the slurry containing the phosphors is coated on the back face of the transparent window portion 107 of the lid 106, it is cured by heating at 220\u00b0 for 30 minutes, and then, the color conversion portion 109 is formed. The light emitting device II which was constituted thus is a light emitting diode which can emit light of a white color having high luminescence brightness. Further, according to the type 2 light emitting device II, the light emitting device which can extremely and easily adjust chromaticity and is excellent in large scale productivity and reliability can be provided.",
        "Further, the type 2 light emitting device II which was constituted as described above can make all of the constituting member by inorganic substances, and can constitute a light emitting device having remarkably high reliability, even if the luminescence emitted from the LED chip 101 is at an ultraviolet or visible short wave length region.",
        "(Type 3 Light Emitting Device III)",
        "FIG. 3 is a section view showing the type 3 light emitting device III related to the present invention, and a cap type light emitting device.",
        "In FIG. 3, the same codes are named for the same members as the members of the type 1 light emitting device I, and illustration is abbreviated.",
        "The light emitting device III is constituted by covering a cap 16 comprising a transparent resin in which the phosphors are dispersed (not illustrated), on the surface of the mold member 15 of the light emitting device I. The phosphors are homogeneously dispersed in the transparent resin of the cap 16. The transparent resin containing the phosphors is molded in a form which is fit in the form of the mold member 15 of the light emitting device I. Further, in place of the fitting, there may be also possible a production process that after the transparent resin containing the phosphors is charged in a fixed mold frame, the light emitting device I is pushed in said mold frame to be molded. As the specific material of the transparent resin of the cap 16, there are used transparent resins excellent in temperature characteristic and weather resistance such as an epoxy resin, a urea resin, a silicone resin, silica sol, glass, an inorganic binder and the like. In addition to the above-mentioned materials, thermosetting resins such as a melamine resin and a phenol resin can be used. Further, there can be used also thermoplastic resins such as a polyethylene, a polypropylene, a polyvinyl chloride and a polystyrene, thermoplastic rubbers such as a styrene-butadiene block copolymer and a segmented polyurethane. Further, a dispersant, barium titanate, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide and the like may be contained together with the phosphors. Further, a light stabilizer, a coloring agent may be contained. The specific phosphors related to the present invention described later are used for the phosphors used for the cap 16. The phosphors related to the present invention may be also used in the cup of the mount lead 13a. However, since the phosphors are used in the cap 16, only the coating member 12 may be adequate in the cup of the mount lead 13a.",
        "Thus, in the light emitting device III which was constituted as described above, the wave length of the portion of light discharged from the light emitting element 10 is converted by the phosphors when it passes through the cap 16. The wave length converted light and the blue light whose wave length was not converted by the phosphor are mixed, and as a result, white color-base light is externally discharged from the surface of the cap 16.",
        "The phosphor of the mode of operation related to the present invention is illustrated below.",

        "In the general formula, X, Y and Z is an arbitrary figure larger than 0. In particular, X and Y is preferably X=2 and Y=5 or X=1 and Y=7. Specifically, it is preferable that the nitride phosphors represented by (SrTCa1\u2212T)2Si5N8:Eu, Sr2Si5N8:Eu, Ca2Si5N8:Eu, SrTCa1\u2212TSi7N10:Eu, SrSi7N10:Eu, CaSrSi7N10:Eu and the like are used as the base nitride phosphor. Further, the different elements which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R are contained in the base nitride phosphor. Said different elements are at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of P, Sb and Bi, the Group VI Element consisting of S, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru. One or 2 or more of these different elements are contained in the nitride phosphor. The content of these different elements in the nitride phosphor is not specifically limited, but is preferably 1000 ppm or less based on the phosphor which is represented by the general formula LXMYN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y):R or LXMYOZN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y\u2212(2/3)Z):R. Because good luminescence properties can be obtained by setting the content as 1000 ppm or less. The content of these different elements is more preferably set at a range of 0.1 to 500 ppm in order to obtain further good luminescence efficiency.",
        "The addition amount of the different elements in the production process may be occasionally set at 500 ppm or more in order to set the addition amount of different elements at a range of 0.1 to 500 ppm in the phosphor after production, considering the scattered amount of the different elements in firing step. For example, there is a case that even if the amount of the different elements which are added in the raw material is set at 10000 ppm or more, the objective properties cannot be achieved because the different elements are scattered during the firing step in the production steps. However, even in such a case, it is preferable to adjust the amount so that the amount of the different elements become 1000 ppm or less in the final product, and the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness can be adjusted thereby.",
        "As described above, L consists of at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. Namely, in the present invention, L may be one element and 2 or more elements may be contained as L.",
        "For example, the mixture of Sr and Ca can change the compounding ratio according to requirement. In this case, the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum is shifted to a longer wave length side by mixing Sr and Ca, than by using Sr or Ca alone. When the molar ratio of Sr and Ca is about 5:5, the peak wave length is shifted to the longest wave length side, and when the molar ratio of Sr and Ca is 7:3 or 3:7, the peak wave length is respectively shifted to a longer wave length side than by using Sr or Ca alone.",

        "Thus, in the present mode 1 of operation, the nitride phosphor having good crystallinity is obtained by setting Si as essential in the composition of the nitride phosphor.",
        "As a more specific example, for example, those using 95% by weight of Si and 5% by weight of Ge are mentioned.",

Namely, in the present mode 1 of operation, R may consisting of Eu alone, and contains Eu and may further contain one or 2 or more among the above-mentioned elements (the element other than Eu). Thus, in the mode 1 of operation, the nitride phosphor having good luminescence properties can be provided by specifying the element which is used as R.",
        "In Examples related to the mode 1 of operation described later, europium being the rare earth element is used as a luminescent center.",
        "Europium has mainly 2-valent and 3-valent energy levels. In the phosphor of the present mode 1 of operation, Eu3+ is used for the alkali earth metal silicon nitride phosphor of mother-body as the activator. For example, it is preferable to use europium alone or europium nitride. Further, in the present mode 1 of operation, the color tone can be changed and the adjustment of luminescence efficiency can be carried out by activating Eu together with other activator such as Ce and Nd.",
        "In the present mode 1 of operation, the effect of adding the different elements which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R exits in points that as described above, the diffusion of Eu3+ is accelerated and luminescence properties such as color tone, luminescence brightness and afterglow can be improved. Further, since the particle diameter of phosphor particles can be enlarged, brightness can be improved. Further, Cr, Ni and the like have a function of shortening afterglow. The above-mentioned different element may be contained in raw materials which are used for producing the phosphor, and may be contained in a condition of a single body or a compound in the production steps and baked together with the raw materials. However, the above-mentioned different element is not occasionally contained in the nitride phosphor after firing. Even if it is contained, it may occasionally remain at a trace amount in comparison with the initially added amount (in raw materials or an amount added during the production steps). This is considered to be caused by the diffusion of the different element in the firing step.",
        "The phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation absorbs the portion of light at an ultraviolet to blue region which was emitted by the light emitting element 10, and emits light at a yellow to red region. When the phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation is applied to, for example, the type 1 light emitting device I, the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base white color can be constituted by the color mixing of blue light emitted from the light emitting element 10 (light in which the wave length is not converted by the phosphor) and the red color of the phosphor.",
        "Further, in the light emitting device related to the present invention, in addition to the nitride phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation, the light emitting device may have one or more of the phosphor which absorbs light of the first luminescence spectrum which was emitted by a light emitting element, and the portion of light having the second luminescence spectrum which is output from the nitride phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation, and emits light different from the wave length of light absorbed, namely light having the third luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more peak wave lengths (from a blue region to a green region, a yellow region and a red region). Thus, the luminescence color can be made as a multi color. When such constitution is made, the phosphor having the third luminescence spectrum contains preferably at least one or more of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, and the yttrium-gallium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium. Because a desired chromaticity can be easily adjusted by containing the above-mentioned the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Specifically, there can be used Ln3M5O12:R (Ln is at least one or more selected from Y, Gd and La. M contains at least either of Al and Ga. R is Lanthanide series), (Y1\u2212xGdx)3(Al1\u2212yGay)O12:R(R is at least one or more selected from Ce, Tb, Pr, Sm, Eu, Dy and Ho. 0<R<0.5). These phosphors are excited by light at a short wave length side of a near ultraviolet to visible light, 270 to 500 nm, and has a peak wave length of a luminescence spectrum at 500 to 600 nm. However, in the present invention, the phosphor having the third luminescence spectrum is not limited to the above-mentioned phosphors, and various phosphors can be used.",
        "The yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium and the like absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the light emitting element 10, and emits light at a yellow region. Hereat, light becomes a pale white color by the color mixing of the blue light from the light emitting element 10 and the yellow light of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Accordingly, the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base or electric bulb color-base white color can be constituted by using the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor together with a coating member having transparency, and by the combination with the blue light from the light emitting element 10. Further, the light emitting device having various spectrum distributions can be provided by appropriately changing the combination of the phosphors and the contents of the respective phosphors. Further, the warm color-base white color and redwish white color light emitting device means that the average color rendering index Ra is 75 to 95 and the color temperature is 2000 to 8000K. In the present invention, it is possible to produce a warm color-base white color light emitting device, an electric bulb color-base white color light emitting device, a white color light emitting device, a neutral white color light emitting device, daylight color light emitting device according to the JISZ9112 Specification. In the light emitting device related to the present invention, the preferable device in particular is a light emitting device in which the average color rendering index Ra and color temperature are situated at the locus of black body radiation in a chromaticity chart. However, it is needless to say that the compounding amount of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor together is appropriately changed in order to provide a light emitting device having a desired color temperature and the average color rendering index. The warm color-base white color light emitting device can further improve the specific color rendering index R9. With respect to a white color light emitting device which is the combination of a conventional blue light emitting element and the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium, the specific color rendering index R9 is about near 0, and a red component was insufficient. Accordingly, it has been a solving problem to enhance the specific color rendering index R9, but the specific color rendering index R9 can be enhanced to 60 to 70 by containing the phosphor related to the present invention in the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Hereat, the specific color rendering index R9 is determined by using the respective color deviation of 7 color chips as a basis which is different from average rendering property, and not the average of 7 kinds. As 7 color chips, there are selected those which represent red having comparatively high chroma, yellow, green, blue, human skin (white people), the green of a leaf of a wood, human skin (Japanese). They are respectively called in order as R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14 and R15. Among these, R9 is a color chip which indicates red.",
        "Further, the phosphor which is used in combination with the nitride phosphor of the present invention is not limited to the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the like. The phosphor having at least one or more of peak wave lengths from a blue region to a green region, a yellow region, and a red region which can attain the similar purpose as the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and has the third luminescence spectrum can be also used in combination with the above-mentioned nitride phosphor. The white color light emitting device according to the principle of color mixing of light can be provided thereby. As specific phosphor used in combination with the nitride phosphor, there are phosphors emitting green-base light such as SrAl2O4:Eu, Y2SiO5:Ce, Tb, MgAl11O19:Ce, Tb, Sr7Al12O25:Eu (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)Ga2S4:Eu; phosphors emitting blue-base light such as Sr5(PO4)3Cl:Eu, (BaCa)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu, (SrCaBa)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu, (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)2B5O9Cl:Eu,Mn, (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)(PO4)6Cl2:Eu,Mn; phosphors emitting red-base light such as Y2O2S:Eu, La2O2S:Eu, Y2O3:Eu, Ga2O2S:Eu.

        "For example, Si undoped n-GaN layer, n-contact layer comprising Si-doped n-GaN, undoped n-GaN layer, light emitting layer having multi quantum well structure (multi quantum well structure of GaN barrier layer/InGaN well layer), p-clad layer comprising Mg-doped p-GaN, and p-contact layer comprising Mg-doped p-GaN are laminated in order on a sapphire substrate through GaN buffer layer. Further, electrodes are formed as below.",
        "P-Ohmic electrode is formed all over the surface on p-contact layer, and a p-pad electrode 3 is formed on the portion of p-ohmic electrode.",
        "Further, the undoped GaN layer is removed from the p-contact layer by etching, the portion of n-contact layer is exposed, and an n-electrode is formed on the exposed portion.",
        "Further, the light emitting layer having multi quantum well structure was used in the present mode of operation, but the present invention is not limited to this. For example, it may be single quantum well structure utilizing InGaN, and GaN to which n-impurities and p-impurities such as Si, Zn and the like were doped may be utilized.",
        "Further, the light emitting layer of the light emitting element 10 can change a main luminescence peak at a range of 420 nm to 490 nm by changing the content of In. Further, the wave length is not limited to the above-mentioned range, those having luminescence wave length at 360 to 550 nm can be used.",
        "Thus, a semiconductor light emitting element having double hetero structure is constituted on a substrate. In the present invention, there may be used a semiconductor laser element in which active layer is made as a ridge stripe shape and sandwiched by guide layer, and the edge surface of a resonator is provided.",
        "A nitride semiconductor exhibits n-type electroconductivity in a condition in which it is not doped. However, it is preferable to set the carrier concentration of the respective layers within a fixed range for improving the luminescence efficiency. It is preferable to appropriately introduce Si, Ge, Se, Te, C and the like as n-type dopant for forming a desired n-type nitride semiconductor in which the carrier concentration is controlled. On the other hand, when p-type nitride semiconductor is formed, it is preferable to dope Zn, Mg, Be, Ca, Sr, Ba and the like. The nitride semiconductor is hardly made be p-type by only doping the p-type dopant, therefore it is preferable to make it be low resistance by carrying out heating by a furnace, a treatment by plasma irradiation and the like after introduction of the p-type dopant. When a structure in which a sapphire substrate is not removed is made, p- and n-contact layers are exposed at the same face side by partially etching from p-type side to the surface of the first contact layer, and the respective electrodes are formed on the respective contact layers. A light emitting element comprising the nitride semiconductor is prepared by cutting in a chip shape.",
        "In the light emitting device, the light emitting element is selected in the relation of an excitation wave length with the luminescence wave length of a phosphor used, in order to realize a luminescence color required, but then, it is appropriately selected considering the deterioration of a transparent resin by light and the like. In the present invention, those having a luminescence spectrum at an ultraviolet region and its main luminescence wave length is 360 nm or more and 420 nm or less, and those having 450 nm or more and 470 nm or less can be also used.",
        "Hereat, it is preferable to adjust the relation of the sheet resistance Rn of n-contact layer formed at an impurity concentration of 1017 to 1020/cm3 with the sheet resistance Rp of transparent p-electrode, to be Rp\u2267Rn in the semiconductor light emitting element. Specifically, since the n-contact layer is formed to have, for example, a film thickness of 3 to 10 \u03bcm and more preferably 4 to 6 \u03bcm, the sheet resistance Rn is estimated to be 10 to 15\u03a9/\u25a1. Accordingly, hereat, the Rp is preferably formed in a thin film to have a resistance value of the above-mentioned sheet resistance (10 to 15\u03a9/\u25a1) or more. Further, the transparent p-electrode may be formed in a thin film having a film thickness of 150 \u03bcm or less. Further, ITO and ZnO other than a metal can be used for the p-electrode. Hereat, an n-electrode mode equipped with a plural number of openings for light take-out such as a mesh electrode may be made in place of the transparent p-electrode.",
        "Further, when the transparent p-electrode is formed by one kind selected from a group of gold and platinum and a multilayered film or alloy comprising at least one kind of other elements, stability and reproducibility are improved by adjusting the sheet resistance of the transparent p-electrode by the content of gold or platinum element contained. Since gold or a metal element has a high absorption coefficient at the wave length of the semiconductor light emitting element used for the present invention, the lesser the amount of gold or platinum element contained in the transparent p-electrode is, the better the transparency is. A conventional semiconductor light emitting element had the relation of the sheet resistance of Rp\u2266Rn, but in the present invention, since it is Rp\u2267Rn, the transparent p-electrode is formed in a thinner film in comparison with a conventional one. The thin film forming can be easily attained by reducing the amount of gold or platinum element.",

However, since it is difficult to measure Rn after preparing the semiconductor light emitting element, it is substantially impossible to know the relation of Rp and Rn, but it is possible to know what relation exists between Rp and Rn from the condition of light intensity distribution at light emission.",
        "Further, when the transparent p-electrode and n-contact layer have the relation of Rp\u2267Rn, it is preferable to provide p-side pedestal electrode having an extended conduction portion in contact with the above-mentioned transparent p-electrode, therefore the external quantum efficiency can be further improved. The shape and direction of the extended conduction portion is not limited, and when the extended conduction portion is a linear shape, an area obstructing light is preferably reduced, but the shape may be a mesh shape. The shape may be a curve, a lattice, a branch and a hook other than linear shape. Hereat, since the shading effect is increased in proportion to the total area of the p-side pedestal electrode, it is preferable to design the line width and length of the extended conduction portion so that the shading effect does not exceeds the luminescence increasing effect.",

The three compounds as raw materials were charged in a crucible, and firing was carried out in a small size furnace at 1400\u00b0 C. for 5 hours under hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature was gradually raised by heating from room temperature to 1400\u00b0 C., and after carrying out firing for 5 hours, cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature for 5 hours. As a result, a phosphor powder having a orange body color and orange luminescence was obtained, and when visual observation was carried out, luminescence brightness was extremely low.",
        "With respect to Comparative Examples 6 to 9, firing was carried out changing the firing conditions of a furnace, firing temperature, atmosphere and form. The firing is carried out under hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. The nitride phosphors which were obtained in the conditions of Comparative Examples 6 to 8 had extremely low luminescence brightness by visual observation. In case of Comparative Example 9, firing was carried out in hydrogen atmosphere but luminescence was not carried out by visual observation.

        "The phosphor represented by MXSiYNZ:Eu (M contains at least one or more of alkali earth metals consisting of a group of Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn, and Z is Z=2/3X+4/3Y) absorbs a short wave length of 250 nm to 450 nm at a visible light region and intensely reflect light at a wave length of 450 nm to 500 nm. Accordingly, since the phosphor absorbs a short wave length of from indigo, blue color to blue green color of visible light, it strongly reflects at wave length sides such as a green color, a yellow color, a red color and the like. For example, it has property of obtaining a slightly reddish white color by combination with a blue light emitting diode, utilizing the characteristic.",

        "The mode 7 of operation of the present invention is illustrated as follows referring to drawings. However, the mode 7 of operation shown below exemplifies the light emitting device for embodying the technical philosophy of the present invention, and the present invention does not limit the light emitting device to below.

In particular, the phosphors used in the present mode 7 of operation are the first phosphor which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum in a range of a yellow to green region and the second phosphor which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum in a red region. The first phosphor is a YAG-base phosphor which contains Y and Al, and contains at least one of elements selected from Lu, Sc, La, Gd, Th, Eu and Sm and at least one of elements selected from Ga and In and is activated by cerium.

        "In general, since the excitation efficiency of the phosphor is lowered in accordance with the raise of the ambient temperature, the output of light emitted from the phosphor is also lowered. In the present mode 7 of operation, the lowering proportion of the relative luminescence output when the ambient temperature was changed by 1\u00b0 C. is defined as the decreasing rate of the luminescence output. The decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor are 4.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less together, preferably 3.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less, and more preferably 2.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less, and it is constituted that the lowering of beam [lm] of the whole light emitting device accompanying heat emission can be further suppressed. Further, it is constituted that the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor against the raise of temperature are nearly equal. Namely, the difference of the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor is set at 2.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less and more preferably 2.0\u00d710\u22124 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less, therefore the decreasing rates of the luminescence output are nearly equal. The temperature characteristics of the phosphors in which the excitation efficiency is lowered by heat emission become nearly equal, therefore a light emitting device which can suppress the color deviation even if the ambient temperature is changed can be formed.",
        "The respective constitutions of the mode 7 of operation of the present invention are specifically described below.",
        "[Phosphor]",
        "As the phosphor used in the present mode 7 of operation, there can be used a phosphor combining a yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base phosphor with a phosphor capable of emitting red light, in particular a nitride-base phosphor. These YAG-base phosphor and nitride-base phosphor may be mixed to be contained in the coating portion 201, or separately contained in the coating portion 201 which is constituted by a plural number of layers. The respective phosphors are specifically illustrated below.",
        "(Yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base Phosphor)",
        "The yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base phosphor (YAG-base phosphor) used in the present mode 7 of operation is a phosphor which contains Y and Al, and contains at least one of elements selected from Lu, Sc, La, Gd, Tb, Eu and Sm and at least one of elements selected from Ga and In and is activated by at least one of elements selected from the rare earth elements, and a phosphor which emits light by being excited by visible light or ultraviolet rays which were emitted from the LED chip 202. In particular, in the present mode 7 of operation, two or more of yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors which are activated by Ce or Pr and have different compositions can be also applied. For example, there are mentioned YAlO3:Ce, Y3Al5O12 Y:Ce (YAG:Ce), Y4Al2O9:Ce, further a mixture thereof and the like. Further, at least one selected from Ba, Sr, Mg, Ca and Zn may be contained, and further, when Si is contained, the reaction of crystal growth can be also suppressed and the particles of the phosphor can be also uniformed. Hereat, the YAG-base phosphor activated by Ce shall be widely considered, and it is used for a wide meaning including a phosphor having fluorescence action in which a portion or all of yttrium is substituted with at least one of elements selected from a group consisting of Lu, Se, La, Gd and Sm, or a portion or all of aluminum is substituted with any or both of Ba, Tl, Ga and In. More specifically, it is a photoluminescence phosphor indicated by the general formula (YzGd1\u2212z)3Al5O12:Ce (provided that 0<z\u22661), and a photoluminescence phosphor indicated by the general formula (Re1\u2212aSma)3Re\u20325O12:Ce (provided that 0\u2266a<1, 0\u2266b\u22661, Re is at least one selected from Y, Gd, La and Sc, and Re\u2032 is at least one selected from Al, Ga and In).",
        "A desired white luminescence color display can be carried out by color mixing blue light which was emitted from a light emitting element using a nitride-base phosphor-base semiconductor, with green or red light which is emitted from a phosphor whose body color is yellow for absorbing blue light, or yellow light being more greenish light and more reddish light. It is preferable that the light emitting device contains the powder and bulk of the phosphor in various resins such as an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin or a silicone resin, and inorganic substances such as silicon oxide and aluminum oxide in order to provoke the color mixing. The product containing the phosphor can be variously used for a dot shape product and a laminar shape product which were thinly formed so that light from the LED chip passes through the product, and the like in accordance with uses. Arbitrary color tones such as a light bulb color including a white color can be provided by variously adjusting the ratio of the phosphor and resins, coating and the filling amount, and selecting the luminescence wave length of a light emitting element.",
        "Further, a light emitting device capable of efficiently emitting light can be made by respectively arranging 2 or more of phosphors against the incident light from the light emitting element in order. Namely, the reflection light can be effectively utilized by laminating a color converting member in which the phosphor having an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and capable of emitting light at a long wavelength side was contained, and a color converting member which has an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and can emit light at a longer wave length side, on the light emitting element having a reflection member.",
        "When the YAG-base phosphor is used, a light emitting device having an adequate light resistance in high efficiency can be made even though it is arranged contacting with the LED chip having (Ee)=0.1 W\u00b7cm\u22122 or more and 1000 W\u2212cm\u22122 or less as emission brightness, or adjacently.",
        "Since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting blue light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor used for the present mode 7 of operation which was activated by Ce is a garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum can be set from 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length \u03bbp is around 510 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 700 nm. On the other hand, since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting red light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor which was activated by Ce is also the garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum can be set from 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length \u03bbp is around 600 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 750 nm.",
        "Among the compositions of the YAG-base phosphors having the garnet configuration, the luminescence spectrum shifts toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the luminescence spectrum shifts toward longer wavelength by substituting the portion of Y of the composition with Gd and/or La. The YAG-base phosphor can be also obtained by, for example, baking a raw material in which a more excessive amount of substituting element than a stoichiometric ratio was adjusted to be added. When the substitution of Y is less than 20%, a green component is large and a red component is little. Further, when it is more than 80%, the red component is increased but the brightness is rigorously lowered. Further, with respect to the excitation absorption spectrum similarly, among the composition of the YAG-base phosphor having the garnet configuration, the excitation absorption spectrum shifts toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the excitation absorption spectrum shifts toward longer wavelength by substituting the portion of Y with Gd and/or La. It is preferable that the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor is situated at a shorter wave length side than the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element. When such a constitution is made, the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum coincides nearly with the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element, therefore a light emitting device suppressing the generation of the color deviation can be formed without lowering the excitation efficiency of the phosphor.",
        "With respect to the phosphor, oxides or compounds which are easily converted to be oxides at a high temperature are used as raw materials of Y, Gd, Ce, La, Al, Sm and Ga, and they are adequately mixed at a stoichiometric ratio to obtain a raw material. Alternatively, a solubilized solution which was obtained by dissolving the rare earth elements of Y, Gd, Ce, La and Sm in an acid at a stoichiometric ratio was co-precipitated with oxalic acid and then the co-precipitated product was baked to obtain a co-precipitated oxide. Then, the co-precipitated oxide, aluminum oxide and gallium oxide are mixed to obtain a mix raw material. An appropriate amount of a fluoride such as ammonium fluoride, or NH4Cl as a flux is mixed with this, and the mixture is packed in a crucible and baked at a temperature range of 1350 to 1450\u00b0 C. in air for 2 to 5 hours to obtain a baked product. The baked product is pulverized in water by a ball mill, washed, separated, dried and finally sieved to obtain the phosphor. Further, in the production method of the phosphor of the alternative mode 7 of operation, it is preferable that a mixture comprising a flux and a mix raw material which mixed the raw materials of the phosphor is baked by 2 steps which consist of the first baking step of carrying out in air or weak reduced atmosphere and the second baking step of carrying out in reduced atmosphere. Wherein the weak reduced atmosphere means weak reduced atmosphere which was set to contain at least an oxygen amount necessary for the reaction process of forming a desired phosphor from the mix raw material. The black conversion of the phosphor can be prevented and the lowering of the absorption efficiency of light can be prevented by carrying out the first baking step until the configuration formation of the desired phosphor is completed in the weak reduced atmosphere. Further, the reduced atmosphere in the second baking step means stronger reduced atmosphere than the weak reduced atmosphere. Thus, when the phosphor is baked at 2 steps, the phosphor having the high absorption efficiency of excitation wave length is obtained. Accordingly, when the light emitting device is formed by the phosphor which was formed thus, the amount of the phosphor necessary for obtaining a desired color tone can be reduced, a light emitting device having a high light-take out efficiency can be formed.",
        "The yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors which were activated by 2 or more cerium having different compositions may be used in mixture, or may be respectively arranged independently. When the phosphors are respectively arranged independently, it is preferable to arrange a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light from the light emitting element at a shorter wave length side and a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light at a longer wave length side than the former, in order. The absorption and emission of light can be carried out in high efficiency thereby.",
        "In the present mode 7 of operation, when the YAG-base phosphor is used as the first phosphor, for example, the phosphor having the compositions below can be used.\n\n    The phosphor 7-1: (Y0.90Gd0.10)2.85Ce0.15Al5O12 \n    The phosphor 7-2: (Y0.395Gd0.605)2.85Ce0.15Al5O12 \n    The phosphor 7-3: Y2.965Ce0.035(Al0.8Ga0.2)5O12 \n    The phosphor 7-4: (Y0.80Gd0.20)2.965Ce0.035Al5O12 \n    The phosphor 7-5: Y2.650Ce0.035(Al0.5Ga0.5)5O12 \n    The phosphor 7-6: Y2.85Ce0.15Al5O12",
        "Further, the YAG-base phosphor in the present invention is not limited to these. The phosphors 7-1 to 7-6 are more specifically illustrated referring to FIG. 92 to FIG. 97. FIG. 92 is a chart showing the luminescence spectra when the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 and 7-4 were excited at EX=460 nm. FIG. 93 is a chart showing the reflection spectra of the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-4. FIG. 94 is a chart showing the excitation spectra of the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-4. FIG. 97 is a chart showing the luminescence spectra when the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-5 and 7-6 were excited at EX=460 nm. FIG. 95 is a chart showing the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5. FIG. 96 is a chart showing the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6.",
        "Since the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-6 have different peak wave lengths, the YAG-base phosphor having a desired color tone is selected. Then, the light emitting element is selected from the excitation spectrum and reflection spectrum. For example, the peak wave length at the long wavelength side of the excitation spectrum is about 456 nm for the YAG-base phosphor of 1. Considering a case that the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of charged electric current, the light emitting element having a luminescence peak wave length at a longer wave length side by about 5 to 10 nm than the 456 nm is selected. Further, the light emitting element is selected considering the excitation spectrum of the second phosphor.",
        "On the other hand, when the YAG-base phosphor is selected as the second phosphor after selecting a phosphor which emits light at a certain wave length, the points below must be considered. For example, when the charged electric current is low from the relation of the second phosphor with the light emitting element, the light emitting element having a luminescence peak wave length of 457 nm is used at a rating drive of 20 mA. When the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is selected, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is 457 nm. Accordingly, when the charged electric current is comparatively low to the light emitting element, the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 emits light most efficiently. However, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength by about 10 nm in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. When the luminescence peak wave length is shifted toward shorter wavelength by about 10 nm, the excitation efficiency of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is lowered, therefore the relative luminescence intensity of the YAG-base phosphor is lowered. Namely, the proportion of the luminescence intensity of emission after conversion to the excitation light is relatively lowered. Accordingly, the light emitting device using the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 generates the color tone deviation in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. On the contrary, when the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 is selected, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum is 440 nm. The luminescence intensity of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 is improved in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. On the other hand, the luminescence output of the YAG-base phosphor is lowered in accordance with the emission of heat. Accordingly, the light emitting device using the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 can provide a light emitting device having the little color tone deviation and stable luminescence because the color tone deviation caused by heat is compensated with the color tone deviation caused by spectrum shift in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element, even if the charged electric current to the light emitting element is increased. Accordingly, when the YAG-base phosphor having the same peak wave length at increasing the charged electric current of the light emitting element or the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum at a short wavelength side is used for the first phosphor, the change of the color tone and luminescence intensity is extremely little. In addition to the above-mentioned phosphors, various YAG-base phosphors can be used.",
        "(Nitride-base Phosphor)",
        "In the present mode 7 of operation, the nitride-base phosphor absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip 202 and emits light at a yellow to red region. The nitride-base phosphor is used together with the YAG-base phosphor to the light emitting device having the above-mentioned constitution, and there is provided the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base white color by color mixing of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip 202, with the yellow to red light by the nitride-base phosphor. It is preferable to contain the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescence substance activated by cerium, in the phosphor which is added in addition to the nitride-base phosphor. Because the phosphor can be adjusted to a desired chromaticity by containing the yttrium-aluminum oxide luminescent substance. The yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance activated by cerium absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip 202 and emits light at a yellow region. Hereat, light of a pale white color is emitted by color mixing of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip 202, with the yellow light of the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance. Accordingly, there can be provided the light emitting device which emits light of a white color mix light by mixing the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance with the phosphor which emits red light in the coating member 201 having transmittance and combining the mixture with blue light which was emitted from the LED chip 202. In particular, the light emitting device emitting white light which is situated on the locus of black body radiation in a chromaticity chart. However, in order to provide a light emitting device having a desired color temperature, the phosphor amount of the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance and the amount of the phosphor which emits red light can be also suitably changed. The light emitting device emitting white color mix light is designed to improve the specific rendering index R9.",
        "Conventionally, a light emitting device emitting white light which used a semiconductor element adjusts the balance of blue light from a light emitting element and green to red light from a phosphor matching with the visual sensitivity of human, and obtains the balance from the color mixing of light. The color tone of a light emitting device emitting white light which used a semiconductor light emitting element is usually obtained by adjusting the balance of luminescence at the rating drive region in which the output property of the light emitting device is stable. However, in case of a liquid crystal back light and a light-adjustable illumination light source, these light emitting devices are used by changing the applied electric power and electric current density. When the electric current density is changed for adjusting the power of the light emitting device in a conventional technology, the balance of luminescence has been broken and the color tone deviation has been generated to lower the quality of the light source. The mode of operation of the present invention is specifically illustrated below.",
        "Firstly, FIG. 55 is referred.",
        "The peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum which the light emitting element has is shifted toward shorter wavelength by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element. When the applied electric current is increased, the electric current density is enlarged and energy level is raised. There are factors such as a band gap is enlarged thereby, and the like. The fluctuation width between the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum when the electric current density to the light emitting element is small and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum when the applied electric current is increased is about 10 nm when the applied electric current is increased by 20 mA to 100 mA in the present mode of operation.",
        "Illustration is carried out using FIG. 56 and FIG. 57.",
        "For example, the YAG-base phosphor is used as the first phosphor. The peak wave length of the excitation spectrum for the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 3 is about 448 nm. When the luminescence intensity of the peak wave length of 448 nm of the excitation spectrum is set as 100, the luminescence intensity at 460 nm is 95. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 448 nm has higher luminescence intensity than the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 460 nm. The relation of the light emitting element with the first phosphor is outlined because of this reason. Just after electric current is applied to the light emitting element, a light emitting element in which the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is 460 nm is selected. The light emitting element emits blue light. The YAG-base phosphor which was excited by the blue light of the light emitting element emits green light of about 530 nm. Then, the applied electric current of the light emitting element is increased and the electric current of 100 mA is charged. The luminescence output of the semiconductor element is increased thereby, and the temperature of the light emitting element and the periphery is increased in accordance with this. Further, the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is shifted from 460 nm to a short wave length of 450 nm. At this time, the YAG-base phosphor has the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm than 460 nm of the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor exhibits relatively the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm of the excitation light than at 460 nm. Further, blue light has a lower visual feeling efficiency at 450 nm than at 460 nm. Accordingly, since the brightness of the blue light of the light emitting element and the green light of the YAG-base phosphor becomes higher, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is strengthened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the green light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the green light. On the other hand, since the brightness of the phosphor is lowered by the increase of the ambient temperature, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is weakened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the blue light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the green light. The color tone deviation is suppressed by these balances.",
        "Illustration is carried out using FIG. 58 and FIG. 59.",
        "For example, the nitride-base phosphor is used as the second phosphor. The peak wave length of the excitation spectrum with respect to the nitride-base phosphor of the phosphor 5 is about 450 nm between 350 nm and 500 nm. When the luminescence intensity of the peak wave length of 450 nm of the excitation spectrum is set as 100, the luminescence intensity at 460 nm is 95. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 450 nm has higher luminescence intensity than the excitation of the nitride-base phosphor at 460 nm. The relation of the light emitting element with the second phosphor is outlined because of this reason. When the applied electric current density to the light emitting element is low, a light emitting element in which the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is 460 nm is selected. The same light emitting element as the one which was used for exciting the first phosphor is used. The light emitting element emits blue light. The nitride-base phosphor which was excited by the blue light of the light emitting element emits red light of about 637 nm. Then, the applied electric current of the light emitting element is increased and the electric current of 100 mA is charged. The luminescence output of the semiconductor element is increased thereby, and the temperature of the light emitting element and the periphery is increased in accordance with this. Further, the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is shifted from 460 nm to a short wave length of 450 nm. At this time, the nitride-base phosphor has the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm than 460 nm of the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum. Accordingly, the excitation of the nitride-base phosphor exhibits relatively the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm of the excitation light than at 460 nm. Further, blue light has a lower visual feeling efficiency at 450 nm than at 460 nm. Accordingly, since the brightness of the blue light of the light emitting element and the red light of the nitride-base phosphor becomes higher, the relative intensity of the red light to the blue light is strengthened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the red light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the red light. On the other hand, since the brightness of the phosphor is lowered by the increase of the ambient temperature, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is weakened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the blue light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the red light. The color tone deviation is suppressed by these balances.",
        "The relation between the first phosphor with the second phosphor is outlined. The nitride-base phosphor absorbs not only the light from the light emitting element but also the light around the peak wave length (about 530 nm) of the luminescence spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor, and is excited.",
        "Further, the mutual relation of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor is specifically illustrated. Heat emission is generated by charging electric current to the light emitting element. The quantity of heat emission is also increased by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element. The greater part of the heat which was generated at the light emitting element is accumulated in the coating member or the phosphor. Thus, the ambient temperature is raised and the lowering of the luminescence output of the phosphor itself is generated. On the contrary, the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength side by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element as the description, and the luminescence intensity of the first phosphor is increased. The first phosphor can keep the color tone and luminescence output by these interactions without most changing. Further, the second phosphor can also keep the color tone and luminescence output by these interactions without most changing.",
        "The color tone of the light emitting device is determined by the respective interactions of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor. Namely, the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of the applied electric current. The luminescence intensities of the first phosphor and the second phosphor which are excited by the light emitting element is increased in accordance with this. On the other hand, the light emitting element is heated in accordance with the increase of the applied electric current to the light emitting element. The heat is accumulated in the first phosphor and the second phosphor, the coating member and the like by the heat emission. The luminescence output of these phosphors is lowered by the accumulation of heat. Accordingly, the color tone deviation of the light emitting device can be suppressed even if the applied, electric current to the light emitting element is increased. The color tone deviation can be hardly felt visually by selection of the first phosphor and the second phosphor even if the color tone deviation is generated in the light emitting device. Considering the interactions of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor, the color tone of the light emitting device transfers to a direction in which the color tone x is increased and a direction in which the color tone y is also increased. The direction to which the color tone is deviated is fluctuated along the locus of black radiation. The color deviation along the locus of black radiation is low sensitivity for human vision in comparison with the color deviation to a direction perpendicular to the locus of black radiation. Further, the swing width of the color deviation is narrow by the interaction (self absorption and the like) of the first phosphor and the second phosphor. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a light emitting device preventing the color tone deviation. The present invention has a great effect in particular for a light emitting device being easily subject to the influence of heat, for example, a semiconductor light emitting device which is DC drive and a power system which requires a large applied power, a light emitting device in which heat discharge is difficult and heat is easily accumulated, and under drive environment.",
        "Further, a phosphor in which the excitation spectrum is hardly changed can be used within a range in which the light emitting element transfers to a short wavelength side in accordance with the increase of the applied electric power. For example, when the nitride-base phosphor of the phosphor 5 of Example is used, the excitation spectrum is hardly changed between 420 nm to 450 nm, but the effect is exhibited by using YAG having the characteristic of the present invention in combination. Further, the light emitting device of the present invention can be provided even if a phosphor having a characteristic of temperature-characteristics of the above-mentioned phosphor and a characteristic of the excitation spectrum and the light emitting element is used other than the above-mentioned phosphor.",
        "Further, the positions of the excitation spectrum and the peak wave length of the light emitting element can be adjusted considering the thermal resistance and discharge property of heat of the light emitting device, the junction temperature of the light emitting element and the like.",

In particular, the phosphor layers used in the present mode 8 of operation are the first phosphor layer 303 which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum at a red region and the second phosphor layer 306 which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum at a yellow to green region. The first phosphor layer 303 can contain a nitride-base phosphor which contains N, and contains at least one of elements selected from Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn and at least one elements selected from C, Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf, and is activated by at least one element selected from the rare earth elements. Further, the second phosphor layer 306 can contain a YAG-base phosphor which contains Y and Al, and contains at least one of elements selected from Lu, Sc, La, Gd, Th, Eu and Sm and at least one of elements selected from Ga and In and is activated by at least one element selected from the rare earth elements.",

Further, similarly, the LED chip 304 capable of emitting light at a blue region is mounted in the second concave portion 305, and the second phosphor layer 306 is formed so as to cover the LED chip 304 and the first phosphor layer 303. When the molding member having a diffusing agent is used, the first phosphor layer 303 and the second phosphor layer 306 are covered, the electroconductive wire 310, LED chip and phosphor layers are protected, and light which is emitted from the phosphor layers can be also diffused and color-mixed to a direction of the face of observing luminescence. Hereat, the n-side electrode and p-side electrode of the LED chip 302 and the LED chip 304 are respectively connected with the n-side electrode and p-side electrode of the lead electrode 309 which was integrally molded in the package 308, using the electroconductive wire 310.",
        "In the light emitting diodes which were constituted as above, the portion of LED light excites the phosphor contained in the first phosphor layer 303, and generates light at a red region having a wave length which is different from the LED light. Further, the portions of LED light by the LED chip 304 and the LED chip 302 excites the phosphor contained in the second phosphor layer 306, and generates light at a yellow to green region having a wave length which is different from the LED light. The fluorescences which are generated from the first phosphor layer 303 and the second phosphor layer 306 and LED light which is output without contributing the excitation of the phosphors are color-mixed to be output from the direction of the face of observing luminescence of the light emitting device. Thus, a plural number of LRD chips are used and a plural number of phosphors are directly excited respectively, therefore the present invention can make the light emitting device capable of highly brilliantly emitting the light of luminescence spectrum which the respectively phosphors have naturally, in comparison with a conventional light emitting device which excites several kinds of phosphors by one LED chip at once.",
        "When the first phosphor layer and the second phosphor layer, or the third phosphor layer are separately laminated in order, the phosphors emitting light having different wave lengths are respectively contained in the respective phosphor layers, therefore the light emitting device which improved the color rendering property can be made. Namely, since the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum at a red region which is emitted from the red color-base phosphor contained in the first phosphor layer exists at a range of 600 nm to 700 nm and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor contained in the second phosphor layer exists at a range of 420 nm to 470 nm, the light emitted from the red color-base phosphor is hardly absorbed in the YAG-base phosphor and efficiently color-mixed with light having other wave length.",
        "Further, the first concave portion 301 is formed in the inner portion from the second concave portion 305. Since the light having a wave length of 500 nm to 700 nm which was emitted from the second phosphor layer 306 and is oriented to the direction of the face of observing luminescence is not absorbed by the red color-base phosphor having the excitation absorption spectrum at a wave length range of 350 nm to 600 nm, the light emitting device which improved the color rendering property can be made.",
        "Further, since the phosphor layers are formed so as to be divided into 2 layers, the light emitted from the first phosphor layer 303 and the LED light are not absorbed and diffused by the phosphor particles during passing the second phosphor layer 306, therefore the light at a blue region, the light at a yellow to green region and the light at a red region are efficiently color-mixed. Accordingly, the color rendering property of the light emitted from the light emitting device can be improved. Further, a diffusing agent or a filler may be preferably contained in the second phosphor layer 306, or the molding member which contained a diffusing agent or a filler may be formed on the second phosphor layer 306. The color mixing can be more efficiently carried out by making such a constitution.",
        "Since the excitation efficiency of phosphors is usually lowered in accordance with the raise of ambient temperature, the output of the light emitted from the phosphors is also lowered. In the present mode 8 of operation, the lowering proportion of the relative luminescence output when the ambient temperature was changed by 1\u00b0 C. in a condition in which the phosphor is coated on the light emitting element emitting light at a blue region in which the peak wave length \u03bbp is about 460 nm is defined as the decreasing rate of the luminescence output. The decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor against the raise of temperature are 0.4.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less and more preferably 2.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less, and it can be constituted that the lowering of beam [1 m] of the whole light emitting device accompanying heat emission can be further suppressed. Further, it can be constituted that the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor against the raise of temperature are nearly equal. Namely, the difference of the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor is set as 2.0\u00d710\u22123 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less and more preferably 2.0\u00d710\u22124 [a. u./\u00b0 C.] or less, therefore the decreasing rates of the luminescence output can be nearly the same. The temperature characteristics of the phosphors in which the excitation efficiency is lowered by heat emission become nearly equal, therefore a light emitting device which can suppress the color deviation even if the ambient temperature is changed can be formed.",

These YAG-base phosphor and nitride-base phosphor are respectively contained in the phosphor layers which are constituted by a plural number of layers. The respective phosphors are specifically illustrated below. In the present invention, the particle diameter of the phosphor is a value obtained by a volume based particle size distribution curve, and the volume based particle size distribution curve is obtained by measuring the particle size distribution of a phosphor by a laser diffraction-scattering method. Specifically, the phosphor is diffused in a sodium hexametaphosphate aqueous solution having a concentration of 0.05% under environments of a temperature of 25\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 70%, and the value is obtained by measuring the particles at a particle diameter range of 0.03 \u03bcm to 700 \u03bcm by a laser diffraction type particle size distribution measurement apparatus (SALD-2000A).",

In particular, the present mode 8 of operation, 2 or more of the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors having different compositions which were activated by Ce or Pr are utilized. A desired white luminescence color display can be carried out by color mixing the blue light which was emitted from a light emitting element using a nitride-base phosphor-base semiconductor, with the green or red light which is emitted from a phosphor whose body color is yellow for absorbing the blue light, or the yellow light being more greenish light and more reddish light. It is preferable that the light emitting device contains the powder and bulk of the phosphor in various resins such as an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin or a silicone resin, and inorganic transparent substances such as silicon oxide, aluminum oxide and silica sol in order to provoke the color mixing. The product containing the phosphor can be variously used for a dot shape product and a laminar shape product which were thinly formed so that the light from the LED chip passes through the product, and the like in accordance with uses. Arbitrary color tones such as a light bulb color including a white color can be provided by variously adjusting the ratio of the phosphor and resins, coating and the filing amount, and selecting the luminescence wave length of a light emitting element.",

Further, when it is more than 80%, the red component is increased but the brightness is rigorously lowered. Further, with respect to the excitation absorption spectrum similarly, among the composition of the YAG-base phosphor having the garnet configuration, the excitation absorption spectrum is shifted toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the excitation absorption spectrum is shifted toward longer wavelength side by substituting the portion of Y with Gd and/or La. It is preferable that the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor is situated at a shorter wave length side than the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element.

Alternatively, a solubilized solution which was obtained by dissolving the rare earth elements of Y, Gd, Ce, La and Sm in an acid at a stoichiometric ratio was co-precipitated with oxalic acid and then the co-precipitated product was baked to obtain a co-precipitated oxide. Then, the co-precipitated oxide, aluminum oxide and gallium oxide are mixed to obtain a mix raw material. An appropriate amount of a fluoride such as ammonium fluoride as a flux is mixed with this, and the mixture is packed in a crucible and baked at a temperature range of 1350 to 1450\u00b0 C. in air for 2 to 5 hours to obtain a baked product.

Wherein the weak reduced atmosphere means weak reduced atmosphere which was set to contain at least an oxygen amount necessary for the reaction process of forming a desired phosphor from the mix raw material. The black conversion of the phosphor can be prevented and the lowering of the absorption efficiency of light can be prevented by carrying out the first baking step until the configuration formation of the desired phosphor is completed in the weak reduced atmosphere. Further, the reduced atmosphere in the second baking step means stronger reduced atmosphere than the weak reduced atmosphere. Thus, when the phosphor is baked at 2 steps, the phosphor having the high absorption efficiency of excitation wave length is obtained. Accordingly, when the light emitting device is formed by the phosphor which was formed thus, the amount of the phosphor necessary for obtaining a desired color tone can be reduced, a light emitting device having a high light-take out efficiency can be formed.",

        "The nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor which is represented by the general formula LXMYN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y):R or LXMYOZN((2/3)X+(4/3)Y\u2212(2/3)Z):R and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor contains elements (hereinafter, merely referred to as the \u201cdifferent elements\u201d) which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R. Among said general formula, Examples 1 to 80 are a nitride phosphor which is represented by Ca1.985Eu0.015Si5N7.990O0.00225 and contain elements different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R. Table 1 is the result of testing the properties of the nitride phosphor of Example 1 to 80. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 1 represents the raw materials by molar ratio. In Examples 1 to 80, the concentration of Eu is 0.015. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Ca. Further, the addition amount of the different elements against the phosphor after synthesis is the concentration of 100 ppm or 500 ppm. The adjustment of brightness and the adjustment of quantum efficiency can be carried out by adding said different elements. Further, when elements are diffused from a crucible and a furnace material, and in order to confirm the effect by elements contained in raw materials, the effect by said different elements was confirmed by adding the different elements to raw materials. Accordingly, when elements are diffused from a crucible and a furnace material in a practical use, it is considered to be a further mild condition (they become less than a case of consciously adding the different elements to raw materials).",
        "In the present Example, the Ca of a raw material was firstly pulverized to 1 to 15 \u03bcm, and nitrided in nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the nitride of Ca was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 \u03bcm. 20 g of the Ca of a raw material was weighed and nitrided.",
        "Similarly, the Si of a raw material was pulverized to 1 to 15 \u03bcm, and nitrided in nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the nitride of Si was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 \u03bcm. 20 g of the Si of a raw material was weighed and nitrided.",
        "Then, a compound containing the different elements was mixed with a Eu compound, Eu2O3 in a wet process. An example is illustrated by selecting H3BO3 as a compound containing the different elements. Firstly, 20 g of the Eu compound, Eu2O3 and 3.65 g of H3BO3 were weighed. When H3BO3 is made as a solution, Eu2O3 is mixed with the H3BO3 solution, and the mixture is dried. After drying, firing was carried out at 700\u00b0 C. to 800\u00b0 C. for about 5 hours in oxygen atmosphere. Europium oxide to which B was added was produced thereby. After the firing, a mixture of Eu and B was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 \u03bcm.",
        "The mixture of nitride of Ca, the nitride of Si and the mixture of Eu and B was mixed in nitrogen atmosphere.

        "The above-mentioned compounds having the different elements were mixed and baked. As the firing conditions, these compounds were charged in a crucible made of boron nitride in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, firing was carried out at about 1350\u00b0 C. for 5 hours, and they were gradually cooled to room temperature over about 5 hours. The different element was scattered by the firing, therefore the different element is also not occasionally contained in the final product. Even though the different element is contained, the less amount thereof than the initial addition amount remain by 0.1 ppm to about several hundreds ppm.",
        "The luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency of the nitride phosphor of Examples 1 to 80 is represented by the relative value on the basis that it is 100% when 500 ppm of Cr was added (the quantum efficiency of Example 30).",
        "It is the purpose of the firing not only to react in solid state but also to obtain particles having the disired particle sizes and good crystalinity. Flux is a material added to accelerate the growth of crystal. Flux can accelerate not only to grow the crystal but also to introduce a co-activator into the lattice of the base material. For example, since the Group I Elements have a relatively low melting point and can be introduced grain boundary during the firing, the crystal growth is accelerated by melting the element of the phosphor. The phosphor of which particle size is grown to absorbe the exciting energy easily can be obtained.",
        "The nitride phosphors in Examples 1 to 10 containing the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K and Cs have high brightness and high quantum efficiency. It is considered that this is caused by the flux effect. In Examples 1 to 10, the brightness can be adjusted by adjusting the addition amount of the Group I Element.",

        "In the present Examples, it is considered that a crucible is eroded at firing step, and elements constituting the crucible from the crucible contaminate in the nitride phosphor. Hereat, since the nitride phosphors related to Examples use the crucible of a boron nitride material and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere, it is considered that a crucible is eroded and B contaminates in the nitride phosphor. In this case, the nitride phosphor can improve the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency by containing B as shown in Examples 59 and 60.",
        "Accordingly, the crucible of a boron nitride material can be positively used for aiming the effect of improving the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency.",
        "On the other hand, when the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, but in this case, molybdenum lowers the brightness and quantum efficiency as shown in Example 32. Accordingly, it is preferable that the boron nitride crucible is used than the molybdenum crucible. Thus, the influence of the element contained in a crucible, a furnace material and the like to the nitride phosphor can be estimated to a certain degree from Examples 1 to 80.",
        "Even if the different element is contained by the concentration of several hundreds ppm, a light emitting device which emits light of a brilliant orange to red color by the excitation light source of 450 nm to 470 can be provided without generating the sharp lowering of luminescence brightness and luminescence efficiency, from Examples 1 to 80.",
        "Further, in Table 1, the temperature characteristic shows the quality of luminescence of the nitride phosphor at a high temperature and it shows that the nitride phosphor having little attenuation at a high temperature can emits stable luminescence even if the nitride phosphor was provided near at the surface of a light emitting device. Examples 1 to 80 is 97 to 100% at 35\u00b0 C., 95 to 100% at 100\u00b0 C., and 58 to 80% at 200\u00b0 C. Accordingly, it can be grasped that the temperature characteristic of the nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 is extremely good.",
        "According to the above-mentioned Examples 1 to 80, in particular, when several tens to several hundreds ppm of B was added, the brightness is 234.6% and the luminescence efficiency is 244.6% (when 100 ppm of B is added), and the brightness is 237.9% and the luminescence efficiency is 248.1% (when 500 ppm of B is added), as the basis when 500 ppm of Cr was added. This shows that the improvement of the luminescence efficiency is remarkable. Further, the similar effect can be obtained at using Ba, Sr, Ca\u2014Sr and the like in place of Ca, although it is not described in Examples.",
        "The nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 have a peak wave length near at 609 nm when they are excited by an excitation light source of 460 nm.",

Thus, Na, Ti, Mg, Al, B, Cr, Ni and the like have the effect of shortening the afterglow.",
        "When the component composition of the nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 was analyzed, Li, Na, K, Rb,Cs, Mg, W, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, Sb, Bi and the like in which the addition amount were 500 ppm remained by only the amount of 100 ppm or less. Only the less amount of the other different elements than the initial addition amount remained. For example, B which was added by 500 ppm remained by only 400 ppm. This is considered to be that the different elements were scattered.",

Further, the portion of n+GaN:Si is etched and exposed to form an n-type electrode. Copper with Fe is used for the lead frame 13. The light emitting element 10 is die-bonded at about the central part of the cup bottom of the mount lead 13a. Gold is used for the electroconductive wire 14, and Ni plating is carried out on the bump 4 for electrically connecting the electrode 3 with the electroconductive wire 14. In the phosphor 11 the phosphor of Example 15 and the YAG-base phosphor are used by mixture. As the coating member 12, a mixture which mixed an epoxy resin and a dispersant, barium titanate, titanium oxide and the above-mentioned phosphor 11 at a fixed proportion is used. The epoxy resin is used as the mold member 15. The bullet type light emitting device of Example 81 is a column in which the mold member 15 is a radius of 2 to 4 mm, height is about 7 to 10 mm, and the upper portion is hemispherical.",

Specifically, the phosphor of Example 15 emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is different from light having the first luminescence spectrum. Further, the YAG-base phosphor contained in the phosphor 11 is excited by light having the first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the third luminescence spectrum. The white light emitting device of Example 81 emits reddish light which was obtained by color mixing of mutually mixing the first, second and third luminescence spectra.",

Example 15 is the nitride phosphor of Ca2Si5N8:Eu in which Ba was added. On the other hand, as a comparison, there was prepared the type 1 light emitting device which did not contain the phosphor of Example 15 and used only the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium as the phosphor 11. The white light emitting device of Example 81 and the comparative white light emitting device use the phosphor of (Y0.8Gd0.2)3Al5O12:Ce as the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor. The comparative white light emitting device emits light by combination of a blue light emitting element and the phosphor of Y\u2014Ga\u2014Al\u2014O:Ce.

Accordingly, even if the same coating member 12 and the phosphor 11 are used, color unevenness in the color tone of the light emitting device is generated.

The crucible of a boron nitride material can be used, but it is not preferable that the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used. When the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that the crucible is eroded, molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, and molybdenum provokes the lowering of the luminescence properties.",

Further, Si is 5, while the addition amount of Mn is 0.015. Examples 170 to 176 are results obtained by properly changing the concentration of Sr and the concentration of Ca.",
        "Firstly, strontium nitride, calcium nitride, silicone nitride and europium oxide are mixed. In Example 170, the compounding ratio (molar ratio) of strontium nitride, Sr3N2, calcium nitride, Ca3N2, silicone nitride, Si3N2, and europium oxide, Eu2O3 which are raw materials is adjusted to be Sr:Ca:Si:Eu=X: 1.94\u2212X:5:0.06.",

Mn remains by several ppm to several tens ppm in SrXCa(1.94\u2212X)Eu0.06Si5N8(0\u2266X\u22661.94) after the firing.",
        "In Example 170, the molar ratio of Sr:Ca is 9:1. The luminescence brightness of the silicon nitride phosphor of Example 170 is referred to as 100%, the luminescence efficiency is referred to as 100%, and the luminescence efficiencies of Examples 171 to 176 are prescribed based on the basis of the compounding proportion at this time. When the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is increased, the luminescence efficiencies of the silicon nitride phosphor 126.9% at the molar ratio of Sr: Ca=7:3, and the peak wave length is 639 nm. The luminescence efficiency is improved from this, and the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side. Further, when the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is increased and the molar ratio of Sr:Ca is 5:5, namely, 1:1, the luminescence brightness of the silicon nitride phosphor is 111.2%, the luminescence efficiency is 167.7%, and the peak wave length is 644 nm. From this result, the luminescence efficiencies such as the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency are more improved than the case of Sr:Ca=9:1. In particular, since the peak wave length is shifted to a longer wave length side, the reddish phosphor can be produced. Further, the temperature characteristic is also extremely good. When the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is further increased, the peak wave length is shifted to a short wave length side. Even such case, the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency are not lowered, and the good luminescence properties can be obtained. In particular, since Sr is expensive in comparison with Ca, production cost can be reduced by increasing the compounding proportion of Ca.",

Since these have about the same composition, the phosphor has good luminescence properties.",
        "The phosphor related to Example uses the crucible of a boron nitride material, and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere. Since a furnace and a crucible are not eroded under the firing condition, impurities are not contaminated in a baked product. The crucible of a boron nitride material can be used, but it is not preferable that the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used. When the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that the crucible is eroded, molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, and molybdenum provokes the lowering of the luminescence properties.",
        "Thus, the improvement of the luminescence properties can provide luminescence materials which emit light of more brilliant white. Further, since the improvement of the luminescence properties enhance the energy efficiency, electric power can be also reduced.",

When the concentration of Eu is little, the luminescence is not adequately carried out, and when the concentration of Eu is too much, the concentration quenching occurs, or it is reacted with Sr3N2 or Ca3N2, and creates the composition different from the objective base nitride phosphor, therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. The luminescence efficiency is best for Example 180. On the other hand, the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of the concentration of Eu. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is not clear, but it is considered that the mix crystal of Sr and Ca is further accelerated by accelerating the diffusion of Mn with Sr3N2 and Ca3N2, therefore the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side.

        "The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 181. The most improvement of the luminescence brightness was observed at Example 183 in which the concentration of Eu is 0.03. When the concentration of Eu is little, the luminescence is not adequately carried out, and when the concentration of Eu is too much, the concentration quenching occurs, or it is reacted with Sr3N2 or Ca3N2, and creates the composition different from the objective base nitride phosphor, therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. The luminescence efficiency is best for Example 184. Examples 185 to 189 generate the lowering of the luminescence brightness, but it is considered that since commercially available raw materials are used, impurities are contained in said raw materials therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. In Examples 181 to 185 and in Examples 185 to 189, the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of the concentration of Eu. The principle is not clear, but it is considered that the mix crystal of Sr and Ca is further accelerated by accelerating the diffusion of Mn with Sr3N2 and Ca3N2, therefore the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side. Any of the temperarure characteristics of Examples 181 to 189 is extremely good.",

        "The above-mentioned compounds are mixed and firing is carried out. As firing conditions, they are charged in a boron nitride crucible in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350\u00b0 C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours.",

Si of % by weight obtained by extracting the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor from 100% is contained. The nitride phosphor has high luminescence brightness by the firing conditions and Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu and Mn. Since a semiconductor light emitting element generally used is raised to a temperature of 100 to 150\u00b0 C., it is preferable that it is stable at said temperature when the nitride phosphor are formed on the surface of a light emitting element. The temperature characteristics of the nitride phosphors of the present Examples 224 to 229 are extremely good. From this viewpoint, Example 225 has extremely good temperature characteristic therefore has a superior technical meaning.",
        "Example 226 has the high luminescence brightness in comparison with Example 225, and has the high quantum efficiency. Accordingly, Example 226 exhibits the extremely good temperature characteristic.",
        "The particle diameter of Example 224 is 1 to 3 \u03bcm, the particle diameter is big, and the luminescence brightness is high. It has a good dispersion and easiness to handle.",

        "The phosphors related to Examples use the crucible of boron nitride material, and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere. Since a furnace and a crucible are not eroded, impurities are not contaminated in a baked product. Example 228 shows the luminescence efficiency when B is contained in raw materials. From the result of Example 228, the luminescence efficiency is kept in a high condition even if much B is contained.",
        "This is caused by an assumption that a furnace and a BN crucible are eroded and BN is contained in the phosphor, but since the luminescence efficiency is not lowered, firing can be carried out without considering the erosion of the furnace and crucible. Namely, even if the boron nitride eroded is contained in the phosphor as a result of carrying out the firing under the condition, the luminescence efficiency is not lowered, therefore it is extremely useful.",
        "Example 229 shows the luminescence properties of the phosphor containing much aluminum. This considered the erosion from an alumina crucible when the alumina crucible is used. From the result of Example 229, the phosphor in which aluminum is contained exhibits also the high luminescence properties. Accordingly, even if the alumina crucible is used, firing can be carried out without considering the contamination of the alumina crucible.",
        "On the contrary, Comparative Example 2 uses a molybdenum crucible. When the molybdenum crucible is used, the crucible is eroded to be contained in the phosphor. The phosphor of Comparative Example 2 containing molybdenum generates the lowering of the luminescence properties. Accordingly, it is not preferable to use the molybdenum crucible. Since molybdenum lowers the luminescence properties, it is preferably removed to the outside of a system.",
        "Comparative Example 2 used those which contained Fe in the phosphor. Since Fe is occasionally contained in the phosphor by the contamination from the molybdenum crucible and a furnace, an effect of containing Fe in the phosphor was tested.

        "The compounding proportion of calcium nitride, Ca3N2, silicon nitride, Si3N4, and europium oxide, Eu2O3 which are the raw materials of Comparative Example 4 is set so as to be Ca:Si:Eu=1.97:5:0.03, and those which were adequately purified as the raw materials were used. On the other hand, the compounding proportion of the raw materials of Example 227 uses the same condition as Comparative Example 4, and the concentration of several ppm of Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn and Fe which is the same concentration as that of Example 224 is contained in the raw materials. Example 227 charges the three compounds of the raw materials in a BN crucible, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature, firing is carried out for 3 hours at about 800\u00b0 C., and further the temperature was gradually raised, firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350\u00b0 C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. Comparative Example 4 charged the three compounds of the raw materials which do not contain Mn and the like in a molybdenum crucible, and firing was carried out in hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. When the ammonia flow rate of Example 227 is referred to as 1, the flow rate of hydrogen/nitrogen of Comparative Example 4 is hydrogen:nitrogen=0.1:3. On the other hand, Example 224 carried out the raise of temperature gradually, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350\u00b0 C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours.",
        "As cleared from Table 28 and FIG. 38, the luminescence brightness of Comparative Example 4 is 99.1% and on the other hand, the luminescence brightness of Example 227 was 128.7%, therefore the luminescence brightness was improved by 29.6%. The difference of the luminescence brightness has an important technical meaning from the viewpoint of the luminescence efficiency. The energy efficiency of Comparative Example 4 was 99.1%, and on the contrary, the energy efficiency of Example 227 was 131.1%. It was improved by 32%. Further, the quantum efficiency of Comparative Example 4 was 100.5%, and on the contrary, the quantum efficiency of Example 227 was 136.8%. It was improved by 36.3%. Thus, the extremely remarkable luminescence properties can be obtained by changing atmosphere and the material of a crucible. Further, the extremely remarkable luminescence properties can be obtained by containing Mg, Mn and the like. The improvement of the luminescence properties can provide a light emitting material which emits light of a more brilliant white color. Further, the improvement of the luminescence property can improve also the reduction of electric power because it enhances energy efficiency.",
        "Further, Example 224 carried out firing under the same condition except the difference of a firing pattern in comparison with Example 227. The firing pattern of Example 224 carried out the raise of temperature gradually from room temperature, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350\u00b0 C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. At this time, the luminescence brightness was 134.3%, and it was improved by 34.3% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, the energy efficiency was 136.8%, and it was improved by 36.8% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, the quantum efficiency was 139.3%, and it was improved by 39.3% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, when the temperature characteristic is observed by the relative brightness fluctuation of a measured lot by setting room temperature as 100, Comparative Example 4 is 62.8% at a temperature of 200\u00b0 C., and on the contrary, Example 224 is 67.1% at the same temperature, which showed a high value. Further, Comparative Example 4 is 18.2% at a temperature of 300\u00b0 C., and on the contrary, Example 224 was 23.5% at the same temperature, which showed a high value. When said nitride phosphor was provided on surface of a light emitting element, the composition of the nitride phosphor is not changed, it represents that the temperature characteristic shows the high luminescence property, and it shows that the higher the temperature characteristic is, the more stable it is. From the result of Table 28, it is clear that the nitride phosphor related to the present invention has the better temperature characteristic than Comparative Example 4, and reliability is high. Examples 224 and 227 showed the extremely remarkable luminescence property in comparison with Comparative Example 4. The improvement of the luminescence property which has been not solved can be extremely easily carried out thereby.",

Hereat, it is preferable that the difference between the peak wavelength of the excitation absorption spectrum of the phosphors 257-1 to 257-3 and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the LED chip is 40 nm or less. Since the excitation efficiency of the phosphors is improved by using the phosphors and the quantity of light emitted from the LED is decreased without wave length conversion, the chromaticity deviation of a light emitting device can be prevented.",

Accordingly, although the chromaticity deviation of the light emitting device can be prevented by shifting the peak wave lengths of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphors, the emission of the light emitting device is deviated from the black body radiation locus, therefore a red component is added to the color mix light by adding the phosphor 257-4 or the phosphor 257-5, and the chromaticity coordinate is adjusted near at the black body radiation locus.",

The positive electrode and negative electrode of the LED chips 302 and 304 are respectively wire-bonded with the positive electrode and negative electrode of the lead electrode using the electroconductive wire 310.",

        "Firstly, after the light emitting diodes were formed using the phosphors 261-1 to 266-3 one by one, the ambient temperature was raised by applying a pulse current of 20 mA under a condition in which the heat emission of the LED chips themselves is negligible, and the luminescence outputs of the light emitting diodes for the ambient temperature were measured.

        "The LED chip 302 or 304 which is used for exciting the phosphors in the present Example is the light emitting element in which the InGaAlN base compound semiconductor was formed as a luminescence layer, and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum is around 460 nm. Further, the chromaticity coordinate is shifted toward lower color temperature side along the black body radiation locus by heightening the electric current density between 3 to 300 A/cm2. FIG. 81 is a chart showing the electric current properties of luminescence spectrum when electric current run in the LED chips 302 and 304 is changed. As shown in FIG. 81, with respect to the electric current properties of luminescence spectrum, the peak wave length is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of applied electric current.",

Accordingly, although the chromaticity deviation of the light emitting device can be prevented by shifting the peak wave lengths of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphors, the emission of the light emitting device is deviated from the black body radiation locus, therefore a red component is added to the color mix light by adding the phosphor 261-1 or the phosphor 266-3, and the chromaticity coordinate is adjusted near at the black body radiation locus.",

Namely, the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the temperature rises of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 are nearly equal. By making such a constitution thus, the difference of the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 is kept at a nearly equal value without being influenced by the ambient temperature, even if the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 are lowered by the rise of the ambient temperature caused by the heat emission of the light emitting element and the like.
