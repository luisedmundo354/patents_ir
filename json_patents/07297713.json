Cycle-related symptoms occur after ovulation but before menses and usually terminate at the start of the menstrual period or shortly thereafter. Cycle-related symptoms include, but are not limited to, dysmenorrhea and moderate to severe cycle-related symptoms.",
        "Suitably, the PR modulators are formulated for delivery by any suitable route including, e.g., transdermal, mucosal (intranasal, buccal, vaginal), oral, parenteral, etc, by any suitable delivery device including, e.g., transdermal patches, topical creams or gels, a vaginal ring, among others.",
        "When the compounds are employed for the above utilities, they may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, for example, solvents, diluents and the like, and may be administered orally in such forms as tablets, capsules, dispersible powders, granules, or suspensions containing, for example, from about 0.05 to 5% of suspending agent, syrups containing, for example, from about 10 to 50% of sugar, and elixirs containing, for example, from about 20 to 50% ethanol, and the like, or parenterally in the form of sterile injectable solutions or suspensions containing from about 0.05 to 5% suspending agent in an isotonic medium. Such pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about 25 to about 90% of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier, more usually between about 5% and 60% by weight.",
        "The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition being treated. In one embodiment, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.5 to about 500 mg/kg of animal body weight, desirably given in divided doses one to four times a day, or in a sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1 to 100 mg, desirably from about 2 to 80 mg. Dosage forms suitable for internal use contain from about 0.5 to 500 mg of the active compound in intimate admixture with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.",
        "The compounds may be administered orally as well as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes.

Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.",
        "The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringe ability exits. It must be stable under conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacterial and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oil.",
        "The compounds may also be administered via a vaginal ring. Suitably, use of the vaginal ring is timed to the 28 day cycle. In one embodiment, the ring is inserted into the vagina, and it remains in place for 3 weeks. During the fourth week, the vaginal ring is removed and menses occurs. The following week a new ring is inserted to be worn another 3 weeks until it is time for the next period. In another embodiment, the vaginal ring is inserted weekly, and is replaced for three consecutive weeks. Then, following one week without the ring, a new ring is inserted to begin a new regimen. In yet another embodiment, the vaginal ring is inserted for longer or shorter periods of time.",
        "For use in the vaginal ring, a PR modulator compound is formulated in a manner similar to that described for contraceptive compounds previously described for delivery via a vaginal ring. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,372; 6,126,958 and 6,125,850.",
        "The PR modulator compound(s) may also be delivered via a transdermal patch. Suitably, use of the patch is timed to the 28 day cycle. In one embodiment, the patch is applied via a suitable adhesive on the skin, where it remains in place for 1 week and is replaced weekly for a total period of three weeks. During the fourth week, no patch is applied and menses occurs. The following week a new patch is applied to be worn to begin a new regimen. In yet another embodiment, the patch remains in place for longer, or shorter periods of time.",
        "In one embodiment, the PR modulator(s) are used in cyclic regimens involving administration of the PR modulator alone. In another embodiment, the cyclic regimen involves administration of a PR modulator in combination with an estrogen or progestin, or both. Particularly desirable progestins can be selected from among those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,355,648; 6,521,657; 6,436,929; 6,540,710; and 6,562,857 and US Patent Application Publication No. 2004-0006060-A1. Still other progestins are known in the art and can be readily selected.

Among the desirable progestins for use in the combinations are levonorgestrel, gestodene and trimegestone.",
        "Examples of orally administered regimens over a 28 day cycle include administration of a progestational agent solely for the first 21 days at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 100 \u03bcg of levonorgestrel. A PR modulator compound can then be administered at a daily dose of from about 1 to 200 mg from day 22 to day 24, followed by no administration or administration of a placebo for days 25 to 28. It is most desirable that the daily dosages of each relevant active ingredient be incorporated into a combined, single daily dosage unit, totaling 28 daily units per 28-day cycle.",
        "In another regimen, a progestational agent may be coadministered for the first 21 days at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 150 \u03bcg levonorgestrel, desirably equal in activity to from about 35 to about 100 \u03bcg levonorgestrel, with an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 \u03bcg. This may be followed as described above with a PR modulator administered at a daily dose of from about 1 to 250 mg from day 22 to day 24, followed by no administration or administration of a placebo for days 25 to 28.",
        "Still another regimen can include co-administration from days 1 to 21 of a progestational agent, e.g., levonorgestrel, being administered at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 100 \u03bcg levonorgestrel, and an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 \u03bcg. This will be followed on days 22 to 24 by coadministration of a PR modulator (1 to 250 mg/day) and an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose of from about 10 to about 35 \u03bcg. From day 25 to day 28, this regimen may be followed by no administration or administration of a placebo.",
