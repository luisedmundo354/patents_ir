    "abstract": "According to one aspect, a memory cell array includes a bit line connected to a plurality of nonvolatile memory cells, where the nonvolatile memory cells are selectively programmable in any one of at least first, second, third and fourth threshold voltage states, and where the first, second, third and fourth threshold voltage states correspond to four different data values defined by first and second bits. A page buffer circuit stores a logic value as main latch data and is responsive to a main latch signal to selectively flip the logic value of the main latch data according to a voltage level of the bit line. A sub-latch circuit stores a logic value as sub-latch data and is responsive to a sub-latch signal to selectively flip the logic value of the sub-latch data according to the voltage level of the bit line. The memory device is operable in a read mode which reads the threshold voltage state of the non-volatile memory cells and a programming mode which programs the threshold voltage state of the non-volatile memory cells, wherein the page buffer circuit is selectively responsive to the sub-latch data to inhibit flipping of the logic value of the main latch data in the programming mode.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to semiconductor memory devices, and more particularly, the present invention relates to nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices and to methods of operating nonvolatile memory devices.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "The demand for electrically programmable and electrically erasable nonvolatile memory devices has increased dramatically in recent years. Such devices are at least partially characterized by the ability to maintain stored data even in the absence of supplied power. The use of so-called flash memories has become especially popular, particularly, but not exclusively, in the context of portable devices such as digital cameras, cell phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and laptop computers. Flash memories, such as NAND-type flash memories, are capable of storing large amounts of data in a relatively small area.",
        "As background discussion, the basic operating principles underlying flash memory cells and flash memory devices are presented below. However, it should be clearly understood that the discussion that follows is merely exemplary and does not in any way limit and/or define the scope of the present invention.",
        "The operating principle of a flash memory cell will be described first with reference to FIGS. 1A through 1C. FIG. 1A illustrates a typical configuration in which a flash memory cell transistor is connected to word and bit lines of a memory device, FIG. 1B shows the circuit symbol of a flash memory cell transistor, and FIG. 1C shows the threshold voltage characteristics of a flash memory cell transistor.",
        "Referring collectively to FIGS. 1A through 1C, a flash memory cell transistor includes a source region 4 and a drain region 5 located at the surface of a substrate 3. In this example, the substrate is P-type, and the source and drain regions 4 and 5 are N+-type. A gate structure is aligned over a channel region defined between the source and drain regions 4 and 5. The gate structure includes a floating gate 1 and a control gate 2. Although not shown, a tunneling dielectric layer is interposed between the floating gate 1 and the surface of the substrate P-sub, and another thin oxide layer (or control dielectric) is interposed between the floating gate 1 and the control gate 2. In the illustrated example, the drain voltage Vd is supplied from a bit line BL, the control gate voltage Vcg is supplied from a word line WL, and the source voltage Vs is connected to a reference potential such as ground.",
        "The threshold voltage (or voltages) of the flash memory cell transistor defines its stored logic value. That is, in the example of a single-bit cell transistor, when the flash memory cell transistor is in its initial state (also called an \u201cerased\u201d state), the threshold voltage Vth is relatively low as shown in FIG. 1C. In this state, the cell transistor is designated to have a logic value \u201c1\u201d, which generally corresponds to the ON state of a conventional transistor device. On the other hand, when the cell transistor is in its \u201cprogrammed\u201d state (PGM), the threshold voltage Vth is relatively high. This high threshold voltage state is designated to have a logic value \u201c0\u201d, which generally corresponds to the OFF state of a conventional transistor device.",
        "In order to change (program) the cell transistor from its initial state to its programmed state, a process known as Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling is utilized. Briefly, a relatively large positive potential difference is created between the control gate 2 and the substrate P-sub, and excited electrons within the channel on the surface of the substrate are caused to be pushed through and trapped in the floating gate 1. These negatively charged electrons act as a barrier between the control gate 2 and channel on the substrate, thus increasing the threshold voltage of the cell transistor as represented in FIG. 1C. The cell transistor can be brought back to its initial state by forming a large negative potential difference between the control gate 2 and the substrate P-sub, whereby resultant FN tunneling draws the trapped electrons back across the thin oxide layer between the floating gate 1 and substrate, thus removing the electron barrier and decreasing the threshold voltage Vth.",
        "Multi-bit (or multi-state) nonvolatile memories are characterized by utilizing each cell transistor to store two or more bits of data simultaneously. FIG. 2 is a diagram for explaining the operation of an exemplary two-bit nonvolatile cell memory. The threshold voltages Vth of the large numbers of flash cell transistors found in flash memory devices generally exhibit bell curve distributions. In the example of FIG. 2, the cell transistor can be set in any one of four (4) different threshold distributions, i.e., a first state, a second state, a third state and a fourth state. Any cell transistor having a threshold voltage within the distribution defined by one of these four states is assigned a corresponding two-bit logic value, for example, \u201c11\u201d, \u201c10\u201d, \u201c00\u201d and \u201c01\u201d as shown in FIG. 2. The particular bit assignments illustrated in FIG. 2 are known in the art as \u201cgray-coding.\u201d",
        "As mentioned above, a cell transistor is said to be \u201cprogrammed\u201d when its threshold voltage is increased from its normally ON state (its erased state) to a threshold voltage of a higher state. In FIG. 2, the threshold voltage distribution to the far left of the diagram (\u201c11\u201d) is the erased state. In two-bit programming of the cell transistor, two successive programming operations are executed, namely, a least significant bit (LSB) program mode, and a most significant bit (MSB) program mode. Examples of these LSB and MSB program modes are described below with reference to FIGS. 3-5.",
        "Note first that the cell transistor is initially in its erased state, and accordingly, its initial logic value is \u201c11\u201d (FIG. 2). In this example, if the LSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, then a programming operation is executed to increase the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the second state (FIG. 3). On the other hand, if the LSB of the data to be stored is \u201c1\u201d, no programming is executed during the LSB program mode. Note here that the cell transistor is either in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode.",
        "Next the MSB of the data to be stored dictates operations in the MSB program mode. FIG. 4 illustrates the case where gray-coding has been adopted. Regardless of whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode, no programming is executed in the MSB program mode if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c1\u201d. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, then programming occurs which is dependent on whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode. This is shown by the dashed lines appearing in FIG. 4. If the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, and if the cell transistor is in the first state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the fourth state. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, and if the cell transistor is in the second state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the second state to the third state.",
        "FIG. 5 is similar to FIG. 4, except that binary coding has been adopted. In this case, the first through fourth threshold voltage states designate two-bit values of \u201c11\u201d, \u201c10\u201d, \u201c01\u201d and \u201c00\u201d. Again, regardless of whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode, no programming is executed in the MSB mode if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c1\u201d. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, then programming occurs which is dependent on whether the cell transistor is in the first state or the second state after the LSB program mode. This is shown by the dashed lines appearing in FIG. 5. If the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, and if the cell transistor is in the first state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the first state to the third state. On the other hand, if the MSB of the data to be stored is \u201c0\u201d, and if the cell transistor is in the second state after the LSB program mode, then programming is executed to bring the threshold voltage of the cell transistor from the second state to the fourth state.",
        "Reading of the multi-bit nonvolatile memory will be described next with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7. In particular, FIG. 6 illustrates the LSB read mode in which the logic value of the LSB of the stored data is determined. The LSB read mode involves a first LSB read operation and a conditional second LSB read operation. In the first LSB read operation, a first read voltage Vread1 is applied to the word line of cell transistor.

Also, control signals SHLDHeM, SHLDHeS, SHLDHoM and SHLDHoS are set to the ground voltage VSS, and control signals SHLDLeM, SHLDLeS, SHLDLoM, SHLDLoS, BLSLTeM, BLSLTeS, SOBLKM and SOBLKS are set to the supply voltage VDD. In this manner, the bit lines BLe, BLo, BLm and BLs are discharged to the ground voltage VSS.",

Therefore, the on/off states of the selected memory cell MCsel are controlled depending on the data stored therein. When the data stored in the selected memory cell MCsel has a first data state (\u201c11\u201d in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an ON state. In contrast, when the stored data is one of the second to fourth data states (\u201c10\u201d, \u201c00\u201d and \u201c10\u201d in this example), the selected memory cell MCsel is in an OFF state.",
        "During the LSBRD2 interval, the voltage levels of the control signals SHLDLeM and SHLDLeS are changed to the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the discharge state of the even bit line BLe and the main bit line BLm is released. In this case, the control signals SHLDLoM and SHLDLoS are maintained at the supply voltage VDD. Therefore, the voltage level of the odd bit line BLo maintains the ground voltage VSS, and then functions as a shielding line between even bit lines BLe.",
        "Further, after the main pre-charge signal /PLOADM changes from the supply voltage VDD to a first preliminary voltage VPRE1 and maintains the first preliminary voltage VPRE1 for a certain period of time, the main pre-charge signal /PLOADM decreases to the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the main pre-charge transistor 230a is turned ON, and the main sensing node NSENM is thus pre-charged to the supply voltage VDD.",
        "In this case, the voltage level of a main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM is changed to a second preliminary voltage VPRE2 having a voltage level between the supply voltage VDD and the ground voltage VSS. Therefore, the main sensing node NSENM and the main bit line BLm are electrically connected to each other. As described above, the main bit line shutoff signal BLSHFM gates the main bit line shutoff transistor 240a with the second preliminary voltage VPRE2. Accordingly, the main bit line BLm is recharged to a voltage level that is lower than the second preliminary voltage VPRE2 by the threshold voltage of the main bit line shutoff transistor 240a through the use of current provided from the main pre-charge transistor 230a.",

Therefore, the main bit line BLm is electrically isolated from the main sensing node NSENM, and the development of data on the main bit line BLm progresses.",
        "When a data value stored in the selected memory cell MCsel is a first data state (\u201c11\u201d in this example), data on the main bit line BLm is discharged to the common source line (CSL).

        "Further, the main pre-charge transistor 230a maintains ON state and is then turned off just before the LSBRD3 interval terminates. Therefore, the main sensing node NSENM is changed to a floating state after maintaining the supply voltage VDD.",

Therefore, the main latch data is flipped from a logic \u201cL\u201d state to a logic \u201cH\u201d state during the LSBRD4 interval, while the main latch data is flipped from a logic \u201cH\u201d state to a logic \u201cL\u201d state during the LSBRD7 interval.

For example, a NAND-type nonvolatile semiconductor memory device is shown and described in this specification. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the technical spirit of the present invention can also be applied to other types of nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices, such as AND-type semiconductor memory devices.",
        "Further, as already suggested, it is not necessary or essential to include each and every element of the exemplary embodiments to realize the benefits and advantages of the present invention. As one example only, attention is direct to FIG. 25 which illustrates a modification of the embodiment shown in FIG. 17. Specifically, the embodiment of FIG. 25 omits the biasing circuitry found in the sub-bit line selection block 500 of FIG. 17. Many other variations of the invention, too numerous to list herein, will be readily contemplated by those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "Therefore, the technical scope of protection of the present invention is to be defined by the technical spirit of the accompanying claims, not the disclosed embodiments. In this regard, the phrase \u201cconnected to\u201d and similar such phrases are not to be interpreted as requiring direct connection between elements."
