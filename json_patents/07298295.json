        "The present application is a divisional application of application Ser. No. 10/512,648 filed on Oct. 25, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,180,434.",
        "The present invention relates to an audio coded data transmission technology, and more specifically to a code conversion and transmission method for transmitting audio coded data, a code conversion and reception method for receiving coded and converted audio data, a system, an audio code conversion and transmission apparatus and a code conversion and reception apparatus, and a program executed by a computer for performing audio code conversion and transmission/audio code conversion and reception processes.",
        "Recently, a method for transmitting high-efficiency compression coded data based on a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) has been widely used as a method for efficiently transmitting audio data. In this method, an audio signal is divided into frames, the MDCT is performed on the frames, the number of quantization bits are assigned to an MDCT coefficient based on a psychological audio model, the MDCT coefficient is quantized and transmitted. Thus, audio data can be transmitted using a small number of transmission bands by efficiently compressing and coding data.",
        "A typical example is the MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group)-4 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), etc.",
        "However, in the conventional audio transmitting method, when a transmitted data error having long burst or a loss of a transmitted packet which are irrecoverable even by using an error-correcting code occurs, a receiver cannot correctly decode the audio data in the frame in which an error has occurred. A countermeasure of the receiver can be an error concealment method in which an error is replaced with an audio signal in a past frame for which data has been correctly decoded. However, in this case, the degradation of the sound quality cannot be avoided. When a coding efficiency is enhanced through intra-frame prediction of an MDCT coefficient, there occurs the problem that once arising degradation is propagated to the subsequent frames.",
        "In the multicast/broadcast information distribution, a receiver cannot transmit to a transmitter the information about an error of transmitted data or a loss of a transmitted packet. When a receiver feeds back error information to a transmitter, the bands are occupied by the feedback information.",
        "The present invention has been developed to solve the above-mentioned problems, and first aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program capable of suppressing the outstanding degradation of a decoded audio signal caused by a transmission error of audio coded data and received by the receiver down to an audibly tolerable level.",
        "The present invention second aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program allowing a user to set the trade-off of the transmission band available in the transmission of audio data and audio quality.",
        "The present invention third aims at providing an audio data code conversion and transmission method, reception method, apparatus, system, and program capable of preventing an increase in the arithmetic complexity required in decoding compressed audio coded data.",

Thus, even when a burst error occurs in the transmission line 505, the probability that the first to third coded data can be affected by an influence of an error. Therefore, the outstanding degradation of sound quality due to a loss of frame coded data can be reduced. The longest burst time due to a packet loss depends on the actual measurement, etc., and the delay set by the delay addition unit is set based on the buffer size of a reception apparatus and a transfer rate (bit rate) of a transmission line.",

Thus, even if a burst error occurs in the transmission line 509, there is a small probability that the first to third coded data obtained by coding data in the same frame have an influence of the error. Therefore, the occurrence of outstanding degradation in audio quality due to a loss of frame coded data can be suppressed.

        "As a result, even when a less reliable transmission line in which high burst transmission error and packet loss frequently occur is used, the probability that N pieces of coded data are transmitted with errors can be reduced, and the outstanding degradation can be prevented from being generated in decoded audio quality after transmission.",
        "Furthermore, by enhancing the compression rate of the second to third coded data, the increase of transmission bands during the transmission of coded data can be suppressed.",
        "Additionally, depending on the available band, the first to third coded data can be transmitted to a plurality of transmission lines having different bands, and the influence of an error in the transmission line can be reduced.",
        "According to the present embodiment, the code conversion and transmission apparatus and the code conversion and reception apparatus are combined, but they can be independently used.

        "That is, according to the present invention, relating to the integer N which is two or larger, and the integer M which is 1 or larger, the code conversion and transmission apparatus comprises the first to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means on the first to M-th transmission lines, and all or a part of the frames or a packets of audio data is transmitted, or after decoding, the audio data is compressed and coded into N pieces of the coded data and transmitted at predetermined or adaptively variable time intervals. The second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means codes input frames, and the code conversion and reception apparatus selects the coded data having the lowest compression rate and enhanced audio quality from correctly received coded data from the M transmission lines in a frame or a packet unit, and then decoded.",
        "According to the present invention, the status of a transmission line or the transmission based on the intention of audio data transmitter can be reflected in the transmission.",
        "The reason is that, according to the present invention, using the first to M-th transmission lines, the compression rate of the first to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means can be selected depending on the band available in the transmission of audio data in each transmission line.",
        "Furthermore, according to the present invention, the increase of transmission rate by a plurality of coded data transmission processes can be reduced.",
        "Since, according to the present invention, second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means codes data at a compression rate equal to or higher than the rate of the first audio code conversion and transmission means. The transmission of coded data by the second to N-th audio code conversion and transmission means can be performed only on the frame coded by the first audio code conversion and transmission means.",
        "Furthermore, according to the present invention, the increase of arithmetic complexity, which is required by a receiver, can be reduced.",
        "The reason is that the code conversion and transmission apparatus generates coded data including the same frames, and the code conversion and reception apparatus selects and decodes only one piece of data in a frame or a packet unit from plural pieces of received coded data. Therefore, it is not necessary for the code conversion and reception apparatus to decode plural pieces of received coded data."
