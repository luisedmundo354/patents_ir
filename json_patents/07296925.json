        "FIG. 1 is a plan view of an agitator according to the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 2 is a side view of the agitator.",
        "Throughout all the Figures, same or corresponding elements are generally indicated by same reference numerals. These depicted embodiments are to be understood as illustrative of the invention and not as limiting in any way. It should also be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and that the embodiments are sometimes illustrated by graphic symbols, phantom lines, diagrammatic representations and fragmentary views. In certain instances, details which are not necessary for an understanding of the present invention or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted.",
        "Turning now to the drawing, and in particular to FIG. 1, there is shown a plan view of an agitator according to the present invention, generally designated by reference numeral 10 and including a hub 12 for attaching the agitator 10 to an agitator shaft (not shown). Three mountings 16 are securely fixed about the outer periphery of the hub 12 at an angular distance of 120\u00b0 for attachment of three blades 14, which extend essentially radially outwardly. Of course, the blades 14 may also be directly mounted to the agitator shaft. In operation, the agitator 10 turns clockwise in a rotation direction of arrow P around an axis 18 which is defined by the agitator shaft. The mountings 16 may extend transversely to the axis 18 or may extend inclined at an acute or obtuse angle in relation to the axis 18.",
        "It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the illustration of three blades 14 mounted to the hub 12 is by way of example only, as two or more than three blades may, of course, be provided as well.",
        "Reference character R2 designates an outer radius of each blade 14, while reference character L2 designates a total radial length of each blade 14, and reference character B2 designates a total width of each blade 14.",
        "Each blade 14 has in rotation direction a trailing end region which is provided with a blade portion 20 bent forwards in rotation direction and extending radially at a radial length L1 over part of the radial length L2 of the blade 14. The ratio of the radial length L1 of the blade portion 20 to the radial length L2 of the blade 14 is, for example, in a range of about 0.2 to 1.0, preferably in a range of about 0.4 to 0.6. The blade portion 20 has a width B1, whereby the ratio of the width B1, as viewed in circumferential direction, to the width B2 of the blade 14 is, for example, in a range of about 0.1 to 1.0, preferably in a range of about 0.15 to 0.4.",
        "The blade portion 20 is comprised of a curved member 26 having a radius of curvature R1 and terminating in a flat member 28 which, optionally, may also be curved in shape. The ratio of the radius of curvature R1 to the outer radius R2 of the blade 14 is, for example, in a range of about 0 to 0.3, preferably in a range of about 0.01 to 0.15. The blade portion 20 extends from the blade 14 in relation to the vertical rotation axis 18 upwards and then continues substantially forwards in rotation direction of the agitator 10.",
        "The blade portion 20 of each blade 14 has in rotation direction a leading end region with an end section 22 that may be triangular in shape, as shown by way of example in FIG. 2, and extends at an angle \u03b3 to the flat member 28 of the blade portion 20, away from the blade 14. The angle \u03b3 may suitably range from about 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, preferably, from about 10\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. The triangular end section 22 has a radial length L3 and a width B3 and is configured to have a tip 23, which is directed radially outwards, as shown in FIG. 2. Of course, the tip 23 may also be directed radially inwards. The ratio of the radial length L3 of the triangular end section 22 to the radial length L4 of the blade portion 20 is in the range of about 0 to 1.0, preferably about 0.5 to 1.0. The ratio of the width B3 of the end section 22 to the width B1 of the blade portion 20 is in the range of about 0.05 to 0.75, preferably about 0.2 to 0.6.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, the blade 14 extends in relation to the rotation plane D at an angle \u03b1 in the range of about 10\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, preferably, from about 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. The flat member 28 of the blade portion 20 extends in relation to the blade 14 at an angle \u03b2 in the range of about 10\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, preferably about 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. As further shown in FIG. 2, the flat member 28 extends in a parallel relationship to a surface of the hub.",
        "Each blade 14 has in rotation direction a leading end which may be configured to have an end portion 24 which is bent at an angle \u03b4 in relation to the remainder of the blade 14 to extend in a direction of the plane of the flat member 28 of the blade portion 20. The angle \u03b4 may hereby range from about 0\u00b0 to +/\u221240\u00b0, preferably, from about 0\u00b0 to +/\u221215\u00b0. The end portion 24 has a width B4, whereby the ratio of the width B4 of the end portion 24 to the total width B2 of the blade 14 ranges suitably from about 0 to 0.5, preferably about 0.1 to 0.3.",
        "The bending line between the blade 14 and the end portion 24 extends in the non-limiting example of the drawing, transversely to the outer edge of the blade 14. Of course, the bending line between the blade 14 and the end portion 24 may, however, extend also at a different angle to the outer edge of the blade 14. The end portion 24 has a front side, as viewed in rotation direction P, which may be rounded and/or beveled, whereby the bevel may suitably be configured in the radially outer zone of the blade 14.",
        "The agitator 10 according to the present invention attains a much shorter mixing time, while still maintaining superior dispersion quality and experiencing little loss in power. As a consequence of the larger area of the blades 14 in relation to the area of the blade portion 20, the radial pump effect is eccentric and has an axial component. The combination of axial and radial flow patterns results is significantly shorter mixing times in the agitator vessel. In view of the substantially box-shaped configuration of the blade portion 20, formation of gas cushions behind the blades 14 is substantially prevented so that power losses during dispersion of gases are reduced. Moreover, compared to axial flow, the implementation of a strong radial flow results in a better heat transport. Thus, the agitator 10 according to the present invention combines the advantages of radially pumping and axially pumping agitators.",
        "While the invention has been illustrated and described in connection with currently preferred embodiments shown and described in detail, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and practical application to thereby enable a person skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated."
