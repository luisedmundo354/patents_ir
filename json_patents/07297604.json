    "abstract": "In a semiconductor device having a dual isolation structure, and a method of fabricating the same, an epitaxial layer is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor device. A device region including the semiconductor device and the epitaxial layer is defined by a device isolation layer. The device isolation layer has a dual structure that includes a diffused isolation layer and a trench isolation layer. The diffused isolation layer is formed in the semiconductor substrate, and surrounds the base and the bottom sidewall of the device region, and the trench isolation layer surrounds the upper sidewall of the device region by vertically penetrating the epitaxial layer. The method of fabricating a semiconductor device is performed by forming a diffused bottom isolation layer at a predetermined region in the semiconductor substrate, and forming a trench exposed at a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate by patterning the epitaxial layer formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate. A diffused isolation wall is formed to be connected to the diffused bottom isolation layer under the trench. A trench isolation structure is formed to be connected to the diffused isolation wall by filling an insulating layer inside the trench.",

        "This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/379,243, filed on Mar. 4, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,927,452, which relies for priority upon Korean Patent Application No. 02-11623, filed on Mar. 5, 2002, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device having a dual isolation structure and a method of fabricating the same.",
        "2. Discussion of the Related Art",
        "In the semiconductor arts, there continues to be an ever-increasing demand for a high level of power transmission, for high speed switching ability during power conversion, and for various applications of power IC products in power control systems. Power IC products are widely used in automotive electronic componentry as well as in hard disk drive (HDD) and in video tape recording (VTR) systems. Double-diffused MOS transistors (DMOS Tr) offer the combination of high-current processing ability and low on-resistance per surface area; therefore DMOS transistors are an important element of the power IC in the processing of high voltages.",
        "Since the DMOS device is operated at high voltage, a device isolation layer having a high breakdown voltage is required between adjacent DMOS devices or between the DMOS device and other control circuits. Conventionally, junction isolation technology using an impurity-diffused layer for device isolation was employed for this purpose. However, in the case of junction isolation technology, the junction isolation structure requires a wide surface area in order to form deep device isolation structures, as the structure of the DMOS device requires thick epitaxial layers. In order to overcome this limitation, there has been introduced a method of forming a trench device isolation structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,822, entitled \u201cMethod for making all complementary BICDMOS devices\u201d introduces a method of isolating devices by forming a DMOS device on a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate.",
        "FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a conventional DMOS device having a device isolation structure employing the junction isolation technology.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, a DMOS device of the junction isolation structure includes a semiconductor substrate 1, a first conductivity type buried layer 6 placed on a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate 1, and a second conductivity type buried layer 2 slightly spaced apart from the first conductivity type buried layer 6 and surrounding the buried layer 6. A first conductivity type epitaxial layer 8 is deposited on the entire surface of the first conductivity type layer 6, the second conductivity type layer 2, and the semiconductor substrate 1. The epitaxial layer 8 is more lightly doped than the first conductivity type buried layer 6. A second conductivity type junction isolation layer 4 is connected to the second conductivity type buried layer 2 while surrounding a predetermined region of the epitaxial layer 8. The junction isolation layer 4 and the second conductivity type buried layer 2 form a device isolation structure 5 of the DMOS device. The device isolation structure 5 defines the device region of the DMOS device. A field oxide layer 16 is placed in a predetermined region of the device region surrounded by the device isolation structure 5 to define a first active area and a second active area. The field oxide layer 16 surrounds the first active area spaced apart from the device isolation structure 5. A gate electrode 14 is placed on the first active area with a gate insulating layer 22 interposed there between. A source region is formed in the first active area adjacent to the gate electrode 14, and a drain region is formed in the second active area. The source region 26 includes a first conductivity type diffused layer 18 formed on the surface of the first active area adjacent to the gate electrode 14, a second conductivity type diffused layer 20 spaced apart from the gate electrode 14 adjacent to the first conductivity type diffused layer 18, and a second conductivity type body region 26 surrounding the first conductivity type diffused layer 18 and the second conductivity type diffused layer 20. The drain region includes a sink region 10 vertically penetrating the epitaxial layer 8 and connected to the first conductivity type buried layer 6, and a heavy doped region 12 formed on the surface of the second active area on the sink region 10. A field oxide layer 15 is further formed on the junction isolation layer 4 for device isolation.",
        "Normally, the breakdown voltage of the DMOS device is proportional to the thickness of the epitaxial layer 8. That is, the epitaxial layer 8 is typically formed to have a thickness of over 10 \u03bcm, in order to provide a high breakdown voltage in the DMOS device. Therefore, when forming the second conductivity type junction isolation layer 4 through the thick epitaxial layer 8, and considering the diffusion of the impurity to form the second conductivity type junction isolation layer 4, the junction isolation layer and the drain region should be positioned a suitable distance apart. As a result, the area size occupied by the device isolation structure in the DMOS device employing the junction isolation technology is over 25% of the entire device region.",
        "FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a DMOS device having a trench device isolation structure that was introduced in order to overcome the above-mentioned limitations in the traditional junction isolation structures.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, as in the junction isolation structures described above, a DMOS device having a trench device isolation structure includes a first conductivity type buried layer 36 formed on a semiconductor substrate 31, an epitaxial layer 38 covering the buried layer 36 and the semiconductor substrate 31, a gate electrode 34 formed on the epitaxial layer 38, a source region and a drain region. The source region and the drain region have the same structure as the corresponding parts of the DMOS device having the junction isolation structure. That is, the source region includes a first conductivity type diffused layer 48, a second conductivity type diffused layer 30, and a second body region 44. The drain region includes a sink region 40 connected to the buried layer 36, and a heavy doped region 42 formed on the upper side of the sink region 40. A device isolation structure 32 is placed to penetrate a portion of the epitaxial layer 38 and the semiconductor substrate 31. The device isolation structure 32 defines the device region. A field oxide layer 46 is placed on a predetermined region of the device region surrounded by the device isolation structure 32 to thereby define the first active area and the second active area. The gate electrode 34 and the source region are placed on the first active area surrounded by the field oxide layer 46. The drain region is placed in the second active area between the field oxide layer 46 and the device isolation structure 32.",
        "As described above, the device isolation structure 32 is more deeply formed than the first conductivity type buried layer, in order to isolate between neighboring DMOS devices and between the DMOS devices and other control circuits. That is, the device isolation structure 32 has a thickness over about 20 \u03bcm in the DMOS device having a working voltage of about 70 V. However, there is a limit in forming the deep trench device isolation structure in such a small area because of difficulties in the etching and burying processes.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating semiconductor devices that substantially obviate one or more of the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.",
        "A feature of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same having a much-improved isolation structure that provides for enhanced device isolation ability.",
        "Another feature of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same having a device isolation structure in which the area required for device isolation is relatively small as compared to the area occupied by the device region.",
        "In accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and described herein, a semiconductor device having a dual isolation structure is provided in accordance with the present invention. The device includes a semiconductor substrate and a first conductivity type epitaxial layer on the surface of the semiconductor substrate.",

A first conductivity type impurity is implanted into the second active area a2 so as to form a sink region 70 connected to the buried layer 54. The sink region 70 may be formed after or before forming the field oxide layer 66. In case of forming the sink region 70 before forming the field oxide layer 66, a thermal oxidation process to form the field oxide layer 66 may be performed, and during the process, the resistance of the sink region 70 can be reduced. However, in case of forming the sink region 70 after forming the field oxide layer 66, the thermal process is preferably performed on the substrate having the sink region after forming the sink region 70 to reduce the resistance of the sink region 70.",

In this manner, the present invention addresses the limitations associated with the conventional semiconductor device having a junction device isolation structure, which requires a relatively large amount of area for the device isolation region due to the external diffusion. The present invention further provides a semiconductor device having a deep device isolation structure by solving the difficulties in the conventional device isolation structure in forming a trench isolation structure at a depth of over 15 \u03bcm. As a result, the device isolation ability of the semiconductor device operated at high frequency and high voltage can be greatly improved, while reducing the area occupied by the isolation structure.",
