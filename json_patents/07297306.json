        "This application is a National filing of PCT/US03/12955, filed Apr. 24, 2003, which claims benefit of provisional application 60/375,639, filed Apr. 26, 2002.",
        "In light cured applications utilizing Type II photoinitiators (hydrogen abstraction), low molecular weight amines are typically incorporated as a coinitiator. These small molecule amines are not always fully reacted and can remain in the final cured matrix, which pose complications such as residual extractables and leachables.",
        "Using light to cure coatings comes with motivations such as environmental compliance, fast cure, improved physical properties and lower applied cost. These motivators translate into benefits of reduced solvent emissions, increased product speed/productivity, product performance, efficiency and cost effectiveness. The use of UV-EB has enjoyed a growth rate of approximately 10% per annum over the last decade and equates to an annual industrial usage of about 100,000,000 lbs. Nevertheless, some obstacles include cost of products, equipment cost, poor weatherability, adhesion and curing of thick samples and residual uncured materials. While many of these issues are successfully being addressed, unsolved problems and deterrents still exist.",
        "A UV curable formulation can contain several fundamental components, of which can be monomers, functionalized oligomers, and photoinitiators (free-radical or cationic). Among additional components which can also be included are, for example, pigments, dyes, light stabilizers, radical scavengers and adhesion promoters.",
        "Free-radical photoinitiators are typed into two classes: Type I, those that undergo photocleavage to yield free-radicals and Type II, those that produce initiating radicals through an abstraction process. Type I photoinitiators produce radicals through a unimolecular fragmentation. Examples of these include aromatic carbonyl compounds, such as derivatives of benzoin, benzilketal and acetophenone. One example is 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA), the reaction pathways of which are as follows:",
        "",
        "Upon irradiation DMPA cleavage occurs by generating the benzyl radical and a dimethoxy substituted carbon centered radical. The dimethoxy radical rearranges to form a methyl radical and methylbenzoate. The benzyl radical can initiate polymerization or abstract hydrogens forming benzaldehyde. Unreacted residual DMPA and other small molecules remain in the final polymer matrix and can be readily extracted and leached. This makes these coatings unfit for applications that involve contact with food, notably an emerging application. Residual DMPA can also further react leading to premature degradation of the polymer. These materials then cannot be used for outdoor applications where exposure to intense UV would be expected.",
        "Thus while Type I photoinitiators typically provide high rates of initiation, yielding rapid controllable rates of polymerization and fast curing line speeds, Type I systems are often expensive and can produce toxic by-products.",
        "Type II (abstraction type) photoinitiators are typically aromatic ketones, such as thioxanthone and benzophenone derivatives. In these systems, a coinitiator must be present in order to produce an initiating radical. These coinitiators can include amines, alcohols or ethers. The process of producing radicals is either through a hydrogen abstraction or an electron transfer mechanism depending on the coinitiator. The primary initiating radical is usually a radical centered on the coinitiator. In the presence of abstractable hydrogens (such as amine, ether, thiol or alcohol) the reaction produces two radicals. The reaction pathway may be depicted as follows:",
        "",
        "When the hydrogen donor source is an amine, the excited state benzophenone participates in an electron transfer process forming the radical-anion/radical-cation pair. This is subsequently followed by a rapid proton-transfer from a carbon alpha to the nitrogen on the amine (aminyl radical) to the benzophenone radical-anion producing the semipinacol ketyl type radical and a carbon centered radical on the amine. The semipinacol ketyl type radical is not efficient at initiating polymerization, whereas the aminyl radical readily initiates polymerization. The products from the semipinacol ketyl type radical are still photoactive and can lead to photosensitivity of the final film.",
        "In light cured applications utilizing Type II photoinitiators (hydrogen abstraction), tertiary amines are typically incorporated as a coinitiator, due to their reactivity with type II photoinitiators. Amine synergists can be placed in three categories: amine acrylates, amine acrylate adducts, and free-amines (ethanolamines).",
        "Amine acrylates are made by the reaction of an amine and a multifunctional acrylate in such a ratio as to produce an oligomeric compound. Amine acrylates do not blush or discolor sensitive pigments, but are costly, can cause skin burns, have high viscosity, and must be used in the range of 12-20 wt % to be effective.",
        "Amine acrylate adducts are formed from reacting secondary amines with an acrylate monomer. The amount of amine functionality is controlled by the ratio of amine to acrylate. The amine acrylate adducts give good cure, do not blush and contribute to overcoming the effects of oxygen inhibition, but discolor sensitive pigments, can cause skin burns, and must be used in the range of 8-12 wt % to be effective.",
        "Free-amines (ethanolamines), which are low in cost, effective in the range of 4-6 wt %, and give good through cure as well as contribute to overcoming the effects of oxygen inhibition. However, these blush in high humidity, discolor sensitive pigments such as rhodamine red and reflex blue in over print varnishes, are extractable, and contribute to odors due to high vapor pressures. Examples of low molecular weight amines typically used as a coinitiators are N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, and N-methyldibutylamine. These small molecule amines are not always fully reacted and can remain in the final cured matrix, which pose complications such as residual extractables and leachables.",
        "Accordingly, when forming films using Type II photoinitiators, especially thin films of about 2 mils or less, a need exists for a way of eliminating or minimizing (i) extractables in the films, (ii) discoloration of the films, and (iii) premature degradation of the films, while at the same time achieving rapid cures. It would be especially advantageous if not only films but other articles as well could be fabricated by photopolymerization using Type I or Type II initiators, or both, without increasing extractables, blushing, discoloration or degradation of the resultant article or product.",
        "Pursuant to this invention, a new class of amines is incorporated into photopolymerizable systems employing Type I or Type II photoinitiators, or a combination of both such types. In the case of systems based on Type II photoinitiators the amines used pursuant to this invention offset the deleterious effects of conventional small molecule amines without compromising cure speed performance. Indeed, in films of about 2 mils or less, super-fast cures can be accomplished eliminating or minimizing (i) extractables in the films, (ii) discoloration of the films, and (iii) premature degradation of the films. The amines used pursuant to this invention also have low extractables, low viscosity, and low use concentrations. In systems based on use of Type I photoinitiators, extractables are not increased and moreover, blushing, discoloration and premature degradation of the polymer can be minimized by use of the amine coinitiators of this invention.",
        "The amines used in the practice of this invention are one or more trialkylamines each having a total of 10 to about 36 carbon atoms in the molecule and wherein at least one alkyl group has a chain length of at least 8 carbon atoms. Preferred amines are (A) one or more trialkyl amines each having a total of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms in the molecule, and wherein two of the alkyl groups are methyl or ethyl, or one of each, (more preferably both are methyl), and the remaining alkyl group contains at least 8 carbon atoms (and more preferably is a primary alkyl group containing in the range of 8 to about 22 carbon atoms), or (B) one or more trialkyl amines each having a total of 17 to about 38 carbon atoms in the molecule, and wherein one of the alkyl groups is methyl or ethyl(preferably methyl), and the other two alkyl groups are the same or different, and each is a primary alkyl group). Particularly preferred amines from the cost-effectiveness standpoint are octyldimethylamine, decyldimethylamine, dodecyldimethylamine, tetradecyldimethylamine, hexadecyldimethylamine, octadecyldimethylamine, didecylmethylamine, and dodecylmethylamine.",
        "Another aspect of this invention is the discovery that certain short chain amines when used in combination with the above long chain trialkylamines behave synergistically, or at least provide improved results as compared to the long chain trialkylamine in the absence of the short chain amine. For example, the combination of a short chain amine in the form of, e.g., N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N,N\u2032,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine (Polycat 77; Air Products, Inc.), or 2,2\u2032-oxybis[N,N-dimethylethanamine](DABCO BL-19; Air Products, Inc.), or preferably N,N-dimethyl-4-morpholineethanamine (DABCO XDM; Air Products, Inc.), when used in combination with the above long chain trialkylamines and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropane-1-one, provide synergistic results. N,N-dimethyl-4-morpholineethanamine, when used in combination with dodecyldimethylamine and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropane-1-one, has been shown to be effective at a lower percentage as compared to methyldiethanolamine.",
        "The \u201cshort chain amines\u201d are tertiary amino compounds containing at least two electronegative atoms in the molecule, at least one of which is a tertiary nitrogen atom and another of which is an oxygen atom or a tertiary nitrogen atom, and wherein the electronegative atoms are bonded only to short chain alkyl or alkylene groups (e.g., C1-3 alkyl or alkylene groups), and wherein the compound has a total of at least 4 and preferably at least 6 abstractable hydrogen atoms in positions alpha to at least some of the electronegative atoms in the compound. To illustrate, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N,N\u2032,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine has three electronegative atoms and a total of 9 abstractable hydrogen atoms in the molecule. 2,2\u2032-Oxybis[N,N-dimethylethanamine] has three electronegative atoms and a total of 8 abstractable hydrogen atoms in the molecule. N,N-dimethyl-2-morpholinoethanamine has two electronegative atoms and a total of 8 abstractable hydrogen atoms in the molecule. N-Hydroxyethylmorpholine has two electronegative atoms and a total of 6 abstractable hydrogen atoms in the molecule. A short chain amine having the requisite number of abstractable hydrogen atoms will cause polymerization to occur when used with benzophenone in a mixture with epoxyacrylate diluted with tripropylene glycol diacrylate in a 35:65 wt ratio on exposure of the mixture UW light at 254 nonometers. The forgoing illustrative short chain amines make clear that the short chain alkylene groups can be part of a non-cyclic compound or of a cyclic compound. Thus for example in N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N,N\u2032, N\u2032-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, the alkylene group (the propane moiety) is in a non-cyclic compound. In contrast, in N-hydroxyethylmorpholine there are two alkylene (ethylene) groups in the morpholine moiety, which groups form a cyclic morpholine ring with an oxygen atom and a nitrogen atom, as well as an open chain alkylene group (the ethyl moiety in the N-hydroxyethyl group).",
        "Among the various types of suitable short chain tertiary amino compounds are compounds represented by the formula:\n\nR\u2014(CH2)n\u2014NR1R2 \n\nwhere\n\n    A) R is (i) a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; (ii) an N-alkylpiperazinyl group in which the alkyl is a C1-3 primary alkyl group, or (iii) a morpholino group;\n    \n        R1 is a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group;\n        R2 is (i) a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; (ii) an alkyleneamino group in which alkylene is a C1-3 alkylene group and the amino is a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; (iii) an alkyleneaminoalkyleneamino group (\u2014R\u2014N(R)\u2014R\u2014NR2) in which each alkylene is, independently, a C1-3 alkylene group, the amino between the alkylenes is a C1-3 primary alkylamino group, and the other amino is a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; (iv) an alkyleneoxyalkyleneamino group (\u2014R\u2014O\u2014R\u2014NR2) in which each alkylene is, independently, a C1-3 alkylene group, and the amino is a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; or (v) an alkyleneoxyalkyleneoxyalkyleneamino group (\u2014R\u2014O\u2014R\u2014O\u2014R\u2014NR2) in which each alkylene is, independently, a C1-3 alkylene group, and the amino is a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group;\n\nor where\n\n    \n    \n    B) R is (i) a dialkylamino group in which each alkyl is, independently, a C1-3 primary alkyl group; (ii) an N-alkylpiperazinyl group in which the alkyl is a C1-3 primary alkyl group, or (iii) a morpholino group; and R1 and R2 taken together is (i) an N-alkylpiperazinyl group in which the alkyl is a C1-3 primary alkyl group, or (ii) a morpholino group.",
        "In addition to the above, many other types of short chain amines can be used pursuant to this invention. In general, the compound will typically consist of one or more tertiary amino groups, one or more ether oxygen atoms, and/or one or two hydroxyl groups linked to each other by C1-3 aklylene groups, such that there are at least two tertiary amino groups or at least one tertiary amino group and at least one ether oxygen atom or at least one hydroxyl group linked together in this fashion, and such that the compound has a total of at least 4 and preferably at least 6 abstractable hydrogen atoms in positions alpha to at least some of the electronegative atoms in the compound. The tertiary amino group(s) when not part of a cycloaliphatic ring system are di(C1-3 alkyl)amino or mono(C1-3 alkyl)amino group(s) depending on whether the tertiary amino group is a terminal group or an internal group.",
        "A few non-limiting examples of suitable short chain amines include N,N,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine, N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N,N\u2032,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N,N\u2032,N\u2032-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, 2,2\u2032-oxybis[N,N-dimethylethanamine], 3,3\u2032-oxybis[N,N-dimethylpropanamine], 4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]morpholine (a.k.a.

        "In the photopolymerization of monomer or oligomer, films having a thickness of about 2 mils or less, such as in the manufacture of thinly-coated papers or thin high grade card or paperboard stock for use in magazine covers, brochures, corporate annual reports, folders, and the like in coating systems operating at high linear speeds, exposure times must be extremely short. Such thin photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer coating films are typically applied to paper webs travelling at speeds of about 10 feet per second and thus the photopolymerization exposure time of such coated webs travelling at such speeds can be in the range of as little as about 0.005 to 0.02 second. Thus the amine coinitiators used pursuant to this invention must function extremely rapidly while at the same time becoming fixed within the polymerized coating without discoloration and without undergoing or causing other types of degradation within the thin film.",
        "An advantageous feature of such concurrent production and in situ application or bonding of such thin photopolymerized coatings on a travelling paper or thin paperboard or card stock is that no other operations such as washing or drying are required. Indeed, it is preferable to conduct the concurrent production and in situ application or bonding of not only such thin photopolymerized coatings on a travelling paper or thin paperboard or card stock, but also the production of other articles, coatings, or laminates without use of washing or drying steps. In short the finished articles of this invention are produced with a minimum of steps. All that is required is to place the photopolymerizable composition in the proper place and configuration to be photopolymerized and expose the resultant article to sufficient radiation to effect the in situ photopolymerization. Printed matter, decorations, or the like may thereafter be applied to the photopolymerized article, coating, or laminate using conventional techniques, if desired.",

As shown in Table 1, the resultant polymerization exotherm data on the three long chain alkyldimethylamines with benzophenone initiator are comparable to the exotherm obtained when using MDEA with benzophenone. Table 2 compares the data on initiation of HDDA polymerization when using didecylmethyl amine (DAMA\u00ae 1010 amine) in place of MDEA on an equal molar basis. In these runs the DAMA 1010 amine concentration was set to be equal to 1.0% by weight of MDEA (8.4\u00d710\u22122 M), and the light intensity was 1.43 mW cm\u22122 in N2 at 365 nm.

As in the case of FIRSTCURE AS-1 amine synergist, because a relatively small percentage of FIRSTCURE AS-3 amine synergist is required, the remaining percentage can be substituted with a higher loading of oligomers to give better properties, and the monomer can be substituted with a lower cost one to reduce the cost of the final formulation.",
