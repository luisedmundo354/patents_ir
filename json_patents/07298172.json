        "The present invention relates to a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, an interface circuit, and an electronic instrument.",
        "In recent years, a high-speed serial transfer interface such as low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) has attracted attention as an interface standard aiming at reducing EMI noise or the like. In the high-speed serial transfer interface, data transfer is implemented by allowing a transmitter circuit to transmit serialized data using differential signals and a receiver circuit to differentially amplify the differential signals. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-314397 has disclosed a conventional technology relating to the high-speed serial transfer interface, for example.",
        "However, since the high-speed serial transfer interface allows current to constantly flow through the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit, a reduction of power consumption is limited.

Therefore, the power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit 44 in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the CLK+/\u2212 differential signal lines. The power-down command for setting the strobe transfer (clock transfer in a broad sense) receiver circuit 28 in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the STB+/\u2212 differential signal lines.",
        "However, as shown in FIG. 8A, the frequency (band) of the signals transmitted through the CLK+/\u2212 and STB+/\u2212 differential signal lines is higher than the frequency of the signals transmitted through the DTO+/\u2212 and DTI+/\u2212 differential signal lines. Therefore, if the power-down detection circuit, the power-down setting circuit, and the voltage driver described in this embodiment are provided on the side of the CLK+/\u2212 and STB+/\u2212 differential signal lines, transfer performance such as the transfer rate and transfer reliability may be adversely affected. In particular, if the voltage driver is provided on the side of the CLK+/\u2212 and STB+/\u2212 differential signal lines, the parasitic capacitance of the drain terminal or the gate terminal of the transistor may be added to the differential signal lines, whereby the transfer performance may be adversely affected.",
        "Therefore, in FIG. 8B, the power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit 44 in the power-down mode (hereinafter called \u201cclock transfer power-down command\u201d) and the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode (hereinafter called \u201cclock transfer wakeup voltage\u201d) are transmitted through the OUT transfer DTO+/\u2212 differential signal lines.",
        "Specifically, when setting the clock transfer receiver circuit 44 in the power-down mode, the OUT transfer transmitter circuit 22 transmits the clock transfer power-down command to the OUT transfer receiver circuit 42 through the DTO+/\u2212 differential signal lines. The power-down setting circuit included in the OUT transfer receiver circuit 42 outputs the power-down signal to the clock transfer receiver circuit 44 when the clock transfer power-down command is detected as the power-down command transmitted through the DTO+/\u2212 differential signal lines. This causes the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator included in the clock transfer receiver circuit 44 to be set to the power-down mode.",
        "When canceling the power-down mode of the clock transfer receiver circuit 44, the OUT transfer transmitter circuit 22 (voltage driver) outputs the wakeup voltage to the DTO+/\u2212 differential signal lines. When the wakeup detection circuit included in the OUT transfer receiver circuit 42 detects the wakeup voltage from the OUT transfer transmitter circuit 22, the wakeup detection circuit outputs a signal for canceling the power-down mode of the OUT transfer receiver circuit 42 and the clock transfer receiver circuit 44.",
        "The above-described configuration makes it unnecessary to transmit the power-down command or the wakeup voltage through the CLK+/\u2212 differential signal lines. Therefore, the transfer performance of the clock transfer performed through the CLK+/\u2212 differential signal lines can be prevented from being adversely affected.",
        "The power-down command for setting the strobe transfer receiver circuit 26 in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the IN transfer DTI+/\u2212 differential signal lines. The power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit in the power-down mode and the power-down command for setting the data transfer receiver circuit in the power-down mode may be commands in different codes or commands in the same code.",
        "7. Details of Power-down Control",
        "The details of the power-down control are described below. In this embodiment, various states are defined as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. In FIGS. 9 and 10, a device disabled state is a state in which the entire electronic instrument (host device and target device) is set to the power-down mode. A target disabled state (period T1) is a state in which the supply of the clock signal from the host device to the target device is terminated and all the functions of the target device are stopped. The supply of the clock signal is terminated after the device has entered the target disabled state.",
        "An OUT idle state (period T2) is the idle state of the OUT transfer (transfer from the host device to the target device) (state between packet transfers). In the OUT idle state, since the host-side transmitter circuit and the target-side receiver circuit are not set to the power-down mode, the normal transfer can be immediately performed. Since current constantly flows through these circuits, electric power is consumed. An OUT transfer state (period T3) is a state in which the OUT transfer is performed.",
        "An OUT disabled state (period T4) is a state in which the OUT transfer is terminated. In this state, the current which has been constantly flowing through the host-side transmitter circuit and the target-side receiver circuit is terminated by the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented. The power-down mode can be canceled by allowing the host-side transmitter circuit to output the wakeup voltage to the target-side receiver circuit, whereby the transfer which has been terminated can be resumed.",
        "An IN idle state (period T5) is an idle state of the IN transfer (transfer from the target device to the host device). In the IN idle state, since the target-side transmitter circuit and the host-side receiver circuit are not set to the power-down mode, the normal transfer can be immediately performed. Since current constantly flows through these circuits, electric power is consumed. An IN transfer state (period T6) is a state in which the IN transfer is performed.",
        "An IN disabled state (period T7) is a state in which the IN transfer is terminated. In this state, the current which has been constantly flowing through the target-side transmitter circuit and the host-side receiver circuit is terminated by the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented. The power-down mode can be canceled by allowing the target-side transmitter circuit to output the wakeup voltage to the host-side receiver circuit, whereby the transfer which has been terminated can be resumed.",
        "In FIG. 9, a \u201chost function\u201d indicates the system function of the host, a \u201ctarget CLKIN\u201d indicates the presence or absence of the clock input to the target device, and a \u201ctarget function\u201d indicates the system function of the target. A \u201cDTO transmission\u201d indicates the DTO+/\u2212 transmission function of the host, and a \u201cDTI reception\u201d indicates the DTI+/\u2212 reception function of the host. A \u201cDTI transmission\u201d indicates the DTI+/\u2212 transmission function of the target, and a \u201cDTO reception\u201d indicates the DTO+/\u2212 reception function of the target. A \u201cCLK transmission\u201d indicates the CLK+/\u2212 transmission function, and a \u201cCLK reception\u201d indicates the CLK+/\u2212 reception function. In FIG. 9, a symbol \u201c\u25ef\u201d indicates that these functions are in the enabled state (operating state), and a symbol \u201c\u00d7\u201d indicates that these functions are in the disabled state (power-down state). A symbol \u201c\u2212\u201d indicates \u201cdon't care\u201d. In FIG. 10, \u201cS\u201d indicates the start code of packet transfer, and \u201cE\u201d indicates the end code of packet transfer. The start code and the end code are generated by using 8B/10B encoding, for example.",
        "The OUT transfer is in the idle state at C1 shown in FIG. 10, and a packet is transferred by the OUT transfer at C2. In the OUT disabled state at C3, the host-side transmitter circuit and the target-side receiver circuit are set to the power-down mode. In the target disabled state at C4, the supply of the clock signals CLK+/\u2212 is terminated as indicated by C5, whereby all the functions of the target device are terminated.",
        "The IN transfer is in the idle state at C6 shown in FIG. 10, and a packet is transferred by the IN transfer at C7. In the IN disabled state at C8, the target-side transmitter circuit and the host-side receiver circuit are set to the power-down mode. The target disabled state occurs at C9. As indicated by C10 and C11, the target supplies the strobes STB+/\u2212 to the host only when performing the normal IN transfer.",
        "According to this embodiment, each transmitter circuit can individually set the corresponding receiver circuit in the power-down mode or cancel the power-down mode. Therefore, the setting and cancellation of the power-down mode optimum for each state shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 can be implemented, whereby a more intelligent power-down control can be implemented.",
        "8. Second Configuration Example",
        "A detailed second configuration example of the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit in this embodiment is described below using FIG. 11. In FIG. 11, the configuration and operation of the circuit block denoted by the same symbol as in FIG. 3 are almost the same as those in the first configuration example shown in FIG. 3. Therefore, description thereof is omitted.",
        "In FIG. 11, the power-down detection circuit 110 includes the command decoder 112 and a power-down signal generation circuit 115. The command decoder 112 detects the power-down command by the decode processing. The power-down signal generation circuit 115 outputs a target side power-down signal TPDW at the H level (active) when the power-down command is detected.",
        "When the power-down command is detected by the power-down detection circuit 110 and the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage to the differential signal lines (DTO+ or DTO\u2212), the power-down setting circuit 120 sets the current/voltage conversion circuit 90 and the comparator 100 in the power-down mode. In more detail, the power-down setting circuit 120 includes an AND circuit AND1. When the target-side power-down signal TPDW from the power-down signal generation circuit 115 and a host-side power-down signal HPDW, of which the voltage level changes corresponding to the state of the differential signal lines, are set at the H level (active), the power-down setting circuit 120 outputs the power-down signal PD at the H level (active). When the power-down signal PD is set at the H level, the comparator 100 is set to the disabled state and the transistors TR3A and TR3B are turned OFF, whereby the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode.",
        "The wakeup detection circuit 130 detects cancellation of the power-down mode and outputs the wakeup signal TWUP. In more detail, when the wakeup detection circuit 130 detects cancellation of the power-down mode after the receiver circuit has been set to the power-down mode by the power-down voltage output to the differential signal lines from the transmitter circuit, the wakeup detection circuit 130 outputs the wakeup signal TWUP at the H level (active). When the wakeup signal TWUP is set at the H level, the logic circuit in the subsequent stage (circuit in a layer higher than the physical layer) is awakened.",
        "The operation in the second configuration example shown in FIG. 11 is described below using waveform charts shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. When the transmitter circuit transmits the power-down command to the receiver circuit as indicated by D1 shown in FIG. 12, the power-down detection circuit 110 detects the power-down command. When the power-down command is detected, the power-down signal generation circuit 115 outputs the signal TPDW at the H level as indicated by D2.",
        "The transistor TR2A of the transmitter circuit is turned ON when the signal PDIN is set at the H level, whereby the voltage driver 70 is electrically connected to the differential signal lines. When the voltage driver 70 outputs the power-down voltage at the H level of the CMOS voltage level to the differential signal lines as indicated by D3 shown in FIG. 12, the signal HPDW is set at the H level (active) as indicated by D4. Since both the signals HPDW and TPDW are set at the H level, the power-down signal PD output from the power-down setting circuit 120 is set at the H level as indicated by D5. When the signal PD is set at the H level (active), the comparator 100 is set to the disabled state and the transistors TR3A and TR3B are turned OFF, whereby the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode.",
        "As described with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B, when the signal PD is set at the H level and the data transfer receiver circuits (42, 26) are set to the power-down mode, it is preferable to set the clock transfer receiver circuits (44, 28) in the power-down mode. When the power-down mode of the data transfer receiver circuits is canceled, it is preferable to cancel the power-down mode of the clock transfer receiver circuits. In this case, the data transfer receiver circuit outputs the signal PD to the clock transfer receiver circuit, and the power-down mode of the clock transfer receiver circuit is set or cancelled based on the signal PD.",
        "When the signal HPDW is set at the H level, the output nodes NA and NB of the RS flip circuits (NAND1, NAND2) included in the wakeup detection circuit 130 are respectively set at the L level and the H level, as indicated by D6 and D7 shown in FIG. 12. In this case, since the node ND of the signal HPDW is at the H level, the wakeup signal TWUP output from the wakeup detection circuit 130 remains at the L level (inactive) as indicated by D8.",
        "The signal PDIN is then set at the L level, whereby the transistor TR2A is turned OFF as indicated by E1 shown in FIG. 13. This causes the supply of the power-down voltage to the differential signal lines to be terminated and the power-down mode to be canceled, whereby the differential signal lines are set to the idle state as indicated by E2. In the idle state, since the transistors TR1A and TR1B of the transmitter circuit are turned OFF, the voltage levels of the differential signal lines are set at a low voltage level of about 1 V, for example. Therefore, the signal HPDW is set at the L level as indicated by E3, and the power-down signal PD is set at the L level (inactive) as indicated by E4. This causes the comparator 100 to be set to the enabled state and the transistors TR3A and TR3B to be turned ON, whereby the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled. As described with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B, the power-down mode of the clock transfer receiver circuits (44, 28) is also canceled.",
        "The signal HPDW may be set at the L level by causing the transistors TR1A and TR1B to be turned ON after the transistor TR2A has been turned OFF. The signal HPDW may be set at the L level by causing the transistor TR2A to be turned ON for a predetermined period and allowing the voltage output circuit 72 to output a voltage at the L level in the predetermined period.",
        "When the node ND of the signal HPDW is set at the L level, since the node NB and the node NC of the wakeup detection circuit 130 are respectively set at the H level and the L level, the wakeup signal TWUP is set at the H level as indicated by E5 shown in FIG. 13. The logic circuit in the subsequent stage (circuit in a layer higher than the physical layer) is awakened by being triggered by the wakeup signal TWUP set at the H level. When the signal TWUP is set at the H level, the power-down signal generation circuit 115 sets the signal TPDW at the L level after a predetermined period has elapsed as indicated by E6. This causes the voltages of the nodes NA and NB to be respectively set at the H level and the L level as indicated by E7 and E8, and the wakeup signal TWUP returns to the L level.",
        "The difference between the first configuration example described with reference to FIGS. 3, 5, and 6 and the second configuration example described with reference to FIGS. 11 to 13 is described below.",
        "In the first configuration example, the pulse signal PDPLS is set at the L level after the period TD1 has elapsed after detection of the power-down command as indicated by A5 shown in FIG. 5. This causes the signal PD to be set at the H level as indicated by A6, whereby the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode.",
        "In the second configuration example, when the power-down command is detected and the signal TPDW is set at the H level as indicated by D1 and D2 shown in FIG. 12, and the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage at the H level to the differential signal lines as indicated by D3 and D4, the signal PD is set at the H level as indicated by D5, whereby the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode.",
        "In the first configuration example, when the transmitter circuit outputs the wakeup voltage at the L level as indicated by B2 shown in FIG. 6, the signal PD is set at the L level as indicated by B5, whereby the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled.",
        "In the second configuration example, when the supply of the power-down voltage to the differential signal lines by the transmitter circuit is terminated as indicated by E2 shown in FIG. 13, the signal PD is set at the L level as indicated by E4, whereby the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled. The wakeup signal TWUP is then set at the H level as indicated by E5, whereby the higher layer logic circuit in the subsequent stage is awakened.",
        "Specifically, in the first configuration example, the power-down mode is set merely on condition that the power-down command is detected. Therefore, the delay circuit for setting up the periods TD1 and TD2 shown in FIG. 5 is necessary. This is because the holding circuit 122 shown in FIG. 3 is reset if the timing at which the differential signal lines are set at the H level indicated by A4 shown in FIG. 5 is later than the timing at which the pulse signal PDPLS is set at the L level indicated by A5, whereby the power-down mode is canceled. Since the transmitter circuit cannot know the signal delay state of the receiver circuit, the timing adjustment becomes complicated if such a delay circuit is provided, whereby the sequence design becomes difficult.",
        "In the second configuration example, the power-down mode is not set even if the power-down command is merely detected as indicated by D2 shown in FIG. 12, and the power-down mode is set on condition that the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage after the power-down command has been detected as indicated by D3 and D4. Specifically, preparations for transition to the power-down mode are made on condition that the power-down command is detected, and the transition to the power-down mode occurs on condition that the output of the power-down voltage is detected. This makes it unnecessary to provide a delay circuit, which is necessary in the first configuration example, whereby the timing adjustment can be simplified and the sequence design can be facilitated.",
        "In the second configuration example, the wakeup signal TWUP must remain at the L level at the timing indicated by D8 shown in FIG. 12, and the wakeup signal TWUP must be set at the H level at the timing indicated by E8 shown in FIG. 13. However, the signal HPDW is set at the L level and the signal TPDW is set at the H level in the period TA1 shown in FIG. 12 and the period TA2 shown in FIG. 13. Specifically, the signal state is the same in the period TA1 and the period TA2. Since the clock signal is terminated in the period between the timing indicated by D8 shown in FIG. 12 and the timing indicated by E5 shown in FIG. 13, the period TA1 and the period TA2 must be distinguished only by the signal state.",
        "Therefore, in the second configuration example, the wakeup detection circuit 130 having the configuration shown in FIG. 11 is provided. Specifically, in the second configuration example, the period TA1 shown in FIG. 12 and the period TA2 shown in FIG. 13 can be distinguished by allowing the RS flip-flop circuits (NAND1, NAND2) of the wakeup detection circuit 130 to hold the voltage states of the nodes NA and NB. As described above, the wakeup detection circuit 130 is a circuit which sets the wakeup signal TWUP at the H level (active) when the voltage level of the differential signal lines changes from the power-down voltage (H level, for example) to another voltage level (1 V, for example) (when the signal HPDW changes from the H level to the L level) after the power-down command has been detected and the output signal TPDW from the power-down detection circuit 110 has been set at the H level (active). This circuit prevents the wakeup signal TWUP from being set at the H level at the timing indicated by D8 shown in FIG. 12 and causes the wakeup signal TWUP to be set at the H level at the timing indicated by E5 shown in FIG. 13.",
        "9. Third Configuration Example",
        "A detailed third configuration example of the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit according to one embodiment of the present invention is described below using FIG. 14. In FIG. 14, the configuration and operation of the circuit block denoted by the same symbol as in FIGS. 3 and 11 are almost the same as those in the first and second configuration examples shown in FIGS. 3 and 11. Therefore, description thereof is omitted.",
        "The third configuration example shown in FIG. 14 differs from the second configuration example shown in FIG. 11 in the configuration of the transmitter circuit. In more detail, in FIG. 14, the current driver 60 (first and second current sources) of the transmitter circuit includes N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR11A and TR12A and a current source IHS. The current driver 60 includes N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR11B and TR12B and a current source ILS.",

The transistor TR12A is provided between the output node NQB and the current source IHS. In more detail, the input signal DIN\u2212 is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR12A, the output node NQB is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR12A, and the current source IHS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR12A.",

The transistor TR12B is provided between the output node NQB and the current source ILS. In more detail, the input signal DIN\u2212 is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR12B, the output node NQB is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR12B, and the current source ILS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR12B.",
        "The current source IHS is provided between the transistors TR11A and TR12A and the power supply VSS (first power supply). The current source IHS is a current source which can generate current (500 \u03bcA, for example) greater than that of the current source ILS, and may be formed by a transistor to which a first reference voltage is input at a gate terminal, for example.",
        "The current source ILS is provided between the transistors TR11B and TR12B and the power supply VSS (first power supply). The current source ILS is a current source which can generate current (100 \u03bcA, for example) smaller than that of the current source IHS, and may be formed by a transistor to which a second reference voltage lower than the first reference voltage is input at a gate terminal, for example.",
        "When the input signal DIN+ becomes active (H level) and the input signal DIN\u2212 becomes inactive (L level), the transistors TR11A and TR12B are turned ON and the transistors TR12A and TR11B are turned OFF. This causes a large amount of current (500 \u03bcA, for example) to flow through the DTO+ signal line and a small amount of current (100 \u03bcA, for example) to flow through the DTO\u2212 signal line. When the input signal DIN+ becomes inactive (L level) and the input signal DIN\u2212 becomes active (H level), the transistors TR11A and TR12B are turned OFF and the transistors TR12A and TR11B are turned ON. This causes a small amount of current to flow through the DTO+ signal line and a large amount of current to flow through the DTO\u2212 signal line.",
        "FIGS. 15A, 15B, and 15C show the inverter circuits (inversion circuits) INV1A and INV1B according to one embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 15A, the inverter circuit INV1A (INV1B) is formed by N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR20 and TR21 connected in series between the power supply VDD and the power supply VSS. The power supply VDD (second power supply) is connected to a gate terminal of the transistor TR20, and the input node NIA (NIB) is connected to a gate terminal of the transistor TR21.

        "In FIGS. 3, 11, and 14, the circuit formed by the transistor TR4A (TR4B) and the inverter circuit INV1A (INV1B) functions as a low-impedance generation circuit. A specific impedance (Z0) of the DTO+ (DTO\u2212) differential signal lines can be matched with the input impedance of the receiver circuit by complementing the impedance (Z2) of the resistor RA (RB) to the impedance (Z1) generated by the low-impedance generation circuit (Z0=Z1+Z2). The length of the differential signal lines or the like is changed depending on the type of an electronic instrument, whereby the specific impedance of the differential signal lines may be changed. In this case, it is preferable that the resistor RA (RB) be a variable resistor. This enables the circuit formed by the low-impedance generation circuit (circuit consisting of the transistor TR4A and the inverter circuit INV1A or the circuit consisting of the transistor TR4B and the inverter circuit INV1B) and the resistor RA (RB) to function as an impedance adjustment circuit. Therefore, impedance matching can be performed even if the specific impedance of the differential signal lines is changed. The resistor RA (RB) may not be provided when the specific impedance of the differential signal lines is low and impedance matching can be performed only by the input impedance of the low-impedance generation circuit, for example.",

Therefore, since the number of interconnects which pass through the connection section between the first and second instrument sections can be significantly reduced, the design and mounting of the connection section can be facilitated. Moreover, occurrence of EMI noise can be reduced.
