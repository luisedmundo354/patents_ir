        "The present invention relates to thin film device fabrication, and more particularly, this invention relates to an image transfer process for defining a width of a thin film layer or layers.",
        "The heart of a computer is a magnetic disk drive which includes a rotating magnetic disk, a slider that has read and write heads, a suspension arm above the rotating disk and an actuator arm that swings the suspension arm to place the read and write heads over selected circular tracks on the rotating disk. The suspension arm biases the slider into contact with the surface of the disk when the disk is not rotating but, when the disk rotates, air is swirled by the rotating disk adjacent an air bearing surface (ABS) of the slider causing the slider to ride on an air bearing a slight distance from the surface of the rotating disk. When the slider rides on the air bearing the write and read heads are employed for writing magnetic impressions to and reading magnetic signal fields from the rotating disk. The read and write heads are connected to processing circuitry that operates according to a computer program to implement the writing and reading functions.",
        "In high capacity disk drives, magnetoresistive (MR) read sensors, commonly referred to as MR heads, are the prevailing read sensors because of their capability to read data from a surface of a disk at greater track and linear densities than thin film inductive heads. An MR sensor detects a magnetic field through the change in the resistance of its MR sensing layer (also referred to as an \u201cMR element\u201d) as a function of the strength and direction of the magnetic flux being sensed by the MR layer.",
        "The conventional MR sensor operates on the basis of the anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) effect in which an MR element resistance varies as the square of the cosine of the angle between the magnetization in the MR element and the direction of sense current flow through the MR element. Recorded data can be read from a magnetic medium because the external magnetic field from the recorded magnetic medium (the signal field) causes a change in the direction of magnetization of the MR element, which in turn causes a change in resistance of the MR element and a corresponding change in the sensed current or voltage.",
        "Another type of MR sensor is the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor manifesting the GMR effect. In GMR sensors, the resistance of the GMR sensor varies as a function of the spin-dependent transmission of the conduction electrons between ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer (spacer) and the accompanying spin-dependent scattering which takes place at the interface of the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers and within the ferromagnetic layers.",
        "GMR sensors using only two layers of ferromagnetic material (e.g., Ni\u2014Fe) separated by a layer of non-magnetic material (e.g., copper) are generally referred to as spin valve (SV) sensors. In an SV sensor, one of the ferromagnetic layers, referred to as the pinned layer (reference layer), has its magnetization typically pinned by exchange coupling with an antiferromagnetic (e.g., NiO or Fe\u2014Mn) layer. The pinning field generated by the antiferromagnetic layer should be greater than demagnetizing fields (about 200 Oe) at the operating temperature of the SV sensor (about 120\u00b0 C.) to ensure that the magnetization direction of the pinned layer remains fixed during the application of external fields (e.g., fields from bits recorded on the disk). The magnetization of the other ferromagnetic layer, referred to as the free layer, however, is not fixed and is free to rotate in response to the field from the recorded magnetic medium (the signal field).",
        "One well known way to increase the performance of magnetic disk drives is to increase the areal data storage density of the magnetic hard disk. This can be accomplished by reducing the written data track width, such that more tracks per inch can be written on the disk. To read data from a disk with a reduced track width, it is also necessary to develop sufficiently narrow read head components, such that unwanted magnetic field interference from adjacent data tracks is substantially eliminated.",
        "Thin film head components such as sensors are created by wafer processing. Typically, a layer of photoresist is added to define the width of the component positioned underneath, and exposed material is removed by various processes. As components become smaller, the lithographic patterns must also become smaller yet must maintain a high resolution to properly form the components.",
        "Shrinking thin-film head (TFH) device geometries force adoption of more advanced lithography platforms for enhanced resolution of small features. Products planned for the near-term future exceed the printing capability of the existing manufacturing platform, deep-ultraviolet (DUV, 248 nm wavelength) lithography. The 193 nm wavelength lithography platform provides extended resolving capability, but poses challenges in integration of the lithographic pattern into the TFH read-head build process.",
        "One difficulty is that 193 nm photoresists tend to have poor etch resistance. If reactive ion etching (RIE) is used, the topography of the photoresist pattern tends to be destroyed because the photoresist etches away along with the underlayer. If edges of the photoresist are reduced, i.e., the resolution is degraded, the edges of the component will be removed, resulting in a deformed component. Further, if too little photoresist remains, the photoresist will tend to become encapsulated by subsequently deposited materials, making liftoff difficult or impossible. FIG. 1 illustrates a read head 100 just before liftoff according to a standard photolithography process. As shown, the photoresist 102 becomes shrunken and rounded from the RIE, resulting in the deposited material 104 encasing the remaining resist structure completely. The solvent cannot reach the photoresist 102 to effect the liftoff.",
        "Prior art attempts to overcome the problem of photoresist erosion used thicker layers of photoresist. However, the photoresist tended to fall over during subsequent processing. For typical photoresists, only an aspect ratio of about 3 to 1 photoresist height/width or less is stable enough for further processing.",
        "Yet another problem is the need for a bottom antireflective coating (BARC) to suppress standing waves and sensitivity of the photoresist's printed linewidth to fluctuations in photoresist thickness. Most BARC materials are insoluble in wet stripping reagents, complicating rework of the photoresist pattern.",
        "Electron-beam (e-beam) lithography provides an alternative platform for extended resolving capability, but it lags behind the optical platforms in readiness and is generally less cost-effective due to low tool throughput.",
        "A method for fabricating a thin film component includes forming a wafer having a thin film, an etch-stop layer, and a release layer, the release layer being soluble in a solvent. A layer of photoresist is added and patterned. Etching is performed to substantially remove exposed regions of the release layer and the etch-stop layer. Milling is performed to substantially remove exposed regions of the thin film. A layer of metal is added to the wafer. The wafer is baked at a temperature above a glass transition temperature of the photoresist for a period of time sufficient to cause deformation of the photoresist to an extent that the photoresist creates cracks in the metal layer. A solvent is applied to the wafer to dissolve the release layer, the solvent penetrating the cracks in the metal layer to reach the release layer. The release layer and any material above the release layer are removed.",
        "The etch-stop layer is preferably carbon based. The release layer preferably also functions as an antireflective coating. The photoresist is preferably capable of resolving lines 60 nm wide or smaller.",
        "The photoresist is preferably resistant to O2 reactive ion etching, and may contain silicon to achieve this property. The layer of metal can be a monolayer or multiple layer to form such things as biasing magnets, leads, etc.",
        "Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, when taken in conjunction with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.",
        "For a fuller understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention, as well as the preferred mode of use, reference should be made to the following detailed description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

For clarity, much of the description shall be described in terms of defining a width of a magnetic sensor, one skilled in the art understanding that this process can be adapted to fabrication of many other types of electronic components.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates the general process flow of a method 200 for fabricating a thin film component. In step 202, a wafer having a thin film layer, a release layer, and a patterned layer of photoresist is formed. In step 204, the pattern of the layer of photoresist is transferred to the release layer. In step 205, the wafer is subjected to ion milling to remove exposed portions of the thin film layer. A layer of metal is added to the wafer in step 206. In step 208, the wafer is heated to a temperature above a glass transition temperature of the photoresist for a period of time sufficient to cause deformation of the photoresist to an extent that the photoresist creates cracks in the overlying metal layer. In step 210, a solvent is applied to the wafer to dissolve the release layer, the solvent penetrating the cracks in the metal layer to reach the release layer. The release layer and any material above the release layer are removed in step 212.",

The release layer 308 is preferably formed of a material having some, and ideally, all, of the following properties:\n\n    \n    \n        Good adhesion to the underlying carbon so that the resist subsequently added will adhere to the substrate.\n        Good resistance to downstream etching.\n        Good absorption of 193 nm light to provide BARC functionality. Good antireflective qualities are desirable at these wavelengths of exposure because of the generation of standing waves, and because the process is very sensitive to minor fluctuations in resist thickness.\n        Solvent strippability to simplify rework processing and to facilitate the downstream liftoff step. This is not a characteristic shared by typical BARC layers, which normally require RIE to remove. Preferably, the material is soluble in conventional liftoff solvents such as NMP. If the photo mask needs to be reworked because of misalignment, etc., the underlayer can be easily removed by applying solvent. In contrast, if dry etchable BARCs were used, a dry etching process would have to be performed, and since this layer is formed on a carbon surface, some carbon would also be removed. Thus, additional processing to replenish the carbon layer would have to be performed.\n        Resistance to intermixing with the overlying photoresist image layer.",
        "One material which has all of these properties is a polyimide manufactured by Arch Chemicals, Inc. 501 Merritt 7, Norwalk, Conn. 06856 under the trade name Durimide. The coated thickness is determined by the extent of downstream etching, but may be in the range of about 20-400 nm. The methodology disclosed herein provides a new use for this preferred material, which is generally sold in a form about 10\u00d7 thicker (3-6 microns) than is used in this illustrative process, and is typically used in fully cured form as a lasting part of the device structure rather than as a sacrificial layer as here.",
        "The material is baked at a temperature and time sufficient to drive off casting solvents and prevent intermixing, but insufficient to cure the polyimide (which would render it insoluble in liftoff and rework solvents). In the illustrative process, the Durimide is baked at 200\u00b0 C. for two minutes.",
        "Step 3:",
        "Referring to FIG. 3C, the substrate is coated with a photoresist \u201cimage layer\u201d material 310 which is preferably capable of resolving lines down to 60 nm width and smaller, at a thickness and etch resistance sufficient to withstand downstream etching steps 4 and 5 such that not all of the material is removed. Since photoresist lines tend to collapse at a height/width aspect ratio greater than 4 or 5, it is preferred that the material's resistance to downstream etching be sufficient to allow its thickness to be about 250 nm or less before the etching, yet maintain a thickness of at least 100 nm after etching so that the reflow bake step 7 can be effective. A suitable photoresist material is TIS 51-23, also available from Arch Chemicals, Inc. TIS 51-23 combines excellent imaging characteristics with good resistance to RIE etching in an O2 environment, conferred by incorporation of silicon (Si) into the polymer structure. Si-containing resists have been found to improve the resistance of the imaging layer to reactive ion etching (RIE). It is believed that the Si reacts with the oxygen and forms a glass that reduces damage to the imaging layer by the RIE.",
        "A stencil of the read-head track image is formed in the image layer photoresist 310, using 193 nm light through a suitable mask in a step and scan printer, followed by post-exposure bake and develop steps under conditions suitable for the particular imaging resist being used.",
        "Step 4:",
        "As shown in FIG. 3D, the wafer is subjected to RIE in an O2 environment to remove the release layer and carbon etch-stop layer in the areas exposed in step 3. Again, the release layer 308 is preferably fairly resistant to the RIE due to the Si content. Experimentation with the preferred materials listed herein have shown about a 6 to 1 ratio of etch rate between the carbon layer 306 and the release layer 308.",
        "Step 5:",
        "Referring to FIG. 3E, the wafer is subjected to ion milling to remove the magnetic sensor film 304 in the areas exposed in step 3. At this point, it is preferred that some image layer photoresist material 310 be left atop the release layer 308 in order for the downstream step 7 to work effectively.",
        "Step 6:",
        "As depicted in FIG. 3F, metal 312 is added to the wafer to form biasing magnets and electrical connections to the sensor which is protected by the photoresist stencil 310 unexposed in step 3. Any suitable process to add the metal 312 may be used, such as ion beam deposition (IBD). At this point, enough of the imaging photoresist layer 310 is typically left that it is able to support the deposited material 312 without falling over. In the lower corners 314 of the structure, the thickness of the deposited metal 312 tends to be thinner, the importance of which will become apparent during discussion of the next processing step.",
        "Step 7:",
        "The wafer is baked at a temperature above the glass transition (Tg) of the image layer photoresist 310 for a time sufficient to cause it to flow. A temperature of about 150\u00b0 C. is preferred for the materials listed herein. The resist flow causes the deposited metal layer 312 to crack and form pathways for solvent to penetrate to the release layer 308 in the subsequent step 8. In this exemplary method, as shown in FIG. 3G, the photoresist 310 swells and breaks the weak points (corners 314 and possibly other areas) of the deposited metal 312, creating cracks at the corners 314 (exaggerated in the FIG.) that allow the solvent to penetrate to the underlying release layer 308.",
        "Step 8:",
        "The wafer is exposed to a solvent such as NMP or other solvent capable of dissolving or weakening the release layer 308 to dissolve the release layer 308, and allow lifting off of the photoresist 310 and metal 312 atop it. Upon liftoff, the deposited metal layer 312 is then generally left only in the areas originally exposed during lithographic patterning in step 3, as shown in FIG. 3H.",
        "Step 9:",
        "An optional CMP process can be used to remove residues of metal and photoresist that may be left behind after the liftoff step 8. Formation and transfer of the read head track is now complete. The remainder of the head can then be formed.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a read head 400 formed by the process above just before the baking of step 7. As shown, the track width is very well defined.",
        "While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."
