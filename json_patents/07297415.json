However, an inorganic electroluminescence device needs a high voltage alternating current for light emitting.",

A lot of attempts to use the organic EL device for device structures, organic fluorescent dyes and organic charge transport compounds have been reported because the organic EL device has the feature that it can easily provide light emissions of many colors in addition to the features of low voltage drive and high luminance in comparison with the inorganic EL device (Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 27, page L269 (1988)), (J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 65, page 3610 (1989)).",

        "For the polymer LED, a film of an organic layer can be easily formed by coating.

Since the polymer LED is a polymer, it is considered excellent in mechanical strength of a film.",

The solvent to be used for the solution of the acid may be water or other solvents.",
        "Meanwhile, the solvent that separates the phase of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in a liquid state from the phase of the acid in a liquid state can easily separate the polymeric fluorescent substance from the acid. Therefore such a solvent is more preferred.",

        "First, the starting polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved in a solvent that well dissolves the polymeric fluorescent substance and separates from the phase of the aqueous solution of the acid (or water), for example, in chloroform, and then the solution is brought into contact with the solution of the acid while stirring for example (step of treating with an acid). After allowed to stand still, the phase of the solution of the acid is separated from the phase that contains the polymeric fluorescent substance.",

        "Then, the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance that was obtained by separating the phases of the solution was brought into contact with water to remove the acid remaining in the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance. By repeating the removal of the acid in the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance until the pH of the aqueous phase becomes 7, a solution of the polymeric fluorescent substance is obtained. The solution is added dropwise into a poor solvent for the polymeric fluorescent substance such as methanol, while stirring, to produce the precipitate of the polymeric fluorescent substance. The precipitate is filtered, washed with ethanol and then dried under a reduced pressure to obtain the polymeric fluorescent substance.",
        "Examples of method 2) include a method comprising mixing a liquid acid with a solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance without using a solvent and then treating by washing operation of stirring repulp type; and a method comprising dissolving the acid in an organic solvent and mixing it with a solid powder of the polymeric fluorescent substance and treating by washing operation of stirring repulp type. When using a solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in the present method, the acid or other unnecessary ingredients can be removed from the solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance by treating with the acid followed by filtration. Further, the acid remaining in the polymeric fluorescent substance can be removed with an organic solvent or water by washing operation of the stirring repulp type.",

        "Next, the step of treating with an alkali will be described below.",
        "In the production method of the present invention, a good solvent for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is preferably used because it is preferable for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance to be sufficiently dissolved in order to be uniformly treated with the alkali.",
        "The organic solvent may be any solvent that can dissolve the crude polymeric fluorescent substance without particular limitation. However, examples of good solvents for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance include chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, tetralin, decalin, n-butylbenzene, and dioxane. Typically 0.1 wt % or more crude polymeric fluorescent substances can be dissolved in these solvents, but it depends on the structure or molecular weight of the crude polymeric fluorescent substances.",

        "The method for producing the polymeric fluorescent substance of the present invention comprises the step of bringing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance into contact with the alkali. This step may be repeated twice or more. In the step of bringing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance into contact with the alkali, it is preferable to contact the crude polymeric fluorescent substance dissolved in an organic solvent with the alkali with respect to the contact efficiency.",
        "Examples of the method for bringing into contact with an alkali include (a) a method in which the alkali is just added as it is to a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance; (b) a method in which a solution of an alkali in a solvent is added to a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance; (c) a method in which a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance is added to a solution of an alkali; and (d) a method in which a crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dispersed in a solvent in which an alkali is dissolved.",
        "In methods (b) and (c), the solvent in which the alkali is to be dissolved may be an organic solvent or water. When the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved in an organic solvent, the solvent in which the alkali is to be dissolved may be a solvent homogeneously mixed or unmixed with the organic solvent in which the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved. Among organic solvents, preferred is the same organic solvent as that in which the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved.",

        "To obtain two-dimensional light emission using the polymer LED of the present invention, sheet-shaped anode and cathode may be arranged to overlap to each other. Moreover, examples of method for obtaining patterned light emission include: a method of arranging a mask provided with patterned window(s) on the surface of the above sheet-shaped light emitting device; a method for forming an organic layer of the non-light emitting part thick to make itself substantially not light emissible; and a method for forming either an anode or a cathode or both of them in patterned forms. A segment type display device that can display numerals, letters, simple symbols and the like can be obtained by forming patterns by any of these methods and arranging some electrodes so that they can be independently turned ON/OFF. Further, a dot matrix device can be obtained by forming both an anode and a cathode in stripe and arranging them orthogonally. A partial color display and a multicolor display can be obtained by partially arranging plural kinds of polymeric fluorescent substances that emit light in different colors or by using a color filter or a fluorescence conversion filter. The dot matrix device can be driven by a passive drive or active drive in combination with TFT and the like. These display devices can be used as a display device such as a computer, a television, a mobile terminal, a mobile phone, a car navigator and a viewfinder of a video camera.",
