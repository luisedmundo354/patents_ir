    "description": [
        "The present invention generally relates to the description of an interface applicable to a computer object. In a first aspect of the invention, the description of the interface is in a markup language. In a second aspect of the invention, the description of the interface is in a schema language associated with a markup language.",
        "In an object oriented system, the computer object is an element comprising data, also known as attributes, and functions or method which may possibly use parameters or input arguments. Typically, these functions may be called or invoked in order to manipulate the data of the object.",
        "An interface is a set of functions applicable to an object.",
        "A known markup language will be considered more particularly below. In this case it is the XML (Extended Markup Language) language.",
        "This language is defined by a well-known standard: the XML standard.",
        "The XML standard defines a syntax enabling documents to be structured with the use of tags bounded by the signs <and> (for example: <tag>). These tags are grouped together by pairs of opening and closing tags (<tag> and </tag>). An XML tag is an element constituted by an opening tag, the corresponding closing tag, as well as the whole of the content bounded by these tags. This content is composed of other elements and/or pure text. A tag without content can be represented by an empty tag <tag/>. An XML document is constituted by a principle element.",
        "A schema language enables a markup language to be described. Thus, an XML schema language enables an XML language to be described. Several XML schema languages exist and are known in the art.",
        "A document written in an XML schema language is commonly called an XML schema. An XML schema describes the structure of a set of XML documents. An XML schema is the description of the tags authorized in a document conforming to this XML language and of their possible nesting. An XML document respecting the structure defined by an XML schema is said to be valid with respect to this XML schema.",
        "In this context, the French patent application No. 99 08155 filed by the present applicant describes a method of remote execution of a function on a computer object in a computer network. More particularly, this document proposes a method of describing the interfaces of an object based on an XML language. The XML language used is specific to this application and only provides a limited set of possible types for the input and output parameters of the functions.",
        "Moreover, a specification written by the IBM and Microsoft companies, called WSDL (Web Services Description Language) provides a method of describing services using XML syntax. A service is characterized by the description of the document which it receives as input and by the document which it produces as output. These documents are XML documents of which the structure can typically be described by XML schemas.",
        "It should be noted that this specification does not use the notion of object. The XML schema language is used according to its known function, that is to say to describe the structure of XML documents. Within this specification, the documents described are documents processed and produced by a service.",
        "Furthermore, the United States patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,391 describes the use of documents for carrying out transactions between commercial partners via a network. In a similar manner to the WSDL specification, a transaction is described by its input and output documents.",
        "Here too, the notion of object is not used and the XML schema language is used according to its known function, that is to say to describe the structure of XML documents.",
        "The present invention aims to remedy the drawbacks of the prior art, by providing a method and a device for describing a function applicable to a computer object.",
        "In the first aspect of the invention, the inventors have worked more particularly on the markup language. Thus, the invention proposes a method of describing a function applicable to a computer object, the function being invocable in a first markup language, the function being initially expressed in a predetermined programming language different from the first markup language,",
        "characterised in that it includes the steps of:\n\n    \n    \n        defining a first tag describing the function, in the first markup language,\n        defining second tags describing the arguments of the function, these tags being contained in the first tag describing the function and the types of the arguments being expressed in a second markup language,",
        "and, if the function produces a result,\n\n    \n    \n        defining a third tag describing the result of the function, this tag being contained in the first tag describing the function and the type of the result being expressed in the second markup language.",
        "Correlatively, the invention concerns a device for describing a function applicable to a computer object, the function being invocable in a first markup language, the function being initially expressed in a predetermined programming language different from the first markup language,",
        "characterised in that it has:\n\n    \n    \n        means of defining a first tag describing the function, in the first markup language,\n        means of defining second tags describing the arguments of the function, these tags being contained in the first tag describing the function and the types of the arguments being expressed in a second markup language,",
        "and, if the function produces a result,\n\n    \n    \n        means of defining a third tag describing the result of the function, this tag being contained in the first tag describing the function and the type of the result being expressed in the second markup language.",
        "By virtue of the invention, a single interpreter capable of processing the markup language is necessary for processing an interface.",
        "In addition, an interface can easily be read by a user whilst offering a great variety of possible types.",
        "In particular when the first markup language is an XML language and the second markup language is an XML schema language associated with the XML language, the typing part of the XML schemas is preserved.",
        "Finally, it is not necessary to have a complex processor for processing an interface according to the invention. For example, the invention can be used on a communicating diary, known as a PDA, or a portable telephone.",
        "According to alternative preferred characteristic\n\n    \n    \n        the second markup language is a schema language associated with the first markup language, or\n        the second markup language is a markup language which makes it possible to construct complex types by aggregation of predefined simple types.",
        "The second language thus procures either the advantages of a schema language, or an even more simple implementation in which only new complex types can be created.",
        "According to a preferred characteristic, the third tag is differentiated from the second tags by an attribute with a specific value.",
        "Thus a result is easily identifiable.",
        "According to another preferred characteristic, at least one function forming part of an interface, the interface is stored in the markup language and in the programming language.",
        "The description device has means of implementing the above characteristics.",
        "The invention also concerns a method of obtaining, by a client terminal, an interface of an object, said interface having at least one function described by the method presented above,",
        "characterised in that it includes the translation of said interface into a programming language different from the markup language.",
        "According to a preferred characteristic, the obtaining method includes the storage of the interface in the markup language and in the programming language.",
        "The invention also concerns an obtaining device having means of implementing the above characteristics.",
        "According to a preferred characteristic, the markup language is an XML language and the associated schema language is the XML schema language described by the standard \u201cXML Schema\u201d.",
        "The description device, the obtaining method and device have advantages similar to those previously presented.",
        "In the second aspect of the invention, the inventors have worked on a schema language associated with a markup language. Thus, the invention provides a method of describing a function applicable to a computer object, it being possible to invoke the function in a markup language, the function being initially expressed in a predetermined programming language different from the markup language,",
        "characterized in that it comprises the steps of:\n\n    \n    \n        defining an element describing the function, in a schema language associated with the markup language,\n        defining the arguments of the function, in said schema language,",
        "and, if the function produces a result,\n\n    \n    \n        defining the element describing the result of the function, in said schema language.",
        "Correlatively, the invention relates to a device for describing a function applicable to a computer object, it being possible to invoke the function in a markup language, the function being initially expressed in a predetermined programming language different from the markup language,",
        "characterized in that it comprises:\n\n    \n    \n        means for defining an element describing the function, in a schema language associated with the markup language,\n        means for defining the arguments of the function, in said schema language,",
        "and, if the function produces a result,\n\n    \n    \n        means for defining the element describing the result of the function, in said schema language.",
        "By virtue of the invention, the functions are described with the use of a schema language which is a standard language, and this enables the use of all the existing tools for dealing with this language.",
        "The design and programming of an interface are simplified.",
        "In particular, it is possible to define new types of elements, to validate the invocation of functions, these functions making it possible to perform processing operations, for example on images, which were previously complex, if not difficult, to carry out.",
        "According to preferred features and alternatives, when a function produces a result, the definition of an element describing an invocation of that function comprises a specific attribute for indicating which element describes the result of that invocation or a relationship is established between an element describing an invocation of that function and the element describing its result by means of documentary elements of the schema language. Thus, an invocation of a function and its result are linked.",
        "According to a preferred feature, the definition of an element of a function has a particular type which makes it possible to characterize this element as describing a function.",
        "According to another preferred feature, with at least one function forming part of an interface, the invention comprises the storage in memory of the interface in the schema language and in the programming language.",
        "The describing device comprises means for implementing the above features.",
        "The invention also concerns a method for obtaining an interface of an object by a client terminal, said interface comprising at least one function described by the description method already set out,",
        "characterized in that it comprises the translation of said interface into a programming language that is different to the schema language.",
        "According to a preferred feature, the obtaining method comprises the storage in memory of the interface in the schema language and in the programming language.",
        "According to a preferred feature, the markup language is an XML language and the associated schema language is an XML schema language. The XML schemas make it possible to validate the documents containing the function invocations and the documents containing the function results.",
        "The invention also relates to an obtaining device comprising means for implementing the above features.",
        "The describing device and the obtaining method and device have similar advantages to those already set out.",
        "The invention also relates to a computer including the device according to the invention, or means for implementing the method according to the invention. The advantages of the computer are identical to those already disclosed.",
