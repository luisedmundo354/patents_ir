        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a power control apparatus for a four-wheel drive hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and a motor as power sources.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Conventionally, a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle is known in the art, which, for example, includes an internal combustion engine as a power source for driving front wheels, an AC generator that is driven by the internal combustion engine, an electrical energy storage device for storing electrical energy generated by the AC generator, and a motor that drives rear wheels by being supplied with electrical energy from the electrical energy storage device, and in which the amount of generation by the AC generator is controlled depending on the difference between the rotational speeds of the front wheels and the rear wheels (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 11-318001).",
        "Moreover, conventionally, a hybrid vehicle is known in the art, which, for example, includes an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels, a generator that is driven by the internal combustion engine, and a motor that drives the other of the front and rear wheels by being supplied with electrical energy from the generator, and in which a target torque of the motor is determined depending on the difference between the rotational speeds of the front wheels and the rear wheels, or depending on a depression amount of the accelerator pedal (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-177909).",
        "In the above-mentioned power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle, because the motor for the rear wheels is driven by merely being supplied with electrical energy from the electrical energy storage device, the capacity of the electrical energy storage device must be increased, or the output voltage of the electrical energy storage device must be made higher in order to increase the output power of the motor. In such a case, problems are encountered in that the electrical energy storage device becomes large, and high tension elements become large.",
        "Moreover, in the above-mentioned hybrid vehicle, because the motor for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels is driven by merely being supplied with electrical energy from the generator, the output power of the motor is limited by the maximum electrical power of the generator; therefore, a desired output power may not be obtained.",
        "The present invention was conceived in view of the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle, which includes an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels, a motor that drives the other of the front and rear wheels, and an electrical energy storage device that receives energy from and sends energy to the motor, and which enables obtaining a desired output power of the motor without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device.",
        "In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle including: an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels; a first motor-generator which is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine; a second motor-generator which is connected to the other of the front and rear wheels; an electrical energy storage device which receives energy from and sends energy to the first and second motor-generators; and a control unit which is operatively connected to the internal combustion engine, the first and second motor-generator, and the electrical energy storage device, and which includes: an electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device; an electrical power calculation section for calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or for calculating the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator; an output power command calculation section for calculating an output power command for a powering operation of the second motor-generator; and an output power limiting section which is adapted to calculate the sum of the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator, to compare magnitudes of the sum or the difference and of the output power command for the second motor-generator, and to set the smaller of the sum or the difference and the output power command for the second motor-generator as a new output power command for the second motor-generator.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, the second motor-generator can be operated using the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator in addition to the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device. As a result, the front wheels or the rear wheels can be driven by the second motor-generator with an output power which is greater than the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator. In other words, the output power of the second motor-generator can be greater, without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device, than in the case in which the second motor-generator is operated merely using the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device or the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.",
        "Moreover, the electrical power which can be supplied from the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator to the second motor-generator, i.e., the sum of the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator, is calculated, and when the sum or the difference is smaller than the output power command for the second motor-generator, the output power command for the second motor-generator is limited by the output power limiting section. As a result, the second motor-generator can be operated in a powering manner while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated in such a manner that, for example, the electrical energy storage device is prevented from being over-discharged, and the first motor-generator is prevented from receiving an excessive electrical generation command.",
        "The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and the electrical discharge amount calculation section may be adapted to set a calculated value, which is obtained by subtracting the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, as a new electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, at least the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device can be supplemented by the electrical energy storage device, and at the same time, the output power of the second motor-generator can be increased while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated.",
        "The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and a generation command calculation section which is adapted to obtain a calculated value by subtracting the output power command for the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, and to set the absolute value of the calculated value as a generation command for a generating operation of the first motor-generator when the calculated value is negative.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when the sum of the output power command for the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device is greater than the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator may be increased so that the output power of the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device can be provided by the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.",
        "The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a deterioration detecting device for determining whether the electrical energy storage device has deteriorated, and the control unit may further include an output power command setting section for setting the output power command for the second motor-generator in such a manner that, when the electrical power calculation section is calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, and when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected by the deterioration detecting device, the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator which is calculated by the electrical power calculation section is set as the output power command for the second motor-generator.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected, the output power command for the second motor-generator can be ensured by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.",
        "The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and the output power command setting section may be adapted to set a calculated value, which is obtained by subtracting the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator which is calculated by the electrical power calculation section, as the output power command for the second motor-generator.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected, the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device in addition to the output power command for the second motor-generator can be ensured by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.",
        "The present invention further provides a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle including: an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels; a first motor-generator which is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine; a second motor-generator which is connected to the other of the front and rear wheels; an electrical energy storage device which receives energy from and sends energy to the first and second motor-generators; and a control unit which is operatively connected to the internal combustion engine, the first and second motor-generator, and the electrical energy storage device, and which includes: an electrical charge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device; an electrical power calculation section for calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or for calculating the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator; a regeneration command calculation section for calculating a regeneration command for a regenerating operation of the second motor-generator; and a regeneration limiting section which is adapted to calculate the sum of the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, to compare magnitudes of the sum or the difference and of the regeneration command for the second motor-generator, and to set the smaller of the sum or the difference and the regeneration command for the second motor-generator as a new regeneration command for the second motor-generator.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, the electrical energy storage device can be charged using the regenerated energy from the second motor-generator in addition to the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator. As a result, an amount of electrical energy, by which the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy exceeds the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, can be provided by the regenerating operation of the second motor-generator. In other words, the regenerated energy from the second motor-generator can be greater, without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device, than in the case in which the second motor-generator is operated in a regeneration manner merely depending on the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device or depending on the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator.",
        "When the electrical power which can be supplied from the second motor-generator to the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator, i.e., the sum of the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator is smaller than the regeneration command applied to the second motor-generator, the regeneration command for the second motor-generator is limited by the regeneration limiting section. As a result, the second motor-generator can be operated in a regenerating manner while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated in such a manner that, for example, the electrical energy storage device is prevented from being over-charged, and the first motor-generator is prevented from being supplied with an excessive electrical power.",
        "The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and the electrical charge amount calculation section may be adapted to set a calculated value, which is obtained by adding the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device to the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device, as a new electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device.",
        "According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device can be provided by the regenerated energy from the second motor-generator; therefore, the regenerated energy from the second motor-generator can be increased while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated.",

        "An embodiment of the power control device for a hybrid vehicle according to the present invention will be explained below with reference to the appended drawings. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the power control device 10 for a hybrid vehicle according to this embodiment is installed in a four-wheel drive hybrid vehicle 1 in which, for example, an internal combustion engine (indicated by ENG in the drawings) 11, a front motor-generator (M/G1) 12, and a transmission (T/M) 13, which are directly connected to each other in series, are connected to front wheels Wf via a front differential gear box DF, and a rear motor-generator (M/G2) 14 is connected to rear wheels Wr via a rear differential gear box DR. The power control device 10 includes a main battery (BATT) 15, a front power drive unit (PDU1) 16, a rear power drive unit (PDU2) 17, a DC-DC converter (DC-DC) 18, an auxiliary battery 19, a battery ECU 21, a motor ECU 22, an engine and T/M ECU 23, and a management ECU 24.",
        "In the hybrid vehicle 1, the driving powers of the internal combustion engine 11 and the front motor-generator 12 are transmitted to the front wheels Wf via the transmission 13 such as an automatic transmission (A/T), a CVT, a manual transmission (M/T), or the like, and via the front differential gear box DF which distributes the driving power between the right and left front wheels Wf.",
        "The driving power of the rear motor-generator 14 is transmitted to the rear wheels Wr via the rear differential gear box DR which has a clutch (not shown), and which distributes the driving power between the right and left rear wheels Wr.",
        "When the clutch (not shown) provided in the rear differential gear box DR is disengaged, the vehicle is placed in a front-wheel drive state in which solely the front wheels Wf are driven, and when the clutch is engaged, the vehicle is placed in a four-wheel drive state in which both the front and rear wheels Wf and Wr are driven. In the four-wheel drive state, distribution of the driving power between the right and left rear wheels Wr can be freely controlled.",
        "Moreover, when power is transmitted in reverse from the front wheels Wf to the front motor-generator 12, and from the rear wheels Wr to the rear motor-generator 14, such as when the hybrid vehicle 1 decelerates, the motor-generators 12 and 14 act as generators so as to generate so-called regenerative braking force, whereby the kinetic energy of the vehicle is recovered as electrical energy.",
        "The powering operation and regenerating operation (generating operation) of the motor-generators 12 and 14 are controlled by the power drive units 16 and 17 while receiving control commands from the motor ECU 22.",
        "To the power drive units 16 and 17, each of which includes a PWM inverter that operates in a pulse width modulation mode, the high voltage main battery 15, which receives energy from and sends energy to the motor-generators 12 and 14, is connected.
