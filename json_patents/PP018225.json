        "Botanical classification: Fittonia verschaffeltii.",
        "Variety denomination: \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019.",
        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Fittonia plant botanically known as Fittonia verschaffeltii and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019.",
        "The new cultivar was discovered by the inventor in a cultivated area of Haaren, The Netherlands in September 1999. \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 was discovered as a naturally occurring whole plant mutation of Fittonia verschaffeltii \u2018Anne\u2019 (not patented).",
        "Asexual reproduction by terminal cuttings of the new cultivar \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 was first done in October 1999 in Haaren, The Netherlands. Since that time, under careful observation, the unique characteristics of the new cultivar have been uniform, stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.",
        "The following represent the distinguishing characteristics of the new Fittonia cultivar \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019.\n\n    \n    \n        1. Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 exhibits dark pink leaf veins.\n        2. Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 exhibits wavy green leaf margins.\n        3. Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 exhibits broad ovate to elliptic leaves.",
        "The closest comparison cultivar is Fittonia \u2018White Anne\u2019 (not patented). The new cultivar Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 is distinguishable from Fittonia \u2018White Anne\u2019 by the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 exhibits dark pink leaf veins. The leaf veins of \u2018White Anne\u2019 are white.",
        "The new cultivar Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 is distinguishable from the parent plant Fittonia \u2018Anne\u2019 by the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 has dark pink leaf veins. The leaf veins of \u2018Anne\u2019 are light pink.",
        "The accompanying photograph illustrates the distinguishing traits of Fittonia \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019. The plant in the photograph shows an overall view of a 12 week old plant. The photograph was taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.",
        "The following is a detailed description of the new Fittonia cultivar named \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019. Data was collected in Haaren, The Netherlands from 12 week old greenhouse grown plants in 8.5 cm. containers. The time of year was Fall and the average temperature was 24 degrees Centigrade during the day and 22 degrees Centigrade at night. No photoperiodic treatments were used. Color determinations are in accordance with The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart 2001 edition, except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The growing requirements are similar to the species. \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, however, without any variance in genotype.\n\n    Botanical classification: Fittonia verschaffeltii \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019.\n    Use: Ornamental.\n    Parentage: \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 is a naturally occurring whole plant mutation of Fittonia verschaffeltii \u2018Anne\u2019.\n    Vigor: Moderate.\n    Growth rate: Moderate.\n    Growth habit: Broad spreading, upright.\n    Plant shape: Flattened globose.\n    Suitable container size: 8.5 cm. diameter container.\n    Height: Average 6.6 cm.\n    Width: Average 9.9 cm.\n    Hardiness: USDA Zone 10.\n    Propagation: Terminal cuttings.\n    Time to initiate roots: Approximately 21 days to produce roots on an initial cutting at 24\u00b0 Centigrade.\n    Time to produce a rooted cutting: Approximately 35 days to produce a rooted cutting at 24\u00b0 Centigrade.\n    Crop time: 12 weeks.\n    Root system: Fine and fibrous.\n    Stem:\n    \n        \n        \n            Branching habit.\u2014Moderately branching.\n            Average number of lateral branches.\u20142.\n            Pinching.\u2014No.\n            Lateral branch diameter.\u20142.5 mm. in diameter, thickened at the nodes, 3 mm in diameter.\n            Lateral branch length.\u20143.7 cm. in length.\n            Lateral branch color.\u2014200D.\n            Stem color.\u2014200C to 200D.\n            Pubescence.\u2014Dense, length 1.2 mm, color N155A.\n            Internode length.\u20141.3 mm. between nodes.\n            Internode color.\u2014143B.\n            Shape.\u2014Rounded.\n            Surface.\u2014Dull.\n            Stem strength.\u2014Moderate to strong.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    Foliage:\n    \n        \n        \n            Leaf arrangement.\u2014Opposite.\n            Compound or single.\u2014Single.\n            Leaf shape.\u2014Broad obovate to elliptic.\n            Leaf apex.\u2014Broad acute to rounded.\n            Leaf base.\u2014Truncate to obtuse.\n            Leaf texture.\u2014Slightly glossy and slightly rugose with furrowed venation.\n            Leaf length.\u2014Average 5.9 cm. in length.\n            Leaf width.\u20143.6 cm. in width.\n            Quantity of leaves per lateral branch.\u2014Average 6.\n            Pubescence.\u2014Short hairs on margins and main veins, 0.2 mm. in length, N155A.\n            Leaf margin.\u2014Wavy.\n            Vein pattern.\u2014Pinnate.\n            Young leaf color, (upper surface).\u2014141A, margins 139A.\n            Young leaf color, (lower surface).\u2014138A.\n            Mature leaf color, (upper surface).\u2014139A.\n            Mature leaf color, (lower surface).\u2014138B.\n            Vein color (upper surface).\u201453B, margins 53C.\n            Vein color (lower surface).\u2014144B to 144C.\n            Leaf attachment.\u2014Petiolate.\n            Petiole dimensions.\u2014Average 1 cm. in length, 2 mm. in diameter, 1.5 mm. in height.\n            Petiole color (upper surface).\u2014177B.\n            Petiole color (lower surface).\u2014144C to 144D to 145A.\n            Durability of foliage to stress.\u2014High.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    Flowers: Flowers have not been observed.\n    Disease and insect resistance: Plants of the new Fittonia have not been observed for disease or insect resistance."
