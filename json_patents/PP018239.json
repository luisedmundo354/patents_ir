        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Nemesia plant grown as an ornamental for use in borders, hanging basket or flower bed. The new variety is known botanically as Nemesia\u00d7hybrida and will be referred to hereinafter by the cultivar name \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019.",
        "The new Nemesia cultivar named \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 resulted from a formal breeding program that was conducted by the inventor at the inventor's nursery in West Sussex, United Kingdom. The purpose of the breeding program was to produce new varieties of Nemesia that exhibited improved flower size, new flower color, and compact habit. Three other varieties that have resulted from this breeding program are:",

        "The new Nemesia variety named \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is a selection arising from controlled cross-pollination that began in 1998 and proceeded as follows.",
        "(All of the seedling plants referenced herein by number are unreleased, unpatented selections retained by the inventor from previous generations).",
        "Nemesia seedling 111 was crossed with Nemesia seedling 110 to produce Nemesia seedling 152.",
        "Nemesia seedling 110 was crossed with Nemesia seedling 145 to produce Nemesia seedling 168.",
        "Nemesia seedling 152 was then crossed with Nemesia seedling 168 and produced \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019. The seed parent is Nemesia seedling 152 (unpatented) and the pollen parent is Nemesia seedling 168 (unpatented). Cross-pollination of the parents took place in West Sussex, United Kingdom in 2002. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is one of the seedlings that was selected from this cross. The distinguishing characteristics that make \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 unique from all other Nemesia known to the inventor are compact upright habit, large flower size, and cerise-red flowers.",
        "\u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is distinguishable from the female parent by flower color and disease resistance. Seedling 152 exhibits large dark-blue flowers, and is prone to disease, whereas \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 exhibits cerise-red flowers and is not susceptible to the diseases that affects seedling 152. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is distinguishable from the male parent by plant habit, and flower color. Seedling 168 exhibits compact habit, and mauve flowers, each with a large yellow eye, compared to \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019, which exhibits compact upright habit and cerise-red flowers each with a small yellow eye.",
        "The two closest comparison plants known to the inventor are Nemesia \u2018FLEURAME\u2019 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/095,139, filed Mar. 30, 2005), and Nemesia \u2018FLEURBAC\u2019 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/138,003, filed May 27, 2005).",
        "\u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is distinguishable from \u2018FLEURAME\u2019 by plant height and flower color. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is distinguishable from \u2018FLEURBAC\u2019 by plant height and flower color. \u2018FLEURBAC\u2019 exhibits bi-colored flowers, and both \u2018FLEURAME\u2019 and \u2018FLEURAME\u2019 are short in height compared to \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019.",
        "\u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 was first asexually propagated in 2002 at the inventor's nursery in West Sussex, United Kingdom. The asexual propagation was conducted by the inventor and the method utilized was softwood cuttings. The inventor has determined that \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is stable and uniform, and reproduces true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the distinguishing characteristics of \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019. In combination these traits set the new cultivar apart from all other existing varieties of Nemesia known to the inventor. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, without however, any variance in genotype.\n\n    \n    \n        1. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 exhibits compact upright habit.\n        2. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 exhibits large cerise-red flowers.\n        3. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 exhibits green foliage.\n        4. Growing conditions of \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 include peat and bark soil, fertilizer, normal daylight, and adequate but not excess water.\n        5. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is asexually propagated utilizing the method of softwood cuttings.\n        6. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is hardy to minus 6\u00b0 Centigrade.\n        7. \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 is grown for use as a border plant, hanging basket, or bedding plant.",
        "The accompanying color drawings illustrate the overall appearance of the new Nemesia cultivar named \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019 showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the drawings may differ from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the actual colors of the new variety \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019. Plants are 8-months-old, in 1-liter containers and were grown under greenhouse conditions in Encinitas, Calif.",
        "The drawing labeled FIG. 1 depicts a side view illustrating plant habit.",
        "The drawing labeled FIG. 2 is a close-up view of the flower. Drawings were made using conventional techniques, and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance, they are as accurate as possible by conventional photography.",
        "The following is a detailed description of the new Nemesia cultivar named \u2018FLEURCEL\u2019. Data was collected in Arroyo Grande, Calif. from 4-week-old plants grown indoors in 10 cm. containers. Phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, without however, any genotypic differences.
