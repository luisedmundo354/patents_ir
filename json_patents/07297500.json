        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/286,045, filed Apr. 23, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/269,055, filed Feb. 15, 2001.",
        "This invention was made under contract with the USDA-NRI agency of the United States Government under Contract No. CSREES 99-35503-8135.",
        "The present invention relates to the development of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of meat species, either raw or cooked meats, utilizing Troponin I as a speciation marker. Also provided are monoclonal antibodies specific to Troponin I.",
        "The accurate labeling of meat products is mandated and monitored by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as well as by state and local governments. Mixing undeclared species in meat products is illegal under Food Labeling Regulations. Apart from regulatory reasons, the prevention of adulteration of meat products with less desirable meat species is important to the consumers for economic, health, food safety and religious reasons.",
        "Several methods have been developed to identify meat species including electrophoresis, chromatography, DNA hybridization, and immunoassays. Immunological techniques, including agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most commonly applied for meat species identification.",
        "There are several disadvantages to the official method AGID. Concentrated antiserum preparations are required to obtain visible precipitin lines in AGID. Obtaining the antiserum is expensive in large-scale testing. Furthermore, the sensitivity of AGID is variable. Usually ten percent or more contamination must be present to detect adulteration with this method. Lastly, AGID cannot be used for species identification in cooked meat because of the shortage of commercial antiserum specific to cooked meats.",
        "The ELISA method has emerged as a sensitive, rapid, and specific method for meat speciation. This method can detect levels as low as one percent or less of meat contamination. Furthermore, it requires only simple sample preparation and no expensive equipment or highly skilled operator. In addition, the ELISA technique can be used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of meat proteins.",
        "Specific antibodies, either polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), are required as capture reagents in ELISA. Most of the ELISA methods currently employed for meat species identification use polyclonal antibodies as a capture reagent. However, polyclonal antibodies have disadvantages such as limited production, variable affinity and a requirement for further purification to eliminate cross-reaction.",
        "Using MAb based ELISA can provide better data quality and eventually reduce the cost of assays. To date, the monoclonal antibodies which are utilized in ELISA based assays for meat identification have been raised against native proteins. The antibodies are useful for the detection of meat in raw meat mixtures.",
        "A few disclosures of the production of polyclonal antibodies for the qualitative detection of meat species in cooked meat samples has been reported. These polyclonal antibodies have been raised against native heat-resistant immunizing antigens.",
        "Wide spread meat species adulteration has been found particularly among heat-processed meat products and retail meat markets. Hsieh et al. (1995) Jrnl. of Food Quality 19:1-13, indicated that the violation rate in cooked products was higher than raw meats (22.9% versus 15.9%) in the domestic market. This adulteration can have serious health consequences. Poultry carries pathogens that cause food-borne diseases. Cooking poultry requires a minimum internal temperature of 71.1\u00b0 C. (160\u00b0 F.) to kill salmonella. Beef requires a minimum internal temperature of 68.3\u00b0 C. (155\u00b0 F.) to kill E. Coli H7:0157. If a meat product like beef is contaminated with poultry meat, it might impose a potential health hazard due to the inadequate heat-processing even at a very low level of contamination.",
        "Additionally, regulatory controls to prevent the spread of BSE have prohibited the use of certain animal proteins in feed in several countries, requiring accurate analytical methods for detecting prohibited material in feed stuffs to ensure compliance with the new regulations. Microscopic analysis is commonly used to identify constituents of animal origin, e.g. blood clots, bone fragments, feather fragments, hair or muscle fiber, in feed stuffs. Hahn (1999) Naturwissenschaften 86:62-70. The method is simple and inexpensive, although it requires a certain degree of expertise to distinguish bone fragments of mammals from those of poultry and fish by observing the shape of lacunae. Methods based on PCR amplification of mitochondrial DNA have recently been developed, but generally are not able to distinguish between different tissues of the same species. Immunological methods have played a central role in the species identification of raw and heat processed meats. Hsieh et al., \u201cMonoclonal antibodies against heat-treated muscle proteins for the species identification and endpoint temperature determination of cooked meats\u201d Quality attributes of muscle foods, 1999, pp. 287-307, Plenum Publishing Co., New York, N.Y. The official enzyme immunoassay method for analyzing mammalian proteins of rendered animal material in the UK utilizes antisera raised against heat-stable proteins. Ansfield (1994) Food & Agricultural Immunology, 6:419-433. However, it detects most mammalian proteins without discrimination between prohibited and allowed proteins and requires the complement of microscopic analysis to confirm the presence of mammalian MBM (meat and bone meal).",
        "Thus, development of a suitable screening method to detect undeclared exogenous meat is important to comply with the food labeling regulation and animal feed regulation. There is, therefore, needed a method for the determination of species identification in cooked meats, as well as in animal feed.",
        "In our experience, crude thermostable immunogens could theoretically be used in the production of species-specific MAbs, but were actually ineffective because the chance of success in selecting a specific clone by screening with crude antigen is remote. The use of a defined antigen with known antigenic determinants, a so-called species marker, would substantially increase the chance of eliciting specific antibodies. Thus, besides thermostability, the selected species marker needs to possess a unique antigenic region for a given species that is not present in the counterpart molecules of other species.",
        "The present invention is drawn to antibodies, monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof which bind to Troponin I, a thermostable muscle protein, as well as to methods for making such antibodies and their uses. The antibodies are capable of meat species identification in raw and cooked meats and thus, find use in the detection of species substitution in meats, for determining end-point cooking temperature, and for determining the adequacy of the heat treatment of rendered meat. Additionally, because the presence of Troponin I in blood is indicative of muscle degradation, the antibodies find use in the diagnosis of skeletal muscle disease, as well. Kits containing the antibodies are also provided.",

        "The invention is drawn to the use of skeletal Troponin I (sTnI) as a thermally stable protein component of meat. Troponin I (TnI) is a 24 kD, heterogenic protein which varies immunologically between animal species. Several isoforms of TnI exist within each animal species including skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. These different isoforms of TnI can be immunologically distinguished. The antibodies of the invention include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as well as fragments thereof which retain the ability to bind to at least one isoform of TnI. In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention selectively bind to sTnI. Antibodies are also disclosed which are specific for TnI of a particular animal species of choice.",
        "An antibody, MAb, or fragment thereof is said to be capable of binding to a molecule if it is capable of specifically reacting with the molecule to thereby bind the molecule to the antibody, MAb, or fragment thereof. The term \u201cantibody\u201d (Ab) or \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d (MAb) is meant to include intact molecules as well as fragments or binding regions or domains thereof (such as, for example, Fab and F(ab)2 fragments) which are capable of binding antigen. Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, such as papin or pepsin. Alternatively, antigen-binding fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry.",
        "Methods for the preparation of the antibodies of the present invention are generally known in the art. For example, see Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Ed. Harlow & David Lane (eds.) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y. (1988), as well as the references cited therein. Standard reference works setting forth the general principles of immunology include: Klein, J. Immunology: The Science of Cell-Noncell Discrimination, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1982); Dennett, R. et al. Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridoma: A New Dimension In Biological Analyses, Plenum Press, N.Y.

        "The antibody and monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by various methods. One method to obtain antibodies to TnI utilizes purified TnI from an animal species. Bovine troponin complex can be prepared from beef by modifying the method of Ebashi et al. (1971) J. Biochem. 69(2), 441-45, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Generally, after removing fat and connective tissue, muscle tissue is ground and thoroughly mixed. Troponin complex is extracted and TnI, TnC and TnT is fractionated chromatographically, then dialyzed. The purified TnI can be used to immunize mice.",
        "TnI can be purified from any animal, including pigs, sheep, cattle, horse, deer, chicken, turkey, and the like. TnI can be generally prepared from these species by affinity chromatography utilizing the calcium-dependent binding capability of bovine TnC to various TnI. See Syska et al. (1974) FEBS Letters 40(2):253-257, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The purified TnI is then dialyzed and can be used to immunize mice.",
        "Antibodies or monoclonal antibodies made by the above method can be selected by indirect ELISA. In performing the indirect ELISA assays, TnI is bound to a polyvinyl surface.",
        "By the method of the invention described herein, monoclonal antibodies having a desired specificity can be selected. Thus, monoclonal antibodies specific for a particular meat species or for a type or class of meats can be produced.",
        "By meat type or class is intended a broader class of meats including several meat species. Thus, type or class refers to mammalian, avian, poultry, and the like. By meat or meat species is generally intended meats which are commonly used for consumption, including poultry such as chicken, turkey, and duck, and mammalian meats, such as pork, beef, lamb, deer, and horse. Thus, particular meat species include but are not limited to chicken, turkey, duck, pork, beef, lamb, deer, horse, fish, shellfish, and the like. It is recognized that the method of the invention could be utilized to obtain antibodies against any meat species.",
        "The methods of the invention can be used to develop antibodies which are capable of identifying classes of muscle, for example, mammalian verses poultry, as well as to identify the particular muscle species, for example, pig versus chicken. In this manner, the antibodies of the invention are useful for muscle type or class as well as particular muscle species identification. Such antibodies are capable of binding to both cooked and raw meat samples. Thus, these antibodies are useful for identification of meats in both raw and cooked meat samples.",
        "By meat is intended flesh of animals including, but not limited to, chicken, turkey, duck, pork, beef, lamb, deer, horse, fish, shellfish, and the like.",
        "Because the antibodies are both muscle and class specific, they are useful in the detection of species substitution in meats. To facilitate their use, kits containing the antibodies can be made.

        "Results and Discussion",
        "Comparison of Thermostable Skeletal Muscle Protein and Porcine TnI",
        "Correspondence of 24 kD TSMP in raw and cooked pork extracts to the isolated porcine sTnI was elucidated by their concurrent electrophoretic mobility on 2-D gels. Both TSMP and sTnI are strong basic proteins; therefore, the separation included NEPHGE in the first dimension, which permits the separation of basic proteins in capillary glass tubes using conventional carrier ampholytes, and SDS-PA GE in the second dimension. Most of the proteins in the raw muscle extract clustered on the acidic side; only a few proteins migrated to the basic region (FIG. 1A). MAb 5H9 located the presence of the TSMP in the basic region and several isoelectric isoforms of this protein scattered out towards the acidic side. These results confirmed the earlier observation that TSMP consists of several isoelectric variants, which may result from the small fraction of the protein with various degrees of phosphorylation, Chen et al. As shown in FIG. 1B, the MAb 5H9 also revealed the presence of the TSMP in the cooked meat extract at the same location within the basic region as that in the raw meat extract, indicating that the heat treatment did not degrade this protein. In contrast, most of the proteins on the acidic side faded as a result of heat denaturation. In addition, the cooked meat extract contained several basic proteins which were not seen in the raw extract. The presence of these basic proteins can be explained as being a result of fragmentation of larger proteins during heating, as discussed in an earlier paper, Chen et al. (2001) J. Food Sci. 66(6):799-803. As expected, TSMP probed by MAb 5H9 displayed an identical pattern to that seen in the raw muscle extract. Moreover, the isolated sTnI from porcine skeletal muscle showed exactly the same pattern and location as the TSMP seen in the raw and cooked muscle extracts (FIG. 1C). These results clearly indicate the correspondence of TSMP to sTnI, confirming that the 24 kD TSMP present in pork extracts is sTnI. The molecular specificity of MAb 5H9 to porcine sTnI confers the necessary specificity of ELISA for the detection of pork in various cooked meat products, Chen et al.",
        "Specificity of MAb 5H9 to Porcine TnI",
        "The reactivity of MAb 5H9, which is specific to the 24 kD TSMP, to individual components of porcine skeletal troponin (sTnT, sTnI, sTnC) and cardiac TnI, along with TnI from bovine and chicken skeletal muscle, was evaluated by indirect ELISA and immunoblot. From the results of ELISA, MAb 5H9 recognized native porcine sTnI adsorbed on the plastic surface of microtiter plates (FIG. 2). There was no reaction of MAb 5H9 to other skeletal troponin components (sTnT and sTnC) or to the cardiac isoform (cTnI).",
        "Thermal Stability of TnI",
        "Porcine sTnI retained its solubility after various heat treatments (80, 100, and 121\u00b0 C. for 30 min and 126\u00b0 C. for 120 min), as the concentration of sTnI in the solutions remained unchanged (FIG. 2), with a mean=0.101 mg/ml and S.D.=0.0 03 mg/ml among treatments. There was no difference in the ability of MAb 5H9 to recognize heat-treated sTnI as measured by ELISA at three concentration levels (FIG. 3). Also, the heat-treated sTnI showed an identical profile (gels not shown) to that of unheated sTnI on the 2-D electrophoresis (shown in FIG. 1c). These results indicate little change in the solubility and antigenicity of porcine sTnI during heating.",
        "Purification of TnI",
        "Purification of TnI was carried out as described in Example 1, above.",
        "Immunization",
        "Bovine TnI (1.0 mg/ml) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M sodium phosphate and 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 7.2) containing 0.3% of SDS was heated in boiling water for 30 min. Four BALB/c mice (7-10 weeks old) were immunized either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with 150 mg of the heat-treated TnI mixed 1:1 (v/v) with Freund=s complete adjuvant followed by two booster injections at 4-week intervals with 100 mg/mouse of TnI mixed 1:1 (v/v) with Freund=s incomplete adjuvant.",
        "Production of Monoclonal Antibodies",
        "Test sera were collected by tailbleeding 10 days after each injection; the titer of the sera was then determined by indirect ELISA. The mouse exhibiting the highest serum titer to bovine TnI then received a final boost of 100 mg of the antigen in PBS, 4 days before the fusion. After the final booster, the injected mouse was sacrificed, and the spleen was harvested. The general procedures described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) were followed, with modifications as specified. Cells were washed from spleen by wash media (RPMI-1640 serum free medium supplemented with 1% oxaloacetate, pyruvate, and insulin (OPI) containing 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (p/s)) (Sigma). Cells of the murine myeloma cell line, P3\u00d763, Ag8.653, ATCC CRL 1580 were retrieved from liquid nitrogen and cultured in large tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y.). The culture procedure is described in Procedure A (page 31). Spleen cells from the selected mouse were fused with the myeloma cell line (P3\u00d763.Ag8.653., ATCC CRL 1580) at a ratio of 5:1 in the presence of polyethylene glycol (MW 4000). One ml of 50% PEG was gently added to the cells dropwise. After standing for one minute, 30 ml of wash media was added to cells dropwise. The fused cells were resuspended in Hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) selective growth medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% OPI, 1% glutamine, 1% p/s, 1% HAT) (Sigma) and seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates that have been set with mouse thymocyte feeder cells (Kohler and Milstein, 1975). The hybridoma cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 (Napco CO2 incubator model 6300, Tualatin, Oreg.). The medium was changed twice to remove residual antibodies before the initial screening against bovine TnI using indirect ELISA. For a secondary selection, the positive cells from the initial screening were transferred to larger wells and cultured for 3 more days before testing for cross reactivity with TnIs from other species. In this way, hybridomas with distinct reaction patterns to heterologous TnI were selected.",
        "Antibody-producing hybridoma cells of interest were selected and recloned twice by limiting dilution (Campbell, 1991) and the isotypes of the antibodies secreted by the cell lines were determined using the immunoType isotyping kit according to manufacture's manual (Sigma). Cells were diluted with complete growth media (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% OPI, 1% glutamine and 1% p/s) to give a concentration of 0.5 or 1 cell per well. Two hundred \u03bcl of each dilution were plated in each well to 96-well plates seeded with mouse thymocyte feeder cells. The subcloned hybridoma cells were screened using the method described previously.",

When the cells grew heavily in the well, they were expanded to 24-well plate, 12-well plate, small petri culture dish and large petri culture dish, sequentially. When cells grew heavily in the large petri dish, they could be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen (Procedure B, page 32).",

        "SDS-PAGE and Western Blot",
        "Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to resolve the protein extracts of different cooked meat species. Western blot was then carried out to transfer proteins from gel to nitrocellulose membrane and to determine the molecular weights of immunogenic components which reacted with developed MAbs. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (1970) with the following modifications. Proteins were separated on 4% acrylamide stacking gel (pH 6.8) and a 12% acrylamide separating gel (pH 8.8). The protein extracts of different cooked meat species were diluted one-half with sample buffer containing 2% (wt/vol) SDS, 5% (vol/vol) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 60 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 6.8), 25% (vol/vol) glycerol and 0.0001% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue (Laemmli, 1970), boiled for 2 minutes, cooled, and applied to the gel at 10 \u03bcg/well. The gel was electrophoresed at 200 V for 45 minutes using a Protean-II minigel system (Bio-Rad) connected to a power supply (Bio-Rad Model 3000). After electrophoresis, the resolved protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 hour using an electroblotting apparatus (Bio-Rad) in blotting buffer (20 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine, 20% methanol) according to the method of Towbin et al. (1979). Upon completion of the electroblotting, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked by 3% gelatin (Bio-Rad) in PBS for 30 minutes. Following two washes in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) (TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween-20), the membrane was incubated with hybridoma supernatant in antibody buffer (1% gelatin in TBST) overnight at room temperature. The excess MAb was removed by washing twice with TBS, and the membrane was incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted in antibody buffer (1:3000) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing with TBST two times, and an additional wash with TBS, the membrane was incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT) in alkaline phosphatase color development solution (0.1 M, pH 9.5 Tris buffer)(Bio-Rad). The reaction was stopped by washing the membrane in distilled water. The appearance of a dark purple band indicated the antibody binding site. The prestained PAGE broad range standards including myosin (M. Wt. 205,000), \u03b2-galactosidase (M. Wt. 116,500), bovine serum albumin (M. Wt. 80,000), ovalbumin (M.

        "From two consecutive fusions, the overall positive rate was around 10% of the original fusion wells when first screened against bovine TnI. After the supernatant from positive wells was retested against heterologous TnI for cross-species reactivity, several cell lines secreting MAbs with distinct patterns were selected. These MAbs were categorized into three groups according to their reactivities to heterologous TnI (above). The characteristics of these MAbs are summarized in Table 1. The first group includes three MAbs (1F9 and 2G3) which displayed a broad reactivity to all the TnIs from porcine, bovine, ovine, equine, deer, chicken, turkey, duck, goose, ostrich, and catfish.

        "Cell lines secreting IgG were chosen because of its ease of handling and good performance in immunoassay. The isotypes of the MAbs all belong to IgG1.",
        "The use of heat-treated TnI as the immunogen but native TnI for ELISA screening ensures that the selected MAbs, which recognize heat resistant epitopes appearing on both native and heat-treated antigen molecules, are capable of recognizing TnI in both raw and heat-processed muscles. Titer of the MAbs, determined by indirect ELISA as the antibody concentration (ng/ml) at a level of 50% of the maximum binding to a predetermined concentration of bovine TnI, may reflect the relative affinity of the antibodies toward the same antigen, Liddell et al. \u201cCharacterization, purification, and labelling,\u201d A practical guide to monoclonal antibodies, 1991, pp. 105-138, John Wiley, New York. When the titer was compared among the three groups, the MAbs of Group I always showed the highest titer, whereas the MAbs of Groups II and III exhibited only slight differences.",
        "Identification of TnI in Heat Treated Muscles",
        "Species specificity of the MAbs to TnI was further evaluated by immunoblot of muscle extracts from different species separated by SDS-PAGE (not shown). TnI in the extract of autoclaved (121\u00b0 C., 20 min) muscles was revealed by Group I MAbs as a major band around 24 kD for all species including porcine, bovine, ovine, equine, deer, chicken, turkey, duck, goose, ostrich, and catfish. Species specificity of Group II MAbs to mammalian TnI and Group III MAb to ruminant TnI by immunoblotting using muscle extracts (not shown) corresponded with the results of indirect ELISA using isolated TnI (Table 1). Abundance of TnI in skeletal muscles and its solubility after severe heating (121\u00b0 C., 20 min) justify the use of TnI as a suitable marker protein for authentication of species origins of heat-processed muscles. This was confirmed by indirect ELISA testing reactivity of three TnI MAbs to different species of meat that had been heat-treated at 132\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. See FIG. 4. As can be seen, reactivity remains much the same as set out in Table 1.",
        "Current EU wide feed controls have prohibited the use of processed animal proteins to feed animals that are intended for food production. Group I MAbs, which provide broad cross-reactivity among all the species tested, including five mammalian, five avian, and one fish species, would allow the detection of muscle tissues of both territorial and marine animals. Group II MAbs, which differentiate mammalian from poultry and marine species, are capable of detecting the mammalian MBM that, under the new UK regulations, is now prohibited in feed for all farmed livestock. Where porcine and equine proteins are allowed in ruminant feeds, as permitted by the current US regulations, Group III MAb, which reacts with ruminant animal muscles (bovine, ovine, deer), would provide a means to distinguish between prohibited and allowed species. Potential applications of these MAbs in feed detection include an analysis for meat meals, meat and bone meals, animal meal, and other compound feed stuffs containing materials derived from muscle tissues.",

The indirect ELISA assays may not sensitive enough in some circumstances. It is expected that the assay sensitivity could be greatly enhanced (such as 0.1% or less), if sandwich ELISA assays which utilize a pair of these MAbs as specific capture (such as an \u201call species\u201d MAb\u2014for instance, 2G3).",

Food Protection 63(11):1602-1609. Moreover, the method involves a lengthy procedure utilizing ammonium sulfate precipitation to remove gelatin, which interferes with the measurement, and to concentrate proteins, in order to boost the assay sensitivity, Ansfield (1994) Food & Agric. Imm. 6:419-433. The MAb based ELISAs Applicants developed detects specifically muscle TnI without cross-reaction to gelatin, blood/serum proteins and milk proteins (data not shown).

        "Purified TnI, not blood serum proteins (serum albumin), are used as antigens to produce MAbs in this study. The blood proteins are used to raise polyclonal antibodies in commercial raw meat species identification kits. Their quantity in a given sample does not necessarily parallel the amount of the corresponding species meat (Jones and Patterson (1988). Recent Developments in Meat Specification. In Immunoassays for Veterinary and Food Analysis-1, B. A. Morris, M. N. Clifford and R. Jackman (Ed), p. 121-126. Elsevier Applied Science Publishers, London, England). The amount of serum proteins is affected by the residual blood left in the muscle after slaughter (Warris (1977) Meat Sci. 2:155-159). Therefore, the presence of serum proteins does not essentially denote the amount of the corresponding muscle tissue. In contrast to serum proteins, the amount of TnI is proportional to the presence of lean meat. It is suitable to be used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis in meat species identification (Martin et al. (1991) Meat Sci. 30:23-31).",

        "Poultry may be added into pork product due to the similar light color. The unmarketable trimmings of poultry may also be substituted into other red meats. Poultry requires a minimal internal temperature of 71.1\u00b0 C. to kill Salmonella.

Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records, Washington, D.C.). If beef or lamb product contaminated with poultry was not fully cooked, it might cause Salmonellosis. Hsieh et al. (1995) reported that 18% and 38% of ground pork and pork sausage samples analyzed were contaminated with poultry using ELISA, respectively. About 31% of ground beef and ground veal samples was also contaminated with poultry (Hsieh et al. (1995) J. Food Prot. 58:555-559). A high percentage of adulteration with multiple species was also found in the ground pork and ground beef samples. The developed MAb 5G8 can react with three poultry species. Therefore, this MAb could be used in ELISA to detect the presence of poultry as a group in the cooked red meat products in a single test. It would be highly suitable and economical for an initial rapid screening of meat samples. A convenient field test kit could be developed using these MAbs for meat inspectors.",
