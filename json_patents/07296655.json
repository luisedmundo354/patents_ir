    "description": [
        "This application generally relates to an acoustic liner for a duct. More particularly, this application relates to a splice for covering seams in the acoustic liner.",
        "Conventional turbine and turbofan engines for aircraft include a plurality of fan blades that rotate within a duct commonly known as a fan case. The fan case serves as a protective covering to protect the fan blades and the aircraft. Further the fan case channels airflow into the turbine engine. The inner surface of the fan case is constructed to withstand impacts from objects that may come into contact with the fan case and includes acoustical features to reduce the noise emitted from the engine.",
        "It is known to provide a fan case liner with a layer of noise attenuation structures and a face layer including a plurality of openings. The face layer is typically a thin sheet of metal or composite material mounted over the noise attenuation structure. Noise causing pressure disturbances emanate through openings within the face layer into the noise attenuation structure where the pressure disturbances dissipate to reduce the total amount of noise.",
        "The face layer forms the inner surface and typically includes at least one seam to accommodate assembly tolerances as well as accommodating loads generated by thermal expansion. A splice is bonded over the seam to protect the edges of the face sheet and the underlying noise attenuation structure. The splice is typically a solid strip of material that overlaps each side of the face layer. The splice is bonded with an adhesive to the face layer on either side of the seam. The adhesive and splice combine to block openings through the face layer to the noise attenuation structure. Disadvantageously, this results in an acoustically dead area within the liner assembly that does not absorb noise. The acoustically dead area reduces the effectiveness of the noise attenuation structures of the acoustic liner.",
        "Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a splice for an acoustic liner that is acoustically active to improve noise attenuation properties of a liner assembly.",
        "An example fan case assembly according to this invention includes a liner assembly having a face sheet with a plurality of openings. A seam within the face sheet is covered over with an acoustically active splice that includes a plurality of acoustic regions that provide for communication of noise energy through the acoustic splice to the noise attenuation layer.",
        "The fan case assembly includes a housing and a liner assembly. The liner assembly includes the noise attenuation layer that is covered by the protective face sheet. The face sheet includes the plurality of openings that communicate noise energy to the noise attenuation layer. The face sheet protects the noise attenuation layer from objects or other debris that may impact against the liner assembly.",
        "The face sheet is typically a single sheet that is attached over the noise attenuation layer such that an axial seam is formed. An acoustically active splice covers this axial seam to prevent intrusion of objects that may damage the noise attenuation layer. The splice includes a plurality of acoustic regions that are open to the face sheet and the plurality of openings to provide communication of noise energy through the acoustically active splice.",
        "Accordingly, the liner assembly of this invention includes an acoustically active splice for covering a seam within the face sheet that provides for improved acoustical performance of the liner assembly.",
        "These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings, the following of which is a brief description.",
        "FIG. 1 is a partial sectional view of a fan case assembly according to this invention.",
        "FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the fan case assembly according to this invention.",
        "FIG. 3 is a plane view of the acoustically active splice according to this invention.",
        "FIG. 4 is an enlarged view of a portion of the acoustically active splice according to this invention.",
        "FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the example acoustically active splice.",
        "FIG. 6 is an enlarged view of a portion of another example acoustically active splice according to this invention.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a duct for a engine assembly is shown and commonly referred to as a fan case assembly 10. The fan case assembly 10 includes an exterior housing 17 and a liner assembly 12 that defines an interior surface of the fan case assembly 10. The liner assembly 12 includes a noise attenuation layer 18 having a plurality of cells 20. Noise energy passes through a face sheet 22 into the plurality of cells 20 where it is dissipated as heat.",
        "The face sheet 22 includes a plurality of openings 24 that provide for communication of noise energy emitted by the gas turbine engine to the noise attenuation layer 18. The face sheet 22 is a sheet of metal or composite material that is wrapped circumferentially within the fan case assembly 10. The face sheet 22 may comprise a single sheet of material or several sheets. Whether one or many face sheets 22 are utilized, a seam 26 is formed along adjacent edges of the face sheet 22. The seam 26 is formed as a result of assembly stack up tolerances, and to accommodate thermal expansion during operation. An acoustically active splice 30 according to this invention is installed to cover the seam 26 and prevent intrusion of objects and other material to the noise attenuation layer 18.",
        "The noise attenuation layer 18 extends in sections from a cowling 16 of the fan case assembly 10 rearward under the face sheet 22. The noise attenuation layer 18 continues further rearward under an abraidable strip 15 that is disposed adjacent a fan blade 14. The abraidable strip 15 absorbs and protects the fan blades 14 from contact with the liner assembly 12. Another portion of the noise attenuation layer 18 extends further rearward from the abraidable strip under a plate 28. The plate 28 is of material that is thicker than the face sheet 22 and provides impact protection for the liner assembly 12.",
        "An acoustically active splice 30 covers the seam 26 in the face sheet 22. The splice 30 covers the seam 26 and includes a plurality acoustic regions 32. The acoustic regions 32 provide for the communication of noise energy through the splice 30 to the plurality of openings 24 within the face sheet 22. The communication of noise energy through the splice 30 provides an acoustically active seam that absorbs noise energy rather than reflecting it or blocking noise energy from entering the plurality of openings 24 within the face sheet 22 that would create an acoustically dead zone.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the splice 30 includes a center portion 34 that covers the seam 26. Extending outwardly from the center portion 34 is a web structure 36. The web structure 36 includes a plurality of web portions 38 that define the boundaries of the acoustic regions 32. The acoustic region 32 extends from the center portion 34 to define an overall width of the splice 30. The overall width 44 provides a bonding area that is adhered adjacent edges of the face sheet 22 along the seam 26.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the splice 30 provides the open areas in the form of the acoustic regions 32 providing for noise energy to pass through. However, the splice 30 must also include sufficient area on either side of the seam 26 to provide for bonding material to adhere and affix the splice 30 to the face sheet 22. The web portions 38 include a width 42 that minimizes local blockage of the plurality of openings 24, and also combines to provide desired bonding area for securing the splice 30 to the face sheet 22.",
        "Further, the center portion 34 includes a width 37 that is preferably of such a size as to ensure coverage of the seam 26 between ends of the face sheet 22. The center portion 34 is not completely bonded to the face sheet 22 as a portion of the center portion 34 covers a gap 40 formed by the seam 26. The width 37 of the center portion 34 is determined to cover the seam 26 for the extremes of tolerance stack up conditions for a specific application.",
        "The splice 30 includes a tail portion 35 that extends downwardly between and into the seam 26 and adjacent portions of the noise attenuation layer 18. Adhesive 46 is utilized on opposite sides of the seam 26 to adhere the splice 30 over the seam 26.",
        "The acoustic regions 32 are configured as a plurality of repeating triangle shaped openings defined by the web structure 36. The web structure 36 provides the triangle shaped openings as a series of alternating chevrons disposed on either side of the center portion 34. The alternating shapes provide the desired openness to the underlying face sheet 22 while combining to provide desired surface area sufficient for providing a desired bond between with the face sheet 22. Although the acoustic splice 30 as illustrated in the example embodiment as triangular shaped acoustic regions 32 it is within the contemplation of this invention that other shapes of acoustic regions may also be utilized.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6 another example splice 50 according to this invention includes a series of rectangular shaped acoustic regions 52. The acoustic regions 52 are defined by a web structure 56 that extends from a center portion 54. The openness of the acoustic regions 52 provide communication to the underlying noise attenuation layer to provide an acoustically active region that absorbs noise energy to minimize sound emitted from the fan case assembly 10.",
        "Accordingly, the acoustic splice of this invention provides a liner assembly that has substantially improved noise attenuation characteristics due to the substantial elimination of an acoustically dead seam between edges of the face sheet.",
        "Although a preferred embodiment of this invention has been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason, the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention."
