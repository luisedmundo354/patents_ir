        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a far field light microscopical method, system and computer program product for analysing at least one object having a subwavelength size. In particular, it relates to a method to analyse the size and topology of subwavelength sized objects, such objects being in particular polymeric structures and supramolecular complexes composed of several to many units fluorescence labelled with an appropriate number of one or more spectral signatures, or any other fluorescent structures, having a subwavelength size at least in one spatial direction, by using spatially modulated illumination microscopy or other methods providing suitable structured illumination in the object plane, or object volume in combination with special calibration procedures obtained by \u201cvirtual microscopy\u201d based specially designed information technology tools.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Since the work of Abbe and Rayleigh at the end of the 19th century wave theory appeared to impose an absolute limit on the potential of light microscopy as a tool to study the nanostructure of thick transparent specimens such as cells and cell nuclei. In an advanced conventional epifluorescence light microscope or using Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy (CLSM), the optical resolution is limited laterally to about 200 nanometers and to about 1 \u03bcm (CLSM: about 600 nm) in the direction of the optical axis of the microscope system, assuming biologically relevant conditions. The above mentioned conventional optical resolution is the smallest detectable distance between two point like objects with the same optical characteristics (for example of same spectral signature) and is also often characterised by the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the microscopic point spread function. In other words, the Point Spread Function (PSF) is the normalised spatial fluorescence intensity distribution in the image plane obtained of a \u201cpoint like\u201d fluorescent object and the width of this distribution at half the maximum intensity (Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum) is a measure for the optical resolution.",
        "The conventional optical resolution, often in combination with advanced three-dimensional (3D)-deconvolution techniques, is already sufficient to study many important topics, such as of cell biology in general, including e.g. human genome structure on a scale down to 0.2 \u03bcm. For example, using a conventional epifluorescence light microscope, or Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy, it became possible to perform genome wide cytogenetic analysis of all mitotic chromosomes and to identify chromosome band regions down to several Megabase pairs (Mbp) in nucleic acids (DNA) as disclosed in M. R. Speicher, G. S. Ballard, D. C. Ward, Karyotyping human chromosomes by combinatorial multi-fluor FISH: Nature Genet. 12: 368-375 (1996); to visualise in human cell nuclei appropriately labelled chromosome territories, chromosome arm territories and still smaller chromatin domains down to the level of about 1 Mbp of DNA; to identify individual genes, using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) techniques, and to estimate their spatial distribution by using in situ hybridisation methods, especially Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation; to localise in living cells individual DNA sequences, using e.g. lac operator/repressor recognition; to visualise protein and protein/Ribo Nuclein Acids (RNA) complexes related to genome function; to measure the local mobility of individual protein and RNA molecules or other structures, in the nucleus of living cells using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) techniques.",
        "Compared with the typical size of nucleosomes (about 11 nm diameter), of the chromatin loops of individual genes (e.g. 100 kilobase pair (kbp) corresponding to a linear extension of about 100 nm), or supramolecular complexes composed of two or more macromolecules) required for replication, transcription, splicing, repair of DNA (typical size diameter estimates up to several hundreds of nm), for macromolecular transport, protein synthesis, protein degradation, ion transport etc., the light microscopical resolution, revealed in the state of the art, is by far not sufficient to answer many pressing questions of present biological, e.g. human genome structure research. Such problems comprise e.g. the extent of an interchromatin domain space; the relative positioning of specific genes with respect to chromatin domains; the spatial structure and temporal dynamics of specific gene regions; the spatial requirements for accessibility of specific proteins to transcription factor binding sites located in the DNA-sequence; the assembly and disassembly of genome function related supramolecular complexes; the analysis of small changes in the compactness of a specific gene region as a prerequisite or as a consequence of transcription as disclosed in T. Cremer & C. Cremer, Chromosome Territories, Nuclear Architecture and Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells, Nature Reviews Genetics Volume 2, 292-301 (2001); the assembly and disassembly of other complexes important for cellular metabolism. The solution of such problems is not only of scientific but also of practical interest. For example, an improved knowledge of spatial human genome complexes and other supramolecular complexes will be of importance not-only in diagnostic but also in drug design for therapeutic treatments of pathological states such as cancer, or aging related diseases.",
        "In the following, the subwavelength sized biological objects (using visible light as a reference) mentioned above are denoted as \u201cBioMolecular Machines\u201d or BioMolecular Modules (BMM). Here, a BMM is defined as any subwavelength sized collection of interacting biological macromolecules of whatever type (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, fatty acids, etc.). In spherical objects, the word size means the diameter. In non-spherical objects it means the diameter of the minimum enveloping ellipsoid (sphere), or the extension of the object in a defined spatial direction, given for example by twice the half axes of a minimum enveloping ellipsoid. If the extension of the object is determined in the direction of the optical axis of the microscope system, \u201csize\u201d or \u201caxial size\u201d means this extension. A more exact meaning of the word \u201csize\u201d is obtained by Virtual Microscopy (VIM) calculations as described in more detail in the following, referring the word \u201csize\u201d to a specific measurement situation.",
        "In addition to BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, the light microscopical analysis of other macromolecules or interacting collections of macromolecules has important applications, e.g. in polymer analysis. In the following, the word MacroMolecular Complexes (MMC) is used to denote BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules as well as other macromolecules or collection of macromolecules. A colocalization volume or the diameter of the minimum enveloping spherical volume, or the half axis of a minimum enveloping ellipsoid, of a collection of fluorescent but not interacting macromolecules, as well as interacting macromolecules can be determined. For brevity, all procedures described for MacroMolecular Complexes or BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules are applicable also to determine the size of the colocalization volume. For the analysis of such MacroMolecular Complexes, it is highly desirable to increase further the resolution of Far Field Light Microscopy (FFLM). For example, far field light microscopical analysis with increased resolution would allow to study such MacroMolecular Complexes in their physiological or natural environment, such as in the interior of thick transparent specimens as cells and cell nuclei. Due to the relatively low photon energy of light, even analysis in living systems is possible. In polymer research it would allow to study e.g. structures of polymers without any major photonic interaction such as ionising radiation in the case of X-ray, electron beam analysis, or mechanical interaction such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).",
        "For many decades, however, a further resolution improvement in Far Field Light Microscopy appeared to be impossible. Consequently, alternative ways were developed. In particular, X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy allowed further enormous progress in the elucidation of such MacroMolecular Complexes, e.g. of three-dimensional (3D) genome structures and related protein/DNA complexes. In addition, surface related techniques like Atomic Force Microscopy or Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy (NSOM) allowed studies of isolated genome structures at a resolution considerably below 100 nm, i.e. about 4-7 times smaller than the wavelength of visible light usually used in light microscopic studies. These techniques contributed widely to cell biology and medical research in general including genome structure research. Nonetheless, only Far Field Light Microscopy methods would allow the non-destructive study of MacroMolecular Complexes in the interior of thick transparent specimens, in particular BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules in the interior of cells, such as the 3D-architecture of the human genome and its temporal dynamics in the nuclei of morphologically conserved and even living cells. In addition, Far Field Light Microscopy methods of appropriate resolution are useful also where Atomic Force Microscopy and Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy techniques can be applied: since these latest techniques are mechanically interacting due to the \u201ctip scanning\u201d, and since they are rather slow in image formation.",
        "In the past there have been from time to time speculations on how to break the \u201cAbbe limit\u201d of resolution in Far Field Light Microscopy, or in other words light microscopic methods where the distance between the object to be analysed and the first light collecting element of the registration system is typically in the order of 102 wavelengths and more; until recently they were not realised to such an extent that they were really useful in biology or other MMC-analysis. To describe the state of the art, in the following, we shall indicate the relevant recent major developments in Far Field Light Microscopy (FFLM) using fluorescence labelled objects.",
        "Improvements of Optical Resolution",
        "Since the beginning of the 1990's, Far Field Light Microscopical devices were designed and then realised having a highly improved and practically usable optical-resolution. This goal was achieved by using different ways of narrowing the microscopic Point Spread Function. The starting point was the thoroughly calculated theoretical design of a 4Pi microscope where the spatial angle of the incident focusing wave was substantially enlarged, and with the experimental realisation of such a microscope, which is described in detail in S. W. Hell & J. Wichmann, in \u201cBreaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated emission: STED fluorescence microscopy\u201d, Optics Left. 19, 780-782 (1994).",
        "In another approach, a further resolution increasing modulation of the point spread function, called \u201cpoint spread function engineering\u201d, or in other words methods to narrow or modulate the Point Spread Function in a way to increase the optical resolution beyond conventional high resolution confocal microscopy, was achieved by a sophisticated use of Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) in the object (Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy). By such methods, a true optical resolution in the order of \u215b of the exciting wavelength (less than 100 nm) has now already been achieved (T. A. Klar, S. Jakobs, M. Dyba, A. Egner & S. W. Hell, Fluorescence microscopy with diffraction resolution barrier broken by stimulated emission, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 8206-8210 (2000)). Theoretical considerations have been revealed describing the design of a Far Field Light Stimulated Emission Depletion STED-microscope having an optical resolution in the order of 1/40- 1/20 (about 20-40 nm) of the exciting wavelength [S. W. Hell & J. Wichmann, Breaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated emission: STED fluorescence microscopy, Optics Lett. 19, 780-782 (1994).].",
        "Improvements of Topological Resolution",
        "For light microscopical studies of MacroMolecular Complexes and in particular of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, it is important to measure positions and mutual distances (\u201ctopology\u201d) between smaller, fluorescent labelled, parts (\u201celements\u201d) of such complexes (e.g. protein subunits, or nucleic acid sequences or part of them subunits, or positions of other special nucleic acid sequences) with high precision even if they are situated in thick transparent specimens. This allows for example to examine human genome topology in three-dimensionally (3D) intact cell nuclei as described in T. Cremer & C. Cremer, Chromosome Territories, Nuclear Architecture and Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells, Nature Reviews Genetics Volume 2, 292-301 (2001), especially when the elements are labelled with fluorescent markers having different spectral signatures as described in WO 98/28592; DE 19654824.1,. As a consequence, this allows to identify the objects due to their fluorescence life times or excitation/emission spectra. The elements positions and their mutual distances are then determined from their coordinates in the image data file, e.g. with respect to a given cover slip position using the known magnification parameters of the microscopical set up. Using confocal microscopy, a topological distance resolution in the order of about 35 nm laterally (in the object plane) and about 50 nm axially (perpendicular to the object plane) has been achieved in topological studies of human nuclear genome regions described in A. Esa, P. Edelmann, L. Trakhtenbrot, N. Amariglio, G. Rechavi, M. Hausmann, C. Cremer, Three-dimensional spectral precision distance microscopy of chromatin nanostructures after triple-colour DNA labelling: a study of the BCR region on chromosome 22 and the Philadelphia chromosome, J. Microsc. 199, 96-105 (2000)]. Here, \u201cTopological Resolution\u201d (sometime also called \u201cResolution Equivalent\u201d RE) is defined as the smallest distance which can be detected between two appropriately fluorescence labelled elements where these elements have a distance equal or larger than the optical resolution from other elements having a fluorescence label of the same spectral signature (see FIG. 1). Such distance requirements may be realised in different ways e.g. by labelling specific sites in a cell as disclosed in A. Esa, P. Edelmann, L. Trakhtenbrot, N. Amariglio, G. Rechavi, M. Hausmann, C. Cremer, Three-dimensional spectral precision distance microscopy of chromatin nanostructures after triple-colour DNA labelling: a study of the BCR region on chromosome 22 and the Philadelphia chromosome, J. Microsc. 199, 96-105 (2000), or by using nanolithographically produced arrangements as disclosed in DE 100 52 823. Although many biological systems display a considerable flexibility in the topology of their elements, it remains important to further increase the topological resolution since:",
        "It is well known that in small BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules (BMM), such as complexes formed of a few proteins as subunits or \u201celements\u201d only, the distances between the subunits can vary to a very limited extent only, due to the short range interaction of the hydrogen bond and van-der-Waals forces important in keeping the BMM together as a functional unit. Such forces are in the subnanometer interaction range; hence, changes in the nm-range may severely alter the biological integrity or function of such a BMM. For example, a Biomolecular Machine or Module of 30 nm diameter with a ring like arrangement of 20 different elements, such as proteins, would allow 20!=2.4\u00d71018 different topological arrangements with respect to given point and it is highly unlikely that all 2.4\u00d71018 arrangements which differ in topology only by a few nm up to a maximum of 30 nm would all have the same biological function.",
        "It is to be expected that also larger BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules such as proteasomes involved in the degradation of proteins, require a topological precision on the nanometer or subnanometer scale, at least for some of their elements.",
        "Large BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, such as Mbp-chromatin domains containing about 1 Mbp of DNA [T. Cremer & C. Cremer, Chromosome Territories, Nuclear Architecture and Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells, Nature Reviews Genetics Volume 2, 292-301 (2001)], appear to exhibit a much larger degree of flexibility: it is likely, however, that the changes in the degree of condensation (or \u201ccompaction\u201d) of a specific gene region induced by such a flexibility may result in significant changes of functional activity e.g. due to differences in accessibility to macromolecular factors. In this case, a high topological resolution would allow to distinguish different functionally relevant states of the Biomolecular Machine or Module (BMM). From the variance of the structural parameters of such a flexible BMM, elastic parameters characterising the BMM may be determined. Such elastic parameters may be calculated by using appropriate models of BMM. Especially useful in this aspect are quantitative modelling and simulations approaches as disclosed in DE 100 52 583 A1.",
        "Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy allows a nondestructive, high resolution three-dimensional (3D) microscopy of small biological objects, such as individual cells, containing fluorescence labelled targets, with a contrast and 3D-resolution superior to all other light optical far field techniques so far commercially available. Since the introduction of the first Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopes (CLSM's) into biological research in the mid 1980's, numerous studies have used this new microscopic technique also for an improved analysis of the architecture of the cell nucleus.",
        "In the beginning of these studies, One/Two Channel Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy's were used which allowed the simultaneous registration of one or two spectral signatures only; i.e. fluorescence labelling of targets could be performed with two colours. A few years ago, Three Channel Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy's, and more recently, Multi-channel Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy's have been introduced by different manufacturers. Presently, Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopes with 8 channels are commercially available from the principal manufacturers. In special systems, up to 32 channels are used, allowing to obtain full fluorescence emission spectra on a voxel-by-voxel base. In addition, detector systems suitable for fluorescence life time detection are commercially available. Such Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy's systems are equipped with several lasers allowing one and two photon excitation and discriminated spectral registration for almost any fluorophor presently used in cell biological microscopy. As examples for such fluorophores or fluorochrome markers, DAPI, Hoechst, Indo, Fura2, FITC, DTAF, Cy2, DiO, FDA, Lucifer Yellow, Ethidium bromide, TRITC, Texas Red, Hoechst 33258, etc. are mentioned. In particular, a large collection of fluorescent labelling procedures \u201cin vivo\u201d is available, such e.g. an incorporation of fluorochrome conjugated nucleotides or green fluorescent proteins and their variants [GFP, EBFP, EYFP, dsRed [G. Patterson, R. N. Day, D. Piston, Fluorescent protein spectra, J. of Cell Science 114: 837-838]. In addition procedures have been revealed to allow the \u201cin vivo\u201d fluorescent labelling of specific nucleic acid sequences by complementary base pairing, using fluorescent-labelled nucleic acid probes described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,734; WO 98/3723]; specific labelling of proteins can be defined by various procedures, such as e.g. antibody staining, aptamere labelling, amino acid residue modification, as well as by binding to a variety of semiconductor nanocrystals with different spectral signatures may be mentioned.",
        "In this context, \u201cspectral signature\u201d (preferably called also optical marker or an optical marker with a spectral signature in the following) means any photophysical property which can be used for optically discriminated registration; spectral registration means any registration mode allowing to realise this discriminated registration (i.e. registration of the optical response of the object) using e.g. different excitation and/or emission wavelengths, in combination with fluorescent life time detectors polarisation state detectors etc. According to the state of the art, it is feasible to simultaneously use for Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy analysis a maximum of about 16 spectral signatures bound to specific biological structures or other macromolecules. As an example, 8 different spectral signatures may be realised by the use of nanometer sized semiconductor \u201cQuantum Dots\u201d bound closely connected to the specific \u201celements\u201d using for spectral discrimination the narrow fluorescence emission spectra obtained after ultraviolet light (UV) excitation. An additional 8 spectral signatures may be realised by using 4 types of fluorochrome molecules with two different fluorescence life times each. Here, \u201csimultaneous use\u201d is understood to include also sequential illumination within a time frame within the 102 msec range.",
        "As examples for the application of advanced Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy-Spectral Position Distance Microscopy (Spectral Position Distance Microscopy) are mentioned topology problems in the analysis of functional nuclear architecture, such as: the size and spatial distribution of specific chromosome territories, chromosome arm territories, or chromosome band domains; the formation of \u201cFactories\u201d for replication, transcription, splicing, and repair; the arrangement of specific chromosomal subdomains and genes in chromosomal territories; the topological structure of \u201cimprinted\u201d regions where the maternal and paternal genes are differently active; the topological structure of gene regions correlated with the development/progression of cancer; the influence of physical and chemical agents (such as ionising radiation, chemical environmental mutagens) on the topological structure of specific gene regions; the correlation between topological structure and gene expression; the change of topological structure of specific gene regions as a result of cell determination/differentiation; the quantitative analysis of transcription factor binding site accessibility related to a specific gene region; the simultaneous identification of multiple chromosomes (e.g. all chromosome territories in a human or mouse nucleus), chromosomal subregions, and individual gene regions by combinatorial labelling and colocalization analysis.",
        "The information value of the data obtained drastically increases with the number of nuclear targets which can be labelled and identified simultaneously. For example, the independent registration of four spectral signatures allows the simultaneous identification of 15 different nuclear targets at a sufficiently large distance from each other, using 4-colour combinatorial labelling.",
        "An application of 8 channels allows colocalization and topology analysis of 8 different \u201celements\u201d using 8 spectral signatures and 8 independent registration channels, and the simultaneous identification of up to 255 different nuclear targets (again assuming a distance equal or larger than the optical resolution between targets having the same spectral signature), using 8-colour combinatorial labelling as disclosed in DE 100 52 583 A1. Although presently a maximum of 4-7 different spectral signatures is used, fluorescence labelling techniques are advancing with such a speed that the simultaneous use of even 8 and more spectral signatures in nuclear architecture and other studies is expected. For example, using fluorescence lifetime detection in addition to fluorophor discrimination by different excitation/emission wavelengths, the simultaneous registration of 8-16 spectral signatures is feasible from the optical point of view with optical systems at the state of the art. However, one has to consider that with an increase in the number of labelling targets, a full labelling will become increasingly difficult from the preparative point of view. For example, if the probability p for binding to a given target is p0, then the probability ptot for full N spectral signature labelling can be estimated to be ptot=(p0)N e.g N=16 and p0=0.9, ptot=0.2; for p0=0.8, ptot=0.03. In target configurations obtained by combinatorial labelling, this would not be acceptable, while in Spectral Position Distance Microscopy applications, one may select those structures displaying the desired number of spectral signatures. It is expected that the availability of multi-channel instruments will further stimulate the development of multispectral labelling strategies also from the preparative point of view. Analogous labelling advantages may be obtained for any other Biomolecular Machine or Modules or Macromolecular Complexes.",
        "One of the basic problems of quantitative high precision multi-channel Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy studies using continuous wave One-Photon excitation and different excitations is the correct calibration of chromatic aberrations. These problems are considerably diminished if Two-Photon excitation of different dyes at the same wavelength is possible. In this case, the maximum excitation at different wavelengths, of different fluorochromes is in the same optical plane whereas with One-Photon excitation, the maximum excitation normally occurs in different optical planes. For example, applying a Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy with a Two-Photon option using a Ti:Sa laser source with pulses in the 100 femtosecond range together with time-correlated-photon-counting detectors and measuring fluorescent lifetimes at the same emission wavelength allows to eliminate the chromatic aberration completely. Such \u201cFluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy\u201d (FLIM) approaches may be realised also using pulsed laser sources producing One-Photon excitation. In this case, the problem is to identify correctly the objects due to their fluorescence lifetimes. Using appropriate algorithms, at the state of the art a fluorescence photon count in the order of 104 is sufficient to obtain a localisation precision in the nanometer range.",
        "Multi-channel Confocal microscopy is increasingly being used to study different aspects of specific MacroMolecular Complexes, such as nuclear nanostructures. For example, Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy's have been used to allow to determine a colocalization of two objects labelled with different spectral signatures with an accuracy well below the nominal optical resolution (given as the smallest detectable distance between two objects of the same spectral signature). Using visual ovservation, colocalization means that the distance of the two objects is so small that the diffraction images of the objects labelled with different spectral signatures are overlapping. Thus, e.g. in the case of large nuclear protein complexes, it is inferred to be probable that the two labelled objects belong to the same complex. The technique of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measurements allows distance determination at very small distances (below 10 nm), it allows quantitative distance measurements only at specific conditions (such as spectral overlap; specific orientation of the molecular dipoles), and only for a few distances simultaneously. Thus, multispectral Spectral Position Distance Microscopy measurements complement FRET analysis to determine the colocalization of multiple elements or other objects. Generally Spectral Position Distance Microscopy allows to bridge the gap between the FRET range and the nominal optical microscopic resolution. Using visual inspection of the Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy images, however, means that the colocalization error still is in the order of at least \u03b4x=\u03b4y=50 nm laterally and \u03b4z=300 nm axially, due to the uncertainties in visual colocalization and insufficiently chromatic aberration effects. At the state of the art, calibration procedures and digital image analysis algorithms using Spectral Position Distance Microscopy are available which allow to reduce the nuclear colocalization error to about 35 nm laterally and 50 nm axially. If the \u201cColocalization Volume\u201d (Vcol) is estimated by Vcol=(4/3)\u00b7\u03c0\u00b7{(\u03b4x/2)\u00b7(\u03b4y/2)\u00b7(\u03b4z/2)}, then by using Spectral Position Distance Microscopy the colocalization volume is reduced by a factor (50\u00b750\u00b7300)/(35\u00b735\u00b750)=12.2, i.e. by about one order of magnitude. This considerably smaller colocalization volume comes into the order of the enveloping volume of individual large macromolecular complexes (MMCs). Thus, the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy approach to colocalization allows to increase substantially the probability that the colocalization detected indicates indeed a functional individual macromolecular complex. Furthermore, if distances between \u201celements\u201d in a MMC are larger than the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014distance resolution (\u201c topological resolution\u201d, see FIGS. 1, 6), the SPDM method allows topology analysis by multiple measurements of the relative positions and mutual distances of objects labelled with different spectral signatures.",
        "A reference is made to FIG. 1 which shows a schematic example of the optical (FIG. 1A) and topological (FIG. 1B) resolution. In FIG. 1A dor is the smallest distance between any two elements, labelled with the same spectral signature and illustrates the Abbe limit of the optical resolution. In FIG. 1B dtop is the smallest distance between two elements fluorescent labelled with appropriate spectral signature. For example if the elements 1, 2, 3 in a MMC (A) are labelled with different spectral signature, respectively specs 1, specs 2, specs 3 and if the distance D between the equally labelled elements 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6 in a MMC (A) and MMC (B), respectively, is equal or larger than dor, then the positions and the mutual distances of and between elements 1, 2, 3 in MMC (A), and of and between elements 4, 5, 6 in MMC (B) can be determined even if the distances between the elements 4, 5, 6 in MMV (B) are considerably smaller than the optical resolution dor. The example given applies to a labelling strategy where the elements in a given Macro Molecular Complex (MMC) to be analysed have all different spectral signature.",
        "Using a preferred embodiment of the invention presented below, a topological resolution dtop better than the optical resolution dtop<dor can be achieved also in the case two elements in a MMC carry the same spectral signature.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, which shows a schematic example illustrating the limits for topological analysis by SMI. In FIG. 6A the elements 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . N are localized in the interior of a minimum enveloping volume of diameter dtop (dtop is the topological resolution). In FIG. 6B the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . N are localized in a minimum enveloping volume of diameter Dc, such that Dc>dtop. The distances dik between any elements i and k are equal or longer to dtop, so that dik>dtop.",
        "To achieve still better distance determinations and topology analysis with a precision in the nanometer range under biologically relevant noise conditions, methods of Point Spread Function engineering (see FIG. 1) may be used. The technical goal is to modify the Point Spread Function of the microscope system in such a way that a maximum precision of position determination of the object can be achieved by the total fluorescence photon count given. Presently, axial distance measurements between small fluorescent objects approaching the range of a few nanometers and with a precision in the One-Nanometer range are feasible using such methods [M. Schmidt, M. Nagorny & S. W. Hell, Subresolution axial measurements in far-field fluorescence microscopy with precision of 1 nanometer, Rev. Scient. Instr. 71, 2742 -2745 (2000); B. Albrecht, A. V. Failla, A. Schweitzer, C. Cremer, Spatially modulated illumination (SMI) microscopy allows axial distance resolution near the one nanometer range, Applied Optics, in press. 2001]. Theoretical considerations based on Virtual Microscopy computer simulations indicate that using microscope systems with an appropriately modified Point Spread Function, the precision of distance measurements in the few-nanometer range can be improved to the sub-nanometer range, using the fluorescence photon counts available from single fluorophores [B. Albrecht, A. V. Failla, A. Schweitzer, C. Cremer: Spatially modulated illumination microscopy: A new approach to biological nanostructure analysis, GIT-Microscopy, July 2001].",
        "The possibility to measure topology related distances in the nanometer range with a precision in the One-Nanometer range, and better will e.g. allow to discriminate functional from aberrant BioMolecular Machines or Modules: It is known that very small changes in the topology of BMMs may have a major influence on their function. As a scientifically as well as economically important application, this will allow e.g. to better analyse and control topological alterations induced by pharmaceutical drugs under physiological relevant conditions.",
        "In other cases, the topological resolution may be better, i.e. have a smaller value, than the biological variation in the distances encountered, e.g. between two labelled genomic sites on a chromatin fiber in a mammalian cell nucleus. In this case, precise topology measurements will allow to measure the variation in the structural states of these sites, and thus provide important parameters for a better understanding of human genome dynamics. For example, at given distance variations, small changes in the mean mutual distances between genomic sites in a gene region may change the probability of access of such a site to transcription factors or transcription factories and thus play an important role in eukaryotic gene regulation [T. Cremer & C. Cremer, Chromosome Territories, Nuclear Architecture and Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells, Nature Reviews Genetics Volume 2, 292-301 (2001)].",
        "Problems related to the State of the Art",
        "The \u201cstate of the art\u201d methods described above, in a number of applications show several drawbacks which make desirable the additional introduction of new techniques.",
        "For example, an important class of problems and applications in biological and biomedical research relates to the diameter (size) of a colocalization volume or to the diameter (size) of a specific BioMolecular Machine or BioMolecular Module. Examples for this are: the discrimination of functional BioMolecular Machines or Modules in the states of formation, by measuring the colocalization volumes of the elements; the sizes of nuclear pores; of transcription factories; of replication factories; of inactive genes (thought to be generally more condensed), or of active genes (thought to be generally less condensed). In polymer research, an important problem is to measure the size of individual macromolecules in their \u201cnatural\u201d environment. Although electron microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, or Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy offer important possibilities to perform size measurements in the required range (down to the nanometer range), far field light microscopical approaches towards such high resolution size measurements would allow to complement and facilitate such measurements considerably. For example, they can be performed in thick transparent specimens, such as in three-dimensionally intact cells, eventually even in living ones. Similar considerations apply to other BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules and MacroMolecular Complexes.",
        "A \u201ctruly point like\u201d fluorescent object (e.g. one fluorochrome molecule of 1 nm diameter) would result in a diffraction image with the smallest diameter achievable with the microscope system used. This \u201cideal\u201d diffraction image would correspond to the Point Spread Function of the microscope system; its diameter corresponds to the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum [FWHM] of the Point Spread Function. The \u201cideal\u201d diffraction image would be disturbed by larger objects. In fact a larger object can be represented as the superposition of several point like objects each one emitting independently to the others; the larger the object diameter, the larger the deviation from the ideal diffraction image. This means that knowing precisely the Point Spread Function of the system, object diameters even below the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of the Point Spread Function of the system can be determined. Using special procedures like volume conserving algorithms, object diameters down to about half the wavelength of the exciting light (i.e. several hundreds of nanometers) have been determined by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. For Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy this minimum correctly detectable diameter (\u201csize resolution\u201d) was found to be in the order of 200 nm and thus is not sufficient for many of the above mentioned applications in polymer research and in cell biology, especially also in human genome structure research. Using Point Spread Function-engineering with a considerably smaller Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the Point Spread Function, it becomes possible to measure considerably smaller sizes of fluorescent objects.",
        "Using a Stimulated Emission Depletion STED-microscope with a Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of 20-40 nm, it is possible to determine the size of a BioMolecular Machine or BioMolecular Module down to about this value. Using additionally Spectral Position Distance Microscopy methods with appropriate multispectral signature labelling allows topological analysis at the one-to-few nanometer distance resolution, with a precision in the subnanometer range at a moderate fluorescence photon count. This requires the labelling of the BMM with fluorochromes where the STED microscopy can be applied. With these possibilities, STED microscopy opens prospective for the far field light microscopical analysis of fluorescent structures until recently thought to be physically impossible. For example, if 27 (3\u00d73\u00d73=27) \u201cpoint like\u201d fluorescent objects are positioned within the observation volume of a conventional high resolution confocal microscope, labelled with the same spectral signature and have a minimum mutual distance larger than 30 nm, their topology can still be analysed by a STED-microscope with 30 nm Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of the STED-PSF. Such a topological resolution, using one spectral signature labelling, can presently be achieved by no other far field light microscopical method.",
        "Nonetheless, Point Spread Function Engineering approaches by measuring the Point Spread Function as revealed so far have drawbacks in a number of instances which makes it desirable to develop and use additional techniques for far field light microscopical analysis. Since Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy has been revealed to allow the smallest Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum the following remarks are on this technique as the most presently realised, advanced are:",

This applies in particular to \u201cin vivo\u201d labelling schemes using methods of molecular genetic engineering, such as introducing genes for certain variants of \u201cGreen Fluorescent Proteins\u201d (GFPs), i.e. proteins which by appropriate excitation show strong autofluorescence and which presently can be introduced having up to five spectral signatures [G. Patterson, R. N. Day, D. Riston, Fluorescent protein spectra, J. of Cell Science 114: 837-838].

        "Another method to determine the size of a BMM in a range comparable to the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of 4Pi/STED microscopy is Spectral Position Distance Microscopy. For example, if a BMM is analysed consisting of 8 \u201celements\u201d, where all of them are labelled with a different spectral signature, then the size of this BMM is analysed by inserting the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy determined positions of the 8 individual elements into a minimal enveloping sphere or ellipsoid. In addition, if the distance dl between the elements are equal or less than the topological resolution, the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014method in this case will allow to reveal the \u201ctopology\u201d of the BMM (see FIG. 1). Here, Topology is defined as the information concerning the relative positions (with regard to a given coordinate system) and mutual distances of the \u201celements\u201d of a BMM, a MMC, or other complexes. The Spectral Position Distance Microscopy method described allows to determine the enveloping volume of any collection of N elements, as well as the size and the topology of any BMM/MMC consisting of N elements where each of the elements is labelled with a different spectral signature. Drawbacks of the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014method are:",
        "In many cases, conditions for correct size measurements by Spectral Position Distance Microscopy may be difficult to fulfil. For example, a BMM of 100 nm diameter may consist of 16 elements with 8 dimers; each dimer is labelled with a given spectral signature so that the entire BMM is labelled with 8 different spectral signatures; then by using Spectral Position Distance Microscopy, it is only possible (using conventional epifluorescence or Confocal Laser Scanning fluorescence Microscopy) to measure for each dimer the position of the joint fluorescence intensity barycenter (of the diffraction image maximum). If the arrangement of the dimer elements is symmetrical around a symmetry centre, then the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014positions measured will coincide, independently of the actual size of the BMM (which would be obtained only if the 16 elements were labelled with 16 different spectral signatures).",
        "Due to the labelling of more than one element with the same spectral signature (for the example see FIG. 2), the correct topological analysis is greatly impaired. Analogous problems occur wherever it is not possible to label all elements differently, especially where certain symmetries occur. This, however, is the case for many biologically important BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, for example nuclear pores, ion-channels, or proteasomes. Referring to FIG. 2A if all the elements are labelled with different spectral signatures, the SPDM procedure allows to determine the topology (position and mutual distances of the elements 1, 2, 3, 4) also in the case that the mutual distances are smaller than the FWHM. Referring to FIG. 2B, assuming a symmetrical arrangement of the element pairs, each pair labelled with spectral signature specs 1, i.e. the elements 1a and 1b labelled with spectral signature specs 1, the elements 2a and 2b labelled with spectral signature specs 2, the SPDM \u2014determined fluorescence intensity gravity centers or also called barycenter or diffraction image maxima coincide in the center denoted with x independently of the actual diameter of the minimum enveloping volume.",
        "The higher the number of spectral signatures to be used for size or topological analysis, the more difficult the application of the method becomes, both in terms of specific and complete fluorescence labelling, and in terms of spectrally discriminated registration and calibration. Whereas the simultaneous use of 4-7 spectral signatures is still relatively straightforward, a Spectral Position Distance Microscopy analysis of e.g. 16 spectral signatures will be technically very demanding. As a consequence, the lower the number of spectral signatures required to solve a given problem of size or topology analysis, the more facilitated the measurement will be.",

Such objects, respectively MMCs of equal type are for example MMCs composed of the same elements, such as chromatin fibers containing the same sequences, transcription factories of a given type, nuclear pore complexes of a given type, ion-channels of a given type, proteasomes or ribosomes, of a given type, or any other MMCs which cannot be identified specifically by reporter molecules. The linear or two-dimensional arrangement of the MMCs of equal type can be determined by a) bringing the MMCs in contact with a liquid mixture of reporter molecules specific for the equal MMCs, e.g. to one of the elements they are composed of, with N/2 different spectral signatures, the reporter molecules being e.g. fluorescence labelled nucleic acid aptamers, or specific antibodies, or any other type of fluorescence labelling fit to the purpose; b) allowing one reporter molecule bearing one spectral signature to be bound to each MMC only; c) identifying by far field light microscopical means the MMCs labelled in the way useful for the application of the invention. Such a \u201cueful\u201d MMC labelling is characterised by displaying the signals of N/2 different spectral signatures within the observation field or observation volume given by the optical resolution, each spectral signature intensity not being larger than twice the intensity displayed by one equal element bound to a reporter molecule with this spectral signature; d) performing the analysis as described in one or several of the previous claims. In particular, the claim refers to linear, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional arrangements having not more than 14 equal MMCs in the observation field/observation volume given by the optical resolution. For example assuming as an estimate for the probe density P of a \u201cuseful\u201d MMC labelling P\u2267{(N/2)!}2/{(N/2)N}, P(N=14)\u22673.7*10\u22125 follows, using e.g. nanolithographically produced arrangements as disclosed in DE 100 52 823 included herein by reference, even such a low probability can be handled advantageously: in such a nanolithography produced pattern of MMCs, in one far microscopical field of view, e.g. of an SMI/SI microscope, up to about 104 MMCs can be arranged in such a way that the SMI/SI measurements can be performed. Since evaluation procedures are executable in a fully automatic way, the analysis of 104 or more MMCs technically is feasible. The lower N, the higher the probability of a useful MMC labelling e.g. P(N=12)\u22672.4*10\u22124, P(N=10)\u22671.5*10\u22123, P(N=8)\u22670.8*10\u22123, P(N=6)\u22670.05, P(N=4)\u22670.25. For example, if in the deconvolution volume 8 MMCs are found, about 1% of MMCs will have a useful labelling, displaying N/2 each with a different spectral signature. Such a condition may apply e.g. to the distribution of cell nuclear pair complexes in a membrane. Since the nuclear membrane of a cell may contain a total of several thousands of such nuclear pore complexes, even analysing the nuclear pore complexes in one cell only, a number of \u201cuseful\u201d labelling according with the claim may be found. In addition, all MMCs not fulfilling this complete \u201cpair wise labelling\u201d condition but displaying spectral signature intensities corresponding in one or more cases to the labelling of a single element in a MMC only, may be used to obtain information in particular on the size of the elements labelled.",
        "In still a further embodiment, the far field light microscopical method may be used to determine the distances between equal MMCs if this distance is smaller than 300 nm. This can be performed for example by a) bringing the MMCs in contact with a liquid mixture of reporter molecules specific for the equal MMCs, e.g. to one of the elements they are composed of, with a number of different spectral signatures; the reporter molecules being e.g. fluorescence labelled nucleic acid aptamers, or specific antibodies, or any other of fluorescence labelling fit to the purpose; b) allowing only one reporter molecule bearing one spectral signature to be bound to each MMC; c) identifying by far field light microscopical means in the SMI/SI-fluorescence intensity diffraction images pairs of MMCs labelled with the same spectral signature, and occurring once only in the light microscopic observation volume; this selection is possible by selecting those images which have the fluorescence intensity fitting to a pair; d) performing the analysis for size and topology as described in the previous claims. If the modulation contrast R is too low to allow a proper distance analysis, the excitation wavelength is changed accordingly. Basic combinatorial considerations show that using a proper number of different spectral signatures, such as 4 or 5 or 6, a considerable percentage of MMCs within the volume consists of pairs with a given spectral signature, allowing size and topology measurements.",
        "According to another embodiment of the present invention, the step of labelling comprises labelling in the object a plurality of linear sequence arrangements of elements L1s1s2s3 . . . sn; L2s1s2s3 . . . sn; L3s1s2s3 . . . sn; LNs1s2s3 . . . sn, such that si, i=1, 2, . . . ,n, is realised either by an element S0 representing the binary code 0, or by an element S1, representing the binary code 1 and wherein\n\n    \n    \n        the element S0 binds to a first optical marker, the element S1 binds to a second optical marker and the starting element L1 binds third optical marker, the starting element L2 binds to a fourth optical marker, etc.;\n        the individual sequence arrangements have a mean distance from each other larger than or equal to the optical resolution of the optical system used for analysis;\n\nthe far field light microscopical method further comprising the step of determining the at least one-dimensional sequence arrangement, the size and the topography of the linear sequences.",
        "Preferably, the far field light microscopical method according to still another embodiment may be used to determine the sequence arrangement in a Bar-Code type linear sequence, preferably in a DNA-\u201cBar Code\u201d or any other Polymer \u201cBar Code\u201d or MMC \u201cBar Code\u201d.

The starting element L2 is constructed in such a way that it binds specifically to a spectral signature 4, etc. Appropriate starting elements can be constructed in the same way as S0 and S1. d) The sequence arrangements L2s1s2s3s4s5 . . . sn are displayed in whatever medium designated for identification in such a way that the individual sequence arrangements have a mean distance from each other larger than or equal to the optical resolution of the SMI-system used for analysis, in particular a mean distance either larger than 200 nm in the lateral (x,y) direction, or larger 1 \u03bcm in the axial direction. This can be achieved by using an appropriate dilution. e) For Bar Code analysis, the sequence arrangements are subjected to labelling with reporter molecules with spectral signatures specific for L1, L2, . . . , and S0 and S1, respectively. The topological analysis according to the invention is performed as described above, with the exception, that in this case, more than two elements s1s2 . . . can be labelled with the same spectral signature. In cases with not more than 5 elements s1s2s3s4s5 . . . , the topological analysis of size and fluorescence intensity barycenter position by application of the invention allows to determine unequivocally whether a given element si at a given position i represents S0 (for binary code \u201c0\u201d), or S1 (for binary code \u201c1\u201d d) Sequence arrangements labelled with L1 represent the binary code for the first 5 binary digits for decimal numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . 31; two types of sequence arrangements labelled with L1 and L2, respectively, represent 10 digits of the binary code, allowing the encoding and detection of decimal numbers from 1 to 1023, the encoding being done in such a way that the first 5 binary digits are encoded in the sequence arrangement starting with L1, and the following 5 binary digits are encoded in the sequence arrangement starting with L2; three types of sequence arrangements labelled with L1 for the first 5 binary digits, with L2 for the second 5 binary digits, and with L3 for the third 5 binary digits allow the encoding and detection of decimal numbers from 1, 2, 3 . . . , 215\u22121=32767; four types of sequence arrangements labelled with L1 for the first 5 binary digits, with L2 for the second 5 binary digits, L3 for the third 5 binary digits, and L4 for the fourth 5 binary digits allow the encoding and detection of decimal numbers from 1, 2, 3 . . . , 220\u22121=1048575\u2248106, etc. Using the invention according to one or several of the previous claims together with this kind of label procedure, about 1 Million decimal numbers may be encoded using 6 spectral signatures for light microscopical detection according to the invention.

First a SMI/SI registration of the axial intensity distributing in for example x, y and/or z direction is performed, followed by determining the size of the enveloping ellipsoind, i.e. the size in z direction Sz and in x, y direction Sxy.",
        "Spectral Signature is any photophysical feature of an object by which it can be identified by appropriate detector systems, such as absorption/emission wave lengths, fluorescence life time, polarisation etc.",
        "Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI) microscopy is a far field light microscopy method where a \u201cstanding light wave field\u201d is produced in the object plane by crossing two collimated laser beams emerging from the front lenses of two opposing high numerical aperture objective lenses.",
        "Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy (SPDM): At a given optical resolution, mutual positions and distances between \u201cpoint like\u201d or small objects can be determined with an error considerably smaller than the optical resolution if a) all objects to be measured and located within the same observation volume carry different spectral signatures; b) the diffraction images obtained from the different spectral signatures are registered independently from each other; c) the maximum of the diffraction image intensity distribution, or its fluorescence intensity barycenter, or another parameter describing the geometrical position of the diffraction image of the object, is determined by quantitative image analysis; d) where necessary, the positions obtained in c) are corrected for chromatic and other aberrations.

        "According to one embodiment of the invention, a relevant property of a Spatially modulated illumination light microscope or SI microscope is that the excitation light forms an interference \u201cfringe pattern\u201d in the object space. Thus, all methods of structured illumination are suitable for the present invention which allow a \u201cstanding wave field\u201d illumination or otherwise structured illumination in the object space, providing either intensity modulated illumination in the direction of the optical axis (z), or in any direction parallel to the object plane (x,y), or both, or in a given angle to object plane and optical axis, respectively. Preferably, a spatially modulated or structured illumination is used which produces in at least one spatial direction in the object space an extended or localised modulated light intensity pattern, i.e. a \u201cfringe pattern\u201d, with at least three of such fringes having an intensity maximum above background noise level, the fringes having a Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (Full-Width-at-Half-Maximumf) considerably lower than the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of the epifluorescence PSF FWHMEPI of a microscope system with lens objectives of same or different Numerical Aperture, excitation and detection wavelengths. At least two fringes adjacent to the fringe with the maximum intensity are assumed to have peak intensities of at least 30% of the maximum. Methods to realize this have been described in the above cited writings and are regarded to be relevant for the technical basis of the invention, but as such do not form a part of it. Experimentally, the fringe pattern may be determined by using an appropriate \u201cpoint like\u201d object excited to fluorescence by the excitation field, i.e. an object with a diameter considerably smaller than the FWHMf, allowing a maximum of modulation contrast of the fluorescence image detected.",
        "Preferably, the structured illumination is a Spatially modulated illumination along the optical (z) axis and further preferably, a specific case of an axial Spatially modulated illumination excitation field. Similar procedures for the other types of modulated illumination are obvious for any specialist trained in the art.",
        "To achieve spatially modulated illumination in the z-direction, a collimated and vertically polarised beam of coherent light may be focused into the back plane of two opposite objective lenses after it is split in a Mike Zender interferometer. This configurations generates, between the two objective lenses, a standing wave-field configuration characterised by sin2 fringe intensity patters along the optical axis (z). The advantage of this system is that the emission light intensity distribution is modulated by oscillation fringes. Since this modulation is highly sensitive to the axial extension of the object excited to fluorescence, this will make it possible to obtain, with the help of specially designed information technology tools making part of the invention, quantitative information's about the size of the object along z even if this size is considerably smaller than the excitation wavelength. The fact as such has been noted previously [B. Bailey, D. Farkas, D. Taylor & F. Lanni, Enhancement of axial resolution in fluorescence microscopy by standing-wave excitation, Nature 366, 44-48 (1993)] in a qualitative statement. However, so far no attempt has been described to use this fact for the quantitative analysis of subwavelength sized fluorescent objects. Preferably, the invention can be applied to all MacroMolecular Complexes, in particular BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, a) which are appropriately fluorescence labelled to allow the registration of a sufficient number of fluorescence photons, if necessary in a spectrally discriminated way, and b) which have a minimum distance of a neighbouring object or element fluorescence labelled in the same way, this distance corresponding at least to the optical lateral (x,y) resolution, or at least to the axial (z) optical resolution. For example, using a system with objective lenses with a numerical aperture of 1.4 and light in the wavelength range of 360-800 nm, this means that two MacroMolecular Complexes labelled with the same spectral signatures have to have either a lateral (x,y) distance of at least 200 nm from each other, or an axial (z) distance of at least 600 nm from each other. Where this latter condition cannot be fulfilled, methods of narrowing the Point Spread Function according to the above described state of the art have to be applied. However, the minimum distance requirements mentioned in many cases do not severely impede the range of applications of the invention, since the specimens containing the MacroMolecular Complexes and in particular the BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules to be analysed can often be prepared in a way fulfilling these requirements. For example, if in a mammalian cell nucleus of a diameter of 10 \u03bcm only a few nuclear sites with a size smaller than the observed volume VOBS and located on different chromosome territories, are labelled with the same spectral signature then this condition is easily fulfilled. In cases, where only two objects of the same spectral signature are located within the observation volume VOBS=(4/3)\u03c0(FWHMxFWHMyFWHMz)/(8). In special cases, techniques can be applied which allow by special labelling and selection schemes to measure even the distance between MacroMolecular Complexes of the same type, or the topology of \u201cequal\u201d elements within such MacroMolecular Complexes, being located in the same observation volume.",
        "Basic Concept of Spatially Modulated Illumination-Virtual Microscopy (SMI-VIM).",
        "Virtual Microscopy (VIM) is based on computer simulations of the structure to be studied, using a set of assumptions including labelling schemes. The computer data sets are convoluted with the PSF of the microscope system used for the registration of corresponding experimental data, adding appropriate noise conditions as well as other condition describing the imaging process. The virtual microscopy data obtained may be analysed in the same way (e.g. especially using digital image analysis tools) as the experimental data. The results of the virtual microscopy data can then be directly compared with the experimental results. Deviations between model predictions and experimental results can be used to refine the model.",
        "Under the above mentioned minimum distance requirements, the basic concept to determine the diameter (\u201csize\u201d) of small fluorescent objects considerably below the optical resolution of advanced microscope systems (about 500-600 nm in axial direction under conditions relevant in routine applications) is to calibrate the disturbance of the modulation of the Spatially modulated illumination/Structured Illumination (SMI/SI) fluorescence intensity diffraction image as shown on FIG. 7, which illustrates the determination of the corresponding size on x, y, z direction or any other direction desired. On FIG. 7, the x, y and z are the spatial coordinates. In the actual measurements the intensity is measured at least along one spatial coordinate. Referring to FIG. 7, first a step of measurement of the optical response, i.e. SMI/SI registration of the intensity distribution in for example direction x, y, and/or z, of objects with different sizes is performed. Here, the optical response of objects with size d1=10 nm, d2=20 nm and d3=40 nm is shown. Subsequently a step of determination of the modulation contrast and a step of determination of corresponding size in x, y, z direction (or any other direction desired) using evaluation procedure according to any of the embodiments of the invention are performed.",
        "To determine the size, an extended fluorescent MMC, e.g. a BMM, or any other \u201cextended fluorescent object\u201d is represented as the superposition of several \u201cpoint like\u201d preferably fluorescent objects, each one emitting light independently with respect to the other. Still further preferably the invention described below may also be used to discriminate a \u201cpoint like\u201d object from an \u201cextended object\u201d.",
        "The resulting fluorescence intensity distribution in the image plane of one or more objective lenses used to realise the modulated illumination, is the incoherent sum of the contributions of each point like object, each contribution corresponding to a Spatially modulated illumination-Point Spread Function (SMI-PSF) located at the respective position. FIGS. 8A and 8B show in more detail the principle of determination of size and topology of an object, e.g. a MMC, wherein (xi, yi, Zi), Ri, Si are respectively the position, the modulation contrast and size of the i-th element. In FIG. 8A all the elements 1, . . . 6 are labelled with the same spectral signature. Then the step of registration of the intensity distribution in any desired direction (for example x, y, z direction) is performed followed by a step of evaluation of the size of the MMC in the desired direction (for example x, y, z). In FIG. 8B each of the elements 1, . . . , 6 is labelled with a different spectral signature (specs). Thus i-th element, i=1, . . . , 6, having coordinates (xi, yi, zi) element, is labelled respectively with specs i (i.e. with a i-th optical marker). Then the step of spectrally discriminated SMI/SI and optical correction detection is performed, wherein the intensity distribution in a desired direction (for example in x, y, or z direction) of the light from each of the object is independently recorded.",

        "The Spatially modulated illumination-Point Spread Function (SMI-PSF) is defined as the appropriately normalised axial (z) intensity distribution in the image plane obtained using a \u201cpoint-like\u201d fluorescent object. In the present description, the \u201cpoint like\u201d object may be represented by an object of e.g. 10 nm diameter, whereas an MMC represents a specimen whose axial diameter size (S) starts to be comparable with the FWHMf of the individual fringes of the SMI-PSF. The application to other sizes of \u201cpoint like\u201d objects is obvious for anyone trained in the art. Thus, for the purpose of size determination, a MMC can be replaced by several fluorescent point-like objects (an ensemble), each e.g. having a size s0 equal to 10 nm. Following this scheme, it is possible to represent the Axial Fluorescence Intensity Distribution (AID) in the image plane of this ensemble as the incoherent superposition of axial Point Spread Functions. For more details see Example 2 and FIG. 12.",
        "Preferably, any size which is considerably smaller than the FWHM of the individual or secondary fringes (FWHMf) according to the invention. Further preferably, for the sake of a clear description, here the size of the constituent point like objects are fixed to 10 nm. The number of \u201cpoint-like\u201d objects and their distances from each other represent the size of the MMC formed by these constituent \u201cpoint like\u201d objects (see Example 2). For example, the maximum distance measured between two elements of a MMC corresponds to the diameter of the minimum spherical enveloping volume, i.e. the colocalization volume (see FIG. 3).",
        "With respect to FIG. 3, a colocalization error \u03b4x=\u03b4y=\u03b4z=\u03b4xyz means that the mutual distance between all the fluorescent labelled objects 1, 2, 3, . . . N [for example labelled respectively with specs 1, specs 2, specs 3, etc] are equal or smaller than \u03b4xyz. Frequently they may be enclosed by an enveloping volume of a diameter \u03b4xyz. (in case of different \u03b4x, \u03b4y, \u03b4z the colocalization volume is given by an appropriate ellipsoid volume). The smallest detectable distance between two objects (for conditions see FIG. 1) is dtop. Thus the minimum detectable colocalization error is equal to dtop.",
        "Increasing the number of \u201cpoint like\u201d objects with a given distance, the size of the MMC formed increases and the modulation of the axial intensity distribution decreases. The size range that can be evaluated for each excitation wavelength (\u03bbex) is limited. In fact, it is not possible to recognize any differences in the axial intensity distribution for sizes smaller than about 20 nm and larger than about 190 nm, using a \u03bbex=488 nm for the Spatially modulated illumination pattern assumed (see the following section). In the case where the MMC size approximately corresponds to two times the FWHMf of the individual fringes, the axial intensity distribution does not present any useful modulation.",
        "The size range discussed above depends on the fringe Full-Width-at-half-Maximum Point Spread Function (FWHMf PSF) of the fluorescence collecting objective lens being directly related to the numerical aperture of the objective lens, and to the excitation wavelength \u03bbex. A still another preferred embodiment of the invention, uses invention related information technology tools to determine the object diameter size along the optical axis (z) in a quantitative way, and how it depends on the fluorescence photon count conditions. To describe the basic content of the invention, the conditions shown in Example 1, 2, respectively FIGS. 11, 12 are assumed. To obtain the AID of the object, the individual axial intensity distributions of the constituting point like objects were summed up. Note that for a better schematic representation, the axial intensity distributions of the constituting point like objects in Example 1 are not represented in scale. The resulting AIDs are shown on the right in FIG. 11, respectively FIG. 12.",
        "It is obvious that the modulation contrast R strongly depends on the object size (see Example 2, 3 and respectively FIGS. 7, 12, 13). In particular, a preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a method to determine R as a function of the size of the MMC, or any other subwavelength sized fluorescence labelled object, and \u03bbex using information technology approaches, under given boundary conditions of excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, FWHMf, FWHMEPI, FWHMSMI, further preferably the FWHM of the Point Spread Function of the system, numerical aperture of the objective lenses, total number of fluorescence photons registered for a given spectral signature, adaptation function used, noise other then photon noise etc. For an example of the influence of the total number of detected photons see Virtual Microscopy Example 1.",
        "For the modulation contrast determinations as a function of object size, three dimensional (3D) digital axial intensity distributions (AIDs) produced by Spatially modulated illumination-virtual microscopy can be used.",
        "In a first virtual microscopy computational experiment, the voxel size of each image was 100 nm\u00d7100 nm\u00d720 nm. Here, the projection on the z axis of the 3D axial intensity distribution was calculated. The axial diffraction image intensity distributions (AID) of extended objects symmetrically positioned with respect to the axial Spatially modulated illumination fringes were analysed. Furthermore, here it was assumed that 3D distances (D) between an extended object and its nearest neighbour of the same spectral signature was D>>FWHMSMI, where FWHMSMI denotes the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of the envelope of the Spatially modulated illumination-Point Spread Function (SMI-PSF), corresponding to the FWHM of the detection PSF. This FWHMSMI can be approximated by connecting the maxima of the individual fringes in the SMI-PSF.",
        "To obtain the desired relationship between object size and modulation contrast, it was analysed by Spatially modulated illumination-virtual microscopy (SMI-VIM) how the axial intensity distribution (AID) changed on variation of the object size. Here, this object size was defined as the maximum distance between the axial positions of two or more constituting \u201cpoint like\u201d objects representing the axial extension S of the extended object to be analysed, in particular a MMC or more specifically, a BMM. It was found that the modulation contrast of the AID decreased with increasing size S. The basis of a quantitative determination of the size consisted on the study of the relation between the maximum of the sinc2 envelope and the size of the specimen. In particular, the size dependent variation of this relation was analysed, changing S, The modulation factor R between the total intensity maxima M and the maxima of the sinc2 envelope was determined by SMI-VIM (see above), taking into account optical aperture, exciting wavelength, refraction index as well as fluorescent photon count statistics. A first example for the calculation of a calibration curve by Spatially modulated illumination-VIM according to preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in Virtual Microscopy Example 3, assuming \u201cideal\u201d optical conditions (see Example 1, 2 assuming the absence of noise).",
        "In a first application, the modulation contrast R was studied for the excitation wavelengths \u03bbex=360 nm, 488 nm, 564 nm and 647 nm. For each excitation condition, the factor R was computed as a function of the size S of the extended object representing, e.g. a BMM. In this case, the AID was calculated as the axial projection of the 3D convolution product between a Gaussian-like \u201cpoint like\u201d object (Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum of intensity=FWHM0, and the Spatially modulated illumination-PSF. In this description, extended objects asymmetrically positioned in the fringe patterns of the modulation illumination where not further considered. For an execution example according to the invention see Spatially modulated illumination-VIM Example 3 and FIG. 13. A test function G(z) was used, extracting information's from the axial intensity profile, in order to evaluate S. The test function, based on a least square algorithm, is described in the attachment (Example 1, 2).",
        "In Example 3, R is given as a function of the extended object size S, corresponding to the axial diameter. As an example, R is shown for \u03bbex=488 nm. For simplicity, also the emission wavelength \u03bbem of the excited fluorescence was set to \u03bbex. In principle, such a condition can be experimentally obtained by e.g. using fluorescence life time microscopy [P. P. Kerten, P. Tinnefeld, M. Sauer: Identification of single fluorescently labelled mononucleotide molecules in solution by spectrally resolved time-correlated single-photon counting. Appl. Physics B 71: 765-771 (2000); P.

        "In Example 4, respectively FIG. 14, the above mentioned relation R=R{S} is represented for four different wavelengths. In a certain size range, being different for different excitation wavelengths, assuming else constant conditions, R=R{S} increases strongly with the axial size of the object. For a special case see Example 3, 4. In case a spherical object is assumed, this corresponds to the diameter of the object in all directions.",
        "In a limited range it is possible evaluating S to determine the axial object size graphically or within certain limits, with the help of a linear approximation function. This range, as it is expected, depends on the fringe Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum, FWHMf, and varies by changing the excitation wavelength. For object diameters under 20 nm and above 180 nm, no significant changes of the parameter R were detected under the assumptions used in Example 3 (\u03bbex=488 nm).",
        "The fit parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 (for definition see Example 5) were evaluated using all the above cited excitation wavelengths. The resulting means and their standard deviation values are given by the equation described in the Example 5.",
        "In a second application, using the four calibration functions R=R{s} above described, the analytical function R=R{s, \u03bb*ex} was calculated, where \u03bb*ex is a parameter called effective wavelength (see Example 6). The effective wavelength of an Spatially modulated illumination/Structured illumination (SMI/SI) microscope takes into account all the variations of the refraction index; furthermore, in the case of the SMI microscopical device it takes into account the tilting angle between the beams and the optical axis (z) and the camera acquisition axis. To facilitate size and topology measurements according to the invention, in the case of different excitation wavelength, the optical conditions, in particular the tilting angles of the exciting laser beams, may be chosen in such a way that the effective wavelength \u03bb*ex for modulation contrast R determination is equal for the different excitation wavelength.",
        "After testing several functions, in order to fit three in the example given (the calibration functions concerning \u03bbex=360 nm, \u03bbex=568 nm and \u03bbex=647 nm) of the four calibration functions, one closed analytical expression, (described in the examples), characterised by three parameters depending only on \u03bb*ex, was chosen. For each parameter, several fitting functions were tested varying the effective excitation wavelengths. In the case shown here, the effective wavelength (see example 3) coincided with the excitation wavelengths. Then for each parameter the explicit dependence on \u03bb*ex was determined, and this relation was placed inside the expression R=R{s, \u03bb*ex}. As a prove of the validity of the algorithm implemented, a comparison between the fourth calibration function measured by virtual microscopy (\u03bbex=488 nm), and the one obtained plotting R=R{s, \u03bb*ex=488 nm} was made. The two calibration functions, in different ways evaluated, were in good agreement as shown by the Example 6 and FIG. 16. In this way a fast and high precision algorithm to determine the relation between the object size S and the modulation contrast R was developed, allowing the user to determine such a relation for all the experimentally realised and detected effective wavelengths.",
        "A plot of several calibration functions obtained using the previous relation is shown in Example 7 and FIG. 17.",
        "A major obstacle to high resolution light microscopical analysis of small fluorescence objects in biological or individual polymer applications is the low number of detected fluorescence photons; therefore, preferably an important part of the invention relates to a method to determine the influence of photon noise on the size measurements. To achieve this, extensive Spatially modulated illumination-virtual microscopy simulations of the effect of photon count noise were performed.",
        "To illustrate further the invention, examples for four different excitation wavelengths (in four independent detection channels), \u03bbex=360 nm; =488 nm; =588 nm; =647 nm were executed. For details see Example 8 and FIG. 18. The application to any other excitation wavelength, refraction index, numerical aperture of the fluorescence collecting objective lenses, number of channels, monochromatic and chromatic aberrations, number of photons and other optically relevant parameters, registered is obvious for anyone trained in the art, using the invention. The Spatially modulated illumination-VIM simulations allow to estimate the theoretical limits of size measurements in the different channels. In each channel, 3D diffraction image intensity distributions were produced for extended objects of a given size S. The total number of detected photons was fixed to be Ntot=10,000. Before performing image analysis of the virtual data, appropriate Poisson noise was added to the 3D intensity distribution of the object; for each specimen, 40 different acquisitions were made.",
        "In addition, two other conditions were studied: In the first, the excitation wavelength \u03bbex and the emission wavelength \u03bbem were assumed to be the same; in the second condition, a difference between the excitation and the emission wavelength was assumed. It is obvious for anyone trained in the art to use also other differences as those shown here, applying the invention. In Example 9 and FIG. 19, a comparison is shown between an ideal calibration function (compare Example 3, 4) and the result obtained under the non ideal photon count condition described above for the case in which the emission and excitation wavelength were considered to be different. The large bars represent the region where the variability of R is high, due to slight instabilities in the calculation of the adaptation function. Obviously, these instabilities do not impair the usefulness of the calculation mode used.",
        "In Example 10, the results of the virtual Spatially modulated illumination-microscopy for R=R{S} assuming that excitation wavelength and emission wavelength are equal, are listed in Table 1 for the wavelengths 360 nm; 488 nm; 568 nm; 647 nm, and Ntot=10,000 photons. For each wavelength, the axial sizes were determined from R a) using the graphical visualisation of the calibration function columns A (see Example 3, Example 4,) b) using the analytical calibration function columns B (with the help of a set of programs described below, with the application Examples 6, 7) or c) using the linear approximation formula columns C (see Example 5). As expected, the accuracy in evaluation depends on the \u201ctrue\u201d size S of the extended object that is evaluated, and even more on the wavelength used. As the \u201ctrue\u201d size of the object in the Spatially modulated illumination-VIM microscopy simulations the size value assigned as the starting point of the calculation was assumed. For each excitation wavelength, the accuracy of the size evaluation was better in the region where the graph was fairly well approximated by a linear fit function. This region changes for different excitation wavelengths. Using lower excitation wavelengths and the non-linear calibration mode, \u201ctrue\u201d extended object sizes/diameters S as low as 20 nm were detected with an error (standard deviation) of a few nanometers for the conditions assumed in the example. Using a linear approximation calibration mode, \u201ctrue\u201d extended object sizes/diameters S down to about 40 nm were correctly detected by the Spatially modulated illumination-evaluation procedure. Using longer wavelengths, \u201ctrue\u201d extended object sizes/diameters S up to about 200 nm were correctly determined.",
        "Examples 11, 12 and 13, respectively FIGS. 20, 21 and 22 show the relationship obtained between \u201ctrue\u201d size/diameter St and detected size S determined according to any of the embodiments of the invention. Example 11 describes the relationship for the excitation wavelengths 360 nm, 488 nm, 568 nm, 647 nm and a total number of 10,000 registered photons, using the analytical calibration function and the related inversion software; in Example 12, for the same conditions as in the previous example, a direct evaluation of the calibration functions determined (see Examples 3,8) was studied. Example 13 shows the relationship under the same conditions as in Example 11 and 12, but calculated using the linear approximations. The most simple correlation between \u201ctrue\u201d size St and \u201cevaluated\u201d size S is given by the continuous straight line, using the linear approximation mode. The vertical bars indicate the standard deviation obtained under the assumption of a Poisson noise corresponding to a total number Ntot=10,000 of fluorescent photons detected for each object. For each excitation wavelength, the range where the linear approximation can be used successfully is given by the region with small size error bars. It is obvious for any one trained in the art to insert other noise distributions in the virtual Spatially modulated illumination-microscopy calculation, e.g. an appropriate combination of Poisson noise and camera read out noise.",
        "After the evaluation of the parameter R was made, the size computation was performed using the analytical calibration function (see Examples 6, 7) and using the Virtual Microscopy calibration function (see Examples 3,4), given in the Table 1 in Example 10 in the left and in the center column, respectively; or the linear approximation formula (Example 5) was used, given in the Table 1 (Example 10) in the right column.",
        "Example 14, respectively Table 2 shows the results of a size determination under the condition of a difference between the excitation wavelength and the corresponding emission wavelength: \u03bbem=\u03bbex+100 nm. A comparison of the results of Example 14 with those of Example 10 shows that similar results are obtained for both cases above sizes of ca. 30 nm: in case a) \u03bbex=\u03bbem; in case b) \u03bbem=\u03bbex+100 nm. This indicates that using reasonable Stokes-shifts, the size evaluation on the whole does not critically depend on the small enlargement of the FWHM of the enveloping curve (corresponding to the detection Point Spread Function of the collecting objective lens. Problems may occur to distinguish 10 nm and 20 nm sized objects under the large Stokes-shift of 100 nm assumed. This problem can be overcome by using still shorter wavelengths for excitation, or shorter Stokes-shifts, or both. An extension of the determination of R to any other excitation wavelength and emission wavelength according to the invention is obvious for any one with knowledge in the field.",
        "In Examples 15 and 16, respectively FIGS. 23 and 24, it is shown how the dependence is between the total number of photons registered (Ntot) and the accuracy in the determination of the modulation contrast R depending on size see (1), (2), (3), (4). In these cases the condition a) and b), respectively were considered. In particular, it was studied for a fixed value of the modulation contrast R how the accuracy of its determination changes varying the total number of photons detected. It is important to point out that a fixed value of the modulation contrast factor corresponding to different values of object sizes depends on the effective wavelength \u03bb*ex. As it is expected, the higher the photon counts, the higher is the accuracy in modulation contrast R and consequently in object diameter (size) determination.",
        "Examples 17 and 18 show how the calibration functions change considering for different photon count conditions in the case a) (\u03bbex=\u03bbem) and b) (\u03bbem=\u03bbex+100 nm), respectively.",

Further it is important that under both conditions, a strong dependence of R as a function of S on the excitation wavelength \u03bbex was noted and quantitatively and analytically calculated in dependence of the optical conditions, such as the value of the excitation and the emission wavelength; the numerical aperture of the collecting objective lens used and generally, the Point Spread Function of the fluorescence light collecting system; the number of fluorescence photons registered. It is obvious for any one trained in the art that the way of calculation of R described here can be extended to other forms of modulated illumination or otherwise structured illumination, such as in the lateral (x,y) plane; to other forms of noise, such as read out noise of the camera, to other excitation and emission wavelengths; to the simultaneous use of different excitation and emission wavelengths or fluorescence lifetimes to measure the sizes of any objects labelled with such spectral signatures; to errors in chromatic calibration; to errors in the discrimination of different fluorescence lifetimes etc.",

Example 19 shows an example for the dependence of R on the distance between the two \u201cpoint like\u201d objects. In the example shown, unequivocal distances measurements are feasible for distances below 60 nm. It is obvious for anyone trained in the art that the invention can be used to determine the dependence R on distance for any other optical condition mentioned.",

Furthermore, the invention can be preferably used as described in Example 19, to improve the MacroMolecular Complexes topological analysis.",

        "Perspectives of the Invention",
        "Since Ernst Abbe in 1873 formulated his famous relation describing the limits of resolution in a light microscope, any access appeared to be barred to the three-dimensional (3D) structure and temporal dynamics (3D-structure plus time=4D-geometry) of complex nanosystems such as the dynamic structures constituting the basis of life. This principal limit of knowledge appeared to be a direct consequence of the physical nature of light. In the 130 years since then, thanks to the progress of science and technology, many new methods have been discovered and successfully applied to increase knowledge of complex nanostructures in all disciplines of science, such as X-ray analysis and X-ray microscopy, Transmittance Electron Microscopy [1EM], Scanning Electron Microscopy [SEM], electron tomography, neutron diffraction analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy, Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy, or FRET-microscopy. All these methods have contributed essentially and still contribute to improve our understanding of the structure of complex nanosystems. Each system has been shown to be needed in its special range of applications: Thus, the experience of the last 130 years is that to understand the 3D-structure of such nanosystems, and especially the most complex 4D geometry of living systems, a spectrum of microscopical techniques is needed and to be broadened by new methods.",
        "Especially, this spectrum has to be broadened by methods to study the structure and dynamics of nanosystems in the interior of thick transparent specimens, such as BMM, in the interior of cells and under \u201cphysiological\u201d conditions, eventually \u201cin vivo\u201d. This, however, requires methods of Far Field Light Microscopy capable to break the \u201cAbbe limit of resolution\u201d at least under certain, structure relevant conditions. Since strictly speeding the \u201cAbbe limit\u201d refers to the situation in coherent illumination, for fluorescent microscopy one may speech of the \u201cRayleigh limit of resolution\u201d [J. T. Frohn, H. F. Knapp, A. Stemmer, True optical resolution beyond the Rayleigh limit achieved by standing wave illumination. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 7232-7236 (2000)]. In practice, however the differences in the actual resolution estimates are small. Here, only recently it became clear that by using physical principles and technologies completely unknown at the time of Ernst Abbe and Lord Rayleigh, such an improvement of far field light microscopy is indeed possible. Examples for these new developments are 4Pi-confocal microscopy, or Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy. These methods break the \u201cAbbe Limit\u201d in the sense that the \u201csmallest detectable distance between any two objects\u201d may be considerably smaller than predicted by the respective formula for any conventional Far Field Light Microscope.",
        "In addition, the advent of multispectral fluorescence labelling of specific molecules has allowed to realise additional ways to topological nanostructure analysis by the application of Spectral Position Distance Microscopy. The present invention \u201cLight MicroscOpical Nanosizing\u201d [LIMON], adds to these new possibilities. From the optical point of view, LIMON is more limited than Point Spread Function narrowing approaches like 4Pi-confocal microscopy and Stimulated Emission Depletion\u2014microscopy, since like previously described Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014techniques it does not provide an increased optical resolution in the sense of a narrowed Point Spread Function. Thus in LIMON, the \u201csmallest detectable distance between two objects\u201d can be decreased below the smallest \u201cconventionally\u201d detectable distance only by imposing certain constraints on the objects to be measured, such as appropriate fluorescence labeling, or number of objects within the observation volume. From the application point of view, however, these constraints are much less disturbing: A detailed analysis of the strategies necessary for LIMON-analysis shows that LIMON is a powerful new tool to analyse for example the structure and dynamics of a wide range of complex nanosystems, down to the molecular level. The reason for this is that due to the large amount of scientific tools available today to analyse the chemical composition and to estimate structural properties of complex nanostructures, e.g. in molecular cell biology and human and mammalian genome research, so much is already known about the system that in contrast to the past, the role of Far Field Light Microscopy is often to answer very specific questions. A few examples for this may be mentioned briefly: How fast do certain, already well known molecular components colocalise to form a functioning system; How are proteic and/or nucleic acid subunits of known molecular structure arranged in a functional complex; Is the size and topology of such a complex in the living cell the same as observed in the electron microscope (recent experience has shown that this is often not the case); How do size and topology of an intracellular nanostructure change with cellular activities under the influence of well defined other agents and molecules, including e.g. not only the effects of thousands of different but identified macromolecules in a cell but also including pharmaceutical drugs, ionising radiation, and electromagnetic fields; What is the velocity of assembly and disassembly of specific nanostructures; How does this velocity change under \u201cphysiological\u201d conditions and under the influence of other agents and molecules; What is the variability of nanostructure topology under physiological conditions, eventually in the living cell; Which of the topological conformation alternatives of a nanostructure predicted by Biocomputing approaches based on the X-ray structures of the subunits is under physiological condition and in the intact cell. These and many others questions are important problems to be solved, and can in many cases be answered using LIMON and/or Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014techniques. These techniques usually require specific fluorescence staining; this staining requirement, however, at the present stage of molecular cell biology and human & mammalian genome research, is obligatory practically for a very wide range of problems to be answered by light microscopy.",
        "LIMON is a method to analyse the spatial information of an object, e.g. the size and topology of subwavelength sized objects, such objects being in particular polymeric structures and supramolecular complexes composed of several to many units fluorescence labelled with an appropriate number of one or more spectral signatures, or any other fluorescent structures, having a subwavelength size at least in one spatial direction, by using Spatially modulated illumination microscopy or other methods providing SI in the object plane, in combination with special calibration procedures obtained by \u201cvirtual microscopy\u201d based specially designed information technology tools.",
        "LIMON allows a far field light microscopic size and colocalization resolution of an extended fluorescent object, such as a polymeric structure, a MMC, in particular a BMM, in the order of a few tens of nanometers, even if a minimum number of only one spectral signature labelling is available. In combination with appropriate multispectral labelling protocols, a topological resolution/colocalization resolution in the few nanometer range is achieved. As an example, for a number of problems in cell biology, in particular in human and mammalian genome structure research, this will allow to reach the domain so far held by electron and X-ray microscopy, as well as Atomic Force Microscopy and Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy methods. At the same time, however, all the established advantages of Far Field Light Microscopy are maintained: Nondestructiveness; multispectral imaging potential; observations of MacroMolecular Complexes in the interior of thick transparent specimens, especially in the interior of 3D-conserved (\u201cintact\u201d) and even living cells. Together with appropriate specific molecular labelling techniques down to the single molecule level [Knemeyer, J.-P., Marm\u00e9, N., Sauer, M. (2000) Probes for Detection of Specific DNA Sequences at the Single-Molecule Level. Anal. Chem. 72, 3717-3724] and image analysis procedures, using these conditions a preferred embodiment of the invention allows to analyse by means of Far Field Light Microscopy in particular the arrangement, size, and topology of MacroMolecular Complexes, in particular of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules, such as the nanostructure of specific sites of the human genome and their dynamics in intact and even living cells. Since now the major elements of life (such as genome sequence, biochemistry, individual protein sequences and their structure) are known, the optical analysis of the cellular and in particular the nuclear nanostructure and its dynamics will become one of the major issues in the understanding of the specific organisation of cells and their differences, e.g. in different stages of development, in different tissues, or in different pathological conditions. Such an improved understanding of the \u201c4-D geometry\u201d of life will be of utmost importance for a better understanding also of the structural basis of genome reprogramming, one of the fundamental problems of modern biology and medicine. From this follows a wide range of practical applications of LIMON, for example:",
        "The analysis of the \u201ccompaction\u201d of specific genetically active and inactive gene regions in three-dimensionally (3D) conserved (\u201cintact\u201d) cell nuclei, including artificial chromosomes or other gene vectors introduced in a cell nucleus. Using e.g. LIMON-conditions allowing to measure quantitatively the size of a specifically fluorescence labelled gene region in the order of 30-50 nm diameter, gene regions as small as a few kbp in DNA sequence length can be analysed. This corresponds to the sequence length of even relatively small genes. If such a small gene region is transcribed by transcription factories with a size in the order of 50 nm, it will be decondensed to a degree which can be measured by the LIMON technique even using labelling with one spectral signature only. Another application example is the estimate of copy number of gene by size determination, on a cell by cell basis. This is interesting e.g. in such case where differences in the overall intensity of the registered fluorescence label are not sufficiently reliable;",
        "If a number of gene regions each corresponding to the conditions mentioned in 1) is to be analysed for genetic activity correlated \u201ccompaction\u201d changes, each of these regions can be labelled by a different spectral signature and analysed for \u201ccompaction\u201d by LIMON;",
        "The methods described above allow compaction analysis up to chromatin regions in the order of 200-300 nm, choosing the appropriate Spatially modulated illumination/Structured illumination SMI/SI conditions;",
        "If a number of gene regions each corresponding to the above conditions is to be analysed, and if these gene regions have a minimum distance from each other which is either larger than the lateral (x,y) optical resolution, or larger than the axial (z) optical resolution, then combinatorial labelling schemes [M. R. Speicher, G. S. Ballard, D. C. Ward (1996) Karyotyping human chromosomes by combinatorial multi-fluor FISH: Nature Genet. 12: 368-375.] can be applied. For example, using Nspecs different spectral signatures, 2Nspec\u22121 different gene regions can be identified in a cell nucleus. In each of these identified gene regions, the size of this region can be determined by LIMON using a minimum of one of the spectral signatures used for labelling. For example, if Nspecs=4, the compaction of 15 different gene regions in a given nucleus can be determined by LIMON; if Nspecs=8, the compaction of 255 different gene regions in a nucleus can be determined by LIMON. Since the observation volume in Spatially modulated illumination-microscopy is in the order of 0.1 \u03bcm3, in principal a combinatorial labelling of a large number of gene regions is feasible e.g. in a human cell nucleus, having a typical volume in the order of 500 \u03bcm3. Thus, LIMON analysis of cells with combinatorially labelled gene regions provides a possibility to use the entire cell like a \u201cDNA expression chip\u201d. Although the number of genes to be analysed is considerably smaller, it is still sufficient to allow important analysis types. A great advantage, however, with respect to DNA expression chips is that this method allows a considerably faster and more economical cell-by-cell-analysis. The relatively limited number of gene regions to be analysed by LIMON in a cell can even advantageous from the clinical point of view: Methodologically, the LIMON analysis has to be restricted to the interesting part of the genome. Some examples for application of LIMON are: Selection of gene regions with cell type specific genetic expression and \u201ccompaction\u201d patterns allows to discriminate different cell types light microscopically on the cell-by-cell level, using LIMON. Under these conditions, LIMON analysis of gene regions allows to analyse the determination of cells before other signs of differentiation become visible, on a cell-by-cell level. In cases where the labelling can be performed in the living cells e.g. [T. Tsukamoto et al. 2000: Visualisation of gene activity in living cells. Nature Cell Biol. 2, 871-878], the cell type and or the state of its determination/differentiation can be identified by LIMON even \u201cin vivo\u201d on a cell-by-cell level. Using suitably fast CCD-cameras for registration, Spatially modulated illumination-data registration is possible in the one-second range. During this time, Brownian movements of gene region is sufficiently slow to allow \u201ccompaction\u201d analysis. Special examples for application of this on a cell-by-cell level are: Discrimination of cancer cells and normal cells in a tissue section; follow up of cell determination/differentiation in ontogenetic development; follow up of genetic changes in stem cells related to further differentiation; changes in the genetic expression pattern induced by pharmaceutical drugs, by ionising radiation, by electromagnetic fields, or by environmental chemicals;",
        "The sequence differences between homologue chromosomes in mammalian cells such as in human cells are assumed to be usually very small, except for the sex chromosomes. The difference is believed to be in the order of 0.1%. This amounts to sequence differences between autosomes in the order of 3 Million base pairs, or in the order of 100 kbp per chromosome. As a continuous sequence, 100 kbp may amount to a size in the order of 100\u00d710 nm of a folded 30 nm chromatin fiber [T. Cremer & C. Cremer, Chromosome Territories, Nuclear Architecture and Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells, Nature Reviews Genetics Volume 2, 292-301 (2001)]. In Human Genetics, examples are known where homologues differ from each other by small continuous pieces of DNA sequences. If in a chromosome in a given region only a small sequence length difference of a few kbp can be identified, then LIMON allows to distinguish the two autosomes. This can either be done by labelling the small sequences directly and then measure size differences in the two homologues; or by labelling flanking sequences. Examples for practical applications of this method are: The identification of homologues with imprinting regions, such as the maternal and paternal human chromosome #15; the identification of many or all homologues on a cell-by-cell basis; the identification of maternal or paternal chromosomes carrying cancer correlated or other disease correlated genes, on a cell-by-cell basis; the stem line identification of stem cells on a cell-by cell basis using the homologue identification pattern;",
        "The improved assignment of individual DNA sequences to given sites on the linear sequence map of a chromosome, measured on a cell-by-cell-basis, in particular in cell nuclei: Whereas the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014methods described in the \u201cstate of the art\u201d allow to assign the site of a short DNA-sequence with high precision if neighbouring sequences are labelled with different spectral signatures, due to the complex folding of the chromatin fiber this method may give equivocal results if the linear sequence distances become larger. Using the a preferred embodiment of the invention, the folding of the chromatin fiber can be taken much better into account, and hence the reliability of assignment can be improved. This applies also to analysis of artificial chromosomes or other gene vectors, e.g. used gene therapy approaches;",
        "The improved analysis of the folding of the chromatin fiber in a given region: Whereas the Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014methods described in the \u201cstate of the art\u201d allow a detailed analysis of the folding of the chromatin fiber, e.g. in a specific gene region, only if a high and thence technically difficult realisable number of spectral signatures is applied, in a preferred embodiment of the invention a combination of topological and size measurements is used; following established principles of geometrical analysis, this leads to a considerably improved folding analysis, using the same number of spectral signatures;",
        "The measurement of the size of a BMM other then a gene region, such as the size of a nuclear pore in vivo in Far Field Light Microscopy under specific conditions; the size of a replication factory; the size of a transcription factory; the size of repair complex; the size of a proteasome; the size of a membrane protein cluster; the size of an ion-channel. The sizes of such BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules are well known from electron microscopy, as well as Atomic Force Microscopy and Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy. However, due to the special conditions necessary to perform such measurements, the large scale observation of thousands of such BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules under special physiological conditions, such as multiple drug testing has been difficult to impractical. LIMON analysis, if necessary in combination with special nanolithographic procedures as disclosed in DE 100 52 823, included herein by reference, allows to speed up such measurements considerably;",
        "In LIMON-supported Spectral Position Distance Microscopy\u2014analysis of topology, LIMON considerably extends the possibilities of previously revealed Spectral Position Distance Microscopy analysis of topology. For example, if for the topological analysis of a BMM the determination of the relative positions and mutual distances of 16 \u201cpoint like\u201d elements is required, the solution of this problem due, to those previous procedures requires the specific labelling of the 16 elements with 16 different spectral signatures, followed by the spectrally discriminated registration of the fluorescence of 16 spectral signatures. Although this is in principle technically possible, it is presently very difficult to perform. In the LIMON supported solution of this problem, instead of labelling all 16 elements with different spectral signatures, 8 pairs of elements are labelled with 8 different spectral signatures. For each pair, the distance between the \u201cpoint like\u201d elements, their joint fluorescence intensity barycenter, and the relative orientation of the vector connecting the calculated positions of two elements are determined applying the LIMON method as described. From this, the relative positions and mutual distances of all 16 element are determined. This way of LIMON supported topology analysis can be extended in an analogous way to any other number of elements allowing spectrally differential labelling and registration;",
        "Another example of LIMON supported topology analysis refers to the measurement of the topology of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules containing a large number of equal elements, e.g. of proteins of the same kind, or nucleic-stretches with the same sequence of bases or base pairs. A way to solve this problem is to bring such a BMM together with a mixture of reporter molecules, such as fluorescence labelled nucleic acid aptamers where each of the elements can bind one of these reporter molecules only. For example, a BMM Contains 12 equal elements. If the mixture contains reporter molecules with 12 different spectral signatures, then each of the 12 elements has 12 possibilities to be labelled; this gives a total of 1212=8.9\u00d71012 possibilities of labelling. For normal Spectral Position Distance Microscopy analysis (i.e. without LIMON), only those label patterns are useful where each spectral signature in a BMM analysed is occurring only once. This is the case in 12!=4.8\u00d7108 cases. Thus, the overall probability to encounter in a specific BMM analysed the kind of labelling useful for Spectral Position Distance Microscopy analysis of the topology of all 12 equal elements is estimated to be 12!/[1212]=5.4\u00d710\u22125=1/18600. To analyse such a number of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules is technically possible using nanolithographic approaches as described in DE 100 52 823 included herein by reference. Using LIMON supported Spectral Position Distance Microscopy, instead of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules with all 12 equal elements labelled by chance differently, it is sufficient that only 6 pairs of elements are labelled with 6 different spectral signatures. This can be performed by subjecting the BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules to a mixture with types of reporter molecules of 6 different spectral signatures. Then, element 1 has 6 possibilities for labeling; since pairs with the same label are allowed for LIMON-supported Spectral Position Distance Microscopy, also element 2 has also 6 possibilities of labelling; element 3 has to be labelled with one of the remaining 5 spectral signatures to be useful for Spectral Position Distance Microscopy analysis; element 4 again has 5 possibilities for LIMON-supported Spectral Position Distance Microscopy, since pair with the same label are admitted, etc. In the end, 6\u00d76\u00d75\u00d75\u00d74\u00d74\u00d73\u00d73\u00d72\u00d72=[6!]2=518,400 useful labelling possibilities exist. The probability for such a useful labelling is then P=[6!]2/612=518,400/2.2\u00d7109=2.4\u00d710\u22124. In this case, one in about 4,200 can be analysed by LIMON, whereas in the other case of the previous Spectral Position Distance Microscopy methods, one BMM in about 18,600 only has the right label. Thus the use of LIMON in these cases is also highly advantageous. The example given may easily be extended to other number of elements and spectral signatures;",
        "LIMON allows another possibility to read DNA \u201cBar codes\u201d, or any other bar code arranged and labelled as described above, by far field light microscopy. An example of the determination of the MMC Bar Code is shown on FIGS. 5A and 5B., wherein specs denotes the spectral signature. The analysis of the arrangement of the linear sequence is explained in more detail in FIG. 10, wherein for convenience an orientation in z direction is assumed. Any other direction where SMI/SI excitation occurs can be used according to the invention. In FIG. 10 the liner sequence of elements E1, E2 . . . , E6 which for the sake of clarity is assumed to be in z direction are pair wise labelled with the same spectral signature (specs 1, specs2, specs 3) at the first step. Then step a SMI/SI discrimination is performed. Then, in the next step barycenter coordinates of specs 1, specs 2, specs 3, . . . , specs N/2 are determined. Finally the positions (xi, yi, zi), where i=1, 2, 3, . . . N (in FIG. 10 N=6), of all N elements in the linear arrangement are determined. This allows an identification on a cell-by-cell, or \u201cspot-by-spot\u201d or \u201cfield-of-view-by field-of-view-basis, with a limited number of different spectral signatures even for the encoding of high decimal numbers. For example, using LIMON analysis, 8 spectral signatures are sufficient for about 109 different decimal numbers with combinatorial labelling, a considerably lower number of spectral signatures is needed for the encoding of higher decimal numbers. Examples for application are: a) All cases where DNA-bar codes are being used; for example, stem cell lines, or any other cell line, may be unequivocal identified by introducing an artificial, genetically inert mini-chromosome carrying the DNA-bar code for this line; for example, the DNA-bar code may be contain such a high number of \u201cSTOP\u201d codons that any translation into proteins is practically impossible even after a number of point mutations and other genetic aberrations induced in such minichromosomes; b) identification on the basis of other polymer sequences, such as in specific vivo-label of even very large number of animals by innocuous polymer labels supplied in an appropriate way;",
        "In combination with appropriate Spatially modulated illumination/Structured Illumination (SMI-SI) registration devices, LIMON allows to measure the topology of appropriately labelled elements in a MMC as well as the size of the MMC or its elements in any spatial direction desired. This latter application allows to estimate important morphological parameters, such as e.g. volume and surface, the half axes of the minimum enveloping ellipsoid, the roundness described by the relation between [volume]2 to the [surface]3 etc. Thus, LIMON opens a way to determine the topology and morphology of subwavelength sized objects by means of far field light microscopy to an extent so far thought to be possible only by increasing the optical resolution correspondingly;",
        "The possibility to measure topological and morphological parameters made possible by LIMON, allows new approaches also in modelling and simulation of subwavelength sized objects, such as MacroMolecular Complexes or in particular BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules. For example, methods for modelling & simulation of human nuclear genome structures as disclosed in DE 100 52 583 A1, included herein by reference, have shown that it is possible to derive from such simulation microscopically observable parameters, such as relative positions and mutual distances between given subunits; the half axes of minimum enveloping ellipsoids; the volume, surface and the roundness of given objects; the dependence on time applying for example models including Brownian motion, etc. On the basis of such predictions, it is possible to test assumptions in a rigorous way. The validated models of human nuclear genome structure can then be used to predict more precisely important biomedical consequences, such as the mobility of drugs for gene therapy or other therapeutic purposes; the induction of cancer related specific chromosome aberrations by ionising radiation; or the functional characteristics of artificial chromosomes and other vectors, e.g. for gene therapy. On the basis of LIMON-derived determinations of topological and morphological parameters of subwavelength sized objects, such principles of modelling & simulations can now be applied in a corresponding way to the establishment of experimentally validated models e.g. of BioMolecular Machines or BioMolecular Modules or other MacroMolecular Complexes, even in the interior of cells under physiological conditions.",
        "Further, several Examples illustrating different embodiments of the invention are described.",

        "FIG. 11 A.) shows the case of a point like object. The axial Point Spread Function (PSF) is the axial intensity distribution of a \u201cpoint like\u201d object. In this example, a \u201cpoint like\u201d object is any object where the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHMo) of its fluorochrome distribution is one order of magnitude or more smaller than the FWHMf of the modulation fringe pattern. In the example the PSF detected is shown in an \u201cideal condition\u201d by Spatially modulated illumination microscope. Such a PSF is the result of the product between the Epifluorescent intensity distribution and the Spatially modulated illumination fringe pattern; this PSF is computed by Virtual Microscopy (VIM) using the convolution between a Dirac delta function and the theoretical Spatially modulated illumination-PSF (see C.)). A Dirac delta function is well approximated by a high intensity pulse (peak value equal to 255 in grey scale) with a FWHMo that respects the following condition: FWHMo<<FWHMSMI. B.)

On the right site is an example regarding the effect of photon noise in Spatially modulated illumination-PSF analysis. Three different photon count condition are shown assuming that the photon noise respects a Poisson statistics. In other words, Virtual Microscopy considers each point of an ideal PSF as the average value of a Poisson statistics. Each point of the ideal PSF is considered independently with respect to the others, and for each of them a random value of the statistical distribution described above is chosen. As it is shown the higher the total number of photon (Ntot) detected by the acquisition system, the closer to the ideal detection condition shape is the PSF.",

The extended object was realised either as an ensemble of several point like objects (5 and 11 in the example, shown in the upper part, respectively in the lower part of FIG. 12B) with a total extension of 50 nm and 110 nm, respectively, giving rise to 5 and 11 Spatially modulated illumination-Point Spread Functions SMI-PSFs being 10 nm apart from each other.

The resulting AIDs are shown on the right. Note that the modulation contrast R=Mg/M strongly depends on the object size, wherein Mg is the minimum, respectively and M is a maximum of the axial intensity distribution and the modulation contrast R=Mg/M The same AID was obtained by convolution of an object represented by a Gaussian intensity distribution with an axial Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum FWHMTrue. The FWHMTrue is equal to the maximum distance between the equivalent object constituted by several point like objects as in FIGS. 12A and 12B. In the following it is assumed that the \u201ctrue size\u201d value of an object is equal to FWHMTrue. For example, the object in FIG. 12B with an indicated size of 50 nm was represented by a Gaussian with the FWHMTrue=50 nm.

For sizes smaller then 20 nm the modulation contrast R is close to zero; this means that the Axial Intensity Distribution AID, in such a condition, well approximates the theoretical PSF. Increasing the size the modulation contrast also increases and the degree in modulation in AID decreases. For (S\u2248160 nm) the modulation contrast starts to be close to one and it is not possible detect any clear information from the AID because it does not presents any modulation in its shape; in this case small changes in the modulation contrast correspond to large changes of the size starts to be close to one and it is not possible detect any clear information from the AID because it does not presents any modulation in its shape; in this case small changes in the modulation contrast correspond to large changes of the size.",

The figure shows that, varying \u03bbex, the calibration function R=R(s, \u03bbex) changes. Changing \u03bbex, it is possible to analyse in optimal condition different size ranges. Smaller the excitation wavelength smaller the size that is possible to determine e.g. with \u03bbex=360 nm it is still possible to evaluate, in critical photon count conditions e.g. Ntot=10000, the size of object which diameter is close to 20 nm. Bigger the excitation wavelength bigger the axial object size that it is possible to determine. With \u03bbex=647 nm object sizes up to 200 nm can be determined with a good precision.

        "Example 5 illustrates the determination of the linear approximation relation between the modulation contrast R and the object size.",
        "Note that in the Example 5, respectively FIG. 15 the subscript \u201cex\u201d denotes the excitation wavelength. A linear relation between the modulation contrast R and the object size S can be, under appropriate conditions, determined. The linear coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2 were calculated using all the calibration functions showed in Example 4. For each excitation wavelength \u03bbex the modulation contrast R was studied as a function of the ratio between the size S and \u03bbex varying S in a range in which the relation R=R(s/\u03bbex, \u03bbex) is well approximated by a linear function RL: RL=RL(s/\u03bbex, \u03bbex)=(\u03b1/\u03bbex)S+\u03b2(\u03b1=4.18\u00b10.05; \u03b2=\u22120.27\u00b10.02). Using this procedure it is possible to determine independently four times (one for each \u03bbex) the linear parameters \u03b1, \u03b2. In the following examples it will be shown that the linear relation RL is valid (for each effective excitation wavelength) only for a limited range of values of S. The calculation shown are valid also for the same effective wavelengths \u03bb*ex (see Example 4).",

The good agreement between the Virtual Microscopy's computed modulation contrast R (for definition of \u03bb*ex see Example 4,5) and R(s, \u03bb*ex) shown in the Figure can be considered the prove that R(s, \u03bb*ex) is a valid analytical expression of the modulation contrast R for other values of the effective excitation wavelength.
