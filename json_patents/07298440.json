        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device capable of reflective type display and transmissive type display, and particularly relates to a liquid crystal display device in which liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicular to the plane of a substrate when no voltage is applied.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Recently, liquid crystal display devices are applied to various display devices such as portable personal data assistants (PDA), mobile phones, portable video games, car navigation systems and the like.",
        "Such outdoor devices, which have inherent characteristics of compactness and light weight, are required to have further characteristics of low power consumption and excellent viewability (high contrast). In this association, semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices of which excellent indoor and outdoor viewabilities are expected have been proposed (e.g., Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 11-101992A).",
        "This semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device includes a reflection section comprised of an electrode (reflecting electrode) having high reflectance in each pixel, which is a minimum unit of an image, and a transmission section comprised of an electrode (transparent electrode) having high transmittance, and performs display in a transmission mode where the transmission section transmits light of a backlight indoors while performing display in a reflection mode where the reflection section reflects external light outdoors. Accordingly, the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device maintains sufficient contrast indoors and outdoors, thereby exhibiting excellent viewablity.",
        "FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 are schematic sections of semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices 50a, 50b, respectively, disclosed for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2000-305110A, and FIG. 9 is a schematic plan view of an active matrix substrate 10 composing the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 50b.",
        "Each of the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices 50a, 50b includes: the active matrix substrate 10 in which a plurality of pixel electrodes are arranged in matrix; a counter substrate 20 facing the active matrix substrate 10 in which a common electrode 8 is provided; and a liquid crystal layer 30 interposed between the substrates and composed of liquid crystal molecules 30a. Further, polarizing plates and retardation plates are attached to the outer surfaces of the substrates 10, 20.",
        "In the active matrix substrate 10, a plurality of gate wires 11 and a plurality of source wires 12 are arranged so as to intersect at right angles with one another and a TFT 2 is provided at each intersection.",
        "The TFT 2 is composed of: a gate electrode which forms a protruding portion of the corresponding gate wire 11; a gate insulating film provided so as to cover the gate electrode; a semiconductor layer formed on the gate insulating film; and a source electrode 2a and a drain electrode 2b both of which are formed on the semiconductor layer. The source electrode 2a is connected with the corresponding source wire 12, and the drain electrode 2b is made of a transparent conductive film, of which extended part serves as a transparent electrode 6.",
        "Further, in the active matrix substrate 10, a protection insulating layer 3 is provided on a glass substrate 1 so as to cover the TFT 2. An interlayer insulating layer 4 is provided on the protection insulating layer 3. A reflecting electrode 5 connected with the transparent electrode 6 is provided on the interlayer insulating layer 4 to compose a pixel electrode in combination with the transparent electrode 6. In addition, an alignment layer 7 for orienting the liquid crystal molecules 30a is provided on the pixel electrode.",
        "In the counter substrate 20, a color filter layer 9, a common electrode 8 and an alignment layer 7 for orienting the liquid crystal molecules 30a are provided sequentially in this order on a glass substrate 1\u2032.",
        "In each of the liquid crystal display devices 50a, 50b, a region where the reflecting electrode 5 serves as a reflection section and the other region (a transparent electrode exposed portion 6\u2032) serves as a transmission section. The reflection section reflects external light made incident from the counter substrate 20 side, and the transmission section transmits light of a backlight made incident from the active matrix substrate 10 side.",
        "In each of the liquid crystal display devices 50a, 50b, for displaying an image, a gate signal is sent to a given gate wire 11 to allow each TFT 2 connected to the gate wire 11 to be ON state, and simultaneously, a source signal is sent from a given source wire 12 to write a predetermined charge to a corresponding pixel electrode composed of the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6 through the source electrode 2a and the drain electrode 2b. This causes potential difference between the pixel electrode and the common electrode 8, so that a predetermined voltage is applied to a liquid crystal capacitor composed of the liquid crystal layer 30. Then, by changing the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules 30a in the liquid crystal layer 30 by the applied voltage, the transmittance of the light made incident from outside through the polarizing plate is adjusted for displaying an image.",
        "FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 also show orientation of the liquid crystal molecules 30a where no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer 30, wherein the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 50a shown in FIG. 7 is a liquid crystal display device of homogeneous orientation type in which the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal molecules 30a is positive (\u0394\u03b5>0) and the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented in parallel with the planes of the substrates, and the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device shown in FIG. 8 is a liquid crystal display device of homeotropic orientation type, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-167253A, in which the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal molecules 30a is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0) and the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented perpendicular to the planes of the substrates.",
        "Referring to the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 50b, in which the dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0), the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented in parallel with the substrate planes when sufficient voltage for orienting the liquid crystal molecules 30a in response to the electric field is applied, so that the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented radially with one orientation center as a base point when viewing from the upper side of the substrate plane, as shown in FIG. 9.",
        "In order to prevent sticking of an image, an AC driving method, in which the polarity of voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is exchanged alternately between positive and negative is employed in liquid crystal display devices. For example, there is a method for alternately exchanging the polarity of voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between positive and negative by writing charge of which polarity is inverted between positive and negative in every predetermined cycle into the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode (the pixel electrode). In this method, an optimum counter potential is set in the potential of the common electrode of the counter substrate so as to effectively equalize the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between positive and negative.",
        "The optimum counter potential depends on the structure of the pixel, the gate voltage applied to the TFT, the material of the electrodes and the like.",
        "In the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices 50a, 50b respectively shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, the reflecting electrode 5 in the reflection section is made of an aluminum thin film, the transparent electrode 6 in the transmission section is made of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), for example, and therefore, the work functions of the materials of the electrodes 5, 6 are different from each other. Accordingly, the optimum counter potential of the common electrode 8 is different between in the reflection section and in the transmission section.",
        "The work function herein is minimum energy required for taking a single electron immediately outside the surface portion of a metal or the like from the surface portion, and the magnitude thereof depends greatly on a kind of atom in the surface portion, orientation of a plane, other atoms and the like. For this reason, if the materials of the electrodes are different for the reflection section and for the transmission section, the surface potential is different between the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6, resulting in difference in applied voltage therebetween. The difference in applied voltage leads to difference in optimum counter potential of the common electrode 8 between in the reflection section and in the transmission section.",
        "In order to reduce the difference between retardation in the reflection section and retardation in the transmission section, the liquid crystal layer 30 is formed so that the thickness in the reflection section is \u00bd of that in the transmission section, and therefore, the reflecting electrode 5 is located near the common electrode 8. Accordingly, the electric field of the reflection section is stronger than that of the transmission section. For this reason, the reflecting electrode 5 is liable to absorb an ionic impurity included in the liquid crystal layer 30, thereby storing surplus charge. This generates a difference in stored charge amount between the reflection section and the transmission section, and generates a difference in applied voltage therebetween. Due to the difference in applied voltage, the optimum counter potential of the common electrode 8 becomes different between the reflection section and the transmission section.",
        "With the difference in optimum counter potential between in the reflection section and in the transmission section generated for the above reasons, display quality may be lost in the display device of homeotropic orientation type shown in FIG. 8 though no problem is involved and uniform display is capable in the device of the homogeneous orientation type shown in FIG. 7.",
        "In detail, in the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 50b of homeotropic orientation type, the alignment film 7 less affects (orientation restricting force) the liquid crystal molecules 30a, and therefore, slight imbalance of the electric fields which are caused due to the difference in applied voltage may cause orientation turbulence of the liquid crystal molecules 30a.",
        "Further in detail, when the potential of the common electrode 8 is set to be an optimum counter potential of the transmission section, the magnitude of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is slightly different between positive and negative in the reflection section. Accordingly, DC voltage caused from the voltage difference between positive and the negative is applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 in the reflection section. Electric field strain generated by the DC voltage causes non-uniform behavior of the liquid crystal molecules 30a at a step portion between the reflection section and the transmission section, which invites orientation turbulence of the liquid crystal molecules 30a in the vicinity of the step portion.",
        "The orientation turbulence is different in pixels and changes the transmittance of each pixel, with a result that roughness (local variation in contrast ratio) in a displayed image in the transmission mode may be observed.",
        "Referring to a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-315766A, the reflecting electrode is covered with an amorphous transparent conductive film so that the potentials of the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode are substantially equalized to each other, thereby reducing flicker.",
        "Further, in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-57639A discloses that in a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device, the potential difference of voltage applied to the reflection section is set smaller than that applied to the transmission section by dividing the capacitor so as to minimize the anisotropy of the refractive index in the reflection section, with a result that orientation defects of the liquid crystal molecules at the boundary between the reflection section and the transmission section is prevented.",
        "In addition, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 10-206845A discloses that in a reflective type liquid crystal display device, the common electrode and the reflecting electrode (pixel electrode) which interpose a liquid crystal layer have work functions substantially equal to each other, taking account of the work function of the materials of the electrodes, thereby reducing flicker.",
        "The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned problems and has an object prevention of roughness in a displayed image in a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device of homeotropic orientation type in which liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicular to a plane of a substrate when no voltage is applied to a liquid crystal layer.",
        "To attain the above object, a liquid crystal display device includes applied voltage adjusting means that approximates voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in a reflection section to voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in a transmission section.",
        "Specifically, a liquid crystal display device includes: a first substrate and a second substrate which face each other; a liquid crystal layer which is interposed between the first substrate and second substrate and which is composed of liquid crystal molecules; and a plurality of pixels each comprised of a reflection section that performs display in a reflection mode and a transmission section that performs display in a transmission mode, wherein a reflecting electrode for applying voltage to the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section and a transparent electrode for applying voltage to the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section are provided in the first substrate, the transparent electrode being connected with the reflecting electrode electrically, a common electrode is provided so as to face the first substrate in the second substrate, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented substantially perpendicular to planes of the substrates when no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer in the liquid crystal layer in each of the pixels, and applied voltage adjusting means is provided which approximates voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section to voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section.",
        "In the above construction, the applied voltage adjusting means that approximates voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section to voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section is provided, and thus, difference in applied voltage is minimized between in the reflection section and in the transmission section. Therefore, orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is uniformed even, for example, in the vicinity of a step portion located in a boundary region between the reflection section that performs display in a reflection mode and the transmission section that performs display in a transmission mode. Thus, the transmittances of the respective pixels are equalized, thereby restraining roughness in a displayed image.",
        "The applied voltage adjudicating means may be made of a transparent conductive film so as to cover at least the reflecting electrode.",
        "In the above arrangement, the reflecting electrode is covered with the transparent conductive film and the transparent electrode is made of a transparent conductive film in general, so that the surface portions of the electrodes for applying voltage to the liquid crystal layer are formed of the transparent conductive film in both the reflection section and the transmission section. Therefore, the surface potentials of the electrodes in the reflection section and in the transmission section become equal to each other, difference in work function between the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode are equalized, and thus, the optimum counter potential of the common electrode is substantially equalized between in the reflection section and in the transmission section. Accordingly, the difference in applied voltage between in the reflection section and in the transmission section is minimized, and the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, for example, in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section is uniformed. In turn, the transmittances of the respective pixel are equalized, thereby restraining roughness in a displayed image.",
        "Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 10-206845A discloses that taking account of work functions of materials of the electrodes, the work functions of a common electrode and a reflecting electrode (pixel electrode) which interpose a liquid crystal layer are equalized in a reflective type liquid crystal display device. While, the present invention is directed to a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device of homeotropic orientation type in which each pixel electrode is divided into the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicular to the substrate when no voltage is applied, and the liquid crystal molecules are oriented in parallel with the substrate when sufficient voltage for orienting the liquid crystal molecules in response to the electric field is applied (hereinafter referred to as \u201cvoltage applied state\u201d). Therefore, the present invention solves different problems by different means from those in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 10-206845A.",
        "Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-315766A discloses that in a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device, taking account of working functions of materials of the electrodes, a reflecting electrode is covered with an amorphous transparent conductive film made of an IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) film to equalize the potentials of the reflecting electrode and a transparent electrode. However, the object of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-315766A is to restrain flicker and is not to solve the problem of roughness in a displayed image as in the present invention.",
        "Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-315766A fails to suggest the problem of roughness in a displayed image caused by orientation turbulence in the vicinity of the step portion between the reflection section and the transmission section in the voltage applied state in liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0). Because, it is considered that Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Publication No. 2003-315766A is directed to a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is positive (\u0394\u03b5>0) and takes no account of a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0).",
        "The present inventors have found a fact that behavior of liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is positive (\u0394\u03b5>0) and behavior of liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0) are remarkably different in the vicinity of the step portion between the reflection section and the transmission section in the voltage applied state.",
        "The fact will be described below in detail with reference to drawings.",
        "FIG. 10A is a schematic plan view showing, in an enlarged scale, the vicinity of a step portion between a reflection section (a reflecting electrode 5) and a transmission section (a transparent electrode exposed portion 6\u2032) in a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is positive (\u0394\u03b5>0), and FIG. 10B is a schematic plan view showing, in an enlarged scale, a step portion between a reflection section (a reflecting electrode 5) and a transmission section (a transparent electrode exposed portion 6\u2032) in a semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0).",
        "In the case where the liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is positive (\u0394\u03b5>0) are used, the liquid crystal molecules 30a in the vicinity of the step portion are oriented substantially perpendicular to the substrate when voltage is applied, as shown in FIG. 10A. Accordingly, when minute potential difference is generated between in the reflection section and in the transmission section, the liquid crystal molecules 30a rotate or move in parallel with respect to a plane parallel to the substrate. However, variation in directors (unit vector in orientation direction) of the liquid crystal molecules is small in the vicinity of the step portion and orientation turbulence is barely occurs. Thus, no roughness appears in a displayed image.",
        "On the other hand, in the case where the liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0) is used, the liquid crystal molecules 30a in the vicinity of the step portion are oriented so as to be tilted in parallel with respect to the substrate in the voltage applied state, as shown in FIG. 10B. Accordingly, if the liquid crystal molecules 30a rotate or move in parallel with respect to a plane parallel to the substrate when minute potential difference between the reflection section and the transmission section is generated, the directors of the liquid crystal molecules are scattered and the orientation is disturbed in the vicinity of the step portion, with a result that roughness is observed in a displayed image.",
        "Further, conventional semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices in which liquid crystal molecules have a dielectric anisotropy positive (\u0394\u03b5>0) generally employ a normally white mode for black display in the voltage applied state. In the normally white mode, even if the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is disturbed, roughness is barely visible because of black display in the voltage applied state.",
        "On the other hand, semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices in which liquid crystal molecules have a dielectric anisotropy negative (\u0394\u03b5<0) generally employ a normally black mode for white display in the voltage applied state. Therefore, roughness is easily visible when the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is disturbed in the voltage applied state.",
        "In this way, the object of restraining roughness in a displayed image is not easily inferred in such conventional semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices in which liquid crystal molecules have a dielectric anisotropy positive (\u0394\u03b5>0), but is a peculiar object in semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices in which liquid crystal molecules have a dielectric anisotropy negative (\u0394\u03b5<0).",
        "The aforementioned applied voltage adjusting means may be provided so as to cover the transparent electrode.",
        "With the above arrangement, the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode are covered with the transparent conductive film. Accordingly, the surfaces of the electrodes for applying voltage to the liquid crystal layer are made of the same transparent conductive film in the reflection section and in the transmission section, whereby the surface potentials are substantially equalized therebetween, the difference in work function between the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode is canceled, and the optimum counter potential of the common electrode is substantially equalized to each other. As a result, difference in applied voltage is minimized between in the reflection section and in the transmission section, and the liquid crystal molecules, for example, in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section are uniformly oriented. Hence, the transmittances of the respective pixels are equalized and roughness in a displayed image is retrained.",
        "The difference in voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between in the reflection section and in the transmission section may be set to be 300 mV or lower.",
        "By this setting, the difference in voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between in the reflection section and in the transmission section becomes small, 300 mV or lower, and accordingly, roughness in a displayed image is reduced to an invisible degree.",
        "The reflection section and the transmission section may be AC driven.",
        "In so doing, the reflection section and the transmission section are AC driven by inverting the potentials of the reflecting electrode and the transparent electrode, so that the potential of the common electrode is set to be an optimum counter potential that effectively equalizes the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between positive and negative. Wherein, in conventional semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices, the materials and structure of the electrodes are different between the reflection section and the transmission section, and therefore, the optimum counter potentials are different therebetween. This difference may cause difference in voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between in the reflection section and in the transmission section.",
        "However, in the liquid crystal display device of the present technology, the applied voltage adjusting means that approximates the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section to the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section is provided, so that the difference in applied voltage between in the reflection section and in the transmission section is minimized. Hence, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented uniformly, for example, in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section and the transmittances of the respective pixels are equalized, thereby retraining roughness in a displayed image.",
        "The reflecting electrode may be electrically connected with the transparent electrode through the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section.",
        "With this arrangement, the reflecting electrode is electrically connected with the transparent electrode not through a contact hole but through the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section. Therefore, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules may be disturbed in the vicinity of the step portion and roughness may be caused in a displayed image.",
        "However, in the liquid crystal display device of the present technology, which includes the applied voltage adjusting means, the difference in applied voltage between in the reflection section and in the transmission section is minimized.

        "The liquid crystal layer in the reflection section except the step portion may be set to have thickness different from that of the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section.",
        "By this setting, the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section except the step portion is different from that of the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section, so that the strength of the electric filed of the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section except the step portion is different from that in the transmission section. In this association, the electrode (the reflecting electrode or the transparent electrode) of which electric filed is stronger are liable to absorb ionic impurity included in the liquid crystal layer and surplus charge is liable to be stored. Accordingly, difference in stored charge amount is caused between the reflection section and the transmission section and the applied voltage may be different therebetween.",
        "However, in the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device of the present technology, which includes the applied voltage adjusting means that approximates the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section to the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section, the difference in applied voltage between in the reflection section and in the transmission section, which may be caused due to the difference in stored charge amount between the reflection section and the transmission section, becomes not too large to cause roughness in a displayed image. Therefore, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented uniformly in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section and the transmittances of the respective pixels are equalized, thereby restraining roughens in a displayed image.",
        "The liquid crystal layer in the reflection section except the step portion may be set to have a thickness of substantially \u00bd of that of the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section.",
        "By this setting, the thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the reflection section except the step portion is substantially \u00bd of that of the liquid crystal layer in the transmission section, so that the difference between retardation in the reflection section and retardation in the transmission section is reduced but the electric filed of the reflection section is stronger than the electric field of the transmission section because the reflecting electrode is located nearer the common electrode. In this association, the reflecting electrode is liable to absorb ionic impurity included in the liquid crystal layer and surplus charge is liable to be stored. As a result, the difference in stored charge amount is caused between the reflection section, and the transmission section, and difference in applied voltage may be caused therebetween.",

        "It is possible to perform white display by orienting the liquid crystal molecules substantially in parallel with the plane of the substrate when voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer.",
        "In so doing, the liquid crystal display device is in the normally black mode that performs white display when voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer. Therefore, when orientation turbulence of the liquid crystal molecules is caused in the voltage applied state, the turbulence may be viewed as roughness in a displayed image.",

Accordingly, leakage current caused due to light of the TFT 2 is prevented.",

Other liquid crystal molecules 30a, located apart from the rivets 21, are oriented substantially perpendicularly to the plane of the substrate. On the other hand, when voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer 30, the liquid crystal molecules 30a located apart from the rivets 21 are also oriented and tilted in the aforementioned radial direction so as to match the liquid crystal molecules 30a in the vicinity of the rivets 21. Such orientation of the liquid crystal molecules widens the viewing angle in image display.",

In each pixel, when the TFT 2 is in ON state when a gate signal is sent from the corresponding gate wire 11, a source signal is sent from the corresponding source wire 12 so that a predetermined charge is written into the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6 via the source electrode 2a and the drain electrode 2b. This causes potential difference between the common electrode 8 and the electrodes (the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6), so that a predetermined voltage is applied to the liquid crystal capacitor and the auxiliary capacitor which are formed of the liquid crystal layer 30.",
        "In the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 60a, the liquid crystal molecules 30a of the liquid crystal layer 30 oriented substantially perpendicular to the substrate plane are oriented in parallel with the substrate plane radially with the rivets 21 as centers when voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer 30. The orientation state of the liquid crystal molecules 30a is changed according to the magnitude of the applied voltage. For displaying an image, the transmittance is adjusted by utilizing the change in the orientation state.",
        "In order to prevent sticking of an image, AC current driving is employed which exchanges alternately the polarity of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 between positive and negative by utilizing potential inversion of the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6. In this association, an optimum counter potential is set in the common electrode 8 for equalizing the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 effectively between positive and negative.",
        "In the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 60a with the above construction, the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6 are comprised of different materials and have different work functions. However, the electrode covering film 13 is provided so as to cover the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6 for compensating for the difference in work functions. Hence, the optimum counter potential of the common electrode 8 is substantially equalized between the reflection section and the transmission section, and the difference in applied voltage therebetween is reduced to 300 mV or lower. As a result, the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented uniformly in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflections section and the transmission section and the transmittances of the respective pixels are equalized, thereby restraining roughness in a displayed image.",
        "The thickness of interlayer insulating film 4 is so set that the liquid crystal layer 30 in the reflection section has a thickness of substantially \u00bd of the thickness of the liquid crystal layer 30 in the transmission section. Therefore, the difference between retardation in the reflection section and retardation in the transmission section is reduced. In this connection, the reflecting electrode 5 is located nearer the common electrode 8 than the transparent electrode 6, so that the electric field of the reflection section is stronger than that of the transmission section. Therefore, the reflecting electrode 5 absorbs an ionic impurity included in the liquid crystal layer 30 easily, thereby storing surplus charge. This surplus charge may cause a difference in a stored charge amount between the reflection section and the transmission section, and applied voltage may be different therebetween. However, since the electrode covering film 13 is provided on the reflecting electrode 5 and the transparent electrode 6 as described above, the difference in applied voltage between the reflection section and the transmission section does not become too great to cause roughness in a displayed image even if the difference in applied voltage between the reflection section and the transmission section is caused by the difference in stored charge amount therebetween.",
        "Further, the orientation turbulence of the liquid crystal molecule 30a in the vicinity of the step portion in the boundary region between the reflection section and the transmission section is restrained. This obviates time otherwise required for stabilizing the orientation. Hence, the response speed for displaying an image is increased, which facilitates a moving image display.",
        "Semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices of homeotropic orientation type can employ a display mode of normally black which performs black display when no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer. Hence, semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices of homeotropic orientation can provide a display with high contrast, compared with the conventional semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 50a as shown in FIG. 7 which employs a display mode of normally white. Therefore, the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 60a can provide a moving image display and can provide display at a wider viewing angle with high contrast, which are features of the homeotropic orientation type.",

        "The semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device 60b includes: the active matrix substrate 10b serving as a first substrate; a counter substrate 20b serving as a second substrate facing the active matrix substrate 10b; and a liquid crystal layer 30 interposed between the substrates 10b and 20b.",

However, the reflecting electrode covering film 14 comprised of the same transparent electrode material as that of the transparent electrode 6 is provided so as to cover the reflecting electrode 5 for compensating the difference in work function therebetween. Therefore, the optimum counter potential of the common electrode is equalized between in the reflection section and in the transmission section, thereby minimizing the difference in applied voltage therebetween. As a result, the liquid crystal molecules 30a are oriented uniformly between in the reflection section and in the transmission section and the transmittance of the respective pixels are equalized, thereby restraining roughness in a displayed image.

        "Next, a transparent conductive film made of an IZO film is formed by a sputtering method on the entirety of the substrate over the gate insulating film where the semiconductor layer is formed, and then, is patterned by the PEP technique to form the drain electrode 2b and the transparent electrode 6.",

        "The surface of the interlayer insulating film 4 may be rough by the PEP technique. In this association, the surface of the reflecting electrode 5 on the interlayer insulating film 4 becomes rough, with a result that light made incident into the reflecting electrode 5 can be appropriately scattered.",

        "A method of evaluating roughness in a displayed image, using the experimental cell 40 will be described next.",
        "First, signals VR0 and VT0 in a rectangular waveform of which potential is about \u00b15V as shown in FIG. 6A are input to the reflecting electrode 5a and the transparent electrode 6a, respectively, while inputting a signal of which potential is about 0V in DC to the common electrode 8.",
        "FIG. 6B shows waveforms of voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 in the reflection section and the transmission section. VR1 denotes the waveform of the applied voltage in the reflection section and VT1 denotes the waveform of the applied voltage in the transmission section. As can be understood from FIG. 6B, even when the signals VR0 and VT0 having the same pattern are respectively input to the reflecting electrode 5a and the transparent electrode 6a, the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 is different between in the reflection section and in the transmission section because of the difference in work function of the electrodes and the difference in thickness of the liquid crystal layer 30 between in the reflection section and in the transmission section. For this reason, it is necessary to set the potential input to the common electrode 8 to be a reflection section optimum counter potential VR0P1 in the reflection section and a transmission section optimum counter potential VT0P in the transmission section, respectively. Wherein, \u0394V1 denotes the difference between the reflection section optimum counter potential VR0P1 and the transmission section optimum counter potential VT0P.",

Whereby, the applied voltage in the reflection section is in a waveform VR2 and the applied voltage in the transmission section is in a waveform VT2, as shown in FIG. 6C. Also, a reflection section optimum counter potential VR0P2 is approximated to the transmission section optimum counter potential VT0P, so that the difference \u03942 between the reflection section optimum counter potential VR0P2 and the transmission section optimum counter potential VT0P becomes smaller than the difference\u03941 between the reflection section optimum counter potential VR0P1 and the transmission section optimum counter potential VT0P.",
        "By adding the predetermined potential to the reflecting electrode 5a in this way, the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer 30 between the reflecting electrode 5a and the common electrode 8 in the reflection section is adjusted.",
        "Thereafter, the experimental cell 40 is sandwiched between two polarizing plates and roughness in a displayed image is observed while changing the added predetermined potential gradually.",
        "Next, roughness in a displayed image where the predetermined potential is changed using the aforementioned method will be described with reference to Table 1.",

The applied voltage difference herein means difference of optimum counter potentials between in the reflection section and in the transmission section.",
        "When the predetermined potential was raised to 300 mV, the applied voltage difference becomes 350 mV and roughness was less observed in a displayed image.",
        "When the predetermined potential was further raised to 500 mV, the applied voltage difference becomes 300 mV and no roughness was observed by viewing in a displayed image.",
        "Further, when the predetermined potential was raised to 900 mV, the applied voltage difference becomes 0 V and no roughness was observed by viewing in a displayed image.",
        "As described above, the semi transmissive type liquid crystal display device in the present invention minimizes the difference in voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer between in the reflection section and in the transmission section, and therefore, is useful in application to semi transmissive type liquid crystal display devices of homeotropic orientation type using liquid crystal molecules of which dielectric anisotropy is negative (\u0394\u03b5<0), which is liable to cause orientation turbulence of the liquid crystal molecules due to slight variation of the applied voltage."
