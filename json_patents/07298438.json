        "This application is a continuation-in-part of PCT/JP02/10032 filed Sep. 27, 2002 claiming priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 299547/2001 filed Sep. 28, 2001.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semitransparent reflector. Precisely, the invention relates to a semitransparent reflector that transmits the light from a light source on the back side thereof and reflects the light from a light source on the front side thereof to thereby realize a high brightness.",
        "2. Description of the Background",
        "A display device is known, in which the built-in light source is switched on in the dark to visualize the display image by the action of the transmitted light, but is switched off in the light to visualize the display image by the action of the external reflected light. Its typical constitution is shown in FIG. 1, in which the back side of the liquid-crystal cell is specifically noted. The constitution is characterized in that a polarizer and a semitransparent reflector are laminated on the back side of the liquid-crystal cell in that order.",
        "In the liquid-crystal unit of the type, the semitransparent reflector functions for efficiently utilizing the light from the built-in light source in the dark and the light from the external light source in the light both for displays, and also for realizing displays that meet various objects. In general, glaring transmitted light and reflected light are disliked. For increasing the display visibility, the transmittance and the reflectance of the semitransparent reflector must be well balanced, and the display device must have high transmittance and high reflectance.",
        "Heretofore, a semitransparent reflector fabricated by forming a coating layer with a filler such as pearl pigment, silica, alumina or the like therein on a transparent or opacity-controlled base film is used, and its whole light transmittance T and whole light reflectance R are specifically controlled. Also known is a technique of adding the same type of filler as above to the adhesive for bonding a polarizer and a semitransparent reflector to thereby specifically control the whole light transmittance T and the while light reflectance R of the reflector.",
        "These semitransparent reflectors that have heretofore been known may enjoy the balance between the brightness from the transmitted light and the brightness from the reflected light, but could not often attain the intended transmission and reflection brightness in display devices, depending on the optical properties of the constituent components.",
        "The present invention is to attain efficient light transmission and reflection in a display device with a semitransparent reflector installed therein, and to attain a high transmittance and a high reflectance of the display device so as to significantly improve the letter visibility of the device.",
        "We, the present inventors have assiduously studied to realize the improvement of the light transmittance and the light reflectance of a display device, and have found that the improvement may be attained by taking a good balance between the transmission brightness and the reflection brightness of the semitransparent reflector in the device and by reducing the diffusive reflection on the semitransparent reflector.",
        "For realizing the reduction in the light diffusion of the reflected light on a semitransparent reflector, we have considered that a constitution as in FIG. 2 is good in which flaky pores (D) are oriented in the base layer (A) parallel to the surface of the semitransparent reflector and the base layer is coated with protective layers (B) and (C).",
        "For realizing the flaky pores oriented relative to the surface of the semitransparent reflector, we have found that incorporating a flaky inorganic fine powder and/or an organic filler into the base layer and biaxially stretching the base layer is good. In addition, we have found that the structure of the flaky pores (D) is preferably like a true circle (X/Y\u22481), and have completed the present invention.",
        "Specifically, the invention provides a semitransparent reflector having T of from 10 to 80%, R of from 20 to 90%, (T+R) of from 80 to 100%, and (R\u2212Rd) of from 8 to 30% in which T(%) indicates the whole light transmittance of the reflector, R(%) indicates the whole light reflectance thereof, Rd(%) indicates the whole light diffusion reflectance thereof, and they are measured according to JIS-Z-8722. Preferably, the semitransparent reflector of the invention is a multi-layered, biaxially-oriented film, comprising a base layer (A) and protective layers (B) and (C) that contain a thermoplastic resin, a flaky inorganic fine powder and/or an organic filler, and it has flaky pores (D).",
        "Also preferably, the flaky pores (D) have X/Y of from 0.1 to 10, Y/H of from 20 to 1000 and a porosity of from 0.1 to 20%, in which X indicates the pore diameter (\u03bcm) in the machine direction, Y indicates the pore diameter (\u03bcm) in the transverse direction, and H indicates the pore height (\u03bcm).",

The thickness (\u03bcm) of the multi-layered biaxially-oriented film is measured (with a micrometer or through electromicroscopic observation), and the ratio of basis weight/thickness is calculated. From this, the density of the multi-layered biaxially-oriented film (after stretched) is obtained. When the film is coated with porous protective layers (B) and (C) and when the porosity of each layer of the film is determined, the cross section of the film is observed with a scanning electronic microscope at an enlargement magnification of from 500 to 2000 times. In one example, a photographic picture of the observed region of a film sample is taken, then the pores are traced onto a tracing film and painted out, the resulting drawing is analyzed with an image processor (Nireco's Model Luzex IID), and the areal ratio of the pores is obtained to be the porosity.",
        "The density of the multi-layered biaxially-oriented film for use in the invention generally falls within a range of from 0.8 to 0.94 g/cm3, and the film having larger pores may enjoy more improved reflection characteristics.
