        "The present invention relates to enhancer peptide sequences originally derived from various retroviral envelope (gp41) protein sequences that enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of any core polypeptide to which they are linked. The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that hybrid polypeptides comprising the enhancer peptide sequences linked to a core polypeptide possess enhanced pharmacokinetic properties such as increased half life. The invention further relates to novel anti-fusogenic and/or anti-viral, peptides, including ones that contain such enhancer peptide sequences, and methods for using such peptides. The invention further relates to methods for enhancing the pharmacokinetic properties of any core polypeptide through linkage of the enhancer peptide sequences to the core polypeptide. The core polypeptides to be used in the practice of the invention can include any pharmacologically useful peptide that can be used, for example, as a therapeutic or prophylactic reagent. In a non-limiting embodiment, the invention is demonstrated by way of example wherein a hybrid polypeptide comprising, for example, an HIV core polypeptide linked to enhancer peptide sequences, is shown to be a potent, non-cytotoxic inhibitor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV infection. Additionally, the enhancer peptide sequences of the invention have been linked to a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) core polypeptide and a luteinizing hormone receptor (LH-RH) core polypeptide. In each instance, the hybrid polypeptide was found to possess enhanced pharmacokinetic properties, and the RSV hybrid polypeptide exhibited substantial anti-RSV activity.",
        "Polypeptide products have a wide range of uses as therapeutic and/or prophylactic reagents for prevention and treatment of disease. Many polypeptides are able to regulate biochemical or physiological processes to either prevent disease or provide relief from symptoms associated with disease. For example, polypeptides such as viral or bacterial polypeptides have been utilized successfully as vaccines for prevention of pathological diseases. Additionally, peptides have been successfully utilized as therapeutic agents for treatment of disease symptoms. Such peptides fall into diverse categories such, for example, as hormones, enzymes, immunomodulators, serum proteins and cytokines.",
        "For polypeptides to manifest their proper biological and therapeutic effect on the target sites, the polypeptides must be present in appropriate concentrations at the sites of action. In addition, their structural integrity must generally be maintained. Therefore, the formulation of polypeptides as drugs for therapeutic use is directed by the chemical nature and the characteristics of the polypeptides, such as their size and complexity, their conformational requirements, and their often complicated stability, and solubility profiles. The pharmacokinetics of any particular herapeutic peptide is dependent on the bioavailability, distribution and clearance of said peptide.",
        "Since many bioactive substances, such as peptides and proteins, are rapidly destroyed by the body, it is critical to develop effective systems for maintaining a steady concentration of peptide in blood circulation, to increase the efficacy of such peptides, and to minimize the incidence and severity of adverse side effects.",
        "The present invention relates, first, to enhancer peptide sequences originally derived from various retroviral envelope (gp41) protein sequences i.e., HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, that enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of any core polypeptide to which they are linked. The invention is based on the surprising result that when the disclosed enhancer peptide sequences are linked to any core polypeptide, the resulting hybrid polypeptide possesses enhanced pharmacokinetic properties including, for example, increased half life and reduced clearance rate relative to the core polypeptide alone. The present invention further relates to such hybrid polypeptides and core polypeptides, and to novel peptides that exhibit anti-fusogenic activity, antiviral activity and/or the ability to modulate intracellular processes that involve coiled-coil peptide structures. Among such peptides are ones that contain enhancer peptide sequences.",
        "Core polypeptides can comprise any peptides which may be introduced into a living system, for example, any peptides capable of functioning as therapeutic, prophylactic or imaging reagents useful for treatment or prevention of disease or for diagnostic or prognostic methods, including methods in vivo imaging. Such peptides include, for example, growth factors, hormones, cytokines, angiogenic growth factors, extracellular matrix polypeptides, receptor ligands, agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists, peptide targeting agents, such as imaging agents or cytotoxic targeting agents, or polypeptides that exhibit antifusogenic and/or antiviral activity, and peptides or polypeptides that function as antigens or immunogens including, for example, viral and bacterial polypeptides.",

        "The invention still further relates to methods for using the peptides disclosed herein, including hybrid polypeptides containing enhancer peptide sequences. For example, the methods of the invention include methods for decreasing or inhibiting viral infection, e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, RSV, measles, influenza, parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr, and hepatitis virus infection, and/or viral-induced cell fusion events. The enhancer peptide sequences of the invention can, additionally, be utilized to increase the in vitro or ex-vivo half-life of a core polypeptide to which enhancer peptide sequences have been attached, for example, enhancer peptide sequences can increase the half life of attached core polypeptides in-cell culture or cell or tissue samples.",

        "Certain commonly encountered amino acids which provide useful substitutions include, but are not limited to, \u03b2-alanine (\u03b2-Ala) and other omega-amino acids such as 3-aminopropionic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr), 4-aminobutyric acid and so forth; \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib); \u03b5-aminohexanoic acid (Aha); \u03b4-aminovaleric acid (Ava); N-methylglycine or sarcosine (MeGly); ornithine (Orn); citrulline (Cit); t-butylalanine (t-BuA); t-butylglycine (t-BuG); N-methylisoleucine (MeIle); phenylglycine (Phg); cyclohexylalanine (Cha); norleucine (Nle); naphthylalanine (Nal); 4-chlorophenylalanine (Phe(4-Cl)); 2-fluorophenylalanine (Phe(2-F)); 3-fluorophenylalanine (Phe(3-F)); 4-fluorophenylalanine (Phe(4-F)); penicillamine (Pen); 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (Tic); \u03b2-2-thienylalanine (Thi); methionine sulfoxide (MSO); homoarginine (hArg); N-acetyl lysine (AcLys); 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (Dbu); 2,3-diaminobutyric acid (Dab); p-aminophenylalanine (Phe (pNH2)); N-methyl valine (MeVal); homocysteine (hCys), homophenylalanine (hphe) and homoserine (hSer); hydroxyproline (Hyp), homoproline (hPro), N-methylated amino acids, cyclic amino acid analogues (used, e.g., to constrain amino acid residues to particular conformational states, e.g., \u03b1 \u03b1\u2032- and .\u03b2\u03b2\u2032-substituted cyclic amino acids such as 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (cycloleucine) and \u03b2,\u03b2-cyclopentamethylene-\u03b2-mercaptopropionic acid (see, e.g., Hruby et al., 1990, Biochem. J. 268:249-262). and peptoids or oligopeptoids (N-substituted amino acids, e.g., N-substituted glycines; see, e.g., Simon et al., 1972, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:9367-9371).",
        "While in most instances, the amino acids of the peptide will be substituted with L-enantiomeric amino acids, the substitutions are not limited to L-enantiomeric amino acids. Thus, also included in the definition of \u201cmutated\u201d or \u201caltered\u201d forms are those situations where an L-amino acid is replaced with an identical D-amino acid (e.g., L-Arg\u2192D-Arg) or with a D-amino acid of the same category or subcategory (e.g., L-Arg\u2192D-Lys), and vice versa. Such substitutions can also be present within the core polypeptides of the hybrid polypeptides of the invention, whether or not they are present in the enhancer sequence/sequences of the particular hybrid polypeptide.",
        "In addition to the above-described amino acid substitutions, replacement of side chain moieties can be made by introducing, for example, a methyl group or pseudoisosteric groups with different electronic properties (see, e.g., Hruby et al., 1990, Biochem. J. 268:249-262). Further, double bonds can be introduced between adjacent carbon atoms of amino acids and cyclic peptides oranalogs can be formed by introducing covalent bonds such as forming an amide bond between N- and C-termini, between two side chains or between a side chain and the N- or C-terminus of the peptide. Such substitutions can also be present within the core polypeptides of the hybrid polypeptides of the invention, whether or not they are present in the enhancer sequence/sequences of the particular hybrid polypeptide.",
        "The core and hybrid polypeptides of the invention can also be conjugated with one or more chemical groups. The chemical groups utilized for conjugation are preferably not significantly toxic or immunogenic, i.e., any toxicity or immunogenicity observed with a conjugate of a core or hybrid polypeptide is not significantly (i.e., less than 50%) greater than any toxicity or immunogenicity observed with the corresponding unmodified core or hybrid polypeptide.",
        "Exemplary chemical groups include carbohydrates, such as, for example, those carbohydrates that occur naturally on glycoproteins, and non-proteinaceous polymers, such as polyols.",
        "A polyol, for example, can be conjugated to core or hybrid polypeptide at one or more amino acid residues, including lysine residues. The polyol employed can be any water-soluble poly(alkylene oxide) polymer and can have a linear or branched chain. Suitable polyols include those substituted at one or more hydroxyl positions with a chemical group, such as an alkyl group having between one and four carbons. Typically, the polyol is a poly(alkylene glycol), such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and thus, for ease of description, the remainder of the discussion relates to an exemplary embodiment wherein the polyol employed is PEG and the process of conjugating the polyol to a core or hybrid polypeptide is termed \u201cpegylation.\u201d However, those skilled in the art recognize that other polyols, such as, for example, poly(propylene glycol) and polyethylene-polypropylene glycol copolymers, can be employed using the techniques for conjugation described herein for PEG.",
        "The average molecular weight of the PEG can range from about 500 to about 30,000 daltons (D); preferably, from about 1,000 to about 25,000 D; and more preferably, from about 4,000 to about 20,000 D. In one embodiment, pegylation is carried out with PEG having an average molecular weight of about 5,000 D (hereinafter \u201cPEG(5000)\u201d).In another embodiment, a branched-chain PEG having two chains of about 10,000 D each is employed.",
        "PEG preparations that are commercially available, and suitable for use in the present invention, are nonhomogeneous preparations that are sold according to average molecular weight. For example, PEG(5000) preparations typically contain molecules that vary slightly in molecular weight, usually +/\u2212500 D. A variety of methods for pegylating proteins have been described. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337, disclosing the conjugation of a number of hormones and enzymes to PEG and polypropylene glycol to produce physiologically active non-immunogenic compositions. Generally, a PEG having at least one terminal hydroxy group is reacted with a coupling agent to form an activated PEG having a terminal reactive group. Id. This reactive group can then react with the \u03b1- and \u03b5-amines of proteins to form a covalent bond. Conveniently, the other end of the PEG molecule can be \u201cblocked\u201d with a non-reactive chemical group, such as a methoxy group, to reduce the formation of PEG-crosslinked complexes of protein molecules.",
        "Suitable activated PEGs can be produced by a number of conventional reactions. For example, an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of a PEG (M-NHS-PEG) can be prepared from PEG-monomethyl ether (which is commercially available from Union Carbide) by reaction with N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), according to the method of Buckmann and Merr, Makromol. Chem., 182:1379-1384 (1981).",
        "In addition, a PEG terminal hydroxy group can be converted to an amino group, for example, by reaction with thionyl bromide to form PEG-Br, followed by aminolysis with excess ammonia to form PEG-NH2. The PEG-NH2 is then conjugated to the protein of interest using standard coupling reagents, such as Woodward's Reagent K. Furthermore, a PEG-terminal \u2014CH2 OH group can be converted to an aldehyde group, for example, by oxidation with MnO2. The aldehyde group is conjugated to the protein by reductive alkylation with a reagent such as cyanoborohydride.",
        "Alternatively, activated PEGs suitable for use in the present invention can be purchased from a number of vendors. For example, Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, Ala.) sells M-NHS-PEG as \u201cSCM-PEG\u201d in addition to a succinimidyl carbonate of methoxy-PEG (\u201cSC-PEG\u201d) and methoxy-PEG succinimidyl propionate (\u201cSPA-PEG\u201d).",
        "The degree of pegylation of an hGH variant of the present invention can be adjusted to provide a desirably increased in vivo half-life, compared to the corresponding non-pegylated protein. It is believed that the half-life of a pegylated core or hybrid polypeptide typically increases incrementally with increasing degree of pegylation.",
        "It is to be understood that the present invention also contemplates peptide analogues wherein one or more amide linkage is optionally replaced with a linkage other than amide, preferably a substituted amide or an isostere of amide. See, e.g., Spatola (1983) in \u201cChemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins,\u201d Volume VII, (Weinstein, ed.), Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 267-357, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "Thus, while the amino acid residues within peptides are generally described in terms of amino acids, and preferred embodiments of the invention are exemplified by way of peptides, one having skill in the art will recognize that in embodiments having non-amide linkages, the term \u201camino acid\u201d or \u201cresidue\u201d as used herein refers to other bifunctional moieties bearing groups similar in structure to the side chains of the amino acids. Such modifications can also be present within the core polypeptides of the hybrid polypeptides of the invention, whether or not they are present in the enhancer sequence/sequences of the particular hybrid polypeptide.",
        "In addition, one or more of the amino acid residues of the hybrid polypeptide may be blocked.",
        "Additionally, one or more amide linkages of the hybrid polypeptide can be replaced with peptidomimetic or amide mimetic moieties which do not significantly interfere with the structure or activity of the peptides. Suitable amide mimetic moieties are described, for example, in Olson et al., 1993, J. Med. Chem. 36:3049.",
        "Peptide mimetics of the polypeptides of the invention are also intended to fall within the scope of the present invention. Peptide mimetics are structures which serve as substitutes for peptides or portions of peptides (see Morgan et al., 1989, Ann. Reports Med. Chem. 24:243-252 for a review of peptide mimetics). Peptide mimetics, as used herein, include synthetic structures which may or may not contain amino acids and/or peptide bonds, but retain the structural and functional features of a core or hybrid polypeptide. For instance, non-hydrolyzable peptide analogs of amino acid residues can be generated using benzodiazepine (e.g., see Freidinger et al. in Peptides: Chemistry and Biology, G. R. Marshall ed., ESCOM Publisher: Leiden, Netherlands, 1988), azepine (e.g., see Huffman et al. in Peptides: Chemistry and Biology, G. R. Marshall ed., ESCOM Publisher: Leiden, Netherlands, 1988), substituted gamma lactamn rings (Garvey et al. in Peptides: Chemistry and Biology, G. R. Marshall, ed., ESCOM Publisher: Leiden, Netherlands, 1988), keto-methylene pseudopeptides (Ewenson et al. (1986) J. Med. Chem. 29:295; and Ewenson et al. in Peptides: Structure and Function (Proceedings of the 9th American Peptide Symposium) Pierce Chemical Co. Rockland, Ill., 1985), \u03b2-turn dipeptide cores (Nagai et al., 1985, Tetrahedron Lett 26:647; and Sato et al., 1986, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1:1231), and \u03b1-aminoalcohols (Gordon et al., 1985, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 126:419; and Dann et al., 1986, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 134:71).",
        "Further included as part of the invention are peptide libraries, comprising collections of core and/or hybrid polypeptides, including phage display libraries expressing such core and/or hybrid polypeptides.",
        "Enhancer peptide sequences can be used to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of the core polypeptide as either N-terminal, C-terminal, or - and C-terminal additions. While it is preferable for the enhancer peptide sequences to be utilized in a pairwise fashion, that is, preferably hybrid polypeptides comprise an enhancer peptide sequence at both the amino- and carboxy-termini, hybrid polypeptides can also comprise a single enhancer peptide, said peptide present at either the amino- or carboxy-terminus of the hybrid polypeptide. Further, the enhancer peptides can be used in either forward or reverse orientation, or in any possible combination, linked to a core polypeptide. It is noted that any of the enhancer peptides can be introduced at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the core polypeptide. Still further, multiple enhancer peptide sequences can be introduced to the N-, C-, or N- and C-terminal positions of the hybrid polypeptides. Multiple enhancer peptide sequences can be linked directly one to another via the same sorts of linkages as used to link an enhancer peptide sequence to the core polypeptide (see below). In addition, an intervening amino acid sequence of the same sort as described below can also be present between one or more of the multiple enhancer peptide sequences. Multiple enhancer peptide sequences will typically contain from 2 to about 10 individual enhancer peptide sequences (of the same or different amino acid sequence), with about 2 to about 4 being preferred.",
        "It is understood that the core polypeptide is generally linked to the enhancer peptides via a peptide amide linkage, although linkages other than amide linkages can be utilized to join the enhancer peptide sequences to the core polypeptides. Such linkages are well known to those of skill in the art and include, for example, any carbon-carbon, ester or chemical bond that functions to link the enhancer peptide sequences of the invention to a core peptide.",
        "Typically, an enhancer peptide sequence is linked directly to a core polypeptide. An enhancer peptide sequence can also be attached to an intervening amino acid sequence present between the enhancer peptide sequence and the core polypeptide. The intervening amino acid sequence can typically range in size from about 1 to about 50 amino acid residues in length, with about 1 to about 10 residues in length being preferred. The same sorts of linkages described for linking the enhancer peptide to the core polypeptide can be used to link the enhancer peptide to the intervening peptide.",
        "As discussed for enhancer peptide sequences, above, core and intervening amino acid sequences need not be restricted to the genetically encoded amino acids, but can comprise any of the amino acid and linkage modifications described above.",
        "The amino- and/or carboxy-termini of the resulting hybrid polypeptide can comprise an amino group (\u2014NH2) or a carboxy (\u2014COOH) group, respectively. Alternatively, the hybrid polypeptide amino-terminus may, for example, represent a protecting group, e.g., a hydrophobic group, including but not limited to carbobenzyl, dansyl, T-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), decanoyl or napthoyl; an acetyl group; 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group; a macromolecular carrier group, including but not limited to lipid-fatty acid conjugates, polyethylene glycol, or carbohydrates; or a modified, non-naturally occurring amino acid residue. Alternatively, the hybrid polypeptide carboxy-terminus can, for example, represent an amido group; a protecting group, e.g., a T-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc); a macromolecular carrier group, including but not limited to lipid-fatty acid conjugates, polyethylene glycol, or carbohydrates; or a modified non-naturally occurring amino acid residue. As a non-limiting example, the amino- and/or carboxy-termini of the resulting hybrid polypeptide can comprise any of the amino- and/or carboxy-terminal modifications depicted in the peptides shown in FIG. 13 or Table 2, below.",
        "Typically, a hybrid polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence that is a non-naturally occurring amino acid sequence. That is, typically, the amino acid sequence of a hybrid polypeptide, does not consist solely of the amino acid sequence of a fragment of an endogenous, naturally occurring polypeptide. In addition, a hybrid polypeptide is not intended to consist solely of a full-length, naturally occurring polypeptide.",
        "Core polypeptides can comprise any polypeptide which may be introduced into a living system, for example, any polypeptide that can function as a pharmacologically useful polypeptide. Such core polypeptides can, for example, be useful for the treatment or prevention of disease, or for use in diagnostic or prognostic methods, including in vivo imaging methods. The lower size limit of a core polypeptide is typically about 4-6 amino acid residues. There is, theoretically, no core polypeptide upper size limit and, as such a core polypeptide can comprise any naturally occurring polypeptide or fragment thereof, or any modified or synthetic polypeptide. Typically, however, a core polypeptide ranges from about 4-6 amino acids to about 494-500 amino acids, with about 4 to about 94-100 amino acid residues being preferred and about 4 to about 34-40 amino acid residues being most preferred.",
        "Examples of possible core polypeptides, provided solely as example and not by way of limitation, include, but are not limited to, growth factors, cytokines, therapeutic polypeptides, hormones, e.g., insulin, and peptide fragments of hormones, inhibitors or enhancers of cytokines, peptide growth and differentiation factors, interleukins, chemokines, interferons, colony stimulating factors, angiogenic factors, receptor ligands, agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists, peptide targeting agents such as imaging agents or cytotoxic targeting agents, and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin and integrin to name a few. In addition, possible core polypeptides may include viral or bacterial polypeptides that may function either directly or indirectly as immunogens or antigens, and thus may be useful in the treatment or prevention of pathological disease.",
        "Representative examples of hybrid polypeptides which comprise core polypeptides derived from viral protein sequences are shown in FIG. 13, wherein the core polypeptide sequences are shaded. Core polypeptides also include, but are not limited to, the polypeptides disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,464,933, 5,656,480 and WO 96/19495, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "Core polypeptide sequences can further include, but are not limited to the polypeptide sequences depicted in Table 2, and in the Example presented in Section 11, below. It is noted that the peptides listed in Table 2 include hybrid polypeptides in addition to core polypeptides. The sequence of the hybrid polypeptides will be apparent, however, in light of the terminal enhancer peptide sequences present as part of the hybrid polypeptides.",

        "It is to be understood that the peptides listed in Table 2 and in the Example presented in Section 11, below, are also intended to fall within the scope of the present invention. As discussed above, those peptides depicted in Table 2 and in the Example presented, below, that do not already contain enhancer peptide sequences (that is, do not represent hybrid polypeptides) can be utilized in connection with the enhancer peptide sequences and teaching provided herein to generate hybrid polypeptides. Further, the core polypeptides and the core polypeptide of the hybrid polypeptides shown in Table 2, FIG. 13 and the Example presented in Section 11, below, can be used with any of the enhancer peptide sequences described herein to routinely produce additional hybrid polypeptides, which are also intended to fall within the scope of the present invention.",
        "For example, peptide DP397, depicted in the Example presented in Section 11 represents a core polypeptide, and is intended to fall within the scope of the present invention. In addition, hybrid polypeptides comprising the DP397 core polypeptide plus one or more enhancer polypeptide sequences described herein are also intended to fall within the scope of the present invention.",
        "It is noted that while a number of the polypeptides listed in Table 2 and FIG. 13 are depicted with modified, e.g., blocked amino and/or carboxy termini or d-isomeric amino acids (denoted by residues within parentheses), it is intended that any polypeptide comprising a primary amino acid sequence as depicted to Table 2 and FIG. 13 is also intended to be part of the present invention.",
        "The core polypeptide sequences, per se, shown in Table 2, FIG. 13 and the Example presented, below, in Section 11, as well as the hybrid polypeptides comprising such core polypeptides, can exhibit antiviral, and/or anti-fusogenic activity and/or can exhibit an ability to modulate intercellular processes that involve coiled-coil peptide structures. In addition, such peptides can also be utilized as part of screening methods for identifying compounds, including peptides, with such activities. Among the core polypeptide sequences are, for example, ones which have been derived from individual viral protein sequences. Also among the core polypeptide sequences are, for example, ones whose amino acid sequences are derived from greater than one viral protein sequence (e.g., an HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV-derived core polypeptide).",
        "In addition, such core polypeptides can exhibit amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions as discussed, above, for enhancer polypeptide sequences. In instances wherein the core polypeptide exhibits antiviral and/or antifusogenic activity such modifications preferably do not abolish (either per se or as part of a hybrid polypeptide) this activity.",
        "With respect to amino acid deletions, it is preferable that the resulting core polypeptide is at least about 4-6 amino acid residues in length. With respect to amino acid insertions, preferable insertions are no greater than about 50 amino acid residues, and, more preferably no more than about 15 amino acid residues. It is also preferable that core polypeptide insertions be amino- and/or carboxy-terminal insertions.",
        "Among the amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions of the core or hybrid polypeptides of the invention are ones which correspond to amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions found in mutants, e.g., naturally occurring mutants, of the endogenous protein sequence from which a particular core polypeptide is derived.",
        "For example, if the core polypeptide is derived from a viral protein, and this core polypeptide (either per se or as part of a hybrid polypeptide) exhibits antiviral activity against that or another virus, it is possible that variants (e.g., variant strains) of the virus may exist or may ultimately arise that exhibit some level of resistance to the peptide relative to the peptide's antiviral effect on the virus strain from which the original endogenous core polypeptide sequence was derived.",
        "In order to generate core polypeptides that exhibit antiviral activity toward such resistant virus strains, modifications to the original core polypeptide can be introduced. In particular, isolates of the resistant virus can readily be isolated by one of skill in the art using standard techniques. Determination of the sequence within the resistant virus corresponding to the original core polypeptide can also routinely be determined and compared to the original core polypeptide.",
        "In the event the corresponding sequence obtained from the mutant, resistant strain differs from the sequence of the core polypeptide, modifications to the core polypeptide can be introduced such that the resulting modified core polypeptide has the same sequence as the corresponding region in the resistant virus.",
        "The resulting modified core polypeptide, either per se or as part of a hybrid polypeptide, will exhibit antiviral properties against the viral strain that had been resistant to the original core polypeptide. Such methods can be utilized, therefore, to identify core polypeptides that exhibit antiviral activity against virus strains that are or have become resistant to the antiviral activity of other core polypeptides.",
        "One particular, but non-limiting example of the successful use of such a method to produce a modified core polypeptide that exhibits antiviral activity against a viral strain resistant to a \u201cparent\u201d core polypeptide is described in the Example presented, below, in Section 11.",
        "In one embodiment, such modified core polypeptides that exhibit antiviral activity against strains resistant to the \u201cparent\u201d core polypeptide are ones in which amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions have been introduced which modify the \u201cparent\u201d core polypeptide such that an N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation consensus sequence that was present in the \u201cparent\u201d core polypeptide has been abolished in the resulting modified core polypeptide.",
        "For example, the consensus sequence for an N-glycosylation site is -N-X-S/T, where S/T is either serine or threonine and X is any amino acid except proline or aspartic acid. Thus, in one embodiment, a parent core polypeptide exhibiting such a consensus sequence can be modified via amino acid insertion, substitution and/or deletion such that this consensus sequence is abolished in the modified core polypeptide.",
        "Among such amino and/or carboxy-terminal insertions are ones which comprise amino acid sequences amino and/or carboxy to the endogenous protein sequence from which the core polypeptide is derived. For example, if the core polypeptide is derived from gp41 protein, such an insertion would comprise an amino and/or carboxy-terminal insertion comprising a gp41 amino acid sequence adjacent to the gp41 core polypeptide sequence. Such amino and/or carboxy terminal insertions can typically range from about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 amino acid residues amino to and/or carboxy to the original core polypeptide.",
        "The hybrid polypeptides of the invention can still further comprise additional modifications that readily allow for detection of the polypeptide. For example, the hybrid polypeptides can be labeled, either directly or indirectly. Peptide labeling techniques are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, radioactive, fluorescent and colorimetric techniques. Indirect labeling techniques are also well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, biotin/streptavidin labeling and indirect antibody labeling.",
        "The invention further relates to the association of the enhancer polypeptide sequences to types of molecules other than peptides. For example, the enhancer peptide sequences may be linked to nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DNA or RNA) or any type of small organic molecule for the purpose of enhancing the pharmacokinetic properties of said molecules.",
        "The enhancer, core and hybrid polypeptides of the invention may be synthesized or prepared by techniques well known in the art. See, for example, Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman and Co., NY, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Hybrid polypeptides may be prepared using conventional step-wise solution or solid phase synthesis, fragment condensation, Fmoc or Boc chemistry. (see, e.g., Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins, Williams et al., Eds., 1997, CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla., and references cited therein; Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, Atherton & Sheppard, Eds., 1989, IRL Press, oxford, England, and references cited therein). Likewise the amino- and/or carboxy-terminal modifications.",
        "In general, these methods can comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids or suitably protected amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complementary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected, under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth. After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, remaining protecting groups and any solid support can be removed either sequentially or concurrently to afford the desired final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling (under condition that do not racemize chiral centers) a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide.",
        "Typical protecting groups include T-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), benxyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos); 2,4-dinitrophenyl, benzyl (Bzl), biphenylisopropyloxy-carboxycarbonyl, cyclohexyl, isopropyl, acetyl, o-nitrophenylsulfonyl, and the like. Of these, Boc and Fmoc are preferred.",
        "Typical solid supports are generally cross-linked polymeric materials. These include, but are not limited to, divinylbenzene cross-linked styrene-based polymers, for example, divinylbenzene-hydroxymethylstyrene copolymers, divinylbenzene-chloromethylstyrene copolymers, and divinylbenzene-benzhydrylaminopolystyrene copolymers. Such copolymers offer the advantage of directly introducing a terminal amide functional group into the peptide chain, which function is retained by the chain when the chain is cleaved from the support.",

A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a patient. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (e.g., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the fusogenic event, such as a half-maximal inhibition of viral infection relative to the amount of the event in the absence of the test compound) as determined in cell culture.

A TC50 was determined in this assay by incubating cells in the presence and absence of serially diluted peptide followed by the addition of XTT. In surviving/metabolizing cells XTT is reduced to a soluble brown dye, XTT-formazan. Absorbance is read and comparisons made between readings in the presence and absence of peptide to determine a TC50 utilizing the Karber method (see. e.g., Lennette, E.

Two weeks after reconstitution with HuPBMCs, mice were infected IP on day 0 with 103 TCID50 HIV-1 9320 passed in PBMCs (AZT-sensitive isolate A018). Treatment with peptides was IP, bid, for total daily doses of 67 mg/kg (T20), 20 mg/kg (T1249), 6.7 mg/kg (T1249), 2.0 mg/kg (T1249), and 0.67 mg/kg (T1249), for 8 days beginning on day \u22121. The extent of infection in blood cells, splenocytes, lymph nodes, and peritoneal cells was assayed by quantitative co-culture with human PBMC blasts weekly for three consecutive weeks following animal exsanguinations and tissue harvest (day 7, approx. 12 to 18 hours following last drug treatment). Co-culture supernatants were evaluated for HIV-1 p24 antigen production as a measure of virus infection. Infectious virus was not detectable in the blood or lymph tissues of the T20-treated animals, although, virus was detected in the peritoneal washes and spleen preparation. All compartments were negative for infectious virus at the 6.7 mg/kg dose of T1249, indicating at least a 10-fold improvement over T20 treatment. At the 2.0 mg/kg dose of T1249, both the lymph and the spleen were completely free of detectable infectious virus, with a 2 log10 reduction in virus titer in the peritoneal wash and a 1 log10 reduction in virus titer in the blood, compared to infected controls. At the lowest dose of T1249, 0.67 mg/kg, the peritoneal washes and blood were equivalent to infected control; however, at least a 1 log10 drop in infectious virus titer was observed in both the lymph and the spleen tissues. Overall, the results indicate that T1249 is between 30 and 100-fold more potent against HIV-1 9320, in vivo, under these conditions.",

The resulting plasma samples were evaluated using fluorescence HPLC to estimate peptide quantities in extracted plasma. The beta-phase half-life and total AUC of T1249 was nearly three times greater than T20 (FIG. 5).",

Nonspecific binding was defined as binding of the radioligand in the presence of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled peptide. Specific binding was the difference between total and nonspecific binding. The results demonstrate that 125I-T1249 and 125I-T20 have similar binding affinities of 1-2 nM. Linear inverse Scatchard plots suggests that each ligand binds to a homogeneous class of sites.",

The time course for association and dissociation is shown in FIG. 8. Dissociation of bound radioligand was measured following the addition of unlabeled peptide to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM in one-tenth of the total assay volume. Initial on- and off-rates for 125I-T1249 were significantly slower than those of 125I-T20.

Ligand was added just after the unlabeled peptide to start the incubation. The competition curves shown in FIG. 9 suggest that although both ligands have similar affinities, a higher concentration of either unlabeled T20 or T1249 is required to fully compete for bound 125I-T1249.",

FIG. 14A illustrates the CD spectrum of T1249 alone in solution (10 \u03bcM, 1\u00b0 C.). The spectrum is typical of peptides which adopt an alpha-helical structure. In particular, deconvolution of this spectrum using single value decomposition with a basis set of 33 protein spectra predicts the helix content of T1249 (alone in solution) to be 50%. FIG. 14B illustrates a representative CD spectrum of T1249 mixed with T1346. The closed squares (\u25aa) represent a theoretical CD spectrum predicted for a \u201cnon-interaction model\u201d wherein the peptides are hypothesized to not interact in solution.

However, when T1249 is incubated with M41\u0394178 prior to addition of proteinase-K (FIG. 15, lane 7), a protected HR-1 fragment of approximately 6500 Daltons results. Sequencing of the protected fragment demonstrates that it corresponds to a region of primary sequence located within the ectodomain of gp41. The protected fragment encompasses the soluble HR1 peptide (T1346) used in the CD studies described in Section 7.2.9 above, and further contains an additional seven amino acid residues located on the amino terminus. This protection can be attributed to the binding of T1249 to a specific sequence of gp41 which is contained in the M41\u0394178 construct.",

SEQ ID NO:1144) which comprises the core polypeptide T1323 amino acid sequence coupled with enhancer peptides at its amino- and carboxy-termini. As demonstrated in FIG. 12A and 12B, the T1324 hybrid peptide exhibited a significantly increased half-life when compared to the T1323 core peptide which lacks the enhancer peptide sequences.",
        "T1249, depicted in FIG. 13, is a hybrid polypeptide comprising enhancer peptide sequences linked to a core polypeptide derived from a mix of viral sequences. As demonstrated in the Example presented in Section 7 above, the T1249 hybrid polypeptide exhibits enhanced pharmacokinetic properties and potent in vitro as well as in vivo activity against HIV-1. In the example presented below, the pharmacological properties of T1249 in both rodent and primate animal models are further described.",
        "T1249 was administered to Sprague-Dawley albino rats in a single dose administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion (SCI), subcutaneous (SC) injection or intravenous (IV) injection. Each treatment group consisted of nine rats per sex per group. The groups received sterile preparations of T1249 bulk drug substance at a dose of 0.5, 2.0, or 6.5 mg/kg by CSI. One group received 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 8.5, administered as a control. The peptides were given for 12 hours via a polyvinyl chloride/polyethylene catheter surgically implanted subcutaneously in the nape of the neck. Two groups received a single dose of T1249 at a dose of 1.2 or 1.5 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection into the intrascapular region. Two groups received a single dose of T1249 at a dose of 1.5 or 5 mg/kg via intravenous injection. The actual milligram amount of T1249 was calculated using the peptide content that was determined for the batch administrated.",
        "Endpoints for analysis included cageside observations (twice daily for mortality and moribundity), clinical observations, clinical laboratory parameters, body weight and necropsy. Blood samples were obtained by a sparse sampling technique over a 12 hour time period from three rats per sex per group at each of the following times: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 19, and 12 hours after dose administration. Sample analysis was performed using a PcAb ECLIA assay (Blackburn, G. et al., 1991, Clin. Chem. 37:1534-1539; Deaver, D., 1995, Nature 377:758).",
        "For plasma and lymphatic pharmacokinetic analysis of T1249 in rats, T1249 was prepared as a sterile solution in bicarbonate buffer and administered as a single dose, bolus intravenous injection into the lateral tail vain at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Blood was collected from the animal from an in-dwelling jugular catheter. Samples were collected immediately after dosing and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration. For the analysis of lymphatic fluids, samples were taken immediately before dosing and every 20 minutes for the first six hours after dosing. Lymphatic fluid was collected from a catheter placed directly into the thoracic lymphacic duct as previously described (Kirkpatrick and Silver, 1970, The Journal of Surgical Research 10:147-158). The concentrations of T1249 in plasma and lymphatic fluid were determined using a standard T1249 Competitive ELISA assay (Hamilton, G. 1991, p. 139, in \u201cImmunochemistry of Solid-Phase Immunoassay,\u201d, Butler, J., ed., CRC Press, Boston).",
        "Sterile preparations of T1249 bulk drug substance were administered to cynomolgus monkeys in single doses administered by subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection. In a sequential crossover design, one group of animals consisting of two per sex received a single bolus dose of T1249 by IV (0.8 mg/kg), IM (0.8 mg/kg) or SC (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/kg) injection. A washout period of at least three days separated each dosing day. Lyophilized T1249 was reconstituted in sterile phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 immediately prior to dosing. The actual milligram amount of test article was calculated using the peptide content that was determined for the batch administered.",
        "Endpoints for analysis included cageside observations, physical examinations and body weight. For the IV phase of the study, blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes at the following time points: immediately after dosing, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. For the IM and SC phases of the study blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes from each animal at the following time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Plasma samples were prepared within one hour of collection and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples analysis was performed using a PcAb ECLIA assay (Blackburn, G. et al., 1991, Clin. Chem. 37:1534-1539; Deaver, D., 1995, Nature 377:758).",
        "Six male cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned to three groups consisting of two animals per group. All doses of T1249 were given by bolus subcutaneous injection. The study was divided into two sessions. In Session 1, animals in groups 1, 2 and 3 received a sterile preparation of T1249 bulk drug substance (i.e., bulk T1249 dissolved in carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 8.5) twice daily for four consecutive days (Study Days 1-4) at doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg/dose, respectively. A ten day washout period separated Session 1 and Session 2. In Session 2, animals in groups 1, 2, and 3 received a sterile preparation of T1249 drug product (i.e., in aqueous solution, pH 6.5, plus mannitol) twice daily for four consecutive days (Study Days 15-18) at doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg/dose, respectively.",
        "Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were collected on Study Days 1 and 15 to assess single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters, and on Study Days 4 and 18 to assess steady-state plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. Samples were collected at the following times: immediately pre-dose, and 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 12.0 hours post-dose. Animals were monitored during Sessions 1 and 2 for clinical signs and changes in body weight.",
        "Rat models were used to perform an initial assessment of plasma pharmacokinetics and distribution of T1249.

        "Rats that received T1249 by CSI achieved steady-state plasma peptide concentrations approximately four hours after administration. Both the steady-state concentration in plasma (Cpss) and calculated area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) were directly proportional to the administered dose, indicating that T1249 displays linear pharmacokinetics within the tested dose range of 0.5 to 6.5 mg/kg.

        "The kinetic data for both plasma and lymph concentrations of T1249 are illustrated in FIG. 16C and tabulated below in Table 12. T1249 rapidly penetrated into the lymphatic system and equilibrated with the plasma reservoir of drug within approximately one hour after administration. Following equilibration between the two compartments, plasma and lymph levels of drug were comparable out to three hours post-dosing in four out of five animals. One animal had consistently lower concentrations of T1249 in the lymph than the other animals, however this animal's lymph elimination profile was indistinguishable from other members of the group. Comparison of the elimination phase half-life (t1/2) for plasma and lymph suggest that the transit of T1249 between these two compartments is a diffusion-controlled process. After three hours, there appeared to be a second, more rapid elimination phase from the lymphatic system. This difference could be mechanism-based (e.g., due to redistribution or accelerated peptide degradation in the lymph) or due to other factors. The concentration of T1249 in lymphatic fluid six hours post-injection is greater than the IC90 for viral infectivity for common laboratory strains and for primary clinical isolates of HIV-1.",

A direct comparison of the shapes of the plasma concentration-time curves in the present study and the shapes of curves from a previous study-in cynomolgus monkeys suggests that there is a depot effect when T1249 is administered by subcutaneous injection.
