    "abstract": "A sequential color system with reduced or eliminated global temporal notching losses may be implemented with a buffered display panel. Fast global blanking and/or inter-field images may be used to reduce or eliminate the global temporal notching losses. When consecutive states of a pixel are \u201con,\u201d an inter-field image may be displayed by maintaining the pixel in an \u201con\u201d state instead of turning the pixel \u201coff\u201d and then turning the pixel \u201con.\u201d This improves the color brightness and saturation. The display may be implemented with a color wheel or with a color switch.",

        "A progressive-scan active matrix display panel may be written line-by-line to operate in a scrolling mode with continuous viewing. The brightness and color saturation are reduced in sequential systems, which illuminate a large portion or the entire active matrix display panel with a rapid succession of different colors, because of the blanking times used to write images onto the active matrix display panel. The blanking time may be increased by many factors. For example, the time required to write the entire display, the settling time or switching time of the display, the transition time between colors for the light source, and other factors. Accordingly, an active matrix display panel and driving methods are needed that improve one or more of color saturation, brightness, and blanking time.",

        "FIG. 1 illustrates the timing diagram of a prior art color wheel based projector. The timing diagram illustrates the time that a black segment blocks illumination from the color wheel. Initially, the black segment reduces or blocks light from a first color field or section as the color wheel transitions from illuminating a display panel to a dark state. Next, the black segment blocks the light from the color wheel while the liquid crystal is allowed to change states. This interval is represented by \u03c4LC in FIG. 1. For a progressive scan panel, \u03c4LC may also include the time required to write the data. Finally, the black segment reduces or blocks light from a second color field or section as the color wheel transitions from the dark state to illuminating the display panel. The light from the color wheel may be utilized by the panel during a transition time \u03c4c, to the black state which is part of the color transition time. The brightness varies from 0% to 100% during the transition and has an average brightness of 50%.",

The color wheel then begins illuminating with the next color section and full transmission occurs after another transition time \u03c4c that goes from the black state to a color transmissive state. This results in global temporal notching. The total light loss from the global temporal notching is (\u03c4c+\u03c4LC)/\u03c4F, where \u03c4F is the field duration. In FIG. 1, the global temporal, in certain instances depending on the different relevant periods, notching loss is a fixed loss that occurs irrespective of pixels states and reduces the brightness by 10-30%.",
        "Frame buffered silicon backplane liquid crystal display (LCD) panels such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,225,991, 6,295,054 and 6,369,832, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, allow additional functionality to be incorporated into the addressing structure, in part, through the fabrication of multiple transistors and/or other elements beneath each pixel. One function that may be incorporated into frame buffered silicon backplane LCD panels is the simultaneous switching of a block of pixels of the display or the entire display. This substantially reduces the writing time of the display, which results in a substantially reduced blanking time. Since the entire display is simultaneously switched, the blanking time may be limited to the response time of the liquid crystal. Thus, the brightness of the display is increased due to the reduced blanking time, which causes a greater percentage of the light source light to be utilized.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates the timing diagram of a buffered display with a rapid global panel blanking function that reduces the global temporal notching. The width of the blanking notch shown in FIG. 2 may be narrowed by providing a rapid global panel blanking function. However, a compromise between color saturation and brightness may need to be made since the depth and duration of the global temporal notching dictates the extent of color mixing and therefore, the color coordinates. Thus, the black segments (as shown by the 0% color wheel transmission regions) are still included in FIG. 2 in order to eliminate color mixing. Although improved, FIG. 2 still has global temporal notching losses.",
        "The above reduction in global temporal notching losses may be achieved by using a normally white panel and exploiting the asymmetric switching of nematic liquid crystals. By driving all pixels with a high voltage after viewing a field, a global black state may be obtained in less than 100 microseconds. White pixels immediately begin relaxing to a fully transmissive state while black pixels remain driven high. Still further reductions may be achieved by having the color wheel transition to the subsequent field while on-pixels of the panel are relaxing to the fully transmissive state, as shown in FIG. 2.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates a timing diagram for a two-panel system using inter-field images. One panel of the two-panel system is a fixed color panel while the other panel sequentially alternates between two, or more, colors. This example corresponds to a red panel used in combination with a sequential blue-green panel. The two-panel system of FIG. 3 operates by switching a fully saturated blue pixel to a black state while keeping a fully saturated green pixel in the black state. However, when two consecutive fields are transmitted such as for a white or cyan pixel, a pixel may be maintained in the fully transmitting state. An inter-field image provides pixel-by-pixel control of temporal notching, or local temporal notching. The inter-field image is displayed during the transition between color fields and during the time a pixel would otherwise be changing states. The local temporal notching may be accomplished using a frame-buffered panel with sufficient speed that two or more images can be written during the transition between fields.",
        "Inter-field images may be provided by the additional functionality programmed into a buffered panel. This inter-field image allows for the substantial reduction of global temporal notching losses for consecutive \u201con\u201d states. Additionally, the black segment may be eliminated due to the use of a buffered panel. In a system without a black segment on the color wheel, the global temporal notching losses for consecutive \u201con\u201d color fields may be eliminated.",
        "For FIG. 3, the panels may utilize a symmetric switching time where the black pixels settle in time \u03c4LC Once a set of data is transferred to a panel, a new data set is loaded into the frame buffers such that the data set may be rapidly transferred to the panel. An exemplary method of operation is beginning to turn a pixel \u201coff\u201d at time \u03c4w1 when the state is to be changed from \u201con\u201d to \u201coff\u201d, beginning to turn a pixel \u201con\u201d at a time \u03c4W2 when the state is to changed from \u201coff\u201d to \u201con\u201d and maintaining a pixel in its current state when the state is not to be changed. The delay between \u03c4W1 and \u03c4W2 depends upon the panel load time and the liquid crystal response time. The delay is determined by the amount of switching overlap that is tolerable given the saturation requirements provided, the load time and response time are not limiting factors. Thus, a white or cyan pixel will remain in the fully transmitting state and have zero or substantially zero global temporal notching losses while a pixel transitioning between \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states (e.g., pixel is green or blue and not cyan) will have global temporal notching losses. This is shown by the constantly \u201con\u201d panel transmission state of the white/cyan pixel transmission. Other degrees of saturation permit analog control of local temporal notching, such that a particular pastel may have a notch with 50% depth.",
        "Further to pixel transitions from one transmission level to another transmission level, in some instances the relative transmission levels from one field to another may be close enough such that it may be desirable that the pixel value not be reset between fields. For example, the transmission level of a pixel in one field may be within 20% of the transmission level of that pixel in the next field. In such instance, it may be desirable to give that pixel a transmission level of between the two field transmission levels as a part of the inter-field image. Thus, for instance, if a pixel transmission level is 50% in a first field and as 70% in a second field, the inter-field image may be used to update the pixel value to be 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or some other value depending on design considerations.",
        "System level performance improvement may be realized by incorporating local temporal notching into the panel when the color modulator is also free from global temporal notching. Color wheels, for example, have a color mixing interval due to the finite spot size on the spokes and do not have a system level performance improvement. A black segment is typically incorporated to eliminate this color mixing time, thereby causing global temporal notching loss. Conversely, a color modulator with insignificant color mixing time is free from global temporal notching. Thus, a color modulator with insignificant color mixing time will have the benefits of panel local temporal notching.",
        "As an alternative to the color wheel, a color switch can pass red in all voltage states, while rapidly modulating between full transmission of blue with no green, and full transmission of green with no blue (magenta/yellow color switch). Such a device can be implemented using a one-bit switch using color-selective light modulator technology such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,996, which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "A crossed \u03c0-cell switch allows fast switching in both directions. In the 00 state (0=V-low and 1=V-high), magenta is transmitted. When one cell is energized, yellow is transmitted (half-wave state). When the second cell is energized (11-state), magenta is again transmitted. When both cells are returned to the 00-state there is no change in the optical state. In such a configuration, 10-20 microsecond switching may be obtained between both magenta/yellow and yellow/magenta using 20-30 volt signal. Alternatively, ferroelectric liquid crystals or other materials may be used which provide appropriate switching times in a single cell.",
        "Thus, field sequential projection systems with frame-buffered display panels that add one or more inter-field images may have improved brightness and color saturation. A system comprising a panel that provides local temporal notching, and a 10-20 microsecond color modulator may provide both saturated primaries with almost complete elimination of temporal notching of white pixels.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a exemplary block diagram for a sequential color system with frame buffering 400. Shown in FIG. 4 is a display 402 having a plurality of pixels 404. Buffers 406, 408, and 410 are provided, which store transmission states for multiple frames or fields of image data. Illustrated in this figure is buffering (buffers 406, 408, and 410) for a single pixel, and that buffering might provide a single bit of storage per pixel per buffer, for example when a pixel has two possible states\u2014on and off. Alternatively, the buffering might provide multiple bits (e.g., 8 or 16 bits) of storage such as when a transmission value is provided for each pixel. The buffers in this example are provided in serial order, such that buffer 408 would contain the image data presently being displayed on the display panel 402 and buffer 406 would contain the image data to be presented in the next field or frame. The buffer 410 is provided in this example to store inter-field image data, whereby the microprocessor could compare the data being displayed in the display 402 to the data to be displayed in the next field, and in those instances where the pixel data is the same or is to have a transmission state (or transmissivity) that is relatively close to the next field or frame image, then that pixel may be kept in its present state or updated in the inter-field buffer 410 with inter-field image data to be applied between the fields or frames in order to improve image performance. The microprocessor or other controller (such as a specialized display controller) 420 is operable to supervise the operations of the buffers 406, 408, and 410, the comparison of pixel data between the buffers 406 and 408, the computation and storage of inter-field image data into the inter-field data buffer 410, and the transfer of data among the buffers 406, 408, 410 and the display 402.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates a exemplary block diagram for another sequential color system with frame buffering 500. Shown in FIG. 4 are two display panels 502, 503, whose light output can be combined in different fashions to produce a single color image using the image separation and combination block 525 with its image output 526. This embodiment operates in a similar manner to the embodiment of FIG. 4, but there are provided separate sets of buffers for each panel in this embodiment. Thus, buffers 506, 508, and 510 provide the roles described for buffers 406, 408, and 410 respectively as described with respect to FIG. 4, but would be dedicated to display panel 502, whereas buffers 512, 514, and 516 provide those roles but would be dedicated to display panel 503. In the event that one of the display panels handled two colors sequentially, then, the buffers devoted to that panel would have field data for both of those colors stored simultaneously. For example, if the panel 503 was a blue/green panel, the buffer 512 might store green field data while buffer 514 stored blue field data. The inter-field buffer 516 would contain transitional data for optimal handling of the display during transition between the two colors. As before, the microprocessor or other microcontroller 520 would play a supervisory role for these operations, and the buffers might contain one or multiple bits per pixel. The display panels 502, 503 are not illustrated as having pixels, but their form would be similar to the one shown for panel 402, whereby they would each have a multiple buffered pixels and a plurality of buffers would be connected to those plural pixels.",
        "The present invention may be implemented as a two-panel system. For example, a two panel system including a red panel and a blue/green sequential panel. Alternatively, other color combinations may be used. Furthermore, additional sequential and non-sequential panels may be included. For example, the invention can be implemented on a multiple panel display system where individual panels can represent a color (e.g., primary colors red, blue, and green). The pixels of each color panel that have \u201con\u201d state between two colors can be maintained in the \u201con\u201d state during the transition. Alternatively, the present invention may be implemented as a single panel system. Full color single-panel systems may benefit significantly from local temporal notching, since switching time is a substantial percentage of field duration. Other alternative may include various color-mixing intervals since, as a percentage of field time, color-mixing intervals are thus short and have little effect on saturation. Alternatively, the present invention may be applied to monochromatic devices.",
