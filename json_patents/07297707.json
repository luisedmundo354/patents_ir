        "Two different subtypes of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 amd CB2) have been isolated and both belong to the G protein coupled receptor superfamily. An alternative spliced form of CB1, CB1A, has also been described, but it did not exhibit different properties in terms of ligand binding and receptor activation than CB1 (D. Shire, C. Carrillon, M. Kaghad, B. Calandra, M. Rinaldi-Carmona, G. Le Fur, D. Caput, P. Ferrara, J. Biol. Chem. 270 (8) (1995) 3726-31). The CB1 receptor is mainly located in the brain, whereas the CB2 receptor is predominately distributed in the periphery and primarily localized in spleen and cells of the immune system (S. Munro, K. L. Thomas, M. Abu-Shaar, Nature 365 (1993) 61-65). Therefore in order to avoid side effects a CB1-selective compound is desirable.",
        "\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) is the principal psychoactive compound in the Indian hemp (Y. Gaoni, R. Mechoulam, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 86 (1964) 1646), canabis savita (marijuanan), which is used in medicine since ages (R. Mechoulam (Ed.) in \u201cCannabinoids as therapeutic Agents\u201d, 1986, pp. 1-20, CRC Press). \u03949-THC is a non-selective CB1/2 receptor agonist and is available in the USA as dronabinol (marinol\u00ae) for the alleviation of cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) and the reversal of body weight loss experienced by AIDS patients through appetite stimulation. In the UK Nabolinone (LY-109514, Cesamet\u00ae), a synthetic analogue of \u03949-THC, is used for CIE (R. G. Pertwee, Pharmaceut. Sci. 3 (11) (1997) 539-545, E. M. Williamson, F. J. Evans, Drugs 60 (6) (2000) 1303-1314). Anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide) was identified as the endogenous ligand (agonist) for the CB1 receptor (R. G. Pertwee, Curr. Med. Chem., 6 (8) (1999) 635-664; W. A. Devane, L. Hanus, A. Breuer, R. G. Pertwee, L. A. Stevenson, G. Griffin, D. Gibson, A. Mandelbaum, A. Etinger, R. Mechoulam, Science 258 (1992) 1946-9). Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) modulate at the presynaptic nerve teminal negatively adenylate cyclase and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and activate the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (V. Di Marzo, D. Melck, T. Bisogno, L. De Petrocellis, Trends in Neuroscience 21 (12) (1998) 521-8), thereby affecting neurotransmitter release and/or action, which decreases the release of neurotransmitter (A. C. Porter, C. C. Felder, Pharmacol. Ther., 90 (1) (2001) 45-60).",
        "Anandamide as \u03949-THC also increases feeding through CB1 receptor-mediated mechanism. CB1 receptor selective antagonists block the increase in feeding associated with administration of anandamide (C. M. Williams, T. C. Kirkham, Psychopharmacology 143 (3) (1999) 315-317; C. C. Felder, E. M. Briley, J. Axelrod, J. T. Simpson, K. Mackie, W. A. Devane, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90 (16) (1993) 7656-60) and cause appetite suppression and weight loss (G. Colombo, R. Agabio, G. Diaz, C. Lobina, R. Reali, G. L. Gessa, Life Sci. 63 (8) (1998) L113-PL117).",
        "Leptin is the primary signal through which the hypothalamus senses nutritional state and modulates food intake and energy balance. Following temporary food restriction, CB1 receptor knockout mice eat less than their wild-type littermates, and the CB1 antagonist SR141716A reduces food intake in wild-type but not knockout mice. Furthermore, defective leptin signaling is associated with elevated hypothalamic, but not cerebellar, levels of endocannabinoids in obese db/db and ob/ob mice and Zucker rats. Acute leptin treatment of normal rats and ob/ob mice reduces anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in the hypothalamus. These findings indicate that endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus may tonically activate CB1 receptors to maintain food intake and form part of the neural circuitry regulated by leptin (V. Di Marzo, S. K. Goparaju, L. Wang, J. Liu, S. Bitkai, Z. Jarai, F. Fezza, G. I. Miura, R. D. Palmiter, T. Sugiura, G. Kunos, Nature 410 (6830) 822-825).",
        "SR-141716A, a CB1 selective antagonist/inverse agonist is undergoing currently phase III clinical trials for the treatment of obesity. In a double blind placebo-controlled study, at the doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg daily, SR141716 significantly reduced body weight when compared to placebo (F. Barth, M. Rinaldi-Carmona, M. Arnone, H.

        "Compounds of formula ID (compounds of formula I wherein R3 is \u2014NHSO2\u2014R3a, or \u2014NHCO\u2014R3b) can be prepared according to Scheme 1 as follows:",
        "Compounds of formula ID can be prepared from suitable starting materials according to methods known in the art. The conversion of the amino-moiety in IC to access sulfonamides or amides ID (R3=\u2014NHSO2\u2014R3a or \u2014NHCO\u2014R3b; preferably in position 6) can be effected by methods described in literature. For example the conversion of the amine derivatives IC or their respective salts to access compounds of formula ID is effected by reaction of IC with suitable acid chlorides VI or sulfonyl chlorides VII (compounds known or compounds prepared by known methods) respectively in the presence or absence of a solvent and in the presence or the absence of a base. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the solvent to be employed, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or the reagents involved and that it can dissolve the reagents, at least to some extent. Examples for suitable solvents include dichloromethane (DCM), dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the like. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base used in this stage, and any base commonly used in this type of reaction may equally be employed here. Examples of such bases include triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, and the like. The reaction can take place over a wide range of temperatures, and the precise reaction temperature is not critical to the invention. We find it convenient to carry out the reaction with heating from ambient temperature to reflux. The time required for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, a period of from 0.5 h to several days will usually suffice to yield amide or sulfonamide derivatives ID (R3=\u2014NHSO2\u2014R3a or \u2014NHCO\u2014R3b; preferably in position 6).
