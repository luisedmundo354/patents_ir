        "The present invention relates to electronic commerce in general, and, more particularly, to a data processing system for providing formula-based computerized auctions.",
        "Currently, there are many computer-based auction systems (e.g., eBay, CommerceOne, SupplierMarket, SupplierOne, MaterialNet, etc.) in which bidders bid against each other in one or more rounds of bidding until the most advantageous bid is reached for a scope as defined by the auction solicitor. These auctions have worked well and have been quite successful in driving prices down in reverse auctions and prices up in forward auctions.",
        "The current interest in computer-based auctions has prompted innovations in the format of auctions. For example, in the prior art, the bidding phase of an auction often lasted for only a few minutes, which is short enough to continuously hold the attention of all of those interested in the outcome of the auction. In contrast, auctions today, like those on eBay for example, typically last for days. Although a longer auction has many advantages, it is too long for any single bidder to continuously monitor the bidding. To alleviate this disadvantage, eBay, for example, enables a bidder to submit a \u201cproxy bid.\u201d A proxy bid is a direction to the auctioneer (e.g., eBay's data processing system, etc.) or other entity to prepare and enter one or more bids in behalf of the bidder under terms and conditions specified by the bidder.",
        "The proxy bid capabilities known in the prior art, however, have their limitations, and, therefore, the need exists for more advantageous kinds of proxy bids and auction formats.",
        "The present invention provides innovations in proxy bidding and auction formats that avoid some of the costs and disadvantages of proxy bids and auction formats in the prior art. In particular, proxy bids in accordance with the illustrative embodiment offer more functionality and more flexibility than proxy bids in the prior art.",
        "In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, a bidder can program a data processing system to enter one or more bids by proxy. To this end, the capabilities offered by the data processing system include, but are not limited to:\n\n    \n    \n        i. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on the identity of one or more bidders in an auction, or\n        ii. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on the absence of one or more bidders from an auction, or\n        iii. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on the bid variables in one or more other bids, or\n        iv. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on the results of another auction, or\n        v. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on default values, or\n        vi. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on the current time, or,\n        vii. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on an external condition or value, or\n        viii. determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on a random (i.e., stochastic) function, or\n        ix. any combination of i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, and viii.\n\nFurthermore, the illustrative embodiment enables the partitioning of the scope of an auction into a plurality of portions such that a bidder can bid on:\n\n        i. one or more portions of the scope, or\n        ii. the entire scope, or\n        iii. both i and ii.\n\nWhen the scope of an auction is partitioned, the winner(s) of the auction is determined in three steps. In the first step, a candidate winning bid for the entire scope is determined. In the second step, the candidate winning bids for each portion of the scope is determined. In the third step, the winner of the auction is determined by deciding which of:\n\n        i. the candidate winning bid for the entire scope, or\n        ii. the sum of the candidate winning bids for each portion of the scope in each way that the scope is partitioned (provided that there is a candidate winning bid for each portion of the scope in the way that the scope is partitioned)\n\nis more advantageous to the auction solicitor. Typically, an auction solicitor will do better when it enables the scope of an auction to be partitioned, and will do better still when it partitions the scope in more, rather than fewer ways.",
        "The illustrative embodiment comprises: entering, at a data processing system, a first bid into the auction from a first bidder; receiving, at the data processing system, a bid package from a second bidder, wherein the bid package directs the data processing system to determine a bid variable based, at least in part, on the identity of the first bidder; and entering, at the data processing system, a second bid into the auction from the second bidder, wherein the second bid comprises the bid variable as determined by the data processing system.",

        "Although data processing system 101 is depicted as only comprising one computer, one local input/output device, one data storage device, one telephone center, one telephone network interface, and one data network interface, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that a data processing system in accordance with the present invention can comprise:\n\n    \n    \n        i. one or more computers, or\n        ii. one or more local input/output devices, or\n        iii. one or more data storage devices, or\n        iv. one or more telephone centers, or\n        v. one or more telephone network interface, or\n        vi. one or more data network interfaces, or\n        vii. any combination of i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, and vii.\n\nwhether any combination of computers, local input/output devices, data storage devices, telephone centers, telephone network interfaces, and data network interfaces are networked (e.g., a wide area network, a local area network, etc.) or not networked (e.g., a sneakernet, etc.), that cooperate to perform the functionality described below and with respect to FIGS. 3 through 5. Furthermore, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the various components of data processing system 101 need not be co-located, but can separated by hundreds or thousands of miles, which various components can be networked (e.g., a wide area network, etc.) or not networked (e.g., a sneakernet, etc.).",
        "FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of the operation of the illustrative embodiment. For pedagogical purposes, the illustrative embodiment will be described in general and then it will be described in conjunction with an illustrative example. In accordance with this specification, the operation of the illustrative embodiment is described in terms of tasks and subtasks rather than steps because, as will be clear to those skilled in the art, some of the described tasks and subtasks can be performed in a single step. Furthermore, the illustrative embodiment is more easily understood when it is described in terms of its constituent tasks and subtasks than if it were described, formalistically, in terms of \u201csteps.\u201d",
        "At task 301, the parameters of an auction are defined and promulgated. Although the auction solicitor typically initiates the need for the auction, and, therefore, the definition of the auction parameters, the auction solicitor might be assisted by consultants in the task of defining the auction parameters. In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, the operator of data processing system 101 can define some or all of the auction parameters. Task 301 is described in detail below and with respect to FIG. 4.",
        "At task 302, the auction is conducted in accordance with the parameters that were defined and promulgated in task 301. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, this includes, but is not limited to, the initiation of the auction, the receipt of bid packages, the execution of proxy bids, the entering of bids into the auction, and the determination of the winning bid or bids. Task 302 is described in detail below and with respect to FIGS. 5 through 7.",
        "FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of the subtasks that compose task 301.",
        "At subtask 401, a scope for the auction is defined. For the purposes of this specification, the \u201cscope\u201d of an auction is defined as what the auction solicitor seeks to provide (e.g., information, money, services, goods, reality, intangible property, intellectual property, etc.) in consideration for what the auction solicitor seeks to acquire (e.g., information, money, services, goods, reality, intangible property, intellectual property, etc.) as a result of the auction.",
        "For example, when an auction solicitor is a cinder block manufacturer who seeks to sell one lot of 5,000 cinder blocks to one of several masons, the scope of the auction might be to provide 5,000 cinder blocks in consideration for an amount of money to be determined as part of the auction. As another example, when the auction solicitor is a taxi and limousine company that seeks a 1-year service contract for its fleet, the scope of the auction might reasonably be to acquire 48 oil changes for the vehicles in its fleet in a 12-month interval in consideration for a number of taxi rides to be determined as part of the auction and an amount of money to be determined as part of the auction.",
        "The scope of the auction advantageously, but not necessarily, defines the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a qualified bid, when any have been indicated by auction solicitor 102 or data processing system 101. In other words, a bid that does not satisfy all of the mandatory and non-discretionary requirements that are indicated is void or voidable at the auction solicitor's election. For example, for the taxi and limousine company that seeks the oil changes for its fleet, the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of the scope of the auction might be that the winning bidder must supply at least five quarts of 10W-40 Mobil\u00ae One\u00ae oil and one Framm\u00ae oil filter in each of the 48 specified oil changes.",
        "The scope of the auction advantageously, but not necessarily, defines the optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bid. The optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bid are not essential elements that a bid must possess in order to be a qualified bid, but are variable factors that affect how the various bids are ranked and the winning bid(s) is/are determined. For example, for the taxi and limousine company that seeks the oil changes for its fleet, there are two optional and discretionary aspects of a qualified bid: (1) the number of taxi rides to be provided by the taxi and limousine company to the winning bidder, and (2) the amount of money to be provided by the taxi and limousine company to the winning bidder. In other words, because the taxi and limousine company seeks to pay for the oil changes with a combination of money and services, each bid will comprise:",
        "1. an indicium of the number of taxi rides, and",
        "2. an indicium of the amount of money",
        "that in combination the bidder is willing to accept in consideration for the oil changes. For example, this enables a first bidder to indicate that it is willing to accept 100 taxi rides and no money in exchange for the oil changes, a second bidder to indicate that it is willing to accept 25 taxi rides and $400 in exchange for the oil changes, and a third bidder to indicate that it is willing to accept no taxi rides and $825 in exchange for the oil changes.",
        "The mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a bid and the optional or discretionary aspects of a bid can involve the same aspect. For example, when an auction solicitor desires to buy a truck, the scope of an auction might specify that a mandatory and non-discretionary aspect of the bid is a two-year warranty and an optional or discretionary aspect of the bid is a warranty for more than two years. In other words, one aspect (e.g., the length of a warranty, etc.) can have both a mandatory and non-discretionary aspect of the bid and an optional or discretionary aspect of the bid so long as there is a clear demarcation of the line between the mandatory and non-discretionary aspect and the optional or discretionary aspect.",
        "The scope of the auction advantageously, but not necessarily, defines the mandatory and non-discretionary requirements of a qualified bidder, when any have been indicated by auction solicitor 102 or data processing system 101. In other words, a bid from a bidder who does not satisfy all of the mandatory and non-discretionary requirements that are indicated is void or voidable at the auction solicitor's election. For example, when an auction solicitor is a corporation that seeks to provide dental care for its employees, the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of the scope of the auction might reasonably be that the bidder, to be a qualified bidder, must hold a current and valid license to practice dentistry.",
        "The scope of the auction advantageously, but not necessarily, defines the optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bidder. The optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bid are not essential elements that a bidder must possess in order to be a qualified bidder, but are factors that affect how the bid from the bidder is compared to other bids and how the winning bid(s) determined. Typically, the optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bidder are framed in terms of a property of the bidder (e.g., how long the bidder has been in business, whether the bidder and the auction solicitor have ever done business before, the bidder's liquidity, etc.). For example, because the taxi and limousine company seeks to enter into a long-term contract, the company might reasonably place a premium in contracting with a bidder who is financially stable and who has been in business for a while. In this case, the scope of the auction might reasonably include as optional or discretionary aspects of the bid: (1) an indicium of the financial stability of the bidder, and (2) an indicium of the length of time that the bidder has been in business.",

        "The values of one or more optional or discretionary aspects of a bid or bidder or a bid and a bidder as submitted in a bid can affect the acceptable range of:\n\n    \n    \n        i. an optional or discretionary aspect of a bid, or\n        ii. an optional or discretionary aspect of a bidder, or\n        iii. a mandatory and nondiscretionary aspect of a bid, or\n        iv. a mandatory and nondiscretionary aspect of a bidder, or\n        v. and combination of i, ii, iii, and iv.\n\nFor example, if as part of a bid, a bidder seeks to carry X dollars of cargo for an auction solicitor, a mandatory and nondiscretionary aspect of the bidder might be that the bidder currently carries at least X dollars in casualty insurance.",
        "In summary, the scope of the auction informs a candidate bidder with a complete and precise definition of:\n\n    \n    \n        i. what the auction solicitor seeks to acquire as a result of the auction,\n        ii. what the auction solicitor seeks to provide as a result of the auction,\n        iii. the mandatory and non-discretionary requirements of a qualified bid,\n        iv. the optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bid,\n        v. the mandatory and non-discretionary requirements of a qualified bidder, and\n        vi. the optional or discretionary aspects of a qualified bidder.\n\nIn accordance with the illustrative embodiment, each bid comprises one or more optional or discretionary aspects (of the bid or of the bidder or of the bid and bidder) that in combination determine the ordinal ranking of the bid with respect to the other bids. As described below, the illustrative embodiment comprises a mechanism for enabling the objective comparison and ordinal ranking of bids that comprise two or more optional or discretionary aspects of the bid or bidder or bid and bidder.",
        "At subtask 402, the format of the auction is established. For example, the format of an auction advantageously specifies, but is not limited to:\n\n    \n    \n        i. when or under what circumstances the auction begins and ends,\n        ii. whether the auction is a sealed-bid auction or not,\n        iii. how many units or lots of the scope will be competed for,\n        iv. whether the scope is partitioned or not, and if so, how,\n        v. whether the auction comprises one or more rounds,\n        vi. how bids are made,\n        vii. what functionality can be provided by data processing system 101 in preparing a proxy bid,\n        viii. how bids are evaluated and compared,\n        ix. whether the ranking of bids will be disclosed while new and revised bids are still accepted, and\n        x. how the winning bid(s) is determined.\n\nFor example, the illustrative embodiment can be used with, for example, one-sided auctions (e.g., the English auction format, the Dutch auction format, the Vickery auction format, the first-price, sealed-bid auction format, and their variants, etc.) and double-sided auctions (e.g., the continuous double auction format, the Double Dutch auction format, the Japanese auction format, and their variants, etc.).",
        "The illustrative embodiment can be used with sealed-bid auctions and non-sealed-bid auctions. For the purposes of this specification, a \u201csealed-bid\u201d auction is defined as an auction that comprises distinct bidding and resolution phases. In a typical sealed-bid auction, some or all of the contents of each bid submitted during the bidding phase are withheld from the bidders until the resolution phase. A sealed-bid auction can comprise a single round or multiple rounds.",
        "In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, the bids are compared and ranked by plugging in the value of the optional or discretionary aspects associated with each bid into a formula to produce a resultant bid and then by ranking the resultant bids based on their relative magnitude. In accordance with the present specification, each of the optional or discretionary aspects of a bid is called a \u201cbid variable.\u201d",
        "In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, data processing system 101 receives T bids in an auction, wherein T is a positive integer greater than zero. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, each bid, bk, wherein k=1 to T, comprises m bid variables, v1,k through vm,k. For the purposes of this specification, a \u201cbid variable\u201d is defined as a discretionary or optional aspect of a bid or bidder. The integrity and public confidence in the auction process is enhanced when the bid variables are defined in such a way that their values can be determined or verified objectively and not subjectively.",
        "A bid variable can be, for example:\n\n    \n    \n        a binary bid variable (e.g., the inclusion or absence of a warranty in a bid, whether the bidder has or has not previously supplied similar scope to the auction solicitor in the past, whether the bidder has small disadvantaged business status, etc.); or\n        an integer bid variable (e.g., the number of workers to be assigned to a project, the number of computers to be tendered, etc.); or\n        a continuous bid variable (e.g., the fuel mileage of a dump truck, the length of time that a warranty will run, etc.).\n\nA binary bid variable has two possible values, TRUE or FALSE. An integer bid variable and a continuous bid variable can have no bounds (i.e., range from negative infinite to positive infinite), or can have a single bound (i.e., v3>34), or can have two bounds (i.e., 34<v3<57), or more than two bounds (i.e., 34<v3<57 or v3>135).",

        "A key aspect of the illustrative embodiment pertaining to the format of the auction involves partitioning the scope of the auction into a plurality of portions along one or more \u201cdimensions.\u201d When the scope of an auction is partitioned along one or more dimensions, a bidder can bid on:\n\n    \n    \n        i. the entire scope, or\n        ii. one or more portions of the scope in each dimension, or\n        iii. both i and ii.",
        "In this case, the auction solicitor advantageously prescribes how the scope is partitioned and promulgates this information as part of the format of the auction.",
        "For example, the scope of an auction involving 100 office buildings in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, comprises many dimensions along which the scope can be partitioned. For example, one dimension is the state in which the buildings are situated and, therefore, the portions can be: a New York portion, a New Jersey portion, and a Connecticut portion. As another example, one dimension is the region in which the buildings are situated and, therefore, the portions can be: a New England portion (i.e., Connecticut) and a non-New England portion (i.e., New York and New Jersey). As yet another example, one dimension is based on the height of the buildings, and, therefore, the portions can be: a high-rise portion and a low-rise portion, or alternatively, buildings 1-5 stories, buildings 6-13 stories, buildings 14-23 stories, and buildings over 23 stories. As still another example, one dimension is the number of employees in the buildings, and, therefore, the portions can be: buildings with fewer than 400 employees and buildings with 400 or more employees. From these examples, it is clearly shown that there are many dimensions along which the scope of an auction can be partitioned and many ways in which each dimension can be partitioned.",
        "When the scope of an auction is partitioned along a dimension, the sum of the portions in that dimension must equal the entire scope of the auction. It will be clear to those skilled in the art how to determine the dimensions along which the scope of an auction can be partitioned. Furthermore, it will be clear to those skilled in the art how to partition the scope in each dimension.",
        "When the scope of an auction is partitioned, the winner(s) of the auction is determined in three steps. In the first step, a candidate winning bid for the entire scope is determined, provided that there is at least one bid for the entire scope. The candidate winning bid for the entire scope is the bid for the entire scope that is most advantageous to the auction solicitor.",
        "In the second step, the candidate winning bid for each portion of each dimension is determined. If there is not at least one bid for each portion in a given dimension, then all of the bids for all of the portions in that dimension are disqualified because no combination of bids for portions in that dimension will equal the entire scope of the auction. The candidate winning bid for each portion is the bid for that portion that is most advantageous to the auction solicitor.",
        "In the third step, the winner of the auction is determined by deciding which of:\n\n    \n    \n        i. the candidate winning bid for the entire scope, or\n        ii. the sum of the candidate winning bids for each portion in each dimension is more advantageous to the auction solicitor.",
        "An example of how the scope of an auction is partitioned into multiple dimensions is useful for pedagogical purposes. In accordance with the example, the scope of an auction is defined as the purchase and installation of 90 air conditioners for 90 office buildings in Maryland and Virginia in consideration for cash. To simplify this example, the scope of this auction includes only one bid variable, cash, which is dimensioned in terms of money. It will be clear to those skilled in the art, however, after reading this specification, how to make and use embodiments of the present invention that conduct auctions with partitioned scope and multiple bid variables.",
        "To continue with the facts in the example, thirty-five of the buildings needing air conditioners are high-rises and require specialized equipment to install the air conditioners while the remainder of the buildings require no such specialized equipment. Twenty-one of the high rise buildings are in Maryland and fourteen are in Virginia. There are 25 low-rise buildings in Maryland and 30 in Virginia. The distribution of buildings between high-rise and low-rise and between Maryland and Virginia is depicted in Table 1.",

        "For example, a building contractor might need between $80 million and $100 million worth of building contracts in the next year. If the contractor receives substantially less than $80 million in contracts, it might incur substantial loses. In contrast, if the contractor receives substantially more than $100 million in contracts, it might not have the resources to be able to manage all of the contracts properly, which could damage its reputation. Therefore, the contractor might endeavor to ensure that it has between $80 million and $100 million worth of building contracts in the next year.",

Suppose further that the contractor has decided to bid on two building contracts, each for $50 million, and that the auctions for the two contracts will overlap in time. Clearly, the contractor would like to win one, but not two, contracts.",
        "If the contractor wins the first auction, then it must withdraw from the second auction. In contrast, if the contractor loses the first auction, then it must be aggressive in the second auction. The illustrative embodiment enables a bidder, therefore, to direct data processing system 101 to determine one or more bid variables, based, at least in part, on the results of another auction. This capability is equally useful in sealed-bid and non-sealed-bid auctions.",
        "Determining one or more bid variables based, at least in part, on default values. The illustrative embodiment provides this capability because of the recognition that default values for bid variables are convenient for bidders, the auction solicitor, and the auctioneer (i.e., data processing system 101).",
        "For example, when the scope of the auction is defined, a default value for each optional and discretionary aspect of the bid is provided. Thereafter, each bid variable in a bid is assumed to have the default value for that bid variable unless the bid explicitly provides otherwise.",
        "This capability is equally useful in sealed-bid and non-sealed-bid auctions.",
        "At subtask 602 a bid is prepared in accordance with the directions as specified in the bid package. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, each bid, bk, comprises at least:\n\n    \n    \n        i. an explicit value for each of the m bid variables, v1,k through vm,k;\n        ii. one or more indicium that the bid satisfies the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a qualified bid; and\n        iii. one or more indicium that the bidder satisfies the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a qualified bidder.",
        "Regardless of whether each bid variable was explicitly stated in the bid package or implicitly stated in the bid package or determined by data processing system 101 by reference to a default value or determined by data processing system 101 by reference to publicly-available information or determined by data processing system 101 by reference to private information or determined in accordance with any combination of these, data processing system 101 advantageously determines the explicit value for each bid variable, when necessary, and includes it with the bid. In other words, even when bid package does not comprise an explicit value for a bid variable, the bid associated with the bid package does explicitly comprise an explicit value for the bid variable. A bid package, bpk, might instruct data processing system 101 to determine the value of one or more of the m bid variables, v1,k through vm,k, by reference to public or private information. For example, data processing system 101 might be instructed to determine the value of a bid variable by reference to another bidder's bid (e.g., vk,1 equals vk\u22121,1 plus $50, etc.), other bid variables of bidder's bid, or the financial markets (e.g., v1,k equals the S&P 500 index at 10:00 AM today minus 25.00, etc.).",
        "At subtask 603, data processing system 101 waits, if appropriate, a specific or random amount of time before entering a bid in behalf of a bidder. The illustrative embodiment provides this capability because of the recognition that a first bidder might desire to disguise the fact that its bids are being determined and entered by proxy.",
        "For example, when a first bidder enters a bid into an auction and another bid from a second bidder is immediately entered thereafter, the first bidder might suspect that the second bidder's bid is being determined and entered by data processing system 101. This suspicion, if true, could affect the first bidder's decision-making in subsequent or revised bids to the detriment of the second bidder.",
        "Therefore, to alleviate this situation, the illustrative embodiment enables the second bidder to direct data processing system 101 to wait a specific or random amount of time after the first bidder's bid has been entered into the auction before entering the second bidder's bid into the auction.",
        "This capability is particularly, although not exclusively, useful in non-sealed-bid auctions.",

        "At subtask 605, data processing system 101 determines whether each bid received in subtask 604 is a qualified bid by, for example, comparing the one or more indicium that the bid satisfies the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a qualified bid. When the bid does not qualify, it is void or voidable at the election of auction solicitor 102. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, data processing system 101 can, of its own initiative, retrieve publicly-available information or private information and can determine, in whole or in part, by reference to the retrieved information whether a bid received in subtask 604 is qualified.",
        "At subtask 606, data processing system 101 determines whether each bidder who submitted a bid that was received in subtask 604 is a qualified bidder by, for example, checking the one or more indicium that the bid satisfies the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of a qualified bid against the mandatory and non-discretionary aspects of the bidder as defined in the scope of the auction. When the bidder does not qualify, that bidder's bids are void or voidable at the discretion of auction solicitor 102. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, data processing system 101 can, of its own initiative, retrieve publicly-available information or private information and can determine, in whole or in part, by reference to the retrieved information whether a bidder who submitted a bid that was received in subtask 604 is qualified.",
        "At subtask 607, data processing system 101 determines a resultant bid, rk, for the bid, bk, based on the bid formula received in subtask 501 and on the m bid variables, v1,k through vm,k, stated in bid, bk. In auctions that are partitioned, the subtask of determining the resultant bid also comprises determining the resultant bids for each portion of the scope of the auction as well as for bids for the entire scope of the auction.",
        "At subtask 608, data processing system 101 ranks the resultant bids, rk, for k=1 to T, by comparing the relative magnitude of the resultant bids and their relative advantageousness to auction solicitor 102 as defined in the format of the auction. This is advantageously done for both qualifying bids and unqualified bids and for bids from both qualifying bidders and unqualified bidders. For unqualified bids and bids from unqualified bidders, data processing system 101 publishes with each resultant bid an indicium that the resultant bid is unqualified or is a qualified bid from a unqualified bidder or both. This informs all of the bidders that that bid is void or voidable at the election of auction solicitor 102, and, therefore, need not necessarily be overcome to win the auction. In other words, a bidder might not feel the need to overcome a candidate winning (but unqualified) bid to win the auction when the bidder is confident that the auction solicitor will void the candidate winning (but unqualified) bid.",
        "In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, data processing system 101 merely searches through the T resultant bids, without ranking them all, to find the resultant bid that is most advantageous to auction solicitor 102. Furthermore, in some alternative embodiments of the present invention, unqualified bids and qualified bids from unqualified bidders are not published by data processing system 101. And still furthermore, in some alternative embodiments of the present invention, unqualified bids and qualified bids from unqualified bidders are not considered by data processing system 101 at all (e.g., for the purposes of determining whether an auction should end without further bidding or should have another round of bidding, etc.).",
        "It should be understood that each bid comprises multiple bid variables not merely to break a tie between two bids that have the same value for one bid variable, but so that bids that have no ties in any one bid variables can be compared and ranked. That is not to say that two bids in accordance with the present invention cannot have the same value for a bid variable, but that the values of all of the bid variables affect the outcome of an auction. In some alternative embodiments of the present invention, however, no two bids have the same value for any one bid variable (i.e., vq,1 does not equal vq,2, for q=1 to m) in one auction.",
        "At subtask 609, data processing system 101 publishes the ranking for the resultant bids, rk, for k=1 to T, if appropriate in accordance with the auction format. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, the ranking for the resultant bids are published for non-sealed bid auctions.",
        "Furthermore, in accordance with the illustrative embodiment, the ranking for the resultant bids are published for sealed-bid auctions during the bidding phase and before the resolution phase. The illustrative embodiment provides this capability because of the recognition that it makes sealed-bid auctions more competitive. This does not disclose the contents of a sealed-bid to any party, but merely informs each bidder where its bid currently stands and enables each bidder to decide whether it desires to submit a revised bid in the hope of improving its ranking.",
        "At subtask 610, data processing system 101 determines if there is another bid (from a previously received bid package) to be prepared and entered into the auction. Events that could cause another bid to be entered into the auction include, but are not limited to, the entry of the last bid into the auction, the results of another auction, or a change in publicly-available information (e.g., a change in interest rates, etc.).
