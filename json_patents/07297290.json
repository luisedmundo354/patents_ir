        "Magnetorheological materials are typically comprised of magnetizable particles suspended in a carrier material. A magnetorheological material exhibits rapid and reversible changes that are controllable by an applied magnetic field. The shear stress and viscosity of such a material is related to whether the material is in the presence of a magnetic field, termed the on-state, or the absence of a magnetic field, termed the off-state. In the on-state, the magnetizable particles align with the magnetic field and increase the shear yield stress and viscosity of the material over its off-state value.",
        "Typical state-of-the-art magnetorheological (MR) fluids are multiphase materials consisting of magnetizable particles suspended in a liquid carrier fluid. These MR fluids exhibit properties typical of a viscoelastic material. In addition to the magnetizable particles, the carrier fluid serves as a continuous insulating material. Some of the carrier fluids typically utilized are silicone, hydrocarbon, and synthetic oils. An additional component that is often present in MR fluids is a stabilizer, which serves to keep the particles suspended in the fluid. MR fluids demonstrate non-Newtonian fluid behavior when exposed to a magnetic field.",
        "Magnetorheological materials containing chemically cross-linked gels have been reported. U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,972, to Fuchs et al. discloses magnetorheological polymeric gels (MRPGs) comprising magnetic particles and a carrier material comprising a partially covalently-crosslinked polymeric gel.",

Ginder et al. disclose a MR fluid composition comprising a magnetizable carrier fluid and a multiplicity of magnetizable particles loaded within the magnetizable carrier fluid.

The micron sized iron particles can be in the reduced form of iron pentacarbonyl with a purity between about 97 to about 99.5 wt. %. Table 3 lists iron particles suitable for use in nano-MR material formulations. However, the magnetizable particles can be any magnetizable particles known to the art. The particle component of the magnetorheological material of the invention can consist essentially of any solid which is known to exhibit magnetorheological activity, e.g., made of compounds which exhibit paramagnetic, superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic activity. Such particles may be made of iron, iron oxide, iron nitride, iron carbide, carbonyl iron, chromium dioxide, low carbon steel, silicon steel, nickel, cobalt, and mixtures thereof. Iron oxide includes all known pure iron oxides, such as ferric and ferrous oxides, e.g., ferrites and magnetites. The magnetizable particles can be comprised of alloys of iron, such as those containing aluminum, silicon, cobalt, nickel, vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, manganese and/or copper. Typically, the magnetizable particles are in the form of metal powders prepared by processes well known to those skilled in the art.",
        "Typical methods for the preparation of metal powders include the reduction of metal oxides, grinding or attrition, electrolytic deposition, metal carbonyl decomposition, rapid solidification, or smelt processing. Methods for synthesizing iron nanoparticles have been described in the art. Giesen and coworkers (Giesen, B. et al. (2004), Chem. Eng. Sci., 59, 2201-2211) synthesized iron nanoparticles from iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO5), based on homogenous reaction in a wall heated aerosol reactor. The reaction is in gas phase producing a supersaturated iron vapor. The flow reactor is heated up to high temperatures, i.e. the wall temperature of the reactor is between 400-800\u00b0 C. leading to decomposition of the iron pentacarbonyl. Particle size analysis and morphology of the iron nanoparticles were examined by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the average size of iron particles was found in the range of 10-100 nm depending on the process conditions (Giesen, et al. 2004). Chaudret and co-workers (de Caro, D., (1996), Chem. Mater. 8, 1987-1991) also investigated nonagglomerated zero valent iron particle synthesis based on sonolysis of Fe(CO)5 in anisol in the presence of poly(dimethylphenyleneoxide) (PPO). Sonication of Fe(CO)5 with PPO lead to decomposition of Fe(CO)5. The particles size was about 30 nm.",
        "Pure iron particles can be protected from oxidation by means of coating techniques. It is useful to deposit a thin, chemically bonded layer on the iron surface, such as a silane layer (Davis, S. J. and Watts, J. F., (1996), Int. J. Adhesion and Adhesives 16, 5-15). Davis and Watts used 3-glycidoxypropyltri-methoxsilane (GPS) as a silane to coat pure iron particles (Davis and Watts, 1996). Thin silane layer deposition is achieved by immersing the iron particles in silane solution for two minutes. Another silane is described in the work represented by Keller and co-workers (Keller, H. et al. (1996), J. Magnetism and Magnet. Matls., 155, 101-103). Chemisorption of silanes are achieved by hydrogen bonding of silanols which are formed by hydrolization of Si\u2014Cl, Si\u2014OR, and Si\u2014NR2 in aqueous medium. Both trimethoxysilane and tetramethoxysilane with long alkyl chains was used to deposit on iron particles to build up thin protection layer (Keller et al., 1996).",
        "Various metal powders that are commercially available include iron powders, reduced iron powders, insulated reduced iron powders, and cobalt powders. Magnetizable particles with high saturation magnetization, such as iron/cobalt alloys are preferable for this application. These iron alloys are selected to provide high yield stress.",
        "Magnetite or iron/cobalt-based nano-particles from about 5 to about 500 nm can be used to prepare a ferrofluid which can serve as a starting point for preparation of nano-MRPGs. Chemical precipitation may also be used to prepare the magnetite or cobalt based ferrofluids. The starting ferrofluid can also be a commercial ferrofluid. These ferrofluids may contain surfactants and other additives to stabilize the ferrofluid. Surfactants can also be used in the carrier material for viscosity modification.",
        "When MR material comprises both nanoparticles and micro-sized particles, the magnetizable nano-particles can be added to the carrier fluid in an amount from about 0.1 to about 20 wt. % of the nano-MR material. Micron sized iron particles can be added to a ferrofluid to prepare a suspension having nano and micro-sized particles. The micron-sized particles are added to the carrier fluid in an amount from about 10 to about 90 wt. % of the nano-MR material. The combination of nano and micron sized particles provides significantly higher shear yield stress than either alone, increased stability to settling and increased passive-off viscosities. Under the influence of a magnetic field these nano- and micron sized particles contribute to the non-Newtonian behavior of the material. The fluid in which the magnetizable particles are synthesized and/or the fluid used to prepare the particle suspension can be different than the fluid used as a carrier fluid for the magnetorheological material.",
        "When the MR materials comprise nanoparticles, but no microparticles, the magnetizable nanoparticles can be added to the carrier fluid in an amount from about 10 to about 90 wt % of the nano-MR material. When MR materials comprise micron-sized particles, but no nanoparticles, the magnetizabe micron-sized particles can be added to the carrier fluid in an amount from about 10 to about 90 wt % of the MR material.",
        "In an embodiment, the invention provides for surface modification of the magnetizable particles. The magnetizable particles may be coated with a polymer by methods known to the art. Methods for coating particles with a polymer include physical adsorption, silanization, surface atom transfer radical polymerization, self assembled monolayers, surface ring opening metathesis polymerization, and dry coating. Dry coating methods are methods applied to dry particles and include use of fluidized beds, vibrating beds or free-fall gravity tubes. Physical adsorption of polymer chains onto magnetizable particles is described by Fuchs et al. and Wilson et al. (Fuchs, A. et al., J. Appl. Polymer Sci., (2002), 92, 1176-1182; Wilson, M. J. et al. (2002), J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 84, 2733-2742). Use of macromolecular silane coupling agents as inorganic particle treatment agents is reported by Masaharu and Ohata (Masaharu, Y. and Ohata, M., (1996), Progr. Organic Coating, 27, 277-285), Ming et al. investigated magnetite nanoparticles coated by amino silane (Ming, M., 2003, Colloid and Surfaces A: Physiochem. Eng. Aspects 212, 219-226). Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate on magnetite nanoparticles has been reported by Marutani et al. (Marutani, E., et al., (2004), Polymer, 45, 2231-2235). Self assembled monolayers on magnetizable particles have been reported by Kataby et al. (G. Kataby et al., (1996), J. Cryst. Growth, 166, 760)) Surface Ring Opening Methathesis Polymerization has been used to create a polymer coating on gold particles (Watson, K. et al., (1999), J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121, 462-463).",
        "Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has the following features: the polymerization can be performed at very mild conditions (room temperature), with high yield and on a broad range of monomers. The occurrence of transfer reactions (in solution) is negligible, because the radical species are always present at the end of the growing, surface tethered polymer chains. (D. Bontempo, et al., Adv. Mater. (2002), 14, No. 17 September 3, 1239-1241) In this polymerization, radicals are generated by the redox reaction of alkyl halides with transition-metal complexes. Radicals can then propagate but are rapidly deactivated by the oxidized form of the transition-metal catalyst. Initiators typically used are \u03b1-haloesters (e.g., ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate and methyl 2-bromopropionate) or benzyl halide (e.g., 1-phenylethyl bromide and benzyl bromide). A wide range of transition-metal complexes such as Ru-, Cu- and Fe-based system have been successfully applied to ATRP. For Cu-based systems, ligands such as 2,2\u2032-bipyridine and aliphatic amines have been employed to tune both solubility and activity of various ATRP catalysts. ATRP has been successfully applied for the controlled polymerization of styrene, methacrylate, methacrylamides, acrylonitrile and 4-vinylpyridine. (J Pyun, et al., Chem. Mater. (2001), 13, 3436-3448) Muhammad developed the graft polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) by ATPR on an initiator-immobilized substrate. 2-(4-chlorosufonyphenyl)ethyl trimethoxysilane was used as an initiator which can be immobilized on oxidized silicon particles. (M. Ejaz, et al., Macromolecules (1998), 31, 5934-5936) A cross-linked ultrathin polymer film coating on the gold was synthesized, using ATRP, by Wenxi et al. They immobilized the disulfide initiator onto the gold surface followed by surface grafting polymerization by the ATRP approach. Crosslinking is provided by multifunctional ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (W. Huang, et al., Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. (2001), 40 No. 8, 1510-1512).",
        "Ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) catalyzed by well-defined metal-alkylidines has proven to be an efficient method to control polymer molecular structure, size, and bulk properties. Ruthenium-based ROMP initiators have been shown to polymerize a large variety of monomers in a living fashion in a number of solvents, ranging from benzene to water. With these advances in catalyst design, ROMP is capable of overcoming the obstacles, such as side reactions and impurities on a surface, for surface polymerization. Namyong et al developed a method for growing thin polymer films from the surface of a silicon substrate by ring-open metathesis polymerization. (Namyong Y. Kim, et al. Macromolecules (2000),33, 2793-2795) There is a three step procedure. First, there is formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on silicon that incorporates norbornenyl groups. Second, there is attachment of a ruthenium catalyst to the surface using the norbornenyl groups. And third, the polymerization of added monomer to generate the film. This reaction offers ease of use and control over the thickness and chemical composition of deposited film. Keyth et al. took advantage of the functional-group-tolerant ruthenium carbene catalysts. They immobilized the initiator to the surface of gold nanoparticles and carried out the living polymerization on the surface of the particles. The advantages of this strategy are numerous including: control over polymer length and chemical composition as well as particles size, solubility and shape (K. J. Watson, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1999), 121, 462-463).",
        "The particles may also be coated with graphite or ceramic coatings. Graphite coatings may be applied using any suitable method known to the art, including by in-situ graphitization of polymeric precursors. Ceramic coatings include sol-gel and silicon-based ceramics and may be applied using any suitable method known to the art.",
        "In an embodiment, the surface of the magnetizable particles is modified by forming a supramolecular polymer coating on the particle. In an embodiment, the supramolecular polymer coating is comprised of polymeric units which interact with one another. In another embodiment, the supramolecular interaction may be due to interaction of a polymer with a complexing agent such as an oligomeric amphiphile, an alkylphenol, or a surfactant.",
        "Supramolecular polymer coated particles may be made by any method known to the art, including physical adsorption, atom radical transfer polymerization, ring opening metathesis polymerization, and dry coating. Atom radical transfer polymerization, ring opening metathesis polymerization, and dry coating methods provide specificity to the particle surface. For MR materials comprising supramolecular polymer coated particles and corner materials comprising a supramolecular polymer or polymer gel, these three methods permit independent control of the polymer in the carrier material vs. the surface. This can provide improved control over issues including magnetorheological fluid or gel rheology, settling and remixing. In addition, the choice of coating method can allow control of the coating morphology. For example, atom radical transfer polymerization coatings are capable of producing coatings which are more like polymer molecules attached to the surface of the molecule, hanging into the carrier fluid, than a complete layer.",
        "In another embodiment, the surface of the magnetizable particles is modified by forming surfactant-polymer coatings. In this embodiment, surfactant monolayers or bilayers are formed on the surface of the magnetizable particles. The particles can have a bi-modal particle distribution or can be particles of uniform size. Polymer monomers can then undergo hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction with the surfactant and can solubilize in these surfactant monolayers or bilayers. Polymerization of the monomers can form supramolecular surfactant-polymer coatings. The polymer monomers adsolubilized into the surfactant monolayer or bilayer may be co-monomers and the film formed a copolymer. The polymer monomers may be polymerized by any means known to the art. While in some instances, polymerization of monomer molecules may occur spontaneously, in most cases it will be necessary to initiate polymerization such as by using heat, light, or chemical initiators. In an embodiment, a chemical initiator is combined with heat to polymerize the monomer. Suitable chemical initiators are known to those skilled in the art. In an embodiment, the chemical initiator is selected from the group consisting of azobisio-butyronitrile or persulfate. A supramolecular structure involving a surfactant monolayer can be formed by polymerizing within the surfactant bilayer and washing away the outer layer of surfactant. This procedure leaves only polymer coated on top of the surfactant monolayer.",
        "In an embodiment, a self-assembled surfactant bilayer on a magnetite surface is used to absorb monomer molecules into the bilayer. In an aqueous solution, tail to tail assembly of surfactant molecules with the hydrophilic heads of the second layer of surfactant extending toward the aqueous solution forms the bilayer structure. In this embodiment, hydrophobic monomers will diffuse into the bilayer. It is expected that the more hydrophobic the monomer, the higher the monomer concentration will be in the bilayer and the lower the monomer concentration will be in the solution. The solubility of the monomer (or monomers) within the bilayer may be enhanced by introducing a co-solvent. In an embodiment, the concentration of the surfactant in solution is kept less than the critical micelle concentration to prevent micelle emulsion polymerization within the solution. Once the monomer molecules have diffused into the bilayer, the monomer molecules are polymerized to produce a film. In an embodiment, the concentration of monomer in the aqueous solution controlled so that appreciable polymerization of monomer in the bulk of the solution (outside the bilayer) does not occur.",
        "Supramolecular surfactant-polymer coatings can be formed on magnetizable particles in a polar or nonpolar solvent. In an embodiment, the supramolecular surfactant-polymer coating is a supramolecular surfactant polymer gel. As used herein, a \u201csupramolelcular surfactant-polymer gel\u201d is a supramolecule comprising a surfactant and a polymer which is at least in part noncovalently bonded. Polar solvents useful for the present invention include water. The solvent in which the supramolecular surfactant-polymer coating is formed may be the same or different than the carrier fluid or material used in the magnetorheological material.",
        "Surfactants useful in surface modification of the magnetizable particles can have either nonionic or ionic head groups. The surfactant is chosen depending in part on the magnetizable particle surface charge and the nature of the solvent. If the magnetizable particle surface charge at high pH (alkaline medium) is negative, cationic surfactant is preferred to maximize the number of surfactant molecules adsorbed on the solid surface. A surfactant bilayer can also be formed with an anionic surfactant, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), in a polar solvent by adjusting the pH level of the solution. Surfactant tail groups can be either lipophilic or fluorophilic. Surfactant molecules can have either single or twin tails and either single or twin heads. Surfactants useful for the present invention include, but are not limited to: alkyl sulfates, alkyl mercaptants, amide carboxylates, alkylbenzenesulfanates, and methacrylate esters. Through selection of the bilayer surfactants, the properties of the polymer formed at the magnetizable particle surface can be controlled. For example, the solubility of the monomers in the bilayer varies depending on the specific surfactant and monomers chosen.",
        "The redispersion properties of these magnetizable fluids can be further improved by addition of a second amphiphile after formation of a polymer coating on the magnetizable particle. The second amphiphile, such as 3-n pentadecylphenol (PDP), can be hydrogen bonded to the polymer layer, such as the P4VP block of a P4VP layer. In this way a supramolecular polymer coating can be constructed. Such hydrogen bonded supramolecules self organize, providing steric separation between the magnetite nanoparticles and resulting in improved redispersion of the magnetic fluid. These hydrogen bonded assemblies are preferred with solvent or carrier fluid is non-polar.",
        "Surface treatment of particles can help to stabilize the magnetic fluid. Agglomeration of magnetizable particles can result from the attractive van der Waals forces which result when the particles approach on another. For a suspension of solid particles in a liquid there is very high surface energy because of the presence of individual particles, which have high surface area. Therefore, processes accompanied by decreasing surface energy, such as aggregation of particles, easily occur in this system. To prevent agglomeration, and hence stabilize the MR fluid, the magnetizable particles can be stabilized through forces of repulsion. Supramolecular polymer gels can provide polymeric stabilization including steric and depletion stabilization. Steric stabilization is achieved by polymer molecules adsorbing or attaching to the surface of magnetizable particles. In a sterically stabilized system, each particle is coated with physically or chemically adsorbed surface layers that hinder the particles approach to each other to distances where van der Waals force dominate. The thickness of the adsorbed layer is determined by the length of the polymer chain. The long polymer chains in solution assume numerous configurations, which results in repulsion between particles. Depletion stabilization is due to the work involved in driving polymer molecules in free solution from the interparticle region. Close approach of iron particles is accompanied by mixing of the polymer molecules and the solvent in the interparticle regions and driving the polymer molecules out these interparticle regions. Work must be done to make the polymer molecules leave the interparticle region and this corresponds to repulsion force between particles.",
        "A variety of additives, including anti-oxidants, anti-wear agents, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, dispersants, viscosity modifiers, wetting agents, pH shifters, salts, pigments and dyes can be incorporated into the MRPG according to the requirements of the specific application.

        "Another supramolecular polymer system involves supramolecular poly(NIPAAm) with electrostatic interactions. Polyampholyte gels, containing both cationic and anionic groups on the polymer chain, have been synthesized. Two types of poly(NIPAAm) lattices were synthesized, one copolymerized with anionic monomer sodium methacrylate (NaMA) yielding the anionic poly(NIPAAm), and the other copolymerized with the cationic monomer methyl acrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (MAPTAC) yielding cationic poly(NIPAAm). 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride was used as the cationic initiator and ammonium persulfate was used as the anionic initiator. Supramolecular structure has been achieved through electrostatic interactions of a slightly crosslinked anionic copolymer network with a slightly crosslinked cationic copolymer network. In accordance with the present invention, interaction of linear cationic copolymer chains with linear anionic copolymer chains can be achieved within the surfactant bilayer by following the same approach described for PS-b-4VP and hydrophobically modified poly(NIPAAm).",
        "The supramolecular interaction of the anionic and cationic copolymer networks can occur in polar solvents such as water. Once the gel is formed, the gel can be combined with magnetizable particles to form a magnetorheological fluid.",
        "FIG. 1 shows off-state apparent viscosity as a function of shear rate at room temperature for two magnetorheological materials containing supramolecular polymer gel (samples 1 and 2 from Example 1), and a commercial magnetorheological fluid (Lord MRF 132-AD, Lord Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.). A gel (no magnetizable particles) was also tested and remained Newtonian in this range of shear rates. This is because the presence of solvent reduces the number of chain entanglement per unit volume. (Rakesh K. Gupta. Polymer and Composite Rheology, New York, 1977, Chap. 10) The viscosity of the gel was about 36 cp. When iron particles are added the material demonstrates non-Newtonian behavior and higher viscosity. One of the explanations proposed by Frankel and Acrivos is that the increase in viscosity due to particulate addition is due to energy dissipation in the thin liquid film between neighboring spheres as they move past each other. (Rakesh K. Gupta. Polymer and Composite Rheology, New York, 1977, Chap. 10) The viscosity also increases with the amount of supramolecular polymer in the solvent.",
        "The effect of applied magnetic field on shear yield stress of the SMPG is investigated using an Anton Paar Physica MER300 rheometer, operating in either stress or strain controllable mode. ( ) The results of the shear stress vs strain rate under different applied magnetic flux densities for the MRPG are shown in FIG. 2 (for sample 2). It can be seen that dynamic shear stress is almost a linear function of shear strain rate, which can be expressed by Bingham equation. The dynamic shear yield stress can be obtained by extrapolating shear stress data back to a zero strain rate. The plastic viscosity is the slope of the curve. From FIG. 2, the shear stress increases dramatically with the applied magnetic flux density, while the plastic viscosities are not significantly affected. For example, at low magnetic flux density of 115 mT, the dynamic yield shear stress is about 2400 Pa while it is 23500 Pa under 500 mT. The yield stress increases about 9 times when magnetic field strength increases 3.7 times from 115 mT to 500 mT.",
        "The storage modulus G\u2032 is a measure of the deformation energy stored in the sample during the shear process. After the load is removed, this energy becomes available and acts as a driving force for reformation. The loss modulus, G\u2033, is a measure of the deformation energy used up in the sample during the shear process. The energy may be used up during the process of charging the sample's structure or dissipated into the surrounding environment in the form of heat.",
        "FIG. 3 shows the storage modulus and loss modulus as a function of strain amplitude for sample #2 at B=340 mT, and T=20\u00b0 C. which is carried out with the strain amplitude from 0.01% to 100% at a fixed frequency w=10 rad/s. The range of LVE can be determined from the G\u2032 curve according to the condition that in the range of LVE G\u2032 is almost a constant. As shown in FIG. 3, two typical regions are separated by the critical strain amplitude value \u03b3L=0.30%. At very small strain amplitudes, less than \u03b3L, the storage modulus of SMPG is non-sensitive to the strain amplitude. Another region larger than \u03b3L is called the nonlinear viscoelastic region. In this nonlinear region the storage modulus decreases significantly with increasing strain amplitude. A MR fluid exhibits linear viscoelastic behavior when it is in the pre-yield strain region. Hence, we can deduce that yield strain \u03b3Y should be equal to \u03b3L for MR fluid.",
        "In FIG. 3, in the LVE range, the elastic behavior of SMPG dominates over the viscous behavior; the structure shows certain rigidity because G\u2032 is much higher than G\u2033. The material behaves like a viscoelastic solid. This is not a surprise because in pre-yield range the induced iron chains or columns formed by the external magnetic field have high stiffness. In the non-linear range, the value of G\u2032 is just slightly higher than G\u2033, thus, the viscous property increases significantly compared to the LVE region. The chain or column structures have been irreversibly changed. The material behavior is between the elastic solid and viscous liquid.",
        "Both the storage and loss modulus were found to increase significantly with an increase in the applied magnetic field strength.",
        "In an experiment, the applied strain amplitude was fixed at 0.05% and the oscillators driving frequency is swept from 1 to 100 rad/s with the applied magnetic flux density at 340 mT.",
        "The storage modulus was independent of frequency while the loss modulus exhibited a slight decrease with frequency. The storage modulus was much higher than the loss modulus within the frequency range. Obviously, the SMPG exhibited predominantly an elastic response in the frequency range from 1 to 100 rad/s.",
        "In another experiment, a constant strain amplitude 5% much larger than \u03b3L was applied and the driving frequency was swept from 1 to 1000 rad/s.",
        "At low frequency, less than wp, the storage modulus remained constant until a plateau frequency is reached. At that point, the storage modulus begins to decrease with increasing frequency until it reaches a minimum value at frequency wm. Further increasing the frequency leads to an increase in the storage modulus. The loss modulus did not have exhibit much variation in the range of the test frequency.",
        "FIG. 4 shows settling behavior of various SMPGs compared with MRF without supramolecular polymer. In this figure, a larger volume fraction indicates greater settling. It can be seen that MR fluid (sample a) which just includes carrier fluid and iron particles (without supramolecular polymer) has the greatest settling rate. Upon addition of supramolecular polymer (sample b: 1% supramolecular polymer without colloidal graphite), the settling rate decreases dramatically. Without wishing to be bound by any particular belief, one possible explanation for this behavior is that the formation of a supramolecular network, which can exist on the surface of the iron particles and in the space between the iron particles. Supramolecular network formation can provide steric stabilization and is achieved by polymer molecules adsorbing or attaching to the surface of magnetic particles, and depletion stabilization, which is due to the molecules in free solution preventing settling of the iron particles. Comparing the curves of sample b and c, it is found that colloidal graphite can also reduce the settling of iron particles. There may be two reasons for this behavior: one is the increased viscosity which the colloidal graphite causes. The other reason is that the graphite particles reduce agglomeration. It can be seen that increasing of the supramolecular polymer can also reduce the settling behavior by comparing settling curves c and d.",
        "FIG. 5 shows the settling velocity curves for SMPGs and MRF without supramolecular polymer by measuring the inductance of the fluid. This result is consistent with the measurement shown in FIG. 4. The MRF without supramolecular polymer has the greatest sedimentation velocity and SMPG without additives have the second greatest settling velocity. Sample 2 (1.8% supramolecular polymer, 0.4% colloidal graphite) has the smallest sedimentation velocity. Actually, the curves in FIG. 5 correspond to the slope of the corresponding curves of FIG. 4 because the curves in FIG. 4 characterize the position of iron particles changing with time, so the slope of these curves indicates the settling velocity of iron particles while the average velocity of settling is shown in FIG. 5. Consequently, these two methods demonstrate good consistency.",
        "Probe displacement for an applied force is used as the measure of redispersibility (FIG. 6). In order to investigate how the supramolecular polymer affects the redispersibility, the behavior of a MRF sample only containing solvent (N-octyl-pyrrolidone) and iron particles with the weight ratio of 19:81 is also shown. The SMPG sample contains 1% supramolecular polymer without additives. FIG. 6 shows that the probe displacement for the MRF has lower values than that of SMPG sample, which means that the hardness of the settled iron particle cake for MRF is higher than SMPG, thus, it is easier to remix the SMPG than MR fluid.",
        "Without wishing to be bound by any particular belief, the improved dispersion of SMPG MR materials is believed to be due at least in part to adsorption of the supramolecular polymer units on particles as well as in fluid.",
        "This technique utilizes a self-assembled surfactant bilayer on a magnetite surface to absorb monomer molecules into the bilayer. Tail to tail assembly of surfactant molecules with the hydrophilic heads of the second layer of surfactant extending toward the aqueous solution forms the bilayer structure. The concentration of the surfactant in solution is kept less than the critical micelle concentration to prevent micelle emulsion polymerization within the solution. The method involves poly(styrene-4 vinyl pyridine, PS-4VP) and a cationic surfactant; cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as constituents of complex magnetic fluids. Since the magnetite surface charge at high pH (alkaline medium) is negative, cationic surfactant is preferred to maximize the number of surfactant molecules adsorbed on the solid surface. A surfactant bilayer can also be formed with an anionic surfactant, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), by adjusting the pH level.",
        "There were two major steps in synthesizing the ferrofluid. The first was to make the magnetizable nanoparticles, 10-200 nm in size and the second step was the dispersion of those particles in carrier liquid by introducing surfactant and polymer complexation. Thus a colloidal suspension is created.",
        "Magnetite ferrofluid was prepared by co-precipitating iron (II) and iron (III) chloride salts in the presence of a strong base; ammonium hydroxide. The salts, ferrous and ferric chloride were obtained from Fisher Scientific Corporation. A 1 M ferric chloride in 2 M HCl solution (30 ml) and 2 M ferrous chloride in 2 M HCl solution (10 ml) were placed in 100 ml flask equipped with a stirrer. Salts were prepared in acidic medium to prevent formation of iron hydroxides. At room temperature 50 ml of aqueous ammonium solution was added drop wise over a period of 5 minutes. First a brown precipitate and then a black precipitate was formed and settled. The clear liquid above the precipitated magnetite particles was poured off and the cationic surfactant, CPC, below the critical micelle concentration was added to the ferrofluid. The magnetite-surfactant mixture was allowed to remain at equilibrium for an hour to be sure of surfactant bilayer formation.",
        "The monomer solution was then added to the ferrofluid and diffuses into the bilayer. Once the monomer molecules become concentrated within the bilayer, polymerization is initiated by ammonium persulfate (Zaxis Inc.). The ferrofluid-surfactant-monomer mixture was placed in a 1 L, four necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a condenser, and N2 inlet. The mixture was stirred at 40\u00b0 C. under N2 for 30 minutes to make sure that there was no air in the system. To start the polymerization, initiator was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 hours under N2. The bilayer localizes the free-radical co-polymerization reaction of styrene and 4-vinyl pyridine, resulting in a thin polymeric film surrounding the magnetite nanoparticles. This creates a net repulsion between the magnetite particles, providing steric stabilization.",
        "The redispersion properties of these magnetizable fluids can be further improved by addition of a second amphiphile. After treating the magnetizable particles with the first amphiphile followed by emulsion polymerization as described above, the second amphiphile, such as 3-n pentadecylphenol (PDP), can be hydrogen bonded to the P4VP block. In this way a supramolecular polymer is constructed. Such hydrogen bonded supramolecules self organize, providing steric separation between the magnetite nanoparticles and resulting in improved redispersion of the magnetic fluid. A schematic representation of this approach is shown in FIG. 7.",
        "An aqueous nanostructured MRPG is prepared by starting with an aqueous suspension 10 of magnetite or ferrofluid (10-15 wt. %) and micron-sized iron particles 12 (50-90 wt. %) which are the reduced form of iron pentacarbonyl. Surfactant 15 such as alkyl sulfate is dissolved in the aqueous solution and self assembles as a bilayer on the surface of the particles. Styrene and 4-vinyl pyridine (4VP) monomers are dissolved in the aqueous suspension and diffuse into the surfactant bilayer. A free radical copolymerization is done in the bilayer to form a polymeric coating around the particles. 3-n-pentadecylphenol (PDP) is hydrogen bonded to the P4VP block in order to provide the supramolecular structure 50. The supramolecular structure provides steric separation between the particles and therefore provides excellent remixing properties to the fluid.",
        "Supramolecular poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (poly(NIPAAm)) films are synthesized based on hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction with the surfactant bilayer. Hydrophobically modified poly(NIPAAm) are used for this process. Amphiphilic copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide and n-alkylacrylamide, such as poly(NIPAAm-N-(n-octadecyl) acrylamide), can be prepared by free radical polymerization in the surfactant bilayer. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions within the surfactant template results in a self-organized structure, providing steric separation and preventing magnetizable particles from agglomeration due to attraction forces between the nanoparticles. The highly hydrophobic block of amphiphilic copolymer adsorbs in the central region, and the hydrophilic block tails remain in the aqueous solvent, leading to microphase separation. Magnetite stabilization by steric repulsive forces is then achieved using supramolecular hydrophobically modified poly(NIPAAm)."
