        "This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/JP2005/005309, filed Mar. 16, 2005, which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-075391 filed on Mar. 16, 2004, 2004-075392 filed on Mar. 16, 2004, 2004-289652 filed on Oct. 1, 2004 and 2005-072040 filed on Mar. 14, 2005.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to ink jet ink, an ink jet recording method, an ink cartridge, and an ink jet recording apparatus.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "An ink jet recording method refers to a method which conducts recording of images and texts by allowing fine droplets of ink to fly according various operational principles to apply them on a recording medium (e.g. paper). The technique has features like high speed, low noise, ease in multicolor printing, high flexibility of recording patterns and no need for development and fixing, and is therefore rapidly spreading to a wide variety of applications. In addition, full color ink jet recording system has been recently developed and this enables formation of multi-color images comparable to those by polychromic printing according to a prepress method or printed images produced by color photography. For printing in small numbers, the technique can produce printed matters at lower costs than usual polychromic or photographic printing. Under such circumstances, in response to the demand for improved recording properties including high speed, high definition and full color of recording, improvement of ink jet recording apparatus and recording method has been attempted. Since image forming apparatuses such as printers to which the ink jet recording system is applied are used in various situations, recording stability is also important and in addition, improved durability of images is a property required for ink.",
        "As recording media used in the ink jet recording method, various items such as plain paper, coated paper, glossy paper, OHP sheet and back print film are marketed, while for general use in offices, low price plain paper is mostly used. However, when plain paper is used as a recording medium, it becomes necessary to decrease or prevent curling phenomenon (warping or curl of paper) which occurs when a large amount of ink is applied on the recording medium, while satisfying the aforementioned properties. This curling phenomenon is mainly attributable to applied moisture. That is, it is known that considerable curling phenomenon occurs when moisture is applied to a large area, or in a greater amount. In the case of ink jet recording conducted on plain paper, reduction or suppression of not only curling phenomenon during printing but also curling phenomenon after printing caused by drying and evaporation of moisture (curling phenomenon after printing) have become important.",
        "The printed matter (print) obtained according to the ink jet system are used for various purposes, but curled paper cannot be kept flat, causing a lot of troubles such as curling phenomenon when being piled or put in files. In addition, test printing of presentation documents such as slides and OHP sheet is often conducted on inexpensive plain paper and when figures, photographs or background are printed with the secondary color (blue, etc.), paper becomes warped, making it difficult to handle in many cases.",
        "Some approaches to decrease or prevent curling phenomenon have been proposed so far. For example, ink jet ink containing a solid substance which is soluble in water or an aqueous organic solvent and has four or more hydroxyl groups in a molecular structure is proposed (e.g. see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H04-332775). In addition, ink containing a saccharide, a sugar alcohol and a specific amide compound as anti-curling agents is proposed (e.g. see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H06-157955, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H06-240189, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H09-165539 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H09-176538). Further, ink containing a specific polyhydric alcohol and glycerol in combination is proposed (see e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-130550). Moreover, ink containing a solvent, a polymer binder, a dye mordant, a water-soluble anti-curling compound, a water-soluble desizing compound, a light resistant compound and a defoaming agent is proposed (e.g. see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-198267).",
        "Curling phenomenon can be suppressed to some extent by incorporating conventional compounds for preventing curling phenomenon, but ink jet recording has been advanced and involves even higher speed, and ejection stability and reliability are important in the process of high speed printing. Accordingly, in addition to ensuring properties such as stability, permeability and viscosity of the ink itself, it is also important to maintain a high level of basic properties of ink for ink jet recording, in particular, ink jet ejection stability, which is more specifically an anti-clogging property at a ejection port (nozzle) of an ink jet recording head, and a start-up characteristic (re-eject ability of ink from a nozzle after temporal suspension (stopping or pausing) of ink ejection), and at the same time to decrease or prevent curling phenomenon.",
        "Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide ink jet ink which can decrease or prevent curling phenomenon with ensuring, as required for conventional ink jet ink, a ejection stability after leaving a head and a ejection stability which can prevent initial portions of printing from being unstable or blurred at the beginning of printing (start-up characteristic), an ink jet recording method, an ink cartridge and an ink jet recording apparatus.",
        "In addition, another object of the present invention is to sufficiently decrease or prevent curling phenomenon, thereby making it easier to handle printed matters prepared by using plain paper.",
        "The above-mentioned objects are achieved by the present invention described below.",
        "That is, the ink jet ink of the present invention comprises at least water, a colorant, a water-soluble organic compound 1 and a water-soluble organic compound 2,",
        "wherein the content X(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1 is 10 mass % or more based on the total amount of the ink jet ink and the content X(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1 and the content Y(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink satisfy the relation of the following formula (I) and formula (II):\n\n0<Y/X\u22660.9,\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nX+Y\u226715% by mass,\u2003\u2003(II)\n\nand wherein the water-soluble organic compound 1 is a water-retentive, water-soluble organic compound having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less, and the water-soluble organic compound 2 is a water-soluble organic compound other than the colorant and the water-soluble organic compound 1.",
        "In particular, it is preferable that the content Y(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2 is Y<15% by mass and the difference between water retention abilities is 40% or more.",
        "Further, another embodiment of the present invention is ink jet ink comprising at least water and a colorant, further comprising a water-soluble organic compound 1-1, a water-soluble organic compound 1-2, and a water-soluble organic compound 2-1, wherein the content X1(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, the content X2(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink and the content Y1(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink satisfy the relation of the following formulas (1) to (3):\n\n0.1\u2266(X2+Y1)/X1\u22662.5,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nX1+X2\u226710% by mass,\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nX2+Y1\u22673% by mass\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nand wherein the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 is a water-soluble polyhydric alcohol or water-soluble amide compound having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less, and a molecular weight Mw in the range of 100\u2266Mw\u22661000, the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 is a water-soluble alkanediol having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less, and a molecular weight Mw in the range of 100\u2266Mw\u2266150, the alkanediol further containing an \u2014OH group at both terminals of a main chain, and the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 is a water-soluble organic compound other than the colorant, the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2.",
        "In particular, it is preferable that the content Y1(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 is Y1<15% by mass and the difference between water retention abilities is 40% or more.",
        "The ink jet recording method of the present invention comprises applying the above-mentioned ink jet ink to a recording medium by an ink jet head to form an image.",

        "[Mechanism of Occurrence of Curling Phenomenon]",
        "The present invention has been made with the aim of preventing curling phenomenon of recording media after applying ink jet ink (hereinafter referred to as \u201cink\u201d) on recording media by an ink jet recording method.",
        "The mechanism of occurrence of curling phenomenon after printing on a recording medium is as follows. Cellulose fiber is formed into paper by a papermaking machine so as to be aligned (substantially forcibly oriented) along the direction of flow of paper. Since cellulose fiber has greatly different degrees of expansion due to moisture in the machine direction and the cross direction, dimensional change which occurs upon application of moisture varies in the short grain and in the long grain. Therefore, when moisture is applied on paper, cellulose fiber in the cross direction of paper is swelled and the length of paper is increased in the direction (mostly the long grain of paper) perpendicular to the flow direction (mostly the short grain of paper) of the papermaking machine when paper is formed. For this reason, when the amount of ink applied, i.e., the amount of moisture applied, is large upon printing, curling phenomenon occurs toward the direction opposite to the plane on which moisture is applied, namely, negative curling phenomenon occurs. However, due to gradual vaporization of moisture which was once absorbed into cellulose fiber, cellulose fiber starts to shrink to allow paper to shrink. According to this, the length of paper becomes shorter than that before moisture is applied. Thus, the paper gradually curls toward the direction of the plane on which moisture is applied, namely, positive curling phenomenon occurs. This seems to occur because moisture applied by printing first enters into hydrogen bond between fibers and as the moisture is transferred due to evaporation or the like, the tension applied at an initial stage is released and printed portions are shrunk. This positive curling phenomenon poses problems when ink jet recording is conducted on recording media such as plain paper.",
        "The inventors of the present invention carried out detail observation of positive curling phenomenon which occurs when printing is conducted by an ink jet recording method. As a result, they have found that the positive curling phenomenon continuously progresses for a long period when ink jet ink is applied on paper unlike the case where moisture is simply applied to paper.",
        "At present, organic compounds such as glycerol and urea which are contained in most kinds of ink jet ink greatly contribute to reliability, in particular, ejection stability of ink jet ink. On the contrary, it is considered that these organic compounds may be a cause of continuous progress of positive curling phenomenon.",
        "[Water-Retentive, Water-Soluble Organic Compound]",
        "Since curling phenomenon after applying a liquid medium containing water on paper seems to have a correlation with vaporization of moisture applied on the paper, inventors of the present invention conducted the following detailed studies on the water retention ability of water-soluble organic compounds which are commonly used for ink jet ink.",
        "First, 20 mass % aqueous solutions of various water-soluble organic compounds were prepared and 10 g of each solution was precisely weighed and put in a glass petri dish, and left to stand in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45%. Pure water containing no water-soluble organic compound was also left to stand. Due to vaporization of water, the solution in the petri dish decreased and consequently the weight becomes constant. In glass petri dish also left, which contained only pure water, all pure water was vaporized at this point, and it is thus considered that those remained in the petri dish containing a water-soluble organic compound is the water-soluble organic compound and the moisture retained in the substance. Based on this, the water retention ability of each water-soluble organic compound was calculated according to the following formula.",

        "Next, the above petri dish was moved to an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and humidity of 80% and after waiting until equilibrium is reached as in the above, then the water retention ability was measured under this condition. Further, the same petri dish was moved to an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% again and the water retention ability was measured. The obtained results are shown in FIG. 1. In addition, differences of water retention abilities in both environments are shown in FIG. 2.",
        "The inventors of the present invention have considered some correlation between the difference between water retention abilities under the aforementioned environments and the occurrence of curling phenomenon of plain paper. Based on this, occurrence of curling phenomenon was studied by applying, on plain paper, aqueous solutions containing a water-soluble organic compound examined above. As a result, it has been found that the water-soluble organic compound 1 which has a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less can significantly prevent curling phenomenon. Then, ink containing a coloring material, additives and these water-soluble organic compounds was prepared and ink jet recording was conducted to observe occurrence of curling phenomenon. As a result, it was confirmed that no curling phenomenon occurred even after lapse of a few days at room temperature after printing.",
        "The water-retentive water-soluble organic compound in the present invention refers to a water-soluble organic compound having a water retention ability of 5% or more in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45%.",
        "However, when ink composed of a water-soluble organic compound 1 as only water-soluble organic compound is put in an ink jet recording head which ejects droplets from nozzles and the head is attached to an ink jet recording apparatus and left for a long time, there arose other problems that the ejection stability is deteriorated due to clogging of the nozzles and that printing of initial portions is unstable at the beginning of printing in a low temperature, low humidity environment.",
        "In such circumstances, the inventors of the present invention have continued further studies with the aim of ensuring ejection stability equal to that of conventional ink jet ink with preventing curling phenomenon to a certain degree or more. As a result, it has been finally found that the above-mentioned problems can be solved by adding, to ink jet ink, in addition to the a water-soluble organic compound 1, a water-soluble organic compound other than the water-soluble organic compound 1, which is more specifically a water-soluble organic compound 2 having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of more than 36%, in a proportion satisfying the conditions of the following formula (I) and formula (II)\n\n0<Y/X\u22660.9\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nX+Y\u226715 mass %\u2003\u2003(II)\n\n(X: content (%) of water-soluble organic compound 1 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, Y: content (%) of water-soluble organic compound based on the total amount of the ink jet ink).",
        "Furthermore, the studies by the inventors of the present invention has revealed that when a large amount, specifically more than 3.0 g/m2, of ink is applied, the content X(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1 needs to be 10 mass % or more based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, in addition to the above-mentioned conditions.",
        "The water-soluble organic compound 1 is preferably a polyhydric alcohol having an amide bond or polyhydric alcohol having a sulfone group.",
        "The water-soluble organic compound 2 in the present invention corresponds to water-soluble organic compounds generally used for ink jet ink. The water-soluble organic compound 2 has a great difference between water retention abilities, easily releases moisture in the process of drying of recording media to which moisture is applied, and accelerates shrinkage of cellulose fiber. Most of the water-soluble organic compounds 2 have small molecular weight of about 100 or less, and easily migrate within a recording medium as moistures do, and are difficult to be fixed on cellulose fiber. Accordingly, the water-soluble organic compound 2 gradually migrates within the recording medium to accelerate curling phenomenon. Therefore, curling phenomenon is rather great when a large amount of ink containing a water-soluble organic compound 2 which is usually used for ink jet ink is applied on plain paper.",
        "The studies by the inventors of the present invention have revealed that even if ink jet ink contains a water-soluble organic compound 2 which has a property of accelerating curling phenomenon, curling phenomenon can be effectively prevented and ejection stability is improved when the above-mentioned water-soluble organic compound is contained and the content ratio Y/X of the water-soluble organic compound and the water-soluble organic compound is adjusted to 0<Y/X\u22660.9 as shown in the formula (1).",
        "In addition, the inventors of the present invention have also found that the total content X+Y(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1 and the water-soluble organic compound 2 must be X+Y\u226715 mass %. This is because when ink is applied on paper, it is necessary to relatively reduce the moisture content by increasing the total content of the water-soluble organic compounds in the ink jet ink in order to prevent vaporization of water in a short term and paper shrinkage due to migration in particular. In addition to this, it is speculated that, in order to prevent vaporization of ink applied on paper, the total amount of water-retentive water-soluble organic compounds, i.e., the water-soluble organic compound 1 and the water-soluble organic compound 2, needs to be 15 mass % or more.",
        "The above-mentioned X+Y satisfies the relation of more preferably X+Y\u226720 mass %, further preferably X+Y\u226725 mass %. The inventors of the present invention prepared ink having a greater total content X+Y (%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1 and the water-soluble organic compound 2 and observed curling phenomenon. As a result, when the above-mentioned X+Y is great, curling phenomenon which occurs within a short time after printing can be effectively prevented. In particular, when the X+Y is X+Y\u226725 mass %, curling phenomenon which occurs within a short time after printing has improved quite effectively.",
        "In addition, the water content is preferably 77 mass % or less, more preferably 71 mass % or less based on the total amount of the ink jet ink.",
        "In addition, the content Y(%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2 is preferably Y<15 mass % based on the total amount of the ink jet ink. The reason for this can be presumed as follows. As described above, since the water-soluble organic compound has a property of accelerating curling phenomenon, the higher the content thereof in the ink, the higher the occurrence of curling phenomenon. For this reason, even if ink jet ink contains a large amount of water-soluble organic compound 1, the water-soluble organic compound causes migration of the water-soluble organic compound 1, reducing the effect of preventing curling phenomenon of the water-soluble organic compound 1. The difference between water retention abilities of the water-soluble organic compound is preferably 40% or more.",
        "Another embodiment of the present invention described below can also effectively prevent curling phenomenon after printing on a recording medium, in particular, plain paper, and can achieve excellent ejection stability.",
        "The inventors of the present invention continued further studies using the water-soluble organic compound and the water-soluble organic compound 2. As a result, it has been found that the above-mentioned problems can be effectively solved by incorporating, in ink jet ink, one or more of each of specific water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and water-soluble organic compound 1-2 among the water-soluble organic compounds 1. That is, it has been found that the above-mentioned problems can be solved by incorporating a water-soluble organic compound 1-1, a water-soluble organic compound 1-2, and a water-soluble organic compound 2-1 in a proportion that the contents X1(%), X2(%) and Y1(%) of the aforementioned water-soluble organic compounds based on the total amount of the ink jet ink satisfy the following conditions.\n\n0.1\u2266(X2+Y1)/X1\u22662.5\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n10 mass %\u2266X1+X2\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n3 mass %\u2266X2+Y1\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n(X1: content (%) of water-soluble organic compound 1-1 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, X2: content (%) of the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, Y1: content (%) of water-soluble organic compound 2-1 based on the total amount of the ink jet ink)",
        "The action of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 in this embodiment is described below.",
        "The water-soluble organic compound 1-1 is a water-soluble polyhydric alcohol or water-soluble amide compound having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less, and a molecular weight Mw in the range of 100\u2266Mw\u22661000.",
        "Because the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 has large molecules, it is difficult to penetrate into cellulose fiber and thus has little effect on curling phenomenon occurring within a relatively short time after printing. However, once the compound enters into cellulose fiber, it hardly causes migration. This seems to be because the compound has moderate water retention ability and is less likely to accumulate water more than needed, and has high affinity with cellulose fiber because the compound has, in the molecule, a plurality of, specifically, at least three portions which easily form a hydrogen bond.",
        "For example, triols have 3 or more \u2014OH groups, saccharides have 2 or more \u2014OH groups and a carbonyl group, N,N\u2032-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-urea has 2 or more \u2014OH groups and an amide bond, bishydroxyethyl sulfone has 2 or more \u2014OH groups and a sulfone group, and tetraethylene glycol has 2 or more \u2014OH groups and 3 or more ether bonds. It is also considered that a plurality of factors such as large molecular size and low possibility of migration with water are playing some part effectively.",
        "On the other hand, although diethylene glycol, for example, has a molecular weight of 100 or more and 2\u2014OH groups at both terminals of the molecule and an ether bond in the molecule, the effect of preventing curling phenomenon is low. This seems to be because the hydrophilicity (property of bonding to hydrogen) is smaller with only one ether bond compared to one \u2014OH group, and in an aqueous solution containing the same, molecules are bent due to interaction between the ether bond and water molecules and the molecular size becomes smaller. It is thus considered that diols having an ether bond in the molecule needs to have at least three ether bonds so as to exhibit the effect of preventing curling phenomenon.",
        "The water-soluble organic compound 1-2 is water-soluble alkane diol having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of 36% or less, and a molecular weight Mw in the range of 100\u2266 Mw\u2266150 and an \u2014OH group at both terminals of the main chain.",
        "The action of the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 is to prevent curling phenomenon which occurs within a relatively short time after printing (a few hours after printing). Although the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 effectively prevents curling phenomenon which occurs within a relatively short time after printing, it has a smaller effect on curling phenomenon which occurs within a time frame longer than that (5, 6 hours to several weeks). This seems to be because the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 is alkane diol which has a molecular weight of 100 to 150 or lower and contains a \u2014OH group at both terminals of the main chain, and as it contains no hydrophilic bond such as an ether bond in the molecule, the molecules are not bent, making the molecular size relatively large. In addition, it is considered that due to its lipophilic intermolecular structure and hydrophilic molecular terminals, the compound has a characteristic similar to that of a surfactant and thus tends to moisten the cellulose fiber quickly. Further, the moderate molecular size may make it easier to penetrate into the cellulose fiber, enabling the prevention of curling phenomenon which occurs within a short time. However, it is considered that because the number of \u2014OH groups which have an affinity to cellulose fiber is small, migration may occur in a long time.",
        "The inventors of the present invention have found that combination use of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 has an effect of preventing curling phenomenon for a short time to a long time after printing compared to the case in which only one kind of the water-soluble organic compounds is contained. This seems to be because the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 have a similar structure and therefore have a high compatibility, and thus the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 can be effectively introduced to cellulose fiber together with the water-soluble organic compound 1-2, thereby achieving prevention of curling phenomenon for a short time to a long time after printing.",
        "The inventors of the present invention have found that prevention of short-time curling phenomenon can be effectively improved particularly when the total content of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 in the case of combination use is less than 25 mass % based on the total amount of the ink jet ink, or when the water content is more than 71 mass % based on the total amount of the ink jet ink. In particular, in the aforementioned conditions, ink containing a water-soluble organic compound 1-2 and ink which does not contain the same present a remarkable contrast in curling phenomenon which occurs within a relatively short time after printing.",
        "As described above, ink jet ink containing the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 can prevent curling phenomenon effectively. However, to satisfy the ejection stability of ink jet ink, it is necessary to use a water-soluble organic compound 2-1 in combination.",
        "Herein, the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 is other than a colorant, a water-soluble organic solvent 1-1 and a water-soluble organic solvent 1-2. More specifically, it is a water-soluble organic compound having a difference between the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 45% and the water retention ability in an environment of a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 80% of more than 36%.",
        "The reason can be assumed as follows. As described above, the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 has a surfactant-like characteristic, and has low compatibility with a colorant. Therefore, the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 exists near the ink jet nozzle at a concentration higher than those of other components, and this prevents vaporization of moisture near the nozzle. By using a water-soluble organic compound 2-1 which has high compatibility with colorant and high water retention ability, increase in viscosity inside the nozzle can be prevented and the ejection stability is improved.",
        "The studies by the inventors of the present invention have revealed that even if ink jet ink contains water-soluble organic compound 2-1 which has a property of accelerating curling phenomenon, curling phenomenon can be continuously prevented for a short time to a long time after printing and ejection stability can be improved when the above-mentioned water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and water-soluble organic compound 1-2 are contained and the proportion (X2+Y1)/X1 of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1, the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 and the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 is set to 0.1\u2266(X2+Y1)/X1\u22662.5 as shown in the formula (1).",
        "The studies by the inventors of the present invention have also revealed that in order to prevent curling phenomenon when a large amount, specifically more than 3.0 g/m2, of ink is applied, the sum X1+X2(%) of the contents of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 must be X1+X2\u226710 mass %.",
        "The studies by the inventors of the present invention have also revealed that to improve the ejection stability, the sum X2+Y1 of the contents of the water-soluble organic compound 1-2 and the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 must be X2+Y1\u22673 mass %, in addition to the above-mentioned conditions.",

        "Further, the content Y1 (%) of the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 is preferably Y1<15 mass % based on the total amount of the ink jet ink. The reason can be assumed as follows. As described above, the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 has a property of accelerating curling phenomenon, and the higher the content thereof in the ink, the higher the occurrence of curling phenomenon. For this reason, even if ink jet ink contains large amounts of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2, the water-soluble organic compound 2-1 causes migration of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2, and reduces the effect of preventing curling phenomenon of the water-soluble organic compound 1-1 and the water-soluble organic compound 1-2.

In particular, N,N\u2032-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-urea is preferable. The reason is because N,N\u2032-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-urea has an ability to prevent association of molecules, and in the present invention where it is essential to use other water-soluble organic compounds together, it would prevent the association of the water-soluble organic compounds. Particularly, in the case of ink used for an ink jet recording method, abilities such as prevention of clogging and solubility of dye can be exhibited more easily, whereby curling phenomenon can be effectively prevented and ejection stability and reliability can be greatly improved. In particular, when N,N\u2032-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-urea or bishydroxyethyl sulfone is used as a water-soluble organic compound or a water-soluble organic compound 1-1, diol or triol having 5 or more carbon atoms is preferably used in combination. Of the diols or triols having 5 or more carbon atoms, in particular, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,2,6-hexanetriol are preferable. When they are used in combination, the above-mentioned ability to prevent association of molecules can be more effectively exerted, and a particularly excellent curling phenomenon prevention effect and ejection stability can be obtained.",

To solve this problem, at least one of the above-mentioned water-soluble organic compounds 1 or the water-soluble organic compounds 1-1 is preferably a water-soluble organic compound containing a sulfone bond in the molecule. Of such compounds, bishydroxyethyl sulfone is most preferable. This is because, when used in combination with other components, bishydroxyethyl sulfone makes solvation between the other components and water difficult, and reduces viscosity. Thus, in the case of ink jet ink recording method in particular, bishydroxyethyl sulfone is effective for improving start-up characteristic of the ejection stabilities.",
        "In addition, water-soluble organic compounds such as urea and ethylene urea are preferable because they have a small molecular weight and do not easily increase the viscosity even if added in greater amounts.

        "The ink of the present invention containing self-dispersing carbon black in which M is ammonium or organic ammonium can further improve the water resistance of recorded images, and the ink is especially suitable in this respect. This seems to be because when the ink is applied on a recording medium, ammonium is decomposed and ammonia is evaporated. Self-dispersing carbon black in which M is ammonium is obtained, for example, by a method of replacing alkaline metal M of self-dispersing carbon black with ammonium by an ion exchange method, or by a method in which an acid is added to convert M into an H type, and then ammonium hydroxide is added to convert M into ammonium.",
