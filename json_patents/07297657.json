        "This invention generally relates to an improved process for reacting N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines (sometimes referred to as \u201cN-substituted glyphosates\u201d), salts of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines, and esters of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines to form N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (sometimes referred to as \u201cglyphosate\u201d), salts of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, and esters of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine via a noble-metal catalyzed oxidation reaction. This invention is particularly directed to such reactions using N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines, salts of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines, and esters of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines which have a single N-carboxymethyl functionality.",
        "N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is described by Franz in U.S. Pat. No. 3,799,758, and has the following formula:",
        "N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine and its salts conveniently are applied as a post-emergent herbicide in an aqueous formulation. It is a highly effective and commercially important broad-spectrum herbicide useful in killing or controlling the growth of a wide variety of plants, including germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, maturing and established woody and herbaceous vegetation, and aquatic plants.",
        "Various methods for the preparation of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine from N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines are known in the art. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,956,370, Parry et al. teach that N-benzylglycine may be phosphonomethylated to N-benzyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, and then reacted with hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid to cleave the benzyl group and thereby produce N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,927,080, Gaertner teaches that N-t-butylglycine may be phosphonomethylated to form N-t-butyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, and then converted into N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine via acid hydrolysis. N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine also may be produced from N-benzyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine via hydrogenolysis, as described, for example, in European Patent Application No. 55,695. A separate discussion directed to producing N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine from N-benzyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine via hydrogenolysis may be found in Maier, L., Phosphorus, Sulfur and Silicon, 61, 65\u20137 (1991). These processes are problematic in that they produce undesirable byproducts such as isobutylene and toluene which create difficulties due to their potential toxicities. Moreover, acid hydrolysis and hydrogenation of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines have been reported only for hydrocarbyl groups such as tertiary butyl and benzyl groups which are generally known to be susceptible to such reactions; there has not been reported a general method for dealkylation of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines.",
        "Other methods for the preparation of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine include those directed to oxidatively cleaving N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (sometimes referred to as \u201cPMIDA\u201d):",
        "PMIDA may be synthesized, for example, from phosphorus trichloride, formaldehyde, and an aqueous solution of the disodium salt of iminodiacetic acid, as described by Gentilcore in U.S. Pat. No. 4,775,498:",
        "This reaction is complicated by the necessity of removing sodium chloride from the PMIDA product. Sodium chloride has low solubility in the presence of HCl due to the common ion effect, and both iminodiacetic acid and PMIDA are insoluble in HCl and in water under neutral conditions. Thus, salt separation requires that the NaCl be dissolved after the reaction forming PMIDA is complete. This is done by neutralizing the HCl with a base, and then adding water to ensure that all the NaCl dissolves. This large volume of water leads to significant losses of PMIDA during recovery, and increases the volume of waste.",
        "Various methods for converting PMIDA into N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine are well known in the art. These include:\n\n    1. Heterogeneous catalytic oxidation. This method is discussed, for example by Franz in U.S. Pat. No. 3,950,402. A separate discussion may be found in Balthazor et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,654,429.\n    2. Homogeneous catalytic oxidation. This method is described, for example, in Riley et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 113, 3371\u201378 (1991). A separate discussion may be found in Riley et al., Inorg. Chem., 30, 4191\u201397 (1991).\n    3. Electrochemical oxidation using carbon electrodes. This method is described, for example, by Frazier et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,835,000.\n\nSuch methods oxidatively remove one of the two N-carboxymethyl groups from PMIDA. Generally, such oxidative decarboxylations rely on a one-electron oxidation of PMIDA accompanied by loss of carbon dioxide to form a carbon based radical. The radical is then oxidized to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine in a subsequent one-electron step. These reactions are summarized as follows:",
        "Oxidative decarboxylations, in general, are well known in the art, particularly for electrochemical oxidations (also known as the Kolbe reaction).

        "If R\u2032 is other than a carboxymethyl, removal of R\u2032 typically requires a single, two-electron oxidation of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, rather than two successive one-electron oxidations.",

Such a process also would allow for N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine to be made from N-methyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (sometimes referred to as \u201cNMG\u201d), an undesirable byproduct from the carbon-catalyzed oxidation of PMIDA. Such a process would further allow for the use of the various N-substituted glycine reactants and N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactants that\u2014unlike iminodiacetic acid and PMIDA\u2014are soluble in HCl, and therefore more easily separated from the chloride salt byproduct which forms when PCl3 and CH2O are used to phosphonomethylate N-substituted glycine salts.",

Preferably, the amount of water used for the reaction is minimized to optimize recovery of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.",
        "The formaldehyde used in the phosphonomethylation reaction may typically be derived from any source of formaldehyde. Suitable sources of formaldehyde include, for example, formaldehyde itself, formalin, and paraformaldehyde.",
        "The phosphorous acid (H3PO3) used in the phosphonomethylation reaction also may typically be derived from any source of phosphorous acid. Suitable sources of phosphorous acid include, for example, neat phosphorous acid, phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous tribromide, phosphorous acid esters, chlorophosphonic acid, phosphorous acid esters, chlorophosphonic acid and esters of chlorophosphonic acid. One preferred source is phosphorous trichloride (PCl3), which is particularly preferred where the N-substituted glycine starting material is a salt. When PCl3 is combined with water, the PCl3 is hydrolyzed to form H3PO3 and 3 equivalents of HCl (the rate of PCl3 addition preferably is determined by the rate at which the HCl gas evolved in the reaction can be safely removed).

Other salts besides sodium salts may be used, with salts comprising agronomically acceptable cations being preferred. Alkali metal salts of an N-substituted glycine are especially preferred because of the favorable cost of such salts, and because ammonium salts (a well-known alternative salt) can potentially lead to undesirable side reactions during phosphonomethylation.",
        "The order of adding CH2O and PCl3 to the N-substituted glycine salt solution is not critical (especially where both the N-substituted glycine reactant and N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product are soluble in the presence of HCl), and they may be added in the same or separate reactors (i.e., the \u201creaction zone\u201d may comprise one or more reactors). In addition, the CH2O may be added to the mixture before or after the chloride salt precipitate is removed (again, especially where both the N-substituted glycine reactant and N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product are soluble in the presence of HCl). It is often most preferred to add the CH2O after the PCl3 has been added and the chloride salt has been removed.",
        "Preferably, approximately equimolar quantities of H3PO3 and the N-substituted glycine reactant are combined with at least an equimolar quantity of CH2O in the presence of a strong acid having a pKa of no greater than about 1.0. The concentration of the strong acid in the solution preferably is greater than that of the H3PO3, and the number of moles of CH2O added to the reaction mixture preferably is at least 10% greater than the number of moles of either the H3PO3 and the N-substituted glycine reactant, and more preferably is from about 15 to about 25% greater. The CH2O preferably is added to the solution over a period of from about 3 to about 20 minutes as an aqueous solution comprising from about 37% to about 50% CH2O, although both lesser and greater concentrations also may be used.",
        "In one particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, the N-substituted glycine reactant and the resulting N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine phosphonomethylation product are soluble in the presence of HCl. Such N-substituted glycines and N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines may be easily separated (using, for example, any convenient filtration method) from the NaCl or other chloride salt which precipitates after the PCl3 is added to the solution. This makes phosphonomethylation of such compounds less difficult than phosphonomethylation of iminodiacetic acid to PMIDA using PCl3 (as discussed above in the Background of the Invention section, both iminodiacetic acid and PMIDA are substantially insoluble in the presence of HCl, making salt separation more costly). In an especially preferred embodiment, the N-substituted glycine reactant is selected from the group consisting of sarcosine (i.e., N-methyl glycine) and N-ethyl glycine, with sarcosine being most preferred.",
        "FIG. 1 schematically shows one embodiment that may be used to prepare an N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine by combining an N-substituted glycine salt, CH2O, PCl3, and water. For illustration purposes, the N-substituted glycine salt is sodium sarcosinate (i.e., sodium N-methyl glycine). In this embodiment, the PCl3 preferably is introduced into a hydrolyzer reactor 1 comprising a stirred aqueous mixture of CH2O and the sodium N-methyl glycine. The resulting reaction forms HCl and an NaCl precipitate as by-products, in addition to the desired N-methyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (\u201cNMG\u201d). The NaCl precipitate preferably is removed from the mixture using, for example, a filter 2. After the salt precipitate is removed from the solution, the NMG preferably is precipitated by both adding a base (preferably NaOH) to the solution and removing water from the solution (preferably using an evaporator/crystallizer 3). It is preferred not to remove so much water that further salt (e.g., NaCl) produced from the base addition precipitates. The base may be added before, at the same time, or after the water is removed. The amount of base added preferably is the amount required to substantially neutralize the HCl present in the solution. After the NMG precipitates, it preferably is recovered from the solution using, for example, a centrifuge 4. Example 18 further illustrates this phosphonomethylation process.",
        "It should be noted that the process may be varied widely. For example, as noted above, the process may be conducted in a single reaction vessel, or in two or more reaction vessels in series so that, for example, the CH2O and PCl3 are added to the N-substituted glycine salt solution in separate reaction vessels. The N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine also may, at least in part, be precipitated by cooling the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the process may be conducted in a batch-wise, semi-batch-wise, or a continuous manner. In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, at least a portion of the solution (remaining after removal of the NMG) is recycled back to the hydrolyzer reactor 1 to take advantage of any un-reacted N-methyl glycine reactant which is still present in the solution and to reduce the loss of un-precipitated NMG. The embodiment shown in FIG. 1 includes such a recycle stream.",
        "One particular embodiment of this invention is directed to phosphonomethylating N-substituted glycine salts having the formula (XIII):",

In this embodiment, the salt is converted into an N-substituted glycine free acid before being phosphonomethylated. The free acid has the formula (XII):",
        "wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined for the N-substituted glycine salt. This embodiment provides a means to avoid the difficulties associated with salts of R6 that form when N-substituted glycine salts are phosphonomethylated directly.",
        "One particularly preferred method for converting an N-substituted glycine salt into the corresponding free acid comprises neutralization of a solution comprising the salt using a cation exchange membrane. More specifically, the solution comprising the N-substituted glycine salt is contacted with one side of a cation exchange membrane while the other side of the membrane is simultaneously contacted with a solution comprising a strong acid which is capable of neutralizing the salt. The two solutions neutralize each other across the membrane, as shown schematically below for a solution comprising an N-substituted glycine sodium salt and a solution comprising an arbitrary acid (\u201cHA\u201d):",
        "A stream comprising the N-substituted glycine free acid and a stream comprising a sodium salt of HA are produced. To avoid membrane fouling, the concentration of the N-substituted glycine salt preferably is less than the solubility of the corresponding N-substituted glycine free acid at the neutralization temperature. In addition, the amount of acid used preferably is sufficient to completely neutralize the N-substituted glycine salt, but does not substantially exceed this amount. The strong acid preferably has a pKa of no greater than about 1.0. It is particularly preferred to use non-halogen-containing acids (e.g., methane sulfonic acid, toluene sulfonic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid) to avoid contaminating the N-substituted glycine free acid stream with halogens in the event of a torn membrane. Reducing the risk of such contamination is desirable due to the deleterious effect that halogens have on the oxidization catalysts that are used following phosphonomethylation to convert the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine into N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.",
        "Preferably, the cation exchange membrane is mechanically stable under the reaction conditions (e.g., the membrane preferably does not decompose temperatures of at least about 50\u00b0 C.), and does not allow the N-substituted glycine salt and free acid to leak across the membrane. Examples of suitable cation exchange membranes are ESC7000 and Sybron MC3470 membranes available from the Electrosynthesis Company of Lancaster, PA; ICE-450 membranes from Gelman Sciences and Neosepta cation exchange membranes from Tokoyama Soda Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; Ionclad and Raipore membranes from Pall Specialty Materials of Port Washington, N.Y.; and Nafion 117, 350, and 450 membranes produced by DuPont Corporation and available from the Electrosynthesis Company and from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis. Neutralization via ion exchange (known as \u201cDonnan dialysis\u201d) in general is well known in the art, and is described in, for example, K. Scott, Handbook of Industrial Membranes at 705 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1995) (incorporated herein by reference).",
        "Electrohydrolysis is an alternative means to convert an N-substituted glycine salt into the corresponding free acid. Conversion of acid salts to the free acid by electrohydrolysis (also known as \u201celectrodialysis\u201d) is well known in the art. The general process is described in, for example, H. P. Gregor, Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design, 17, 349\u201363 (J. J. McKetta & W. A. Cunninghams, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y. 1983) (incorporated herein by reference). Examples of conversion of amino acid salts to the corresponding free acids by electrohydrolysis may be found in Kuwata et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,330,749 (incorporated herein by reference). Electrohydrolysis is less preferred than ion-exchange neutralization because electrolysis tends to offer less control over the degree of conversion of the salt to free acid.",
        "Once the N-substituted glycine free acid has been formed by ion exchange neutralization, electrohydrolysis, or another suitable method, it preferably is phosphonomethylated to form an N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine having formula (I) or a salt thereof:",
        "wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, \u2014PO3R12R13, \u2014SO3R14, \u2014NO2, hydrocarbyl, and substituted hydrocarbyl-other than \u2014CO2R15; R12, R13, and R14 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, and substituted hydrocarbyl; and R15 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, and an agronomically acceptable cation. The phosphonomethylation preferably is conducted by a process comprising combining the N-substituted glycine free acid, water, a source of CH2O, a strong acid having a pKa of no greater than about 1.0, and a source of H3PO3. The source of H3PO3 may be PCl3, which, for example, may be added directly into a solution comprising the N-substituted glycine free acid. Alternatively, the source of H3PO3 may be, for example, free of halogens, with neat H3PO3 or an aqueous solution comprising H3PO3 being especially preferred. A solution comprising H3PO3 may be obtained by, for example, hydrolysis of alkyl phosphites, followed by distillation of the alcohols. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the solution is formed by hydrolyzing PCl3 in water in a vessel separate from the solution comprising the N-substituted glycine free acid. Although, about 3 equivalents of HCl are formed when PCl3 hydrolyzes, substantially all the HCl goes into the gas phase and therefore may be readily separated from the hydrolysis reaction mixture. The HCl gas may then be combined with water to form an aqueous HCl solution. Thus, two solutions may be formed with little difficulty: (1) an HCl-containing solution, and (2) an H3PO3\u2014 containing solution having a low halogen (i.e., chloride) concentration. The HCl solution may, in turn, be used as the source of acid for the ion-exchange neutralization of N-substituted glycine salt solutions.",
        "If the source of H3PO3 is free of halogens, it is particularly preferable for the source of acid for the phosphonomethylation reaction to also be free of halogens. In this instance, H2SO4 is especially preferred. As noted above, use of such halogen-free acid sources is desirable due to the deleterious effect that halogens have on the oxidization catalysts that are used following phosphonomethylation to convert the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant into N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.",
        "In general, at the conclusion of a phosphonomethylation reaction, it is preferable to neutralize the strong acid. Neutralization typically aids in the recovery of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. Neutralization also tends to reduce the problems associated with the presence of strong acids when the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines are used to synthesize N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, a salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, or an ester of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine; strong acids tend to inhibit the oxidation of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycines to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the phosphonomethylation reaction mixture is neutralized by using the strong acid present in the mixture as the source of acid to convert (via the cation exchange membrane process discussed above) an N-substituted glycine salt into an N-substituted glycine free acid for subsequent use as a starting material in the phosphonomethylation reaction. In this case, the phosphonomethylation reaction mixture is contacted with one side of the cation exchange membrane while the other side of the membrane is simultaneously contacted with a solution comprising the N-substituted glycine salt:",
        "Example 29 further illustrates this embodiment.",
        "Alternatively, the phosphonomethylation reaction mixture may be neutralized by simply adding a base to the reaction mixture after the phosphonomethylation reaction is substantially complete. In this embodiment, if an N-substituted glycine free acid is used as the starting material for the phosphonomethylation, NaOH is typically the preferred base for the neutralization. On the other hand, if an N-substituted glycine salt is used as the staring material, the generally preferred base is the hydroxide of the same cation as in the N-substituted glycine salt. For example, if sodium N-substituted glycinate is used, NaOH would be the preferred base.",
        "The above processes for neutralizing the phosphonomethylation reaction mixture also may be combined. Use of such a combination is preferred when the degree of neutralization achieved by the cation exchange membrane process is less than that required to substantially neutralize all the strong acid in the mixture. In this instance, sufficient base preferably is added to substantially neutralize the strong acid following completion of the cation exchange membrane neutralization process.",
        "Under many circumstances, it is preferred to recover the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine as a solid following the phosphonomethylation. This may be achieved, for example, by forming a reaction mixture containing a supersaturated concentration of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (either during phosphonomethylation or after phosphonomethylation) so that the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine will precipitate. Use of such an embodiment is especially preferred when the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine precipitates readily at supersaturated conditions, such as N-methyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. This supersaturation may be achieved by, for example, (1) using a high concentration of the N-substituted glycine reactant (and adding the source of CH2O after any halogen-containing salt precipitate has been removed); or (2) removing water from the reaction mixture, adding base to the reaction mixture, and/or lowering the temperature of the reaction mixture following the phosphonomethylation and removal of any halogen-containing salt precipitate. Precipitating the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is often particularly preferable when conducting the phosphonomethylation in a continuous reaction system, which reduces the need for a neutralization step to recover the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. In this instance, the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine preferably is filtered from the reaction mixture as it precipitates, and the filtrate is returned to the phosphonomethylation reactor. In such a system, preferably a portion of the water in the reaction mixture is removed; this allows a constant volume to be maintained in the phosphonomethylation reaction zone. This removal may be conducted via, for example, evaporation following filtration of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. In an especially preferred embodiment, however, at least a portion of the water is removed (e.g., by evaporation) from the reaction mixture before filtration to cause a greater amount of N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine to precipitate.",
        "In some circumstances, it is less preferred to recover the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine as a solid following phosphonomethylation. Unlike NMG, some N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactants (e.g., N-isopropyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) do not precipitate readily, even at supersaturated conditions. In these cases, it is often preferable to neutralize the phosphonomethylation reaction mixture and perform the subsequent catalytic oxidation directly on the neutralized mixture without isolation of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant as a solid. Under such an approach, it is desirable for the reaction mixture to be free of halogens because, as noted above, halogens tend to have a deleterious effect on the noble metal catalysts used to oxidize the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactants. Thus, in such situations, the phosphonomethylation reaction preferably uses a source of H3PO3 which, in contrast to PCl3, does not contain halogens. Likewise, it is preferred to use an acid during the phosphonomethylation reaction which does not contain halogens (H2SO4 being especially preferred).",
        "It should be noted that the above phosphonomethylation methods are not the only processes by which N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactants may be obtained. For example, NMG is produced as an undesirable byproduct from the carbon-catalyzed oxidation of PMIDA.",

A catalyst comprising a noble metal on a support also may be prepared by depositing the noble metal onto the surface of the support using any of the various methods well-known in the art. Such methods include liquid phase methods such as reaction deposition techniques (e.g., deposition via reduction of noble metal compounds, and deposition via hydrolysis of noble metal compounds), ion exchange techniques, excess solution impregnation, and incipient wetness impregnation; vapor phase methods such as physical deposition and chemical deposition; precipitation; electrochemical deposition; and electroless deposition.

B., Catalyst Supports and Supported Catalysts, Theoretical and Applied Concepts (Butterworths, Boston, Mass. 1987) (incorporated herein by reference).

As to the latter type, oxidation of the support may be carried out, for example, by immersing the support in a boiling solution comprising H2O2. Preferably, at least about 10 wt % (i.e., 10% by weight) of the solution is H2O2. More preferably, at least about 20 wt % of the solution is H2O2, and even more preferably, at least about 30 wt % of the solution is H2O2.

The polymeric support preferably is mechanically stable (e.g., the polymer preferably remains hard and is resistant to attrition, thermal degradation, hydrolysis, and acid attack) under the reaction conditions. In addition, the polymer preferably is in the form of cross-linked beads which allow the catalyst to be easily handled, dispersed in the reaction mixture, and filtered following the reaction. Preferably, the beads are porous and have a surface area of at least about 10 m2/g, with the noble metal being well-dispersed on the surface.

In a particularly preferred embodiment, the noble metal is platinum and is deposited onto the surface of the support using a solution comprising H2PtCl6. After the noble metal is deposited onto the support, the support and noble metal preferably are treated with a reducing environment, preferably an aqueous solution comprising sodium borohydride.

At concentrations greater than about 20 wt %, layers and clumps of noble metal tend to form. Thus, there are fewer surface noble metal atoms per total amount of noble metal used. This tends to reduce the activity of the catalyst and is an uneconomical use of the costly noble metal.",

Preferably, the promoter comprises a metal selected from the group consisting of aluminum (Al), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os), indium (In), gallium (Ga), tantalum (Ta), tin (Sn), and antimony (Sb).

Methods used to deposit the promoter are generally known in the art, and include the same methods which may be used to deposit a noble metal onto a support discussed above. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a solution of a halogen compound of the promoter is used to deposit the promoter by stirring the catalyst in the solution. Examples of suitable halogen compounds that may be used to deposit promoters include: for indium, InBr3; for gallium, GaBr3; for iron, FeCl3.6H2O; and for tin, SnCl2.2H2O. Example 25 demonstrates the deposition of a promoter using a solution comprising a halogen compound of the promoter.",

Less preferred, although suitable, alternative methods for introducing the oxygen include, for example (1) introducing oxygen into the headspace of the reactor and then drawing it into the reaction mixture using a vortex created by an impeller (this method is sometimes described as a back-mixed operation); or (2) passing the oxygen through a tubular reactor packed with catalyst through which the reaction medium also passes.",
        "It has been discovered in accordance with this invention that an excessive amount of oxygen-containing gas bubbles (i.e., undissolved oxygen) can reduce the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, it is preferable to minimize the amount of undissolved oxygen in the solution, and particularly preferable to minimize the amount of undissolved oxygen which comes into contact with the noble metal catalyst. One way to achieve this is to introduced the oxygen through a membrane which is in contact with the solution. The use of membranes for bubble-free gas transfer is discussed generally in, for example, Semmens, M. J. and Gantzer, C. J., in FED Vol. 187, Aeration Technology, Book No. G00865, pp. 51\u20138 (R.

        "In a particularly preferred embodiment, the reaction is conducted in a stirred-tank reactor employing a rotating impeller and having oxygen-containing gas bubbles introduced into the reaction solution below the upper surface of the solution. To avoid (or at least diminish) the reduction in selectivity due to the oxygen-containing bubbles, the impeller speed preferably is no greater than the speed necessary to prevent the oxygen-containing bubbles from rising directly to the surface of the solution upon their introduction into the solution. Alternatively, oxygen-containing bubbles may be introduced into the solution at a distance from the impeller such that the essentially no bubbles enter the region of the reactor through which the impeller passes, and more preferably such that no bubbles enter the region through which the impeller passes. For example, the oxygen may be introduced just below the upper surface of the liquid and well above the impeller, thereby allowing the bubbles to escape into the headspace rather than forming a gas/liquid turbulent zone around the impeller. Example 27 further illustrates introducing oxygen into a stirred-tank reactor just below the surface of the reaction solution.",
        "The adverse effects of undissolved oxygen also may often be avoided or diminished by introducing oxygen into the reaction mixture in a manner such that no greater than about 10% by volume of the reaction mixture consists of undissolved oxygen. In a more preferred embodiment, no greater than about 4% by volume of the reaction mixture consists of undissolved oxygen, and most preferably, no greater than about 1% by volume of the reaction mixture consists of undissolved oxygen.",
        "The adverse effects of undissolved oxygen in the reaction solution also may often be avoided or diminished by using a noble metal catalyst comprising an electroactive molecular species, as described above. The presence of an electroactive molecular species (particularly N,N\u2032-bis-(3-methylphenyl)-N,N\u2032-diphenyl benzidine) has been found to be especially beneficial for the oxidation of NMG to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. Example 27 further illustrates the use of N,N\u2032-bis-(3-methylphenyl)-N,N\u2032-diphenyl benzidine to reduce the adverse effects of undissolved oxygen.",
        "Preferably, the oxidation reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 50 to about 200\u00b0 C. More preferably, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 100 to about 190\u00b0 C., and still more preferably from about 125 to about 160\u00b0 C.",
        "The pressure in the reactor during the oxidation depends, in part, on the temperature used. Preferably, the pressure is sufficient to prevent the reaction mixture from boiling. If an oxygen-containing gas is used as the oxygen source, the pressure also preferably is adequate to cause the oxygen to dissolve into the reaction mixture at a rate sufficient to sustain the desired rate of reaction. The pressure preferably is at least equal to atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the oxygen partial pressure is from about 5 to about 500 psig. More preferably, when the temperature is in the range of from about 125 to about 160\u00b0 C., the oxygen partial pressure is from about 50 to about 200 psig.",
        "The oxidation reaction may be carried out using a wide variety of batch, semi-batch, or continuous reactor systems. Such systems may also include recycling a residual solution remaining after at least a portion of the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product has been removed from the reaction product mixture. Recycling the residual solution allows any unreacted N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant to be utilized and enhances recovery of any un-precipitated N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product in the reaction product mixture.",
        "In one embodiment of this invention for continuous systems, only a portion of the residual solution is recycled; the rest is purged. This embodiment is particularly useful for reaction systems in which a contaminant is present in the residual solution. Such a contaminant may, for example, be a salt byproduct which is formed when a strong acid is neutralized following the phosphonomethylation of an N-substituted glycine reactant. If the entire residual solution is recycled back to the oxidation reaction zone, the salt contaminant concentration in the reaction mixture will build up over time. Ultimately, the build up will result in the formation of a salt precipitate which will contaminate the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product. To reduce the rate of contaminant build up, a portion of the residual solution may be purged (this purged portion is sometimes referred to as the \u201cwaste solution\u201d). The remaining portion (sometimes referred to as the \u201crecycle solution\u201d) is recycled back to the oxidation reaction zone. The purging may be achieved by, for example, pressurizing the residual solution and contacting it with a membrane which selectively passes the contaminant to form the waste solution while retaining the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant and the unprecipitated N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product to form the recycle solution. Because the membrane selectively passes the contaminant and retains the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant and unprecipitated N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product, the waste solution (also called \u201cthe permeate\u201d) contains a greater concentration of the contaminant and a lower concentration of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant and unprecipitated N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant than the recycle solution. Preferably, the membrane has a molecular weight cutoff of less than about 1,000 daltons and is mechanically stable under the reaction conditions. Examples of suitable commercially available membranes include the SelRO membranes, MPF-34 and MPF-36, available from LCI Corporation (Charlotte, N.C.). This embodiment is further described in Example 30.",
        "In another embodiment of this invention, the oxidation reaction is discontinued before complete conversion of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant is obtained. It has been discovered in accordance with this invention that the activity and selectivity of the catalyst tends to decline as the oxidation reaction nears completion. It has further been discovered, however, that because many N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactants (including NMG and N-isopropyl N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) are more soluble than N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine itself (or salts thereof or esters thereof), the decline in activity and selectivity can be overcome by removing the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, the salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, or the ester of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine before the oxidation is complete. This may be achieved by, for example, removing the catalyst (by, for example, filtration), evaporating a portion of the water in the reaction mixture, and cooling the reaction mixture before there has been less-than-complete conversion. The evaporation and cooling steps precipitate much of the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product in the solution, thereby allowing the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product to be removed from the reaction solution. The residual solution comprising the un-reacted N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is then recycled back to the oxidation reactor.",
        "Preferably, the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is precipitated and removed when from about 20 to about 95% of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine has been consumed. More preferably, the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is precipitated and removed when from about 50 to about 90% of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine has been consumed, even more preferably when from about 50 to about 80% of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine has been consumed, and most preferably when from about 50 to about 70% of the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine has been consumed. Lower conversions lead to undesirably high recycle rates, whereas greater conversions (as discussed above) are associated with poor catalyst activity and reduced selectivity.",
        "A suitable reaction system employing this embodiment is shown schematically in FIG. 2, where, for illustration purposes, the N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant is NMG. An aqueous solution of NMG is combined with a heterogeneous noble metal catalyst and heated in the presence of oxygen in an oxidation reactor 1 until the desired conversion (described above) to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine is achieved. When the desired conversion is achieved, the catalyst is removed by, for example, filtration or centrifugation, and the filtrate is partially evaporated in an evaporator 2 to precipitate at least a portion of the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine product. The N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine precipitate is then separated from the filtrate by, for example, centrifugation in a centrifuge 3 to recover the N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine and form a second filtrate, which then may be again combined with the noble metal catalyst in the presence of oxygen in the oxidation reactor 1 to continue the oxidation reaction of the NMG still remaining in the second filtrate. In a continuous process, preferably only a portion of the filtrate is fed back into the oxidation reactor; the remaining portion is purged from the system to maintain purity in the reaction system.",
        "A particularly useful method for the production of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine or a salt thereof involves recycling the ketone which is produced as a by-product when an N-substituted N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine reactant, having a secondary alkyl group as its substituent, is oxidized:",

In this embodiment, the ketone by-product is used as a starting material to further synthesize an N-substituted glycine reactant, which in turn may be phosphonomethylated and then oxidized to form N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine or a salt thereof. Numerous well-known N-substituted glycine synthesis pathways that use ketones as starting materials may be used for this purpose. Typically, the ketone is coupled to an amine by reductive alkylation or reductive amination, a reaction which is well-known in the art. See, generally, A. Streitwieser, Jr. and C. H. Heathcock, Introduction to Organic Chemistry, 748 (Macmillan, New York, N.Y., 2nd ed. 1981) (incorporated herein by reference).",

Angewandte Chimie Int'l Ed. in English, Vol. 36, No. 16, 1700\u20132 (1997) (incorporated herein by reference). Two particularly useful methods are: (1) the Strecker reaction (described above), in which the primary amine is reacted with an aqueous solution of CH2O and HCN, followed by hydrolysis; and (2) the Wakamatsu reaction, in which the amine is first converted into the corresponding amide, and then reacted with CH2O and CO over a cobalt or palladium catalyst, followed by hydrolysis.",
        "In a further particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, the ketone is reacted with monoethanolamine and H2 over a solid metal-containing catalyst to form the N-substituted monoethanolamine, which may be converted into a salt of the corresponding N-substituted glycine by combining it with a strong base (preferably NaOH) over a solid copper-containing catalyst:",

As to the first step, Example 28 (below) illustrates such a reductive alkylation of monoethanolamine with ketones and H2 over metal-containing catalysts. This reaction has been shown to be highly selective using ethanol as a solvent. See Cope, A. C. and Hancock, E. M., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 64, 1503\u20136 (1942) (incorporated herein by reference).

The hydrophobic electroactive molecular species tended to increase the selectivity of the catalyst. Electroactive molecular species having oxidation potentials more negative than about +0.3 V vs SCE tended to decrease conversion. Thus, the preferred electroactive molecular species for enhancing the selectivity and conversion of NMG oxidation may be either organic or inorganic, but preferably are hydrophobic and have oxidation potentials more positive than about 0.3 volts vs. SCE.",

Deeper penetration was observed where nitric acid (a stronger acid) (catalyst 3) was used.

        "The activity and selectivity of the catalysts for NMG oxidation was determined under the reaction conditions of Example 8. Table 15 shows the results. In general, the conversions of the catalysts pre-treated with acid are poor compared to catalysts not pre-treated with acid, see, e.g., Examples 20 and 21. This suggests that catalysts having the Pt primarily in the interior of the PVP bead are less active for N-substituted glyphosate oxidation than catalysts in which the Pt is mostly on the bead surface. A more detailed examination of the data further reveals that the use of stronger acid, which leads to deposition of the platinum deeper in the particle, tends to lead to progressively less active and less selective catalysts. Thus, the preferred Pt on PVP catalysts for the oxidation of N-glyphosates substituted glyphosates are those in which the Pt is primarily deposited onto the surface of the support.",

Both rate and selectivity are seen to improve with stir rate up to a clear optimum of 1000 rpm. The reported rate is expressed in terms of moles of NMG oxidized per liter per hour. When the stirring was increased to 1200 rpm during the second run, the selectivity decreased. The 1200 rpm selectivity was even worse at the beginning of the third run.",
        "In the reactor described, the degree to which gas is pulled down into the vortex created by the impeller and prevented from bubbling, un-reacted, to the surface increases with the stirring rate up to about 950 rpm, at which point virtually all the gas is pulled into the turbulent zone around the impeller. As the stir rate increases further, however, the turbulent zone of gas-liquid mixing around the impeller widens until, at about 1500 rpm, it fills most of the liquid volume. The data below demonstrates that the optimal stirrer speed for the aerobic oxidation of NMG is that which is just sufficient to substantially prevent the gas bubbles from rising directly to the upper surface of the solution upon their introduction into the solution. Stirrer speeds significantly less than this preferred value tend to cause lower reaction rates and selectivities, while stirrer speeds significantly greater than the preferred value tend to create a wider zone of turbulence which also tends to cause a lower selectivity.",

        "Three runs were conducted. In each, NMG was oxidized to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine using a platinum black (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) catalyst. This reaction was conducted in the stirred reactor used in Example 17 with a stir rate of 1000 rpm.",
        "In the first run, the platinum black catalyst was modified by depositing N,N\u2032-bis-(3-methylphenyl)-N,N\u2032-diphenyl benzidine (\u201cTPD\u201d) onto the surface of the catalyst. This catalyst was prepared by suspending 0.70 g of platinum black in 20 ml of methylene chloride containing 7 mg of dissolved TPD. The catalyst was introduced into the reactor along with 40.1 g of NMG and 113 g of water. The pressure was maintained at 90 psig. Approximately 200 sccm of oxygen were bubbled through the mixture once the solution reached the reaction temperature (150\u00b0 C.). After 32 min., the conversion was 60.4% and the selectivity was 90.8%. After 56 min., the conversion was 77.2% and the selectivity was 83.1%.",
        "In the second run, the reactor was loaded with 0.70 g. of platinum black, 40.0 g of NMG, and 113.3 g of water. The pressure was maintained at 90 psig. The reactor used in Example 17 was modified so that oxygen was introduced through a frit which was placed near the surface of the reaction solution (i.e., about 1.3 cm from the surface in a reaction mixture having a total depth of about 15.2 cm) so that essentially all the oxygen bubbles could escape into the headspace without first coming into contact with the impeller (before this modification, the location of the frit was lower in the reaction mixture, thereby allowing a significant amount of oxygen bubbles to come into contact with the impeller). Approximately 200 sccm of oxygen were bubbled through the mixture once the solution reached the reaction temperature (150\u00b0 C.). After 30 min, the conversion was 59.6% and the selectivity was 92.0%. After 60 min, the conversion was 80.5% and the selectivity was 81.8%.",

The pressure was maintained at 66 psig. When the solution reached the reaction temperature (135\u00b0 C.), oxygen was bubbled into the solution at a flow rate of 100 sccm.

        "A series of runs were conducted utilizing various Pt-containing and Pd-containing catalysts. In each run, the catalyst was suspended in 25 ml of acetone in a glass pressure bottle equipped with a stir bar. Approximately 6.1 g (0.1 mole) of monoethanolamine was then added to the pressure bottle, and the mixture was stirred and allowed to stand for 5\u201310 min. A small amount of heat was evolved. The bottle was then pressurized to 90 psig with H2, and stirred overnight at room temperature at the same pressure. Subsequently, the bottle was de-pressurized, and the relative proportions of monoethanolamlne, N-isopropyl monoethanolamine, and N,N-diisopropyl ethanolamine were determined by gas chromatography.",
        "The catalysts shown in Table 23 were found to be the preferred catalysts for the reaction. Although rhodium on carbon (not shown in Table 23) was found to promote the reductive alkylation of acetone and monoethanolamine, it gave primarily the di-alkylated product. Raney nickel (also not shown in Table 23) exhibited low activity for the desired reaction (<40% conversion using 0.205 g. of 5% Rh/C).",

        "This example demonstrates the neutralization of sodium sarcosinate mediated by ion exchange membranes. The neutralization was conducted in an apparatus composed of two glass pieces. The lower piece was bowl-shaped except for a flange at the top with a groove inscribed for a 44 mm O-ring. The upper piece was cylindrical with a flange on the bottom identical to that on the lower piece. During operation, a Viton O-ring was placed in the upper flange and a piece of the membrane was sandwiched between the flange on the lower piece and the O-ring. The two pieces were held tightly together with a clamp.",
        "To prepare the apparatus for use, the lower piece of the apparatus was filled with a phosphonomethylation mixture (27 ml) prepared by combining 37.5 g (0.205 moles) of NMG, 20.9 g of concentrated sulfuric acid (1.0 equiv.), 16.6 g of 37% formalin (0.20 equiv.), and 212.3 g of water. This yielded a 15% NMG solution containing amounts of sulfuric acid and formalin which are typical of phosphonomethylation mixtures.",
        "After the lower piece was completely filled with the phosphonomethylation mixture, the membrane was placed on top before assembling the apparatus. Care was taken to avoid bubbles between the phosphonomethylation mixture and the membrane. Once the apparatus was assembled, 50 ml of a 5% aqueous solution of sodium sarcosinate was added to the upper (cylindrical) piece. A pH probe was inserted into the sodium sarcosinate solution, and magnetic stirring of the two solutions was initiated. The pH of the upper solution decreased as the neutralization proceeded.",
        "The following membranes were tested using the above equipment and protocol: Nafion 117 (manufactured by DuPont Co. of Wilmington, Del. and available from Aldrich Chemical of Milwaukee, Wis.); Ionclad EDS R4010 membrane (Pall Specialty Materials of Port Washington, N.Y.); and Raipore R1010, Ionac, and ESC 7000 membranes (available from The Electrosynthesis Company of East Amherst, N.Y.). All the membranes were effective in mediating the neutralization. The R4010 membrane was the fastest and exhibited proton fluxes of 0.03 amperes per square centimeter.",
        "This example demonstrates the use of nanofiltration membranes to remove bisulfate ions from a simulant also containing NMG, glyphosate, and dihydrogen phosphate. The proportions of these components in the simulant are representative of those in processes in which an N-substituted glyphosate is prepared by phosphonomethylation catalyzed by H2SO4, and then oxidized to glyphosate after neutralization of the H2SO4 without first isolating the N-substituted glyphosate as a solid. The example suggests that molecular weight cutoffs below 1000 daltons are preferred for this application.",
        "The composition of the simulant was 1.0% NMG, 0.2% glyphosate, 2.7% NaHSO4.H2O, and 0.3% NaH2PO4.H2O in water (pH=1.4). The mixture was homogeneous at room temperature. Approximately 100 ml of the simulant was charged to a SepaST stirred membrane test cell (Osmonics Laboratory and Specialty Products Group, Livermore, Calif.). The cell held a 45 mm disk of the membrane being tested. Helium pressure was applied to the chamber holding the simulant and the permeate was collected and analyzed for NMG, glyphosate, and phosphate concentration by HPLC and for sulfate content by ion chromatography.",
        "Table 24 shows the results for two types of low molecular weight cutoff nanofiltration membranes. The first set are Nova 1k, 3k, and 5k membranes (Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, Mich.). These membranes are characterized by their manufacturer as possessing molecular weight cutoffs of 1000, 3000 and 5000 daltons, respectively. The other set are two SelRO membranes, MPF-34 and MPF-36 (LCI Corporation, Charlotte, N.C.). The manufacturer does not specify a molecular weight cutoff, but the membranes exhibit 95% and 50% rejection of sucrose (molecular weight=342), respectively. Thus, the order of molecular weight cutoff is Nova 5k>Nova 3k>Nova 1k>SelRO MPF-36>SelRO MPF-34.",
        "Table 24 shows the rejection efficiencies for NMG and glyphosate and the relative selectivity of the membrane for sulfate and phosphate with respect to NMG. A selectivity value of 1.0 means that the membrane is not selective. The SelRO membranes exhibit selectivities significantly greater than 1.0, and are therefore effective for this application.",
