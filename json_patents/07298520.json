        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to an image printing system which outputs a photographic image which was photographed with an image pickup apparatus such as digital camera, and stored in a recording media as an image datum, and input Into the printing system by reading the image datum with an equipped media reader, or by reading the out-put photograph directly with an equipped image reader such as scanner.",
        "This invention also relates to an image printing system which outputs a specified scene in the dynamic image digital data which was photographed with an image pickup apparatus such as a digital camcorder, and stored In a recording media, and input into the printing system by reading the image datum with an equipped media reader.",
        "This invention further relates to the individual service and information offer service at the time of printing service of the image data which a customer demands.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "Since the image taken by the digital camera etc. is recorded as digital data, without using a lab, it can print out by using the personal computer and printer at a home.",
        "Moreover, a relatively compact Image outputting apparatus capable of reading and outputting image digital data photographed by a digital camera or the like as well as capable of being installed at a relatively small space of a corner in a shop or on the street has been proposed (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cpost type image outputting apparatus\u201d). For example, JP-A-10-341303 discloses a post type Image outputting apparatus comprising various kinds of interfaces corresponding to a plurality of different kinds of recording media, capable of reading and outputting image digital data from the various kinds of the recording media. The post type image output apparatus provides the handiness to be operated freely by customers so that they can print out desired photograph images instantaneously and take them back with them.",
        "Further, it is well-known to change a scale and a position by carrying out digital processing of the original image, or to edit the original image to synthesize other material images, or to do so, in order to obtain the image having additional value of high quality. For example, with a personal image printing system built on another personal computer as an axis, the digital processing of a image can perform comparatively easily even in an advanced image edition. Moreover, a different type image printing system called \u201cPrint Club\u201d has been also put on the street or other places, wherein a photographed portrait can be synthesized with a frame image.",
        "However, the advantage of using the image printing system put on these streets etc. has been decreased gradually, by improvement in functional of a personal computer and a printer for home use, and thus, a development of the image printing system which can offer a more additional value to the printed article would be desired.",
        "Next, in order to print out one scene (hereinafter, it may be called \u201cdynamic-shot\u201d or a \u201cshot image\u201d may be called below) included in the dynamic image photographed with the digital camcorder, the digital camera, etc. as a still picture, a digital datum to be recorded as the desired scene for static image from the dynamic image digital data is specified, and a still image is printed out based on this static image data.",
        "Such work can be done using the personal computer and printer at a home. Alternatively, once one scene included in a dynamic image is specified by using the personal computer at a home, it is possible for the data of the specified shot image to be recorded on a recording medium, and to be brought to a processing laboratory (lab) in order to be printed as a still picture.",
        "However, in order to print a shot image from a dynamic image data using a lab, it is necessary to specify the scene of wishing to print out as a still picture from the countless scenes included in the dynamic image, and to tell the clerk of the lab about it. For that purpose, a shot Image to be printed should be specified by using a personal computer at home and the datum of shot image should be digitalized to be recorded on a recording medium in order to carry it into the lab. Alternatively, the dynamic image data on a recording medium should be carried into the lab, then the dynamic image data should be reproduced on a monitor in front of the clerk of the lab in order to point out the scene to be printed to the clerk. These are inconvenient anyway.",
        "Although the post type image outputting apparatus as described above can be operated freely by a customer, in order to print out a desired photograph image instantaneously and with ease, it does not have the function which prints out such a shot image.",
        "Furthermore, the shopping center etc. does some unique services offered to customer, such as an information service of the recommended goods by insertion of a newspaper etc., a point service wherein points are given to the customer in proportion to the customer's usage of the shopping center, and any service such as reduction in price, etc., is made according to the given points. These services are not restricted to such a shopping center, but are performed in various types of industry. For example, such service is made on the DPE print store which develops a photograph. In a DPE print store, if a customer orders a print, points will be given to him according to the fee of print. Once the points accrued by the customer attains a fixed point, the print fee will be discounted according to the fixed point. Alternatively, as the service, an enlarged photograph etc. would be given with no charge.",
        "Moreover, in recent years, by using the Internet etc., while performing advertisement of stores (shopping center etc.), a service where a coupon (discount ticket) etc. can be issued by a operation on the browsing screen is offered.",
        "However, when a customer uses the mentioned image printing apparatus, in the present condition, such additional service is not given. Thus, there is a large service gap between the case of using such image printing system and the case of using DPE print store, etc.",
        "Moreover, the printing apparatus has the advantage that it can install anywhere, even In a small space. Therefore, once the printing apparatus is installed in a shop, and it uses for performing advertisement of the shop to the customer using printing apparatus, it is expected that it can perform timely and effective advertisement.",
        "First, this invention aims to provide an printed article with a high added value by improving the edit capability of the personal image printing system which is constructed with a personal computer as an axis, or a known commercial image printing system such as the above mentioned post type image outputting apparatus.",
        "Secondly, this invention aims to provide an image printing system which prints the shot image by specifying one scene out of dynamic image contents, and optionally further processing the specified scene image, with using the post type image outputting apparatus.",
        "Thirdly, this invention aims to provide various information which are useful for the customer, upon using the printing apparatus, which would solve the service gap between the case of requesting a print in a image printing system and the case of using a DPE shop.",
        "The first aim mentioned can be attained by an image plus event information printing system according to the present invention, which comprises:",
        "an image data inputting means for inputting a datum of original image,",
        "an event information database which memorizes the data of current and/or passing events information being sorted with one or more items, wherein one of the items consists of the occurrence time of the event,",
        "an event information retrieval means for extracting any event information within a predetermined range being in correlation to the time which is related to the original image, by retrieving from the sorted data in the event information database with using one or more of the items,",
        "an image editing means for preparing a datum of an image plus event information, from the datum of original image and the extracted event information, and",
        "a printing means for printing the image plus current events information in accordance with the datum prepared by the image editing means.",
        "According to the above mentioned image plus event information printing system, the current and/or passing information which shows the famous occurrence generated at the time or near the time related to the image can be synthesized with the image, and is printed by improving the personal image printing system which is constructed with a personal computer as an axis, or the Image printing system such as the above mentioned post type image outputting apparatus, and thus the printed article with a high added value can be obtained easily.",
        "The time related to an original image may be the photographed day of the original image typically. By searching and extracting the events information which shows such as the famous occurrence generated at the same day as a photographed day or the near time of an original image, and synthesizing with an original image, those who looked at the synthesized image can grasp the photographed time of an original image intuitively from the contents of event information, or can recognize the time background at the time of original image photographed.",
        "In the image plus event information printing system according to this invention, when two or more events information are retrieved from the sorted data by the event information retrieval means, the system may has further the event information selecting means where one or more events information are selected as user's pleases from the retrieved events information in order to synthesize with an original image.",
        "When two or more events information are retrieved, one or more events information may be automatically determined as the event information to be added to the original image, by the system side according to a predetermined priority. It is preferable, however, to make the user choose favorite events information freely by using the event information selecting means, upon showing all of the events information extracted by the event information retrieval means or showing some of those in higher ranks of the predetermined priority, since the printed article of a higher added value would be obtained.",
        "The image plus event information printing system of this invention may be constructed as the stand-alone type which installs all the means in one apparatus, and may constructed with some apparatuses which bears separate means respectively so as to carry out a distributed storing and each apparatuses are connected to each other by the line.",

        "Furthermore, in this invention, distributed storing of each means can be carried out at terminal apparatuses and a server, and a client-server type system can be constructed.",
        "Namely, in this Invention, a server which delivers a material datum for image synthesis to a terminal or server capable of editing the image via line is disclosed. The delivery server comprises:",
        "an event information database which memorizes the data of current and/or passing events information being sorted with one or more items, wherein one of the items consists of the occurrence time of the event;",
        "an event information retrieval means for extracting any event information within a predetermined range being in correlation to the time which is related to the original image, by retrieving from the sorted data in the event information database with using one or more of the items, and",
        "a transmission means for transmitting the retrieved data to the terminal or server capable of editing the image.",
        "Further, in this invention, a server which is connected to a terminal via line and transmits to the terminal a datum of image which is synthesized herein is also disclosed. The transmission server comprises:",

        "Image Plus Event Information Printing System",
        "The image plus event information printing system according to this invention comprises at least following means, that is:\n\n    (1) an image data inputting means for inputting original image data,\n    (2) an event information database which memorizes the data of current and/or passing events information being sorted with one or more items, wherein one of the items consists of the occurrence time of the event,\n    (3) an event information retrieval means for extracting any event information within a predetermined range being in correlation to the time which is related to the original image, by retrieving from the sorted data in the event information database with using one or more of the items,\n    (4) an image editing means for preparing a datum of an image plus event information, from the datum of original image and the extracted event information, and\n    (5) a printing means for printing the image plus current events information in accordance with the datum prepared by the image editing means.",
        "However, the system may have other means optionally, such as a means for inputting order contents, a material database which memorizes material images other than events information, and a means for collecting a charge. Moreover, the image plus event information printing system of this invention may be constructed as the stand-alone type which stored all the means in one apparatus, or may be constructed by some apparatuses which carried out distributed storing of each means and which are connected each other by the line. Furthermore, distributed storing of each means may be carried out at terminal apparatus and a server, and a client/server type system may be constructed.",
        "In order to print the image plus event information with the image plus event information printing system of this invention, at first a image datum which recorded an original image is input in a system by the image data inputting means. Then, the event information which shows a famous current/passing event occurred at a date near to the time being related to the input original image (for examples famous event occurred at the same day with the photographed day of the original image, or within about one month before and after the photographed day) is searched and extracted from the events information database by using a event information retrieval means, and the extracted event information is synthesized with an original image by using the image editing means. Finally, the synthesized image may be printed by the printing means.",
        "The outline of this invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is an constructive embodiment of the printing system according to this invention (1A). The print system 1A comprises a terminal part 2 which can receive an order and can output a printed article, and a events information service part (events information distribution server) 3 which offers events information in response to the demand from a terminal part, and the above mentioned terminal part 2 and the above mentioned events information service part 3 are connected through a line 6. The line 6 may be an exclusive or open network line of various scales such as Internet, intranet, LAN. Alternatively, it may be a line which simply connects one main body with one backyard print part.",
        "In addition, in the illustrated printing system 1A, the terminal part 2 is constituted by the post type image outputting apparatus which is a commercial image output system, on the other hand, the events information service part 3 is constituted by the events information distribution server which an entrepreneur other than that of the post type image outputting apparatus manages, and both are connected by the Internet as a line 6.",
        "The terminal part 2 is equipped with an image data inputting means 7, an order inputting means 8, an image editing means 9, an other material databases 10, an printing means 11, and a fee collecting means 12. On the other hand, the events information service part 3 is equipped with an events information database 13, an event information retrieval means 14, an event information selecting means 15, and the fee collection means 16 of the events Information service part.",
        "In order to print the image plus event information using printing system 1A, the print mode which can print the image plus event information is first chosen by using the order inputting means 8 and the mode is started. The order contents which should be outputted may be input optionally by using the order inputting means 8. However, it is possible to set up the system so that a standardized procedure may be performed automatically after starting the printing system, without receiving no order from the user, up to the final step where the image plus event information is printed. Thus, the order inputting means is not essential to the system of this invention.",
        "several alternatives for order contents may be beforehand prepared by the image printing system side in order that the customer can decide his order content with ease by selecting freely from the alternatives. It is desirable to show the customer the alternatives for order contents which can be chosen on a display means (not shown), and to guide input operation of order contents. As the display means, a CRT, a liquid crystal display or the like, are used commonly, but it can be a simpler device. For example, when applying the printing system of this invention to the post type image outputting apparatus mentioned above, it is possible to stand a bulletin board which itemized the operation method by the side of the terminal part. In addition thereto, a substitute display device such as various kinds of screen panels, plasma displays or the like, can be used as well. As the order contents, for example, the selection In case there are two or more print modes the selection of specifying which frame image should be used in case two or more image data for plural frames are input, specification of the time (image related time) relevant to an original image, designation of a retrieval item which should be directed for a event information retrieval means in addition to the image related time, directions of the contents of edit Including the synthesis with the event information and other material image, expansion or reduction of the image, etc. designation of print number of sheets, the determination of size, etc. may be exemplified.",
        "As the order content inputting device 8, for example, various kinds of pointers such as a touch panel provided integrally with a display device such as a CRT, and a liquid crystal panel, a keyboard, a mouse, and a track ball, can be used. Moreover, the DPOF function (digital print order format) provided in a digital camera can be used as well.",
        "Next, an image datum 17 which recorded the original image is input by using the image data inputting means 7. The image data to be inputted are mainly a photograph image taken by a digital camera or the like, and recorded in a recording medium as digital data, but it is not limited thereto. For example, a computer graphic image produced by a personal computer, digital image data of a synthesized image produced by the editing process of a photography by a personal computer, or any articles which have already printed out, such as those of photograph image, synthesized image, computer graphic image, a handwritten illustration or the like, can be used as well.",
        "As the image data inputting means 7, for example, reading machines corresponding to each recording medium, such as a compact flash memory (CF), a smart medium, a compact disc (CD), a magneto-optic disc (MO), a flexible disc (FD), and a PC card, a connector to be connected with a digital camera, capable of reading image data from a memory of the digital camera, can be used As the image data inputting means 7, a reading device such as a scanner for reading an image from a hard copy, a film, or another printed article so as to convert the same to digital data, can be used as well. By including an image reading device capable of directly scanning an image together with a recording medium reading device in the Image data inputting means 7, even in case the digital image data are not provided, the image printing apparatus according to the present invention can be utilized. For example, in case the negative film is lost, additional prints can be provided easily from the printed photograph. Furthermore, a communication apparatus which can receive an original image from an external server may be used as an image data inputting means 7. It is preferable to include a plurality of reading devices of different kinds in the image data inputting means 7 in order to improve the applicability of the image printing apparatus of the present invention.",
        "Next, the events information which shows the occurrence generated at a time near to the time relevant to the input original Image is searched and extracted from the data of the events information memorized in the events information database 13 by using the event information retrieval means 14.",
        "In the events information database 13, for example, the events information data which specify socially famous occurrences are accumulated. The \u201csocially famous occurrence\u201d would refer to the occurrence which is expected to be remembered and recognized with the exact or about occurrence time thereof by many members in a society, or refer to the occurrence which comes to be a common knowledge in the society, wherein the society may be that organized in a predetermined area, for example, an administrative district region of a prefecture level such as Tokyo, a larger region level such as Kanto, a nation level such as Japan, or worldwide level. The socially famous occurrence may include a historical incident, a large calamity, a topic about a famous entertainer, etc. Event information denotes an information capable of identifying the content of event, such as a socially famous occurrence, on a printed matter, and it can be constituted by words, text, photograph, or picture which each indicate the event, singly or in arbitrary combination thereof. Moreover, since any pattern like a bar code which can reproduce a sound when it Is read with a certain reader, it can be used as event information and thus the contents of a socially famous occurrence can be attached on a printed matter as this pattern and it can be identified with a sound. As a concrete example, the event information may comprise a combination of some brief words which show the socially famous occurrence, a description for the date of the occurrence, and a thumb nail image which indicates one scene of the occurrence.",
        "In the events information database 13, the data of the events information which specify events, such as the socially famous occurrences are sorted or classified by the generating time of occurrence, and preferably, they are pluralistically sorted or classified by two or more items containing the generating time of an occurrence, and memorized. Therefore, an event information 18 regarding the famous occurrence which was generated at the time near the time relevant to the input original image (image related time) can be searched and extracted from the data In the events information database by using the event generating time as the search item at the event information retrieval means 14. Moreover, a priority may be assigned to each events Information accumulated in a database so that the search result can display the events information extracted in preferential order from when many events information are extracted by the search.",
        "The time which is related to the original image is typically the photographed day of the original image. By searching and extracting the events information which shows the famous occurrence generated at the same day as or the near time of the photographed day of original image, and synthesizing the extracted event information with the original image, those who looked at the synthesized image can grasp the photographed time of an original image intuitively from the contents of events information, or can recognize the time background at the time of original image photographed. However, the image related time is not limited to a photographed day. That is, those who perform image edit using this system can choose a certain time related to the original image arbitrarily, and can specify as the image related time. The image related time may be input into the event information retrieval means 14 by using the order inputting means (numeral 21), or may read automatically the data of the photographed day which is recorded along with image data, and transmitted to the event information retrieval means 14 (numeral 22).",
        "In the event information retrieval means 14, a proper time range is set up on the basis of the image related time for searching, and events information for events each of which occurrence time belongs within the time range are extracted. The time range may be set as a proper time range which includes some future from the image related time, and/or some bygone days from the image related time. Alternatively, it may be set to a predetermined period wherein the image related time belongs in arbitrary time units on a calendar(for example, year, month, or day). In accordance with the former method, for example, the events information which indicates the events generated less than 3 months before the image related time, or the events generated within six months each before or after image related time may be searched. In accordance with the latter method, the events information which indicates events generated in the same A.D. annual as the image related time belonging year may be searched Since the events information after the image related time would be not amply accumulated in the system of this invention when using the system at a time relatively close to the image related time, it is desirable to set up and search the range of a proper period before the image related time. On the other hand, when using the printing system of this invention after passing to some extent from image related time, it is desirable to set up and search the range of a relatively extended period before and after the image related time, or the range of the same year or the same month that the image related time belongs.",
        "As far as it is convenient on the operation of this printing system, arbitrary units can be adopted as the time unit for sorting the events by the occurrence time in the events information database 13, as the time unit for specifying the image related time, and as the time unit for setting a searching time range in correlation with the image related time, and the respective time units may be set independently by using separate units. Usually, the occurrence time and the image related time are specified per day unit, and the searching time is set and fixed to one of a day unit, a month unit, and a year unit, or set so that the customer can select one of these unit arbitrarily. For example, then image related time is specified with Mar. 3, 1999, the event information whose generating day is on March 3 can be hit even then using any of year unit (1999), month unit (March, 1999), day unit (Mar. 3, 1999). The event information whose generating day is on March 10 can not be hit when using the day unit, while can be hit with the month unit and with the year unit The event information whose generating day is on May 3 can be hit only with the year unit.",
        "In the events information database 13, when other classification items is adopted in addition to the occurrence time of the event, and events information are pluralistically classified or sorted with these items, events information can be pluralistically searched using two or more searching items corresponding to the classification items. Therefore, the event information whose occurrence time corresponds at image related time can be searched in each genre or categories. For example, even if the image related time to be used is the same, it is possible to extract only the event information in the entertainments category, or alternatively, only event information in the international political field. Further, it is possible to extract any events information regardless the genre, in spite of being classified pluralistically. Namely, searching with non genre can be performed in expectation of a result that two or more events information over a different field would be extracted.",
        "When there are much hit number of events in searching, according to the priority assigned to events information individually in advance or according to the predetermined method for deciding priority of the extracted events information, one or several event information may be selected for image synthesis. Moreover, in order to cope with the case that there are much hit number of events in searching, an event information selecting means 15 can be provided to the system. When two or more events information is hit by the event information retrieval means 14, the all of hit events information are displayed on the display means (not shown) or only several of hit events information are displayed by a selection according to the priority assigned to events information individually in advance or according to the predetermined method for deciding priority of the retrieved events information. The customer can choose freely 1 or two or more events information that he wishes to synthesize with his original image, from the displayed events information by using the event information selecting means 15.",
        "It is desirable to make the customer recognize the event information 18 which is extracted from the events information database 13 by the retrieval means 14, and further optionally chosen by the event information selecting means 15, by displaying the events information 18 on the display means (not shown), and it is more desirable to obtain the customer's confirmation of using the events information extracted or chosen to the image synthesis.",
        "The events information database 13 can be built in memory storage, such as a hard disk in a computer. Moreover, the event information retrieval means 14 and the event information selecting means 15 are realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory device and a hard disk, with the computer.",
        "The event information 18 which is extracted by the event information retrieval means 14, and optionally further chosen by the event information selecting means 15 is transmitted to the image editing means 9 (numeral 23), and is synthesized with the original image. In the illustrated printing system 1A, the image editing means 9 can perform various edits, such as synthesis with material images other than the event information such as a frame, expansion and reduction of image, besides addition of events information.

        "In order to print a desired shot image using the dynamic image shot printing system 102 of this invention, first, image data 120, i.e., the dynamic image data, which recorded the dynamic image is input into the dynamic image shot printing system 102 by using the image data inputting means 126 Usually, by inputting the order contents relevant to this printing system 102 from the order inputting means 113, the image data inputting means 126 is operated and the dynamic image data is input. However, when the recording medium 127 which recorded the dynamic image data is inserted in the reader of this printing system 102, it is possible to set up so that the image data inputting means 126 may operate automatically to start the reading of a dynamic image data.",
        "Although the dynamic image data to be input is the dynamic image which is mainly took with the digital camcorder or the digital camera, and is recorded on a certain recording media as a digital datum, but it is not limited to thereto. For example, it may be the dynamic image of the computer graphics created with the personal computer, and when this printing system is equipped with image pick-up apparatus, such as a CCD camera, as an image data inputting means, the dynamic image datum may be a motion or performance which are actually performed in front of this printing system.",
        "As the image data inputting means 126, for example, reading machines corresponding to each recording medium, such as a compact flash memory (CF), a smart medium, a compact disc (CD), a magneto-optic disc (MO), a flexible disc (FD), and a PC card, a connector to be connected with a digital camcorder, capable of reading dynamic image data from a memory of the digital camcorder, can be used. As the image data inputting means 110, an image pick-up apparatuses, such as a CCD camera which can photograph a motion or performance which are actually performed in front of this printing system and can convert it into a digital datum may be used. The enjoyableness of this printing system may increase when including the image pick-up apparatus which can photograph a dynamic image in addition to the reading apparatus of recording media in the image data inputting means 126. It is preferable to include a plurality of reading devices of different kinds in the image data inputting means 126 in order to improve the applicability of the dynamic shot printing apparatus of the present invention. Moreover, the image data inputting means 126 may be equipped with the function of both a dynamic image data inputting means and a static image data inputting means. That is, an image data inputting means enables not only to receive the input of a dynamic image, but also to receive the input of a static image such as the photograph image photographed by a digital camera, an illustration created by computer graphics, and to process them like the static image data specified from the dynamic image in the subsequent process, and may enable it to create a printed article.",
        "The order contents about the image to be output are input into this printing system 102 by using the order inputting means 113. The alternatives of order contents are prepared in advance at the printing system side, the customer can choose freely any order from the prepared items. It is desirable to show a customer the order contents which can be chosen on a display means (not shown), and to guide input operation of order contents. As a display means, although CRT, a liquid crystal panel, etc. are used commonly, it may be simpler one like the bulletin board which itemized the operation method.",
        "In the alternatives of order contents, for example, those of specifying the image to be output, such as an option for which scene in a dynamic image to be printed, an option for which the specified scene (static image) should be printed as it is or should be further processed, or an option for how the static image should be processed, and those of appertained to the image datum when shot image is printed, such as decisions of the print number of sheets, print size, or using or not using a particular print like a pre-cut seal, etc., may be included.",

For example, since the indication about the printing the read image as it is, or after processing, and the indication about the particular printing such as pre-cut seal, etc., would belong to the alternatives in the main menu, they would be input at the time of starting of this printing system operation. The determination of which scene in a dynamic image to print would be input after reading a dynamic image data into this printing system. The direction of how to process the specified static image data would be input after specifying static image data. Further, the setting of print number of sheet would be input after processing of static image data and the image datum to be output is produced or after the static image datum itself is recognized as the datum to be output Therefore, the order inputting means 113 is performed at any time if needed in the operation process of this printing system.",
        "As the order content inputting device 113, for example, various kinds of pointers such as a touch panel provided integrally with a display device such as a CRT, and a liquid crystal panel, a keyboard, a mouse, and a track ball, can be used. Moreover, the DPOF function (digital print order format) provided in a digital camera can be used as well.",

The static image data specifying means 112 is operated by inputting any required directions from the order inputting means 113. The static image data specifying means 112 is equipped with the dynamic image viewing means 128 for reproducing a dynamic image normally to display the contents on a dynamic image display part (not shown), and the static image selection means 129 which can choose any desirable scene arbitrarily while checking the contents of a dynamic image with the dynamic image viewing means 128. In addition, when there is no reference especially in this description and claims, reproduction of a dynamic image should be understood as a concept also including reverse reproduction (reproduction with rewinding).",
        "The dynamic image viewing means 128 may be provided with a playback speed control means 128a which can change playback speed into a slow motion or frame-by-frame advance to arbitrary timing during reproduction of a dynamic image. A best shot can be easily chosen by reducing the playback speed of a dynamic image by the playback speed control means when the dynamic image reaches a little before the best shot, and pushing the selection button as a static image selection means 129 when the image of a best shot is displayed on a dynamic image display part. It is further desirable that the playback speed control means further has a fast-forward and/or fast-rewind functions since the reproduction time of an unnecessary portion can be omitted or shortened.",
        "Moreover, the dynamic image viewing means 128 may be provided with a photographic playback producing means 128b which can change the dynamic image under reproduction into photographic playback at a choice timing. When the button as photographic playback producing means 128b is pushed at the arbitrary times while reproducing the dynamic image, the dynamic image stops at the time when the button is pushed, and a photographic playback is displayed by package at the dynamic image display part (not shown). The photographic playback includes a series of picture frames within a predetermined time range or of a predetermined number of frames which starting point, middle point, or end point is based on the time when the button is pushed. Each picture frame of the photographic playback displayed at the dynamic image display part serves as a touch panel, and after the customer touches and specifies a position to be desired, by pushing the button as a static image selection means 129, a best shot can be chosen easily.",
        "Moreover, the dynamic image viewing means 128 may be provided with an pausing means 128c which can stop the dynamic image under reproduction to arbitrary timing. If the button as pausing means 128c was pushed when a best shot was displayed on the dynamic image display part(not shown), a dynamic image stops at the time when the button is pushed, and a best shot is fixed. Thus, a best shot can be easily chosen by pushing the selection button as a static image selection means 129 in the state.",
        "Static image data can be more easily chosen now by combining any two or all of playback speed control means 128a, photographic playback producing means 128b, and the pausing means 128c. The case where playback speed control means 128a and pausing means 128c are combined is especially preferable, since a best shot can be particularly easily chosen by reducing the playback speed of a dynamic image by the playback speed control means 128a when the dynamic image reaches a little before the best shot, and then the best shot was hold by pushing the pausing means 128c so as to pause the replay of a dynamic image, and the hold best shot is fixed by pushing the selection button as a static image selection means 129.",
        "In addition, when the timing which operates the static image selection means 129 shifts, it is possible to redo any number of times and the static image data of a best shot is able to be chosen until it canceled the static image data chosen accidentally and went satisfactorily, it can specify as static image data which should be delivered to a output content designation data producing means to mentioned below. In this case, after rewinding a dynamic image to a suitable scene, the same operation as the above may be repeated, or reverse reproduction, an reverse slow motion, or frame-by-frame back is performed, and a best shot may be displayed, optionally by making it stop by the pausing means, and it can be chosen.",
        "As for the static image data specifying means 112, it is desirable to have further the static image data accumulation means 130 which can accumulate two or more static image data When the static image data specifying means 112 is equipped with the static image data accumulation means 130, the candidate of the static image to be output as the shot image, or used as its material can be chosen one after another, it accumulates temporarily, and after that, each candidate Is fully compared and, finally the most desirable static image datum can be specified. Moreover, the package print of the shot image of two or more scenes can also be carried out in one procedure by accumulating two or more static image data in the static image data accumulation means 130, and processing whole accumulated data in parallel at the editing means and the printing means mentioned below. Moreover, it can arrange on one screen all static image data accumulated in the static image data accumulation means 130, then the preview image are edited, and the edited preview image can be printed by the printing means.",
        "It is desirable to prepare preview display means 130b which displays the image of the accumulated static image data on the static image data accumulation means 130, and to enable it to check an accumulation situation easily.",
        "Usually, the static image data accumulation means 130 accumulates two or more static image data with attaching accumulation ranking which is given according to the ascending order of the specific time of static image data It becomes easy to access each accumulated static image data by attaching accumulation ranking according to the specific time of static image data. Moreover, while reproducing a dynamic image, when two or more static image is specified one after another and are accumulated in order according to the ascending order of the specific time of the static image, each scene in a dynamic image comes to arrange along time series. Thus, it is possible to prepare a playback photography by arranging the static images in order of accumulation.",
        "The static image data accumulation means 130 may be provided with an accumulation adjustment means 130a which can delete some or all of static image data or change the accumulation ranking. By establishing such an accumulation adjustment means, substitution of the accumulated static image data becomes easy. Particularly, since only a static image with a bad relation condition with the scene of order can be easily substituted when editing the preview image of playback photography, it is far efficient rather than it redoes the selection work of static image data from the start. Furthermore, according to the accumulation adjustment means, since it is possible to arrange each static image in an order which is not related to a motion of an actual dynamic image, it is possible to produce a preview image which has an unique characteristic distinct from the playback photograph of dynamic image wherein each scene is arranged along the time series.",
        "It is desirable to add to the accumulation adjustment means 130a a function which can give arbitrary accumulation ranking when choosing new static image data. When accumulation adjustment means 130a has such a function, the newly chosen static image data can be directly inserted in arbitrary accumulation ranking in a relation with 1 or more static image data which have already been accumulated.",
        "The static image data specifying means 112 containing the dynamic image viewing means 128, the static image selection means 129, and static image data accumulation means 130 are realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, with the computer.",
        "If required order contents are input into this printing system 102 by the order inputting means 113 while 1 or more static image data 121 are specified by the static image data specifying means 112, the output content designation data producing means 114 will be performed. Consequently, based on some of static image data 121 and order contents 122, the output content designation data 123 which comprises the image data 124 to be output and the data 125 which recorded the other appendix conditions would generate.",
        "Here, as the additional new order content which are input in order to generate the output content designation data, there are the concrete contents of edit for processing print number of sheets and static image data, for example. The directions about the trimming of a image, expansion/reduction, synthesis with the material of a frame or others, the whole layout, etc. are included in the contents of edit. The appendix conditions 125 which accompany the image data to be output are contents which is necessary for directing with image data to a printing means so that a printed article is outputted as order, and for example, items, such as a kind of print number of sheets, size, and paper, are included.",
        "The static image data 121 and the order contents 122 transmitted to the output content designation data producing means 114, when the directions which should process a static image are included in order contents, are delivered to the editing means 131 with which the output content designation data producing means 114 was equipped, and edition is performed, and the image data 124 recorded in the image to be output generates. When the directions which should print the static image recorded on the static image data specified as order contents by the above mentioned static image data specifying means 112 as it is are included, the static image data 121 itself is recognized as image data 124 which records the image to be output at the output content designation data producing means 114. Moreover, some order contents are recognized as conditions 125 which accompany the image data 124 to be output.",
        "The editing means 131 is realizable by executing the program stored in memory storage, such as a memory and a hard disk, by computer. Moreover, the materials, such as a frame design which is synthesized with the a static image in edition, can accumulate in a material database which can construct in memory storage, such as a hard disk of a computer.

        "Next, a charge is determined according to the set up situation. A charge is changed by the existence of point addition service. (\u201cPoint addition service\u201d is a form which adds the number of points according to a customer's use situation, and offers various services with the number of points.) The customer chooses existence of point addition, when a setup of the form of printing, number of sheets, etc. is completed (Step S610). When performing point addition, the card numbers (ID number, password, etc.) of a point card are input (Step S611). By inquiring the card number to the customer information data stored in the database, the customer is specified and to the specified customer information data points is added (Step S612), and it stores in a database (Step S613). When not performing point addition, reduction operation of point service is performed according to the situation used this time (Step S614), and discount etc. is served.",
        "Here, the service correspondence table having shown the service outline is shown in Table 1. The data of Table 1 is beforehand stored in the memory part (hard disk) of printing apparatus, and reads and processes the information which corresponds in case the number of points is added, or in case the charge concerning printing is computed.",
        "TABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSERVICE CORRESPONDENCE TABLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint\nDiscount\n\n\n\nPrint Mode\n(Point)\n(yen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Photo Print\n1\n\u20025\n\n\n\nSeal Print\n4\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(per 1 print)",
        "If a printing form is a digital photograph print as shown in Table 1, when performing point addition per print, the number of points is added 1 point, and when not performing point addition, discount of 5 yen is performed. On the other hand, if a printing form is a seal print, when performing point addition per print, the number of points is added 4 point, and when not performing point addition, discount of 20 yen is performed. For example, when a customer performs a setup which prints 4 digital photograph print and 4 seal prints at a time, and it performs point addition, since seal prints is added 16 point, a digital photograph print is added 4 point and a total of 20 points. On the other hand, when not performing point addition, since 80 yen is discounted for the seal print and 20 yen for digital photograph print, a total of 100 yen is discounted from the normal charge.",
        "Next, fee collection processing is performed (Step S615). Fee collection processing computes normal charge by setup of a printing form, number of sheets, etc. which the above mentioned customer set up. Then, when there is service of discount etc., the charge to be indicated is calculated by deducting discount money from the normal charge. Once a charge is computed, the print data of the charge will be created and it will display on monitor 215a with touch panel as a display part 215. A customer peruses the monitor 215a, and checks a charge. A customer injects the displayed charge from the predetermined entrance slot after a check.",
