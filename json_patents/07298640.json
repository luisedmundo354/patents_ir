        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The principles of the present invention are generally related to resistive memory arrays, and in particular, but not by way of limitation, to a device and method for configuring a resistive memory array, writing and reading from the resistive memory array, and producing the resistive memory array.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Resistive memory materials have recently been used to produce non-volatile memory cells. Data is stored in the memory cells by changing resistance of the resistive memory materials. Resistive memory materials may include colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) material, high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) materials, or other materials that have a perovskite structure capable of having electrical resistance characteristics altered by external influences. Such external influences may include applying positive and negative or reverse polarity voltages to the resistive memory materials to change the resistance characteristics thereof. The electric field strength or electric current density from one or more pulses is generally sufficient to switch the physical state of the resistive memory materials so as to modify the resistive properties. Alternatively, a pulse with the same polarity, but with different pulse widths, may be utilized to reverse the resistive property of the resistive memory materials previously set. Whichever technique is selected, in applying a pulse to the resistive memory materials, the pulse is to be low enough in energy so as not to destroy or damage the resistive material.",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic of a resistive memory array 100 provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,833 to Hsu et al. The memory array 100 utilizes a 1-transistor, 1-resistor (1T1R) memory cell configuration and includes sixteen memory cells 102 composed of a resistive memory element in series with a transistor. The memory array 100 includes columns of bit lines BL1-BL4 and rows of word lines WL1-WL4. In addition, a common line CL extends between bit line pairs BL1-BL2 and BL3-BL4 is shared by every two bits (i.e., memory cells) connected between the bit line pairs BL1-BL2 and BL3-BL4. While the memory array 100 is reduced in size by having two bits share a common line CL, the consequence is that the memory array 100 is not a random access memory. Instead, all of the memory cells 102 must be erased before a write operation. By having to erase all of the memory cells, the use of such a resistive memory array 100 is slow and is inefficient.",

        "FIG. 2 is a schematic of an exemplary resistive memory array 200 according to the principles of the present invention. The memory array 200 is composed of memory cells 202 that include a resistive memory element R11 connected in parallel with a switch M11. In one embodiment, the switch M11 may be MOS transistor. Alternatively, other types of transistors may be utilized. The resistive memory element R11 may be formed of CMR, HTSC, or other resistive materials capable of having resistive characteristics altered by an external influence.",
        "The memory array 200 may be configured by forming series or chains of memory cells 202. As shown, the chains of memory cells 202 may be connected along bit lines BL1-BL4. Word lines WL1-WL4 may be connected to memory cells 202 via gate terminals of the switches along respective memory cells 202. Each bit line may have a select switch MB1-MB4 and sense switch MS1-MS4 connected thereto used to control access to memory cells 202 along the corresponding bit lines BL1-BL4. For example, to access a memory cell 202 having switch M11, select switch MB1 and control switch MS1 are selectably turned on. Below control switch MS1 may be a sense amplifier (see, FIG. 9) that is used for reading data stored in the memory cells along the bit lines as understood in the art.",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic of the resistive memory array 200 of FIG. 2 illustrating an exemplary technique for writing a logic high level into a memory cell 302. In one embodiment, if a positive pulse is applied to the resistive element R22, the resistance increases. If a negative pulse or reverse polarity pulse is applied to the resistive element R22, the resistance decreases. The low resistance (LR) may be as low as 100 ohm to 10 k-ohm, and the high resistance (HR) may range from 50 k-ohm to 10 mega-ohm. The amount of change depends on the resistive material, deposition condition, film thickness and area. Another technique for changing the resistance of the resistive element R22 is to change the pulse amplitude and pulse width of a pulse being applied to the memory cell 302. For example, a 5 volt (5V) and 10 nanosecond (10 ns) pulse may be applied to the resistive element R22 to increase the resistance and a 3V and 4 microsecond (\u03bcs) pulse may be applied to the resistive element R22 to decrease the resistance. However, utilizing positive and reverse polarity pulses are generally a faster techniques for changing the resistance of a resistive element between a high and low logic level.",
        "As previously described, the switches at the top and bottom of the bit lines BL1-BL4 are row/column select switches MB1-MB4 and sense switches MS1-MS4. The select switches MB1-MB4 and sense switches MS1-MS4 are used to select a certain bit and to separate the memory array 200 from external circuitry. For example, if memory cell 302 is to be selected, select switch MB2 and sense switch MS2 are turned on and the other select and sense switches are turned off. In addition, word line WL2 is grounded and each of the other word lines WL1, WL3-WL4 are turned high. By applying a low voltage onto word line WL2, switch M22 remains or is turned off so that current is forced through resistive element R22 connected in parallel to the switch M22. Because word lines WL1, WL3 and WL4 are high, each of the corresponding switches M12, M32, and M42, respectively, are turned on such that current flows through the switches and bypasses each of the resistive elements R12, R32, and R42, respectively connected in parallel. The process of being able to select one memory cell along a bit line enables random access writing and reading. While not writing to or reading from the memory array 200, select switches MB1-MB4 and sense switches MS1-MS4 may be turned off so that the memory array 200 is isolated from the external circuitry, thereby keeping electrical noise from the memory array 200. It should be understood that the memory array 200 is shown as a 4\u00d74 chain array, and may be sized and dimensioned as desired, such as 128\u00d7128 or larger.",
        "FIG. 4 is a timing diagram showing an exemplary technique for writing a logic high into a memory cell 302 in the memory array 200 of FIG. 3. In writing a high value to memory cell 302, select switch MB2 and sense switch MS2 are turned on at time t1 while other select switches MB1, MB3 and MB4 and sense switches MS1, MS3, and MS4 are turned off. At time t2, word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are switched high while word line WL2 is maintained at a low voltage level so that memory switches M12, M32, and M42 are turned on and memory switch M22 is maintained off to cause current to flow through memory switches M12, M32 and M42, rather than the parallel resistive elements R12, R32, and R42, respectively. Accordingly, the current flows through resistive element R22 to enable data to be written into memory cell 302 via a pulse on bit line BL2. At time t3, a positive pulse on bit line BL2 is applied to increase resistance of resistive element R22. In one embodiment, the positive pulse may be 5V in amplitude and 10 ns in duration. At time t4, the pulse on bit line BL2 transitions low. At t5, word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are transitioned low. Select switch MB2 and sense switch MS2 are transitioned low at t6. At this point, the write cycle is complete and a high logic level is stored in the memory cell 302 by causing the resistive element R22 to have a high resistance value. It should be understood that the timing diagram in FIG. 4 is exemplary and that alternative timing may be utilized to write a high logic value to the memory cell 302.",
        "FIG. 5 is a schematic of the memory array of FIG. 2 illustrating an exemplary technique for writing a logic low value or \u201c0\u201d into a memory cell. To write a \u201c0\u201d into memory cell 302, a similar operation is performed as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 with the exception that a pulse in the opposite polarity is applied to the memory cell 302. This causes the opposite effect as that of writing a \u201c1\u201d into the memory cell 302 described with respect to FIGS. 3 and 4 and causes resistance of the resistive element R22 to be lowered. It should be understood that the high and low resistance values of the resistive element R22 are relative and are used to enable a sense amplifier to sense a difference in current flow to determine whether a high or low logic level is stored in the memory cell.",
        "FIG. 6 is a timing diagram showing an exemplary technique for writing a logic low into the memory cell 302 in the memory array 200 of FIG. 5. The timing shown in FIG. 6 is slightly different from that shown in FIG. 4 to show that there may be several embodiments for writing data into a resistive memory cell according to the principles of the present invention. As shown, the word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are driven high at time t1 to cause the current to flow through switches M12, M32 and M42, respectively. Word line WL2 remains low to cause current to flow through resistive element R22, which is being altered in resistance to write a \u201c0\u201d therein. At time t2, select switch MB2 and sense switch MS2 are driven high. Between times t3-t4, bit line BL2 is grounded and sense line SL2 is pulsed, which causes resistive element R22 to transition from a high to a low resistance level. In one embodiment, the pulse may be 5V in amplitude and 10 ns in duration. At time t5, the select and sense switches MB2 and MS2 are transitioned low and word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are transitioned low at time t6, thereby ending the write cycle to store a low logic level in the memory cell 302.",
        "FIG. 7 is a schematic of the memory array 200 of FIG. 2 illustrating an exemplary technique for reading from a memory cell. In reading a memory cell 302, the memory cell 302 is selected in the same manner as used in the write operation, but the voltage on bit line BL2 is low enough not to change the resistance of the resistive element R22. In one embodiment, the voltage applied to bit line BL2 is 0.5 volts. The sense line SL2 is connected to a sense amplifier (not shown), as understood in the art. Depending on the resistance of the resistive element R22 set by the write operation, the sense amplifier senses a different current and/or voltage to determine whether a high or low logic level (i.e., data value) was stored in the memory cell 302.",
        "FIG. 8 is a timing diagram showing an exemplary technique for reading from a memory cell of the memory array of FIG. 2. At time t1 word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are switched high to turn on switches M12, M32, and M42, respectively. Word line WL2 remains low to access the memory cell 302. At time t2, selection switch MB2 and sense switch MS2 are turned on. During times t3 and t4, a low voltage pulse is applied to bit line BL2 to cause a current to flow through the resistive element R22. The current flowing through the resistive element R22 flows to the sense line SL2, which is connected to a sense amplifier. The sense amplifier is able to measure current and/or voltage, which is a function of a voltage drop across the resistive element R22 set or stored during a writing operation. At time t5, the select and sense switches MB2 and MS2 are turned off. The word lines WL1, WL3, and WL4 are turned off at time t6, which ends the reading process. It should be understood that the timing shown in the timing diagram 800 may be different from that shown and still provide the same or equivalent functionality in accordance with the principles of the present invention.",
