    "description": [
        "The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit packaging, and more particularly to an integrated circuit package system including die stacking.",
        "Integrated circuits are what power many of today's consumer electronics, for instance, cellphones, video cameras, portable music players, computers, etc. Integrated circuits are employed in a multitude of environments, and consequently their packaging must protect them from various environmental conditions of contamination, such as, moisture, temperature, mechanical vibration, and even physical abuse.",
        "As customer demand improves integrated circuit (IC) performance, faster, more reliable, and higher-density circuits, need to be produced. Various techniques, such as, flip chip, gall grid array (BGA), chip on board (COB), and multi-chip modules (MCM), have been developed to meet the continued demands for improving system performance and hardware capabilities, while the space in which to provide these improved hardware capabilities continues to decrease.",
        "MCM may include two or more chips stacked one on top of another (i.e.\u2014vertically stacked). This mounting technique permits a higher density of chips or integrated circuits on the MCM substrate. The substrate may include one or more layers of electrically conductive material separated by dielectric materials.",
        "Although vertically stacked MCM's may increase the effective density of chips, over that of horizontally placed MCM components, it has the disadvantage in that the MCM's must usually be assembled before the component chips and chip connections can be tested. These extra manufacturing steps can lead to increased cost and decreased product yield if the chips are defective.",
        "Another common problem associated with vertically stacked MCM's is that the bottom chip must be larger than the top chip to accommodate the plurality of bond pads located on the bottom chip. Due to the constraint of limited space available for mounting individual chips on a substrate, the larger configuration of the bottom chip decreases the number of chips per semiconductor wafer, and correspondingly, increases the cost of manufacturing.",
        "Another problem of vertically stacked MCM's is the lack of sufficient electrical interconnections and signal routing possibilities between the chips themselves, and between the chips and the input/output terminals of the package. Consequently vertically stacked MCM's in a leadframe package format have typically been limited to a simple fan-out interconnection of the chips to the leads, with very limited chip-to-chip interconnection and signal routing capability.",
        "Thus, despite recent developments in semiconductor packaging techniques, a need still remains for improved packaging methods of fabrication to increase semiconductor chip densities while efficiently using wafer space. In view of the ever-increasing need to save costs and improve efficiencies, it is more and more critical that answers be found to these problems.",
        "Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.",
        "The present invention provides an integrated circuit package system including a leadframe with an aperture formed therein. An integrated circuit package is mounted to the leadframe over or under the aperture and a die is mounted within the aperture to the integrated circuit package.",
        "Certain embodiments of the invention have other advantages in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.",

        "What follows is a brief description of a generalized process flow overview for the manufacturing of an integrated circuit package system including a stacked die.",
        "The process flow begins with loading a leadframe into an apparatus for processing. The apparatus manipulates the leadframe by forming an aperture in a portion of the leadframe. A package is then mounted to the leadframe. The package may be a known good die package and may be mounted to cover the exposed aperture. The package is then adhered to the leadframe by a reflow process.",
        "After adhering the package to the leadframe, an epoxy is dispensed on an exposed portion of the package. The exposed portion of the package may occur within the aperture and may include a substrate. A die is then attached to the epoxy on the package. The epoxy securing the die is then cured.",
        "After securing the die to the package, the die is interconnected to the leadframe by wire bonding. The leadframe, the package, the die and the wire bonds are then encapsulated by a molding compound, thereby increasing the durability and improving the reliability of the device operation. After encapsulation, a post-mold-cure (PMC) is then performed. The structure thus formed is then trimmed and formed for its intended purpose.",
        "The manufacturing process for fabricating an integrated circuit package system including a stacked die can be further described by FIGS. 1-8, which depict an exemplary manufacturing sequence for a generalized package assembly flow for the production of an integrated circuit package system 100. As will be described further hereinbelow, the present invention provides for chip stacking on an integrated circuit package. The chip and the integrated circuit package may include active components, passive components, surface mount components, stacked components, and so forth, in numerous configurations and arrangements as may be needed.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1, therein is shown a sectional view of a leadframe 102 of the integrated circuit package system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The leadframe 102 may be a dual row leadframe, for example, and includes electrical contacts 104 on the top and bottom. The electrical contacts 104 may be pre-plated with, but not limited to, an alloy of nickel (Ni) and palladium (Pd). The outer leads of the leadframe 102 may be pre-plated with, but not limited to, an alloy of lead (Pb), tin (Sn), gold (Ag) and copper (Cu). The outer leads are typically formed integrally with the inner leads and extend from the package body for establishing an external electrical connection. The leadframe 102 can be made from a conducting material such as copper.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 1 after aperture formation. FIG. 2 depicts the formation of an aperture 200 within a central portion of the leadframe 102. By way of example, the aperture 200 may be formed by punching, milling or chemical etching.",
        "The aperture 200 is formed such that subsequently mounted or stacked integrated circuit components, such as an integrated circuit package 300 (not shown) or a die 500 (not shown), may pass through the aperture 200. By allowing the subsequently mounted or stacked integrated circuit components to pass through the aperture 200, the overall dimensions of the integrated circuit package system 100 may be reduced by utilizing the thickness of the leadframe 102.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 2 after integrated circuit package attachment. FIG. 3 depicts the attachment of an integrated circuit package 300, such as a known good package, to the leadframe 102. For example, the integrated circuit package 300 may be electrically connected to the leadframe 102 by a solder paste and reflow method. The integrated circuit package 300 may include, by way of example and not by way of limitation, quad-flat non-leaded packages, wire bond packages, dual-side memory packages, internal stacking module packages, flip-chip packages, or stacked die packages incorporating a mix of various devices such as flip chips and wire bondable chips. In accordance with the invention, the integrated circuit package 300 may further include various modular packages or application-specific-integrated-circuit (ASIC) packages of various sizes and dimensions that are well known within the art.",
        "It is to be understood that the integrated circuit package 300 of the present invention covers a wide range of package configurations and the type of package configuration employed is only limited by the ability to secure the package to the leadframe 102. Consequently, the invention includes any package configuration that may be adhered to the leadframe 102. Furthermore, in accordance with the scope of this invention, it is to be understood that the integrated circuit package 300 may include multiple integrated circuits or additional packages stacked thereover.",
        "Notably, the integrated circuit package 300 may also be individually tested in advance of assembly into the integrated circuit package system 100 to assure that the integrated circuit package 300 is properly formed and contains good die. The integrated circuit package 300 is thus proven as a known good package, and thereby improves the assembly process yield performance.",
        "Additionally, the integrated circuit package 300 may include a substrate 302, such as an interposer, a bonding pad, or a paddle, formed within the aperture 200.",
        "Furthermore, although FIG. 3 depicts the integrated circuit package 300 mounted below the leadframe 102, it is to be understood that this invention includes mounting the integrated circuit package 300 to the leadframe 102 over or under the aperture 200.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 3 after adhesive deposition. During this process step a quantity of an adhesive composition 400 is applied to the integrated circuit package 300 that is exposed within the aperture 200. For example, the adhesive composition 400 may be an epoxy resin or an adhesive film. The quantity of the adhesive composition 400 deposited may be any quantity sufficient to adequately secure a die to the integrated circuit package 300. As exemplary illustrations, the adhesive composition 400 may form a fillet or a zero fillet structure.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 4 after die attachment. FIG. 5 illustrates the placement of a die 500, such as a known good die, over the adhesive composition 400 within the aperture 200. The die 500 may include, by way of example and not by way of limitation, a wire bond die, a flip-chip die, a stacked die, or any combination thereof. In accordance with the invention, the die 500 may further include various modular dies or ASIC dies of various sizes and dimensions that are well known within the art.",
        "It is to be understood that the die 500 of the present invention covers a wide range of configurations and types, and the configuration or type employed is only limited by the ability to secure the die 500 to the integrated circuit package 300. Consequently, the invention includes any die configuration or type that may be adhered to the integrated circuit package 300. Furthermore, in accordance with the scope of this invention, it is to be understood that the die 500 may include additional die stacked thereover.",
        "Additionally, the present invention allows for testing of the die 500 before incorporation into the integrated circuit package system 100, therefore ensuring the use of known good die in the manufacturing process.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 5 after interconnect formation. Wire bonds 600 are used to interconnect the die 500 to the electrical contacts 104 of the leadframe 102 using materials and techniques well known in the art.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 6 after molding and post-mold-cure. The leadframe 102, the integrated circuit package 300, the die 500 and the wire bonds 600 are then preferably encapsulated in a molding compound 700 to protect the integrated circuit package system 100 from the external environment. The molding compound 700 will typically be formed from a ceramic, an epoxy, a thermosetting resin compound, or other suitable polymeric composition. After encapsulation, the integrated circuit package system 100 is then subjected to a PMC process.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 7 after trim and lead formation. Once encapsulated, the integrated circuit package system 100 goes through conventional trim and lead formation. For example, the encapsulated package may be placed into a lead trim-and-form tool where the leads are formed into necessary shapes such as gull wing, J-lead and straight.",
        "Although examples are given above, it is to be understood that the leads may be sized, bent and/or otherwise formed to provide package configurations having a wide range of mount designs and types. The lead configurations applicable to the present invention are only intended to be limited by the design specifications of the integrated circuit package system 100.",
        "FIGS. 9-14 depict exemplary embodiments in accordance with aspects of the present invention; however, they are not to be construed as limiting.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 15, therein is shown a flow chart for an integrated circuit package system 1500 for fabricating the integrated circuit package system 100, 900, 1100 or 1300 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The integrated circuit package system 1500 includes providing a leadframe in a block 1502; forming an aperture within the leadframe in a block 1504; mounting a known good package to the leadframe over or under the aperture in a block 1506; and mounting a die within the aperture to the known good package in a block 1508.",
        "It has been discovered that the present invention thus has numerous advantages. A principle advantage is that the present invention may incorporate multiple IC components that are each tested independently prior to final assembly. By incorporating known good die IC components, the overall assembly process yield performance may be improved and the cost of production may be decreased.",
        "Another advantage is that the vertical stacking of multiple IC components into the same package can increase circuit density without employing additional valuable space on the mounting substrate.",
        "A further advantage is component modularization. The present invention may incorporate various modular components to create numerous mixed function devices. By employing standard IC components the cost of production may be reduced.",
        "These and other valuable aspects of the present invention consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.",
        "Thus, it has been discovered that the integrated circuit package system of the present invention furnishes important and heretofore unknown and unavailable solutions, capabilities, and functional advantages. For instance, by providing a process that incorporates known good die IC components, vertical stacking of IC components, and IC component modularization, a more cost efficient and higher yield product can be produced. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile and effective, can be implemented by adapting known technologies, and are thus readily suited for efficient and economical manufacturing.",
        "While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations which fall within the scope of the included claims.
