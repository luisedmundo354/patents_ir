Electrical contact leads 322 include a first end (not shown) for electrical connection with the electrical contacts (not shown) of plug receptacle housing 200, and a second end 322a extending from rear surface 302b of housing 302 for electrical connection with printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d (see FIG. 13).",
        "Each individual receptacle of the second receptacle 320 of header assembly 300 is provided with at least one polarization element 324 which complements polarization element 204a of plug receptacle housing 200. Header assembly 300 further includes a second detent 326 extending from upper surface 302c of housing 302. Second detent 326 is positioned on housing 302 at a location so as to selectively engage latch arm 208 (see FIGS. 7-9) of plug receptacle housing 200.",
        "First and second detents 316, 326 function to selectively engage latch arm 124 of connector assembly 100 and latch arm 208 of plug receptacle housing 200, respectively. As mentioned above, detents 316, 326 and latch arms 124 and 208 function to operatively engage one another and respectfully prevent connector assembly 100 and/or plug receptacle housing 200 from becoming dislodged and/or disconnected from header assembly 300.",
        "While header assembly 300 is shown as having a second receptacle 320 configured and dimensioned to selectively engage and/or mate with a plug receptacle housing 200 including four (4) contact silos 204 arranging in two rows of two, it is envisioned and within the scope of the present disclosure for header assembly 300 to include a second receptacle 320 configured and dimensioned to receive a plug receptacle housing having any number of contact silos 204 without departing from the scope and or spirit of the present disclosure.",
        "Desirably, second receptacle 320 of header assembly 300 is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage and/or mate with plug receptacle housings 200 of the type sold under the tradename MATE-N-LOK\u00ae.",
        "As seen in FIG. 12, header assembly 300 includes at least one, preferably a pair, of hold-downs 304 extending from a bottom surface 302d thereof. Hold-downs 304 are configured and dimensioned to snap-fit connect header assembly 300 to printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d.",
        "As seen in FIG. 13, a preferred layout for a printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d for operatively engaging with header assembly 300 is shown. Printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d includes at least one, preferably a pair of, mounting apertures \u201cR1\u201d configured and dimensioned to receive hold-downs 304 of header assembly 300. Printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d further includes a row of apertures \u201cR2\u201d formed therein for receiving and electrically engaging the second end 312a of electrical contact leads 312 extending from first receptacle 310. Printed circuit board \u201cP\u201d additionally includes a set of apertures \u201cR3\u201d configured and dimensioned to receive and electrically engage the second end 322a of electrical contacts 322 extending from second receptacle 320.",
        "It is to be understood that the foregoing description is merely a disclosure of particular embodiments and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention. Other possible modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art and all modifications will be apparent to those in the art and all modifications are to be defined by the following claims."
