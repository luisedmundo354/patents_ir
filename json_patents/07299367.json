        "The present invention relates to resource monitoring systems and, more particularly, to methods, systems and computer program products that may be used to develop resource monitoring systems.",
        "Resource monitoring systems refer to systems that monitor other systems for situations that may require corrective action. A resource monitoring system typically includes a collection of rules that determines under what situations corrective action should be initiated and the type of corrective action to apply in a particular situation. When a resource monitoring system detects such a situation, the resource monitoring system may, for example, alert an operator and/or self-initiate corrective procedures. Resource monitoring systems are used to monitor a wide variety of software and hardware systems such as computers, applications programs, servers, and industrial systems and equipment, and may greatly expand the number of different systems and applications that an operator may be able to effectively manage.",
        "Typically, resource monitoring systems operate at least in part by (1) extracting raw statistics (data) at specified time intervals from the application or system that is being monitored, (2) processing those statistics, and (3) alerting operators and/or taking corrective action when the processing logic determines a condition requiring the operator's attention and/or automatic correction (an \u201calert condition\u201d) has occurred. Resource monitoring systems may generally be classified into one of two types, namely, instantaneous systems and persistent systems.",
        "Instantaneous resource monitoring systems are systems that use current statistics (and, in some instances, the last prior measured statistic and the elapsed time between the current and last prior measurements) to determine whether an alert condition has occurred. In contrast, persistent systems keep track of the past k values of the measured statistics to impose a \u201csituational persistence\u201d requirement\u2014i.e., a situation must occur for at least a certain amount of time before an alert is raised and/or before corrective action is taken. For example, in a persistent resource monitoring system an alert condition may only be deemed to have occurred if an instantaneous alert condition persists for at least three consecutive time intervals. More sophisticated persistent systems may look at both how many times a condition occurs and how many times it does not occur (such non-occurrences are referred to as \u201choles\u201d) during the past k responses, meaning that an alert is only raised when the condition persists for a certain number of occurrences with no more than another number of non-occurrences during the specified interval. Thus, for example, a persistent resource monitoring system may specify that an alert condition is only deemed to have occurred if the instantaneous alert condition persists for at least ten time intervals with no more than 2 non-occurrences or \u201choles\u201d occurring during that time interval. Alternatively, a persistent resource monitoring system may specify that an alert condition is only deemed to have occurred if the instantaneous alert condition appears ten times, with no more than 2 non-occurrences or \u201choles\u201d between each alert condition.",
        "Unfortunately, resource monitoring systems typically are very labor-intensive to construct and test. The difficulties associated with generating such models serves to severely limit their application, in terms of both resource monitoring systems that are developed and provided by outside vendors and ad hoc end-user constructed resource monitoring systems that are designed to detect specific alertable conditions.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention provide methods of selecting an alert condition for a resource monitoring system. Pursuant to these methods, a logic value is associated with at least some of the entries in a database, where the entries in the database are values for a group of metrics taken at different times. The alert condition is then selected based on at least some of the logic values and at least some of the entries in the database. In these methods, the act of selecting the alert condition may be accomplished, for at least one of the metrics, by using the logic values and the entries in the database to determine a feasible range of values for a threshold, where the threshold will have a specified relationship with respect to the metric. The alert condition may then be selected based on the determined feasible ranges of values. In these methods, the specified relationship may be that the metric will be less than or equal to the threshold and/or that the metric will be greater than or equal to the threshold.",
        "In embodiments of the present invention, the group of metrics may include one or more of the following metrics: (a) a raw metric, (b) a derived metric that is calculated as the difference between the value of a raw metric at a first time and the value of the raw metric at a second time, (c) a derived metric that is calculated as the difference between the value of a first raw metric at a first time and the value of the first raw metric at a second time divided by the interval between the first time and the second time, and/or (d) a derived metric that is calculated as the difference between the value of a first raw metric at a first time and the value of the first raw metric at a second time divided by the difference between the value of a second raw metric at the first time and the value of the second raw metric at the second time.",

The logic values that are specified may be specified using three-valued logic. The methods may further include specifying allowable rates of false positives, and false negatives for the resource monitoring system and/or a maximum amount of time that may elapse before an alert is generated after the occurrence of a potential alert condition system. The methods may also include using historical metric data to estimate the number of alerts that the alert condition would generate for different potential persistence criteria, and a persistence alert condition may then be selected based on the first alert condition and one of the potential persistence criteria that satisfies the specified allowable rates of false positives and of false negatives.",
        "Pursuant to further embodiments of the present invention, methods of generating persistent resource monitoring systems are provided. Pursuant to these methods, an instantaneous resource model having an associated alert condition is provided and allowable rates of false positives and false negatives for the persistent resource monitoring system are specified. A database of historical information is then processed to determine the number of times that the persistent resource monitoring system would take corrective action for a variety of different persistence criteria. One of the persistence criteria may then be selected as the persistence requirement that is applied to the instantaneous resource model to create the persistent resource monitoring system. This may be accomplished in embodiments of the present invention by selecting the persistence criteria having a smallest duration that satisfies the allowable rate of false positives and the allowable rate of false negatives.",

        "In embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of raw metrics mi may be selected that are used in the development of the resource monitoring system. By \u201craw metrics\u201d it is meant numerical or other parameters associated with the resource that is being monitored such as, for example, the cumulative number of page faults, the number of page faults per unit time, response times for various actions and the like. The value of these raw metrics typically vary over time. Thus, each raw metric mi may be represented by a vector mi(t), where each entry in the vector represents the measured value of mi at a specific time. The index for each metric typically will be persistent, such that if mi(t) refers to a given metric at time t, mi(t\u2032) refers to the same metric at time t\u2032, and (mi(t\u2032)\u2212mi(t)) gives a semantically meaningful difference. As discussed herein, a historical database of values for the selected raw metrics mi(t) is used in the construction of the resource monitoring system, so typically the selected raw metrics will be metrics for which historical data is available and/or can be generated.",
        "A predicate G may also be defined that is a function of certain metrics (either the raw metrics discussed above and/or the \u201cderived metrics\u201d discussed below) that are associated with the system that is to be monitored. G may have an unknown structure and may be taken as a description of the gross characteristics of the situation that the resource monitoring system is intended to detect. A predicate is a function of the identified variables that returns a truth value (e.g., TRUE or FALSE) based on the values of the identified variables. In embodiments of the present invention, the predicate may be allowed to operate in a three-valued logic domain of TRUE, FALSE and NO COMMITMENT (the value of NO COMMITMENT means that the predicate makes no commitment as to whether G is true or false in a specific situation). In embodiments of the present invention, the predicate G may be a function of one or more of the selected metrics taken at adjacent measurement times t and t\u2032. In further embodiments of the invention, G may be a function of one or more of the selected metrics taken over a range of times or on a time-limited average.",
        "As discussed herein, a user of the methods, systems and/or computer program products of the present invention may provide an initial theory regarding G. This initial theory acts to initialize the methodology and the methodology/system may be run iteratively until the user is satisfied with the result or the methodology/system demonstrates that no system is consistent with the user's proposed theories. By way of example, with respect to network server resources, many conditions can cause response times of the server to rise above a threshold. In the specific situation where (1) servlet response times are above a specified threshold, (2) a \u201clarge\u201d number of sessions have been open for an \u201cextended\u201d time and (3) the associated Java Virtual Machine is using \u201cminimal\u201d CPU resources, it may be indicative of a deadlock. The appropriate response to a deadlock is to shutdown and restart the application server. The user would like to construct a resource monitoring system that identifies this situation with a minimum number of false positives (i.e., situations where the resource monitoring system identifies a deadlock as having occurred when it in fact has not occurred) and false negatives (i.e., situations where the resource monitoring system fails to identify that a deadlock has occurred). The user, who initially may only know that in the past when the response time was too high and that a restart fixed the problem may seed the methodology for constructing a resource monitoring system that will take the corrective action of restarting the system with the following initial theory of G:\n\nG(mi(t)) is TRUE if mi(t)>x\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere mi(t) is the servlet response time and x is a value such as, for example, 180 seconds, that is supplied by the user. As discussed herein, this initial theory of G may be used to classify specific observations from an historical database of data into positive (i.e., TRUE), negative (i.e., FALSE) and indeterminate (i.e., NO COMMITMENT) examples.",
        "In embodiments of the present invention, the following logical atoms may be defined:\n\nMETRIC\u2266THRESHOLD OR\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nMETRIC\u2267THRESHOLD,\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere METRIC is a metric that is used in the resource monitoring system and THRESHOLD is an unknown threshold value. One or more of the raw metrics mi(t) may be used for METRIC. Alternatively, one or more derived metrics Dk(mi) may be used for METRIC, where a \u201cderived metric\u201d refers to a metric that is calculated based on the values of one or more of the raw metrics. The notation Dk(mi) is used herein to represent the kth derived metric that is based on raw metric mi(t). Also note that derived metric Dk(mi) may be a vector having values for different points in time, although to simplify the notation, the term mi(t) has been shortened to mi. The use of derived metrics may, in certain situations, provide more and/or better information regarding when a particular resource that is being monitored has reached a point that some sort of corrective action may be beneficial. In embodiments of the present invention, one or more of the following derived metrics may be used in the construction of resource monitoring systems:\n\nD1(mi)=mi(t)\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nD2(mi)=mi(t)\u2212mi(t\u2032)\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nD3(mi)=[mi(t)\u2212mi(t\u2032)]/dt\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nD4(mi)=[mi(t)\u2212mi(t\u2032)]/[mj(t)\u2212mj(t\u2032)]\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nIn Equations 4-7 t and t\u2032 are adjacent times in the database of raw metric values and division by zero is not implied. Note also that the \u201cderived metric\u201d D1(mi) is not a derived metric at all, but instead is simply the raw metric mi(t). Note further that the derived metric D4(mi) may be calculated for as many different combinations of first raw metrics mi(t) and second raw metrics mj(t) as is desired. It will also be appreciated that the invention is not limited to using some or all of the exemplary derived metrics set forth in Equations 4-7. For example, as discussed above, derived metrics at time t can include functions of many metrics taken over a range of times.",
        "As noted above, a historical database of values for the raw metrics mi(t) is available or generated for use in the methods, systems and computer program products of the present invention. By \u201cdatabase\u201d it is meant a collection of data stored in any form, including data stored, for example, in a table or a file on a data processing system. Thus, the term \u201cdatabase\u201d is used broadly herein and is not limited to data that is stored in or used with, for example, a conventional database program such as a relational database. In embodiments of the invention in which derived metrics are used, a database of derived metric values may be constructed using the historical database of values for the raw metrics mi(t) and the equations (e.g., Equations 4-7 above) that define each of the derived metrics.",
        "A logic value may be associated with at least some of the entries in the database of metric values (this may be either the historical database of raw metric values of the database of derived metric values depending upon which type of metric is used in any particular implementation). In embodiments of the present invention, a three valued logic system may be used where the logic values may be TRUE, FALSE or NO COMMITMENT. A logic value of NO COMMITMENT may be the default when no logic value is associated with entries in the database of metric values. Typically, the same logic value will be associated with all of the derived metrics associated with a particular time t1. However, this need not be the case.",
        "Continuing with the example set forth above, the user seeds the methodology by initially proposing the theory that G(m1(t)) is TRUE if m1(t)>x where x=180 and m1(t) is the raw metric for servlet response time. Based on this initial theory, entries in the historical database having a servlet response time that exceeds 180 are classified as TRUE (i.e., the logical value TRUE is associated with those entries in the database). The user may choose to classify additional entries in the database as FALSE, and may make no commitment with respect to other entries. In many instances, logic values of TRUE or FALSE will only be associated with a relatively small percentage of the entries in the database.",
        "A \u201csituational description\u201d algorithm may be executed to determine feasible threshold settings, if any, for which the logical atoms METRIC\u2266THRESHOLD and METRIC\u2267THRESHOLD hold true. An interval [a, b] may be defined that represents the lower and upper endpoints, respectively, of the set of feasible threshold values for which a particular metric (e.g., m1(t) or D2(m3)) is less than or equal to the threshold. Likewise, a second interval [c, d] may be defined that represents the lower and upper endpoints, respectively, of the set of feasible threshold values for which the metric at issue is greater than or equal to the threshold.",
        "The \u201csituational description\u201d algorithm starts with the lower endpoints \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d of the two feasible ranges of threshold settings initialized to the lowest possible value that they can attain (e.g., negative infinity, 0, etc., depending upon what the metric is and the lowest value that it can attain) and with the upper endpoints \u201cb\u201d and \u201cd\u201d of the two feasible ranges of threshold settings initialized to the highest possible value that they can attain (e.g., infinity, 231-1, etc.). The \u201csituational description\u201d algorithm then uses the information from the historical database (i.e., the database of raw metrics or the database of derived metrics depending upon the type of metric at issue) to move the endpoints of each range [a, b] and [c, d] closer together by using the information provided by the user about G to classify additional data in the database into positive (TRUE) or negative (FALSE) examples. In certain embodiments of the present invention this may be accomplished as described below.",
        "After initializing the endpoints of the ranges as discussed above, the relevant database of historical information is examined to identify each entry for the metric at issue that has been associated with a logical value of TRUE or a logical value of FALSE (entries with a logical value of NO COMMITMENT may be ignored). Where a logical value of TRUE has been associated with a particular entry for one of the metrics in the database, endpoint \u201ca\u201d of the first range is recalculated as the greater of \u201ca\u201d or the value of the particular entry for the metric (\u201ctheta\u201d) in the database. In this situation endpoint \u201cb\u201d retains its previous value. Where a logical value of FALSE has been associated with a particular entry for the metric in the database, endpoint \u201ca\u201d retains its previous value and endpoint \u201cb\u201d is recalculated as the lesser of \u201cb\u201d and theta. Likewise, where a logical value of TRUE has been associated with a particular entry the metric in the database, endpoint \u201cc\u201d retains its previous value and endpoint \u201cd\u201d is recalculated as the lesser of \u201cd\u201d and theta. Where a logical value of FALSE has been associated with a particular entry for the metric in the database, endpoint \u201cc\u201d is recalculated as the greater of \u201cc\u201d and theta and endpoint \u201cd\u201d retains its previous value. The output of this algorithm is a table of five-tuples <METRIC, a, b, c, d>, where one such five-tuple exists for each metric (e.g., Dk(mi)) that is processed using the situational description algorithm. Table 1 summarizes the processing steps that comprise the situational description algorithm:",

        "Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the figures. FIG. 1 is a flow chart diagram that illustrates operations according to embodiments of the present invention that may be used to develop resource monitoring systems. As shown in FIG. 1, the operations may start with the selection of a particular corrective action that the resource monitoring system is to perform (block 100). By way of example, corrective actions that could be specified might include alerting an operator, notifying a user of the resource, shutting down the resource (and perhaps thereafter restarting it) and/or shutting down related systems, applications and/or resources. The particular type of corrective action may be defined by, for example, the designer of the instantaneous resource monitoring system. As shown in FIG. 1, resource monitoring systems generated according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be designed to implement more than one corrective action where the corrective action taken will vary depending upon the values of various system parameters (i.e., metrics) that are monitored by the resource monitoring system.",
        "Next, a plurality of raw metrics mi(t) may be selected that are used by the resource monitoring system (block 102). As discussed above, embodiments of the present invention may use raw metrics and/or derived metrics in the construction of the resource monitoring system (a \u201cderived metric\u201d is a metric that is calculated based on the values of one or more of the raw metrics). In the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 1, a plurality of derived metrics are used. As shown in FIG. 1, after selection of the raw metrics mi(t) operations continue at block 104 with the definition of the derived metrics Dk(mi) that are to be used in the construction of the resource monitoring system. In embodiments of the present invention, a system or computer program product that is used in the construction of the resource monitoring systems may define the derived metrics that are to be used (either by using pre-assigned derived networks or by adaptively selecting the derived metrics that are to be used based on information regarding the system that is to be monitored) or, alternatively the derived metrics that are used may be defined by the user/operator of the system. Equations 4-7 above provide examples of the types of derived metrics that might be used in the methods, systems and computer program products of the present invention.",
        "Typically, a historical database of values for the raw metrics (database 108) will already be in existence with respect to the resource that is to be monitored, although such a database may also be specially constructed for use in the methods, systems and computer program products of the present invention. In embodiments of the present invention where derived metrics are used, at block 106 of FIG. 1 a database of derived metric values (database 110) may be established. This may be accomplished, for example, by taking data from the historical database of values for the raw metrics mi(t) (database 108) and using that data in the equations that define the selected derived metrics Dk(mi) to compute historical values for the derived metrics. It will be appreciated, however, that a historical database of values for the derived metrics need not be compiled, as the values of the derived metrics may be computed directly from the raw metric data on an as needed basis.",
        "As shown at block 114 of FIG. 1, a logic value may be associated with at least some of the entries in the database of derived metric values (database 110). In embodiments of the present invention, the logic values that are associated with entries in the database of derived metric values (database 110) may be provided by the user of the methods, systems and computer program products of the present invention. Such a user might, for example, look at log entries (each of which may have a time stamp) made during previous operation of the resource that is to be monitored to identify error codes or other information that may be useful in developing a resource monitoring system. These log entries may be contained in a log file 112 or may be obtained from a variety of other sources. By way of example, the user might specify as TRUE all of the values in the derived metric database that are within 2 minutes of a time at which a log entry of \u201cError Code=237\u201d was recorded in the log file 112. The user might also specify that all of the derived metrics at the time of a log entry of \u201cCode Restart\u201d are FALSE. More sophisticated criteria may be used for associating logical values with entries in the database 110 of derived metric values such as, for example, associating values based on the manner in which two different log entries interact. Derived metrics which are not associated with a logic value of TRUE or FALSE may be assigned a logic value of NO COMMITMENT. It will also be appreciated by persons of skill in the art that the association of logic values with entries in the historical databases may be automated in embodiments of the present invention.",
        "Operations continue in the flow chart of FIG. 1 at block 116 with the determination of feasible ranges of values for a threshold such that the threshold will have a specified relationship with respect to one of the derived metrics. In particular, in the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1, for each derived metric Dk(mi) the operations of block 116 determine an interval [a, b] that represents the feasible range, if any, for a threshold such that the logical atom Dk(mi)\u2266THRESHOLD will be TRUE. The operations at block 116 likewise determine for each derived metric Dk(mi) an interval [c, d] that represents the feasible range, if any, for a threshold such that the logical atom Dk(mi)\u2267THRESHOLD will be TRUE. It will be appreciated that the system could be designed to operate with other logical atoms. As discussed above, the situational description algorithm set forth in Table 1 may be used to determine the intervals [a, b] and [c, d].",
        "Although not depicted in FIG. 1, after the feasible ranges are determined for each of the derived metrics Dk(mi), the user may choose to evaluate the output of the situational description algorithm and, if necessary, modify some of the input information such as the logic values associated with specific entries in the historical database 110 of derived metric values and/or the derived metrics that are used. Such an evaluation step may facilitate efficient construction of the resource monitoring system, particularly in situations where the situational description algorithm indicates that with respect to a particular derived metric Dk(mi) that (a>b) and that (c>d), indicating that for metric Dk(mi) there are no feasible threshold ranges that will render either of the logical atoms TRUE. Additionally, even in situations where feasible ranges are identified, it may be helpful to the design process to apply the identified range to the historical database to determine how many additional NO COMMITMENT entries in the database the identified range will move to a TRUE or FALSE setting.",
        "Next, at block 118 of FIG. 1, a candidate instantaneous resource monitoring system may be constructed based on the identified feasible ranges for threshold values (i.e., the five-tuples <Dk(mi), a, b, c, d>). This may be accomplished by performing the instantaneous resource monitoring system construction operations specified above at Equations 8-11 to arrive at the condition COND that will be used to identify when an alert condition has arisen. A designer may then (optionally) choose to evaluate the candidate resource monitoring system (block 120). In certain embodiments of the present invention, this evaluation may be accomplished by using data from the historical database 108 of raw metric values and/or the database 110 of derived metric values to identify the situations where the candidate resource monitoring system would have generated an alert condition. The designer may then compare this information to a log file or other information regarding the operation of the resource at the time the values in the historical database 108 were generated to determine how effective the candidate resource model was in correctly identifying situations in which alerts should have been raised. This may be done, for example, by evaluating the number of false positives (situations where an alert would have been raised even though there was no actual problem) or the number of false negatives (situations when an alert should have been raised but would not have been raised by the candidate resource monitoring system) that would have occurred had the candidate resource monitoring system been in use. (Note that the specific instantaneous resource model described above will only generate false positives because the condition COND that represents the instantaneous resource monitoring system was initialized as TRUE\u2014however, other implementations that will result in the generation of false negatives are also within the scope of the present invention.)",
        "If, at block 122 of FIG. 1, the candidate resource monitoring system is not deemed acceptable, operations may continue by revising some of the information used to generate the model. As shown in FIG. 1, one such revision may be to change some of the logic values that are associated with the data in the database 110 of derived metric values (block 14). This may be done, for example, by making TRUE or FALSE commitments on more or less entries in the database. Additional potential revisions (not illustrated in FIG. 1) would be to modify the selection of raw metrics and/or the selection of derived metrics that were used to construct the candidate resource monitoring system and/or to modify the corrective action that is taken by the resource monitoring system.",
        "If, at block 122, the candidate model is deemed acceptable, an instantaneous resource monitoring system is provided. This model may be used to monitor a system and/or to develop further resource monitoring systems. One way to develop a more sophisticated resource monitoring system is to expand the system to include more corrective actions. This may be accomplished, for example, by selecting one or more additional corrective actions at block 100 and then using the methodology illustrated in FIG. 1 and described herein to generate the conditions COND under which the resource monitoring system will implement these additional corrective actions.",
        "Additional operations for creating a resource monitoring system according to further embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in blocks 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134 of FIG. 1. The operations set forth in these blocks of FIG. 1 may be used to take the instantaneous resource monitoring system generated at block 122 and use it to generate a persistent resource monitoring system.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, generation of the persistent resource model starts at block 124 with the provision of several input criteria, namely (1) the required \u201cresponsiveness\u201d for the model, (2) a maximum acceptable level of false positive alerts generated by the resource monitoring system and (3) a maximum acceptable level of false negative alerts generated by the resource monitoring system. The \u201cresponsiveness\u201d refers to the maximum amount of time that may elapse before the resource monitoring system implements the specified corrective action. Thus, the responsiveness criteria acts to limit the amount of \u201chistory\u201d that the resource monitoring system may evaluate in determining whether or not to raise an alert in a particular situation. For example, if the responsiveness is specified as 10 minutes and the sampling interval (i.e., the time interval at which measurements of the raw metrics are taken) is 30 seconds, the maximum amount of history that may be considered is 600/30+1=21 time intervals worth of raw metric data. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, typically increasing the amount of history considered by the persistent resource monitoring system increases the systems capability to accurately identify alert situations. However, increasing the amount of history considered also decreases the responsiveness of the system as an alert (typically) is not issued until the specified amount of history has been considered.",
        "Next, as illustrated at block 126 of FIG. 1, the condition COND generated at block 120 of FIG. 1 may be applied to the database 110 of derived metric values. At each time entry (sample) in the database 110, the condition COND either will or will not be met. If the condition COND is met, this represents an \u201coccurrence\u201d, meaning that it is a situation where the instantaneous resource monitoring system generated at block 120 would recognize as an \u201calert condition\u201d and take corrective action. A field may be added to the database 110 recording whether or not the condition COND is met for each time entry in the database. This information may then be used to generate a table that lists the number of alerts that would be generated at all feasible combinations of occurrences (and acceptable number of holes) and holes for the specified responsiveness criteria. An exemplary technique for selecting the occurrences and holes settings operates by constructing a table of the following form:",

Analysis of this history with an (occurrences, holes) setting of (1,0) would generate 3 contiguous alert condition intervals; similarly, a setting of (2,0) would generate 2 contiguous alert condition intervals. With a persistence criteria requiring the alert condition to be at least 3 intervals in length, these alert conditions would be false positives (not meeting the persistence criteria) in all but the last contiguous interval. The \u201cMaximum False Negative\u201d columns are filled in by computing the number of raw occurrences that are not \u201cclaimed\u201d by a contiguous alert interval taken against a proxy standard, those that would be claimed with a (2,i) interval setting.

This analysis can be refined by many additional techniques: for example, one could determine the maximum number of justifiable positives at a given responsiveness by processing the output of the persistence algorithm to eliminate the false positives.",
        "Based on the analysis at block 126, a particular persistence criteria may be selected (block 128).

Operations continue in FIG. 4 with the specification of (1) an allowable rate of false positives and (2) an allowable rate of false negatives for the resource monitoring system (block 272). These allowable rates need not necessarily be absolute rates, but instead may represent \u201cexpected\u201d maximum rates for false positives and false negative under normal operating conditions. Candidate persistence criteria may then be evaluated (block 274). This may be done, for example, by processing a database of historical information to estimate the number of times that the instantaneous resource monitoring system would take corrective action if applied for a plurality of different persistence criteria (i.e., different combinations of occurrences and holes) (block 274). Finally, one of the plurality of persistence criteria may be selected as the persistence requirement that is applied to the instantaneous resource monitoring system to create the persistent resource monitoring system (block 276). This may be done, for example, by selecting a persistence criteria that achieves the specified false positive and false negative criteria (and, optionally, any responsiveness criteria). If multiple persistence criteria meet the false positive and false negative criteria, the persistence criteria that meets the false positive and false negative criteria and has the smallest time interval may be selected.",

        "To construct the persistent resource monitoring system, the responsiveness, acceptable percentage of false positives and acceptable percentage of false negatives are obtained. Here, we will assume that responsiveness was specified as 11 seconds, the acceptable false positive percentage was specified as 50% and the acceptable false negative percentage was specified as 40%. Since our time samples are 2 seconds apart in this example (see Table 3 above), the responsiveness specification indicates that the results of the instantaneous resource model for at most 5 time samples may be considered before the persistent resource model makes its decision as to whether or not corrective action is required.",
        "Next, the data in the database of derived metric values is used to determine whether or not the condition COND (i.e., the alert condition for the instantaneous resource model) is met at each time sample included in the database. As illustrated in Table 9, the condition COND is met (i.e., we have an \u201coccurrence\u201d) at times t3, t4, t5, t7, t9 and t10. The condition COND is not met (i.e., we have a \u201chole\u201d) at the remaining four time samples in the historical database of derived metric values.",

        "The information in Table 9 may then be used to determine the number of alerts that would be delivered by the resource monitoring system for each feasible combination of occurrence and hole settings (occ, hole) or \u201cpersistence criteria\u201d if the information from the historical database was fed into the resource monitoring system. This may be accomplished using, for example, the exemplary techniques described above with respect to Table 2. Only the persistence criteria that are feasible given the specified responsiveness criteria need be considered. Here, the terminology (occ, holes) may be defined as (occ+holes) adjacent time samples in the database that includes at least occ number of occurrences. Thus, for example, a persistence criteria of (occ, holes)=(2, 1) is satisfied by three adjacent time samples in the database if at least two of the time samples comprise occurrences. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, however, that different definitions for \u201coccurrences\u201d and \u201choles\u201d may be specified with respect to resource monitoring systems and that the methods, systems and computer program products of the present invention are not limited to any particular definition for occurrences and holes, but may be adapted to be used with any given definition.",
        "A persistence criteria that meets the specified false negative and false positive and any responsiveness criteria may then be selected. The selected persistence criteria may then be used as the wrap-around to the instantaneous resource monitoring system to construct the persistent resource monitoring system.",
