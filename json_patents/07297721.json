        "The reaction of the present invention is enumerated in the following steps:",
        "a) Making of Clear PET Flakes",
        "As per the patented procedure of the inventors (I.P.No. 180047) 100 kg to 1300 kg of the PCR PET Flakes were made ready from the used PET bottles.",
        "b) Addition of Catalysts and Additives",
        "PTA/MEG slurry in the ratio of 70:30 wt % with appropriate quantity of IPA as needed is made ready in the paste preparation vessel. The catalysts in the form of Sb2O3 (100 to 300 ppm), Germanium Dioxide (5 to 50 ppm) and Organic Titanates (5 to 100 ppm) are added in the paste preparation vessel. The coloring agents like Co are added in the range of 20 to 100 ppm in the paste in the form of Cobalt acetate. To support Co, the color toners such as Red and Blue and Optical Brightener are added in the range of 0.2 to 3.0 ppm.",
        "c) Batch Processing",
        "At the end of the esterification/glycolysis of PTA/Flakes oligomer (BHET/Prepolymer) that is formed in-situ, is not separated but transferred to the polyreactor via a filter for further polymerization. So the material from esterifier/prepolyreactor is not taken out for some other process and charged into the polyreactor. The present process is a batch process consisting of two/three reactors viz. Esterifier/Prepolymerizer and Polyreactor and each batch is processed through these reactors.",
        "Initially the esterifier is empty and having the temperature of 240 to 270\u00b0 C. The esterifier is provided with an agitator, internal heating coils and an external heating limpet. The esterifier is maintained under the inert atmosphere by using the Nitrogen. The reactor pressure is maintained in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 Kgs/cm2 The ingestion of PTA/IPA/MEG is done and after the ingestion of around 500-1000 kg of the paste, the PET flakes that were kept charged in the small silo above the reactor are dosed in the esterifier using the nitrogen pressure slightly above the esterifier pressure to prevent the possible air entry to the reactor.",
        "Further, ingestion of PTA/MEG paste is resumed and the charged PET flakes start undergoing the melting process and simultaneously they undergo the glycolysis reaction with the available MEG in the system. After the required quantity ingestion of the paste, further ingestion is stopped.",
        "In the present process, simultaneous reactions of Esterification (PTA conversion to BHET i.e. prepolymer or oligomer), Melting/Glycolysis of PET flakes takes place in the esterification reactor which is a unique feature in the present process.",
        "Thus the complete mass gets converted to the BHET viz., prepolymer/oligomer with the degree of polymerization to the tune of 5 to 10. After getting this first batch converted, the BHET remains in the esterifier and acts as the PREPOLYMER HEEL. This helps to hasten all the above-mentioned unit process in the subsequent batches.",
        "After achieving the desired end temperature of 250 to 275\u00b0 C. and the conversion of 98.5% the prepolymer melt is held in the esterifier for a period of 15 to 45 minutes for equilibration to have a controlled DP of 5 to 10. The prepolymer is then filtered through a 20 micron filter and transferred to the prepolyreactor under nitrogen pressure.",
        "The pre-polyreactor is equipped with an agitator, internal heating coil and external limpet coil. The prepolymer is processed by gradually reducing the pressure to 5-15 mbar (abs.) and increasing the temperature to about 260-285\u00b0 C. After an increase in DP the melt is transferred after filtration to the Polymerization reactor, which is provided with a special agitator, condenser and a fine vacuum system.",
        "The polymerization takes place in the presence of a combination of catalysts viz. Antimony Trioxide, Germanium Dioxide and Organic Titanates (e.g. Tetraisopropylorthotitanate). Here the polymer melt with a low starting DP is raised to its required final high DP of 140-160 by reducing the pressure to as low as 0.1-0.5 mbar (abs.) and the temperature to about 290-298\u00b0 C. The polymer melt is stabilized with heat stabilizers OPA/TEPA. Optical Brighteners and Toners are added at appropriate quantities to achieve the desired color of the final polymer. The polymer melt is extruded under nitrogen pressure and converted into pellets. This amorphous RPET polymer is further solid state polymerized to an intrinsic viscosity (IV) of 0.80-0.86. Since, all the additives are food grade the RPET resin so produced is suitable for food contact application.",
