For example, a search result may be presented with an indication of whether the content corresponding to the search result is available for viewing. Similarly, a search result may be presented with an indication of whether the content corresponding to the search result is appropriate for a maturity level of the user. The indication may be prose near the presentation of the search result. The indication also may be one or more graphical icons near the presentation of the search result. The graphical icons may be selected to reveal text describing the characteristics of the corresponding search result.",
        "Search results returned by a search engine may be sorted according to the characteristics of the search results. For example, the search results corresponding to available content may be presented before search results corresponding to unavailable content. Search results also may be filtered according to the characteristics of the search results. For example, search results corresponding to content that is inappropriate for minors may be omitted from a display of the search results.",
        "Multiple methods exist for identifying the characteristics to be displayed or to be used as a basis for sorting or filtering search results. For example, a spider program collecting information on the contents of various web pages also may collect information regarding the characteristics of the web pages. In addition or as an alternative, if a search result has been viewed previously, a cached version of the search result may be used to identify the characteristics of the search result. Moreover, the web pages viewed by the user may be monitored to identify how the search results are used and the order in which the web pages are viewed. Characteristics may be determined by identifying people that have viewed the search results. If the search results have not been visited before identification as search results, the search results may be visited to determine their content characteristics after the search results are presented to the user.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1A-1E, conventional search engine interfaces present search results returned by a search engine. For example, one or more search results 105 may be returned by a search engine to match search criteria 110 entered by a user of the conventional search engine interface 100. Each search result 105 may be presented with a title that serves as a link to content corresponding to the search result. The search result 105 also may include a summary of the content corresponding to the search result, as well as an indication of the location of the content and a means for accessing pages related to the search result 105.",
        "The user of the conventional search engine interface 100 references the information presented in the search result 105 while deciding whether to access the content associated with the search result. The summary may not accurately or completely describe the content, yet the user may find something included in the content or missing from the content that leads them to or away from accessing the content.",
        "By supplementing the content summary with additional information regarding the content, the user may be better able to determine whether access is appropriate or desirable. For example, the user may be provided with information enabling their quick determination of whether the content corresponding to the search result 105 is unavailable, is inappropriate for minors, includes advertisements, includes or lacks multimedia content, has an unwanted file type, originates from an unwanted source, or has not been viewed by people known to the user. Better indication of the content associated with the search results may prevent the user from accessing unwanted content and enable the user to more quickly access the content being searched for with the conventional search engine interface 100.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2A, an updated search engine interface 200A provides additional information describing characteristics of content corresponding to search results presented to a user in the search engine interface 200A. Specifically, each search result 205a-e is presented with prose 210a-e that describes the characteristics of the content corresponding to the search result. For example, the search result 205c includes prose 210c that indicates that content corresponding to the search result 205c is currently unavailable. In one implementation, a cached version of the unavailable content corresponding to the search result 205c may be made available.",
        "The prose 210a-e may indicate whether the content associated with the corresponding search results 205a-e is currently available. If the content is available, then the user may access the content without problem, but the user may not access the content when the content is unavailable. The prose 210a-e also may indicate whether the content is appropriate for certain ages. For example, prose 210d may inform the user that content associated with a search result 205d corresponding to the prose 210d is inappropriate for minors, or that the content is appropriate for minors.",
        "In addition, the prose 210a-e may indicate whether displaying the content associated with the search results 205a-e leads to the display of advertisements. For example, prose 210a may inform the user that content associated with a search result 205a corresponding to the prose 210a spawns a pop-up advertisement, a pop-under advertisements, or rich media advertisements. A pop-up advertisement is an advertisement that appears in a window distinct from a window that includes main content that is viewed and removes window focus from the window that includes the main content. A pop-under advertisement also is an advertisement that appears in a window distinct from a window that includes main content that is viewed, but the window including pop-under advertisement appears below the window that includes the main content, and window focus remains on the window that includes the main content. A rich media advertisement is an advertisement that appears in a window that includes the main content to be viewed. The rich media advertisement may cover and obscure a part of the main content, which may be viewed after the rich media advertisement is manually dismissed.",
        "The prose 210a-e may indicate the presence of multimedia content among the content associated with the search results 205a-e. Multimedia content includes audio content, video content, or other kinds of content other than text and images. For example, prose 210b may inform the user that content associated with a search result 205b corresponding to the prose 210b includes or does not include multimedia content. Furthermore, the prose 210a-e may indicate a file type included in content associated with a search results 205a-e corresponding to the prose 210a-e. For example, the prose 210a-e corresponding to the search result 205 may inform the user that the content associated with the search results 205a-e include, for example, a spreadsheet file, a presentation file, or a PDF file.",
        "The prose 210a-e likewise may indicate a source of the content associated with the search results 205a-e. For example, prose 210a-e may inform the user that content associated with the search results 205a-e corresponding to the prose 210a-e came from, for example, a message board, a discussion forum, or a web page. The prose 210a-e also may indicate that people known to the user have viewed content corresponding to the search results 205a-e. For example, the prose 210e associated with the search result 205e may indicate the number or percentage of people from a list of people known to the user that have viewed the content corresponding to the search result 205. Another metric besides number or percentage of known people may be used to indicate that people known to the user have viewed the content associated with the search results 205a-e.",
        "The people known to the user may include the user himself. The people known to the user also may include the people listed on a buddy list corresponding to the user. The people known to the user also may include people stored on buddy lists corresponding to people stored in the user's buddy list, and so on, up to a particular number of degrees of separation from the user. The people known to the user also may include all other users belonging to the domain of the user. The people known to the user may actively indicate that the content associated with the search results 205a-e has been viewed, or an automatic determination may be made as to whether the people known to the user have viewed the content corresponding to the search results 205a-e.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2B, the search engine interface 200B also may describe characteristics of search results presented to a user in the search engine interface 200B using graphical icons 215a-c. Specifically, each search result 205a-e is presented with at least one, and potentially more than one, graphical icon 215a-c that indicates characteristics of the content corresponding to the search result 205a-e. Each icon 215a-c describes a characteristic of the content corresponding to the search result 205a-e for which the icon 215a-c is displayed. For example, the search result 205c includes an icon 215a that indicates that content corresponding to the search result 205c is currently available. Similarly, the icon 215b, included in the search result 205a, indicates that content corresponding to the search result for which the icon 215b is displayed is currently unavailable. The search result 205c also includes an icon 215c that informs the user that the content associated with the search result 205c is appropriate for minors. Other icons may be used to illustrate that content is inappropriate for minors, includes advertisements, includes multimedia content, lacks multimedia content, is of a certain file type, is from a particular source, or has been viewed by a certain number of people known to the user.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2C and 2D, the icons 215a-c may be selectable to reveal a description of the characteristics of the search results 205a-e indicated by the icons 215a-c. The description may include an explanation of the icon 215a-c as well as a detailed description of the characteristic and how a determination was made that the content for which the icon 215a-c is displayed has the characteristic represented by the icon 215a-c.",
        "In one implementation, placing the mouse pointer 220 over an icon 215b included in the search result 205d reveals a description 225 of a characteristic of content corresponding to the search result 205d away from the search result 205d. Specifically, the icon 215b indicates that the search result 205d is unavailable, and the description 225 describes the icon 215b by saying that the content is currently unavailable. In another implementation, a mouse button may be clicked while the mouse pointer 220 is over the icon 215b to reveal the description 225.",
        "In another implementation, placing the mouse pointer 220 over an icon 215b included in a search result 205d reveals a tool tip 230 that includes text describing a characteristic of content corresponding to the search result 205d. Specifically, the icon 215b indicates that the search result 215 is unavailable, and the text included in the tool tip 230 describes the icon 215b by saying that the content is currently unavailable. In another implementation, a mouse button may be clicked while the mouse pointer 215 is over the icon 215b to reveal the tool tip 230. In yet another implementation, the mouse pointer 220 may be held over the icon 215b for a period of time before the tool tip 230 is displayed.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2E, a search engine interface 200C also provides additional information describing characteristics of content corresponding to search results presented to a user in the search engine interface 200C. Each of the search results 205a-e is presented with an indication of the characteristics of the content corresponding to the search results 205a-e. The indications may be prose or graphical icons. Interaction may occur with the prose or the graphical icons to display additional information describing the characteristics of the content associated with the corresponding search results 205a-e.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, a search engine 300 visits web pages to gather information that is helpful in returning search results that match entered search criteria. The search engine 300 also may gather information describing the content of the web pages visited for display when the visited web pages are identified as search results that match the search criteria. The search engine 300 includes a spider 305 that visits and gathers information from web pages in the form of tokens to be stored in a token index 310. The search engine also includes a user interface 315 to the search tool 320 that uses the information stored in the token index 310 to return search results, the characteristics of which are determined by a characteristic identifier 325.",
        "In one implementation, the spider 305 starts at an initial web page and follows links included in the initial web page to access subsequent web pages. The spider 305 then accesses the web pages linked to by the subsequent web pages to access more web pages, and so on. When a web page is visited, the spider 305 generates text-based tokens to be stored in the token index 310. The tokens are stored in the token index 310 based on the web page for which the token was generated. The tokens may describe the contents of the web page as well as the characteristics of the contents of the web page. For example, tokens may be generated to describe if the content of the web page is available, the maturity level of the content, or the presence of advertisements within the content. In addition, tokens may be generated to indicate the presence of multimedia content within the content, the presence of a certain type of file within the content, the source of the content, or the people that have visited the web page.",
        "The search engine 300 also includes a user interface 315 which may be used to enter search criteria. The user interface 315 passes the search criteria to a search tool 320, which searches the token index 310 to identify web pages that match the search criteria. The search tool 320 examines the tokens within the token index 310 that describe the contents of the web pages visited by the spider 305 to find the tokens that match the search criteria. The web pages corresponding to the matching tokens are returned by the search tool 320 to the user interface 315 as search results.",
        "After the search results have been identified, the characteristic identifier 325 accesses the tokens from the token database 310 that correspond to the search results and that describe the characteristics of the content corresponding to the search results. The characteristic identifier 325 uses the accessed tokens to identify characteristics of the content associated with the search results. Indications of the identified characteristics are sent to the user interface 315 for display.",
        "FIGS. 4A-4F are flow charts of characteristic identification processes 400A-F that may be used to identify characteristics of content corresponding to one or more search results. The characteristics identified as a result of the characteristic identification processes 400A-F may be displayed for a user of a search engine to better inform the user about the search results.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4A, a characteristic identification process 400A gathers information describing the characteristics of potential search results as part of the preparation for identifying search results that match entered search criteria that is done. The gathered information is used to identify the characteristics of the identified search results. The characteristic identification process 400A includes visiting web pages to collect information on the web pages for use in returning the web pages as search results (402). The collected information describes the content of the page as well as characteristics of the content of the page. After the information has been collected, search criteria are received (404), and the collected information is used to identify search results matching the search criteria (406). The collected information describing the characteristics of content corresponding to the search results is retrieved (408), and that information is used to identify characteristics of content corresponding to the search results that are then displayed (410).",
        "Referring to FIG. 4B, a characteristic identification process 400B identifies characteristics corresponding to search results after the search results have been identified. The characteristic identification process 400B includes receiving search criteria (412), and identifying search results that match the search criteria (414). Content corresponding to the search results search results is accessed (416). The accessed content is the content for which the characteristics are to be identified by the characteristic identification process 400B, so characteristics of the accessed content are determined (418). The characteristics may be determined from an external service, such as, for example, a ratings service that determines a maturity level for the accessed content.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4C, a characteristic identification process 400C stores copies of web pages viewed by a user. The stored web pages are used to identify the characteristics of content corresponding to identified search results when content includes at least one of the stored web pages. The characteristic identification process 400C includes storing copies of web pages viewed by the user (420). Search criteria are received (422), and search results matching the search criteria are identified (424). Among the content corresponding to the search results may be one of the web pages of which a copy was stored by the user because the user previously viewed the web page. The stored copies of the visited web pages that are search results are retrieved (426), and the stored copies are used to identify characteristics of the content corresponding to the search results that are then displayed (428).",
        "Referring to FIG. 4D, a characteristic identification process 400D monitors the web activity of a user to store information regarding how the user interacts with each of the pages viewed by the user. The information describing the use of the page may include the time spent viewing the page, the scrolling activity while viewing the page, information copied from the page, and information entered into forms on the page. The information describing how the user uses the pages aids in identifying the characteristics of the content of the pages when the pages are identified as search results. The characteristic identification process 400D includes monitoring a user's use of web pages (430). Information describing the user's use of the web pages is stored (432). Search criteria are received (434), and search results matching the search criteria are identified (436). Among the search results may be one of the web pages for which the user's use of the page was stored. The stored information regarding the user's use of the search results is retrieved (438). After retrieval, the stored information is used to identify characteristics of the search results that were previously viewed by he viewer (440).",
        "Referring to FIG. 4E, a characteristic identification process 400E monitors the web activity of a user to identify the order in which the user views web pages. The information describing the order in which the user views the pages aids in identifying the characteristics of the content of the pages when the pages are identified as search results. The characteristic identification process 400E includes monitoring the order in which the user views web pages (442). Search criteria are received (444), and search results matching the search criteria are identified (446). Among the search results may be one of the web pages already viewed by the user. The stored information regarding the order in which the user views web pages is used to identify characteristics of the search results that were previously viewed by the viewer (448).",
        "Referring to FIG. 4F, a characteristic identification process 400F identifies people known to a user that have viewed content corresponding to identified search results to determine characteristics of the content corresponding to the identified search results. The characteristic identification process 400F includes receiving search criteria (450), and identifying search results that match the search criteria (452). The people known to the user that have viewed the search results are identified (454). In one implementation, the people known to the user may be stored on a list that is manually or automatically maintained. Characteristics of content corresponding to the search results are identified based on opinions of the content of the people known to the user (456). For example, the people known to the user may record that content corresponding to the search results has been viewed. The people also may submit an opinion of the content. The opinions may be collected and examined to determine the characteristics of the content corresponding to the search results.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, a search result display process 500 displays search results along with descriptions of the characteristics of content corresponding to the search results. The display process 500 includes retrieving search results (505). The search results are retrieved to match search criteria that have been entered. One of the search results is chosen (510), and the search result is displayed (515). In one implementation, displaying a search result may include displaying a title of the search result that also enables access to content corresponding to the link, as well as a summary of the content and an indication of the location of the content.",
        "A determination is made as to whether characteristics of the content corresponding to the chosen search result have been identified (520). If the characteristics have been identified, then the characteristics are accessed (525). If the characteristics have not been identified, then the characteristics are identified (530). The accessed or identified characteristics are displayed (535). In one implementation, displaying the characteristics comprises displaying prose describing the characteristics near the search result, such as in the search engine interface 200A of FIG. 2A. In another implementation, displaying the characteristics comprises displaying one or more graphical icons representing the characteristics near the search results such as in the search engine interface 200B of FIG. 2B. The icons may be selected to reveal text describing the characteristics.",
        "A determination is made as to whether more search results exist to be displayed (540). If so, the process of choosing a search result (510), displaying the search result (515), and displaying characteristics of content corresponding to the search result (535) is repeated. In this way, the search results and characteristics of content corresponding to the search results are sequentially displayed until there are no more search results to be displayed (540), at which point the display process 500 is complete (545).",
        "After characteristics corresponding to search results identified as matching entered search criteria have been identified, the search results may be sorted or filtered based on the characteristics. Sorting and filtering the search results enables a user to see first or only search results in which the user is interested. Sorting and filtering the search results also enables the user to see later or not at all search results in which the user is not interested. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate search engine interfaces in which search results are sorted and filtered, respectively. FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate processes for sorting and filtering, respectively, search results based on the characteristics, and FIG. 7C illustrates an alternative process for sorting and/or filtering search results.",

For example, the search results may be sorted by required maturity level, and search results of one maturity level may be displayed before search results of another maturity level. Likewise, the search results may be sorted by type of advertisement included in the content, and search results including one type of advertisement may be displayed before search results with another type of advertisements. In addition, search results corresponding to content that does not include advertisements may be displayed before search results corresponding to content that does include advertisements.",

The search results may be sorted based on file type of the content, and search results corresponding to content that includes one file type may be displayed before search results corresponding to content that includes another file type. The search results may be sorted based on a source of the content, and search results corresponding to content from one source may be displayed before search results corresponding to content from another source. The search results also may be sorted based on the number of people known to a user of the search engine interface 600A that have viewed the search results, and search results corresponding to content viewed by a particular number of known people may be displayed before search results corresponding to content viewed by another number of known people.",
        "In one implementation, the search results may be sequentially sorted based on multiple characteristics.

The retrieved search results are to be sorted before being displayed. One of the search results is chosen (715). Characteristics of content corresponding to the chosen search result are identified (720). For example, the processes 400A-F may be used to identify the characteristics of the content corresponding to the chosen search result. Based on the identified characteristics and the characteristics over which the search results are being sorted, the chosen search result is inserted into an appropriate location within a sorted list of search results, which is initially empty (725). The location in the sorted list of search results is determined such that the chosen search result is placed with other search results that have the same values for the characteristics over which the search results are sorted. If no other search results have the same value as the chosen search result, then the chosen search result is placed at the end of the sorted list of search results.",
