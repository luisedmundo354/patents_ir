        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a server device, a mobile communications terminal, an information transmitting system and an information transmitting method, and more particularly to a server device which transmits pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses to a mobile communications terminal, an information transmitting system, an information transmitting method, and a mobile communications terminal which receives pattern data transmitted from the server device.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "The current development of mobile communications technology has been remarkable, and our daily life activities are made increasingly convenient in the current age of the \u201cinformation society\u201d. For example, as a result of the spread of the internet, useful application programs and data files can easily be downloaded into terminal devices such as personal computers or the like, and can be utilized.",
        "However, items that are downloaded into terminal devices via the internet are not always limited to useful application programs and data. Specifically, computer viruses that destroy useful application programs and data also frequently invade terminal devices via the internet.",
        "For example, computer virus detection techniques using pattern matching systems are known as techniques for detecting whether or not a computer virus has invaded a terminal device. In such techniques, a database accommodating characteristic data sequences (hereafter referred to as \u201cpattern data\u201d) contained in computer viruses is transmitted to a terminal device from a server device and stored in the terminal device, and the abovementioned pattern data is compared with application programs and data that are similarly stored in the terminal device. As a result, in cases where application programs or data contain the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that these application programs or data contain a computer virus. In cases where computer virus detection techniques using pattern matching systems are utilized, it is necessary that the abovementioned database be successively updated to the most recent version in order to increase the probability of detecting computer viruses. Accordingly, when a new type of computer virus is detected, characteristic pattern data contained in this computer virus is transmitted to the terminal device from the server device, and the abovementioned database of the terminal device is updated.",
        "However, the following problems have been encountered in cases where the abovementioned conventional technique is used to detect computer viruses in a mobile communications terminal such as a portable telephone. Specifically, in the case of such a mobile communications terminal, the memory capacity and CPU capacity are insufficient compared to those of a terminal device such as a personal computer or the like. Accordingly, it is difficult to store all of the abovementioned database in a mobile communications terminal, and to compare all of the pattern data contained in this database with the application programs and data in the mobile communications terminal in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, while terminal devices such as personal computers or the like and server devices are usual connected by a wire circuit, mobile communications terminals and server devices are connected by a wireless circuit. Accordingly, in cases where all of the abovementioned database is transmitted to a mobile communications terminal from a server device, a very large wireless resource is consumed. For such reasons, the detection of computer viruses in mobile communications terminals cannot be efficient performed in the case of the abovementioned conventional technique.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a server device, an information transmitting system and an information transmitting method which solve the abovementioned problems and make it possible to accomplish the detection of computer viruses in a mobile communications terminal in an efficient manner.",
        "In order to solve the abovementioned problems, the server device of the present invention is a server device which transmits pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses to a mobile communications terminal, comprising extraction means for extracting specified pattern data from a plurality of sets of pattern data on the basis of terminal information relating to the abovementioned mobile communications terminal, and transmitting means for transmitting the abovementioned specified pattern data extracted by the abovementioned extraction means to the abovementioned mobile communications terminal.",
        "Furthermore, in order to solve the abovementioned problems, the information transmitting system of the present invention comprises a mobile communications terminal and the abovementioned server device that transmits pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses to the abovementioned mobile communications terminal.",
        "Furthermore, in order to solve the abovementioned problems, the information transmitting method of the present invention is an information transmitting method in which pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted from a server device to a mobile communications terminal, comprising an extraction step in which the abovementioned server device extracts specified pattern data from a plurality of sets of pattern data on the basis of terminal information relating to the abovementioned mobile communications terminal, and a transmission step in which the abovementioned server device transmits the abovementioned specified pattern data extracted in the abovementioned extraction step to the abovementioned mobile communications terminal.",
        "There are many computer viruses that depend on the conditions of the mobile communications terminal, such as the hardware and software of the mobile communications terminal, the data received by the mobile communications terminal (including application programs), and the like. Furthermore, the quantity of pattern data that can be received, the quantity of pattern data that can be stored and the quantity of pattern data that can be compared vary depending on the conditions of the mobile communications terminal such as the hardware and software of the mobile communications terminal. By extracting specified pattern data on the basis of terminal information such as the hardware or software of the mobile communications terminal, the history of data reception in the mobile communications terminal or the like, and transmitting the specified data that is thus extracted to the mobile communications terminal, it is possible to achieve an efficient reduction in the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted to the mobile communications terminal from the server device, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the mobile communications terminal, and the quantity of pattern data that is compared by the mobile communications terminal, in accordance with the conditions of this mobile communications terminal.",

Then, from the pattern data database 41c shown in FIG. 19, \u201cpattern data 1\u201d is extracted as pattern data for a computer virus in which \u201capplication program 1\u201d is the object of detection, and \u201cpattern data 2\u201d is extracted as pattern data for a computer virus in which \u201capplication program 2\u201d is the object of detection.",
        "Next, while reference is made to the application program database 41a of the storage unit 41, a judgement is made by the pattern data transmitting unit 44 as to whether or not the respective application programs extracted by the pattern data extraction unit 43 are present in the server device 40. Here, in the case of application programs that are not present in the server device 40, it cannot be detected whether or not a computer virus is contained in the server device. Accordingly, in the case of pattern data for computer viruses in which application programs that are not present in the server device 40 are the object of detection, this pattern data is transmitted to the portable telephone 100 (S408). Furthermore, in the case of pattern data for computer viruses in which application programs that are present in the server device 40 are the object of detection, this pattern data is not transmitted to the portable telephone 100. Subsequently, the process of S410 through S416 is similar to the processing of S110 through S116 described with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "Meanwhile, in the case of application programs that are present in the server device 40, it can be detected whether or not a computer virus is contained in the server device 40. Accordingly, it is detected by the patter data comparing unit 45 whether or not a computer virus is contained (S418). To describe this in greater detail, the pattern data extracted by the pattern data extraction unit 43 is compared with the application programs, and a judgement is made as to whether or not the application programs have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data. Here, in cases where the application programs have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that a computer virus is contained in these application programs, while in cases where the application programs do not have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that no computer virus is contained in these application programs.",
        "For example, in a case where the two application programs \u201capplication program 1\u201d and \u201capplication program 2\u201d are extracted by the pattern data extraction unit 43, it is found that \u201capplication program 2\u201d is not present in the server device 40 when reference is made to the application program database 41a shown in FIG. 18. Accordingly, \u201cpattern data 2\u201d, which is pattern data for a computer virus in which \u201capplication program 2\u201d is the object of detection is transmitted to the portable telephone 100. On the other hand, since \u201capplication program 1\u201d is present in the server device 40, \u201cpattern data 1\u201d, which is pattern data for a computer virus in which \u201capplication program 1\u201d is the object of detection, is not transmitted to the portable telephone 100, and this \u201cpattern data 1\u201d is used by the pattern data comparing unit 45 of the server device 40 to detect whether or not a computer virus is contained in \u201capplication program 1\u201d.",
        "In cases where it is judged by the pattern data comparing unit 45 that a computer virus is contained in a specified application program, processing that sends a warning to the manager of the server device 40, processing that prohibits downloading of the application program in question, processing that deletes this application program or the like is performed by the computer virus processing unit 46 on the basis of predetermined set information (S420). Furthermore, in cases where it is judged by the pattern data comparing unit 45 that a computer virus is contained in a specified application program, a warning indicating that a computer virus is contained in this specified application program is transmitted to the portable telephone 100 from the computer virus processing unit 46 (S422), and this warning is received by the computer virus processing unit 115 of the portable telephone 100 (S424).",
        "In the portable telephone 100, when the abovementioned warning is received by the portable telephone 100, processing that sends a warning to the user of the portable telephone 100, processing that prohibits execution of the application program in question, processing that repairs this application program or the like is performed by the computer virus processing unit 115 on the basis of predetermined set information (S426).",
        "Next, the effects and merits of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described. In the information transmitting system 4 of the present embodiment, as in the information transmitting system 3 of the abovementioned third embodiment, specified pattern data is extracted on the basis of the downloading history of application programs in the portable telephone 100, and the specified pattern data thus extracted is transmitted to the portable telephone 100.

Accordingly, in the case of application programs that are present in the server device, pattern data that is used to detect whether or not a computer virus is contained in the application programs need not be transmitted to the portable telephone 100. As a result, the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device 40 to the portable telephone 100, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the portable telephone 100 and the quantity of data that is compared by the portable telephone 100 can be further reduced.",

        "Furthermore, in the information transmitting system 7 of the present embodiment, the server device 70 receives computer virus detection information from the portable telephone, and in cases where the number of times that such computer virus detection information data is received reaches a number that is equal to or greater than a predetermined fixed number, a warning is transmitted to portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission. Accordingly, the portable telephones can be warned regarding a widely spread computer virus.",
        "Here, the information transmitting system 7 of the present embodiment extracts specified pattern data on the basis of the model name of the portable telephone 100, and transmits the specified pattern data that is thus extracted to the portable telephone 100. However, it would also be possible to devise this system so that specified pattern data extracted on the basis of the memory capacity, operating system, downloading history of application programs or the like is transmitted to the portable telephone 100 as described in the respective embodiments described above.",
        "Furthermore, in the information transmitting systems of the respective embodiments described above, it would also be possible to devise the system so that pattern data that has already been utilized by the portable telephone 100 (i.e., pattern data for which comparative processing has been completed) is deleted. By deleting pattern data that has already been utilized, it is possible to utilize the memory of the portable telephone 100 in an effective manner. In regard to the deletion of pattern data, the following aspects maybe indicated. For example, the deletion of pattern data may be performed for a portion of the pattern data rather than for all of the pattern data. Furthermore, the deletion of pattern data may be initiated when an effective deadline set beforehand for the pattern data has passed, or may be initiated after a fixed period of time has elapsed following the completion of comparative processing. Furthermore, the deletion of pattern data may also be initiated by instructions from the server device or by instructions from the user of the portable telephone. Moreover, this deletion may be initiated following the detection of computer viruses or following the completion of repair processing.",
        "Furthermore, the constituent elements of the information transmitting systems of the respective embodiments described above are physically disposed in a single server device; however, it would also be possible to physically disperse these constituent elements among a plurality of server devices. For example, in the server device 20 of the second embodiment, it would be possible to devise the system so that the pattern data extraction unit 23 and terminal information database 21a are present in physically different server devices, and so that the pattern data extraction unit 23 sends inquiries regarding terminal information to physically different server devices.",
        "In the server device, information transmitting system and information transmitting method of the present invention, when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted to a mobile communications terminal, specified pattern data is extracted on the basis of terminal information such as the hardware or software of the mobile communications terminal, the reception history of data in the mobile communications terminal or the like, and the specified pattern data that is thus extracted is transmitted to the mobile communications terminal. Accordingly, the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device to the mobile communications terminal, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the mobile communications terminal, and the quantity of pattern data that is compared by the mobile communications terminal, can be efficiently reduced in accordance with the conditions of this mobile communications terminal. As a result, the detection of computer viruses in the mobile communications terminal can be accomplished in an efficient manner."
