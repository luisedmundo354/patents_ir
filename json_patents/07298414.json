        "The present invention relates generally to digital cameras, and more specifically, to the use of retroreflected eye focus measurements to autofocus a digital camera.",
        "Autofocus has become a standard feature on both film and digital cameras. Despite years of innovation and development, autofocus still has several problems that often result in out-of-focus images.",
        "The biggest issue is user intent. In a scene with objects at multiple distances, the camera must choose which part of the image the user would like to be in focus. The conventional solution is to focus on center region of the image, assuming the subject is in the center. This technique fails in the classic case of two people standing side-by-side, with the camera focusing on the background between them.",
        "In addition, conventional autofocus techniques on digital cameras are also slow, power-hungry, and inaccurate in low contrast or low light conditions.",
        "One sophisticated approach to the problem of user intent for autofocus is the use of eye tracking. As a user looks into the viewfinder, an IR emitter and detector array track where the user is looking while framing the shot. The camera then uses an autofocus zone or spot at that position in the scene. An autofocus algorithm then proceeds conventionally, using the image as seen through the camera lens. However, this solution still suffers from the speed, power, and accuracy issues of conventional autofocus.",
        "Prior art relating to the present invention is as follows.",

The focus of the image may be varied to allow for different user profiles or to relieve the stress of maintaining a fixed focus over a prolonged period of time. Optionally, the ocular projection display (12) can include a location and distance sensor (46) for identifying the location of the user's eyes for proper aiming of the image to the eyes of the user and focus detection circuitry (54) to correct for the user's focusing abilities.\u201d",

The anamorphic lens system transmits the illumination light from the light source to an illumination light exit surface positioned away from the optical axis of the observing optical system, and the illumination light is projected toward the position of the user's eye from the illumination light exit surface to separate signals from the image of the eye and an image formed by eyeglasses, if worn. The illumination light exit surface is a rectangular window having a longitudinal side parallel to longitudinal side of a field of view of the observing optical system, and is positioned below the position of a user's eye.\u201d",

        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,394,602 discloses an \u201coptical instrument, such as a microscope or a camera, is provided for forming a viewable image of an object. The optical instrument comprises an objective lens for forming the viewable image at an image plane, an eye sensor for sensing the direction of gaze of a user viewing the viewable image and means for controlling a controllable function of the optical instrument in dependence upon the sensed direction of gaze.

        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,216 discloses \u201cApparatus and method are provided for assessing the direction of fixation of an eye by detecting polarization-related changes in light retroreflected from the fundus of the eye. Nerve fibers in the retina of the eye are birefringent and alter the polarization state of light traversing them as a function of their orientation. The nerve fibers are arrayed in a characteristic pattern in the retina, specifically radiating outward from the fovea and converging to the optic nerve head. By assessment of polarization-related changes in retroreflected light from multiple retinal areas either sequentially or simultaneously, characteristic birefringence signatures of portions of the retina can be identified which are used to assess the direction of fixation of the eye. In addition, interference from the corneal birefringence is reduced by using incident light having a polarization state that is substantially independent of meridional direction. Circularly polarized light or non-polarized light is used for the assessment. Interference from the corneal birefringence is reduced still further by detecting polarization-related changes that are substantially independent of the meridional direction of the corneal birefringence. This is accomplished by detecting changes in ellipticity by measuring solely the Stokes parameter S3 or by measuring any two Stokes parameters. An alternative is measuring the overall intensity of the retroreflected light when the dichroism of the lutein pigment particles in the vicinity of the fovea is used for the assessment.\u201d",
        "However, none of the prior art references discloses or suggests using retroreflected eye focus measurements to measure the focus distance of the eye, and use this distance to set the focus of the camera.",
        "It is an objective of the present invention to provide for a digital camera, viewfinder apparatus and methods that use retroreflected eye focus measurements to provide autofocus, and that improves over conventional implementations.",
        "To accomplish the above and other objectives, the present invention provides for viewfinder apparatus, digital cameras and methods that provide autofocus using retroreflected eye focus measurements. When a user looks at a part of a scene that is the intended subject of the image, the eye is correctly focused on that point. Rather than tracking the position of the eye, the present invention measures the focus distance of the eye, and then uses this distance to set the focus of the camera. The camera does not detect the focus of the scene to determine focus.",
        "Like the eye-tracking technique described in the Background section, the problem of user intent is solved. In addition, the present invention takes advantage of the superior autofocus capability of the human eye. The present invention is faster, more accurate, and more robust in low contrast and low light conditions than conventional electronic autofocus systems.",
        "In addition, the present invention can be used advantageously for video recording. Other techniques which use the camera's lens and sensor for focusing require the lens to \u201chunt around\u201d the point of best focus, resulting in video images which are periodically out of focus. The present invention avoids this problem by \u201chunting around\u201d to find the focus distance of the user's eye, without disrupting the focus of the camera lens.",

        "FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary method in accordance with the principles of the present invention.",
        "Referring to the sole drawing figures, FIG. 1 illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of autofocus apparatus 10 (digital camera autofocus apparatus 10) in accordance with the principles of the present invention for use with a digital camera 20. The first exemplary embodiment of the digital camera autofocus apparatus 10 focuses a retroreflected image of a scene 15.",
        "The first exemplary embodiment of the digital camera autofocus apparatus 10 comprises a viewfinder 11 through which a user looks using his or her eye 16. The viewfinder 11 comprises a selectively movable area array image sensor 12, a selectively movable optical element 13 or lens 13, and a beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14 disposed along an optical axis. A user views an image scene or target 15 through the beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14.",
        "When a user looks at a part of a scene that is the intended subject of the image, the user's eye 16 is correctly focused on that point. Rather than tracking the position of the eye 16, the present autofocus apparatus 10 measures the focus distance of the eye 16, and uses this distance to set the focus of the camera 20. The camera 20 does not detect the focus of the scene.",
        "Eye-focus sensing elements comprising the sensor 12, movable optical element 13 or lens 13, and beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14 are built into the viewfinder 11. It is simplest to imagine a reflex viewfinder 11 that does not contain any magnifying or focusing elements that would modify the user's view of the scene 15. The user views the scene 15 normally, and his or her eye 16 naturally focuses on the subject of interest.",
        "The first exemplary embodiment of the autofocus apparatus 10 measures the focus distance of the eye 16 using a retroreflected image of the scene 15. As is shown in FIG. 1, the lens 13 and/or the image sensor 12 are moved until the image of the scene 15 projected on the retina 16a of the eye 16 is in focus on the sensor 12. The displacement of the lens 13 and/or sensor 12 provides a measure of the focus distance of the eye 16. The camera 20 is focused at a distance that is related to the displacement of the lens 13 and/or sensor 12 when the image on the retina 16a is in focus.",
        "Setting the focus distance of the camera lens from the autofocus data derived from the measured focus distance of the eye may be done by several ways. One exemplary method is to use a pre-stored table, which maps displacements of the movable elements in the viewfinder apparatus described above to the appropriate displacements of the camera lens. This table may be generated as part of a factory calibration procedure, thus compensating for manufacturing variations in both the viewfinder and camera elements. Alternatively, the displacement of the camera lens can be derived from the displacement of the viewfinder elements by processing 35 via a mathematical formula.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of digital camera autofocus apparatus 10a in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The second exemplary embodiment of the autofocus apparatus 10a comprises a selectively movable area array image sensor 12, a selectively movable optical element 13 or lens 13, a first beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14, and a second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a, each of which are disposed along a first optical axis. An infrared light emitting diode illuminator 17 is disposed along a second optical axis that intersects the second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror.",
        "The second exemplary embodiment of digital camera autofocus apparatus 10a works in low-light situations and projects a near-infrared image of an image 15 or target 15 into the eye 16 through the second beamsplitter 14a as is shown in FIG. 2. The retroreflected image of the target 15 is sensed by the infrared image sensor 12. As discussed with reference to FIG. 1, the lens 13 and/or sensor 12 are moved until the image of the target 15 projected on the retina 16a is in focus, and the displacement of the lens 13 and/or sensor 12 is a measure of the focus distance of the eye 16.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates a third exemplary embodiment of digital camera autofocus apparatus 10b in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The third exemplary embodiment of the autofocus apparatus 10b comprises a selectively movable area array image sensor 12, a selectively movable optical element 13 or lens 13, a first beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14, a second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a, each of which are disposed along a first optical axis.",
        "An infrared light emitting diode illuminator 17 is disposed along a second optical axis that intersects the second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror. An astigmatic element 18 is interposed along the second optical axis between the infrared light emitting diode illuminator 17 and the second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a.",
        "The third exemplary autofocus apparatus 10b is a variation that borrows from focus tracking techniques used on optical discs. The astigmatic element 18 is introduced in the infrared optical path as is shown in FIG. 3. As a result, the shape of a retroreflected spot or target 15 depends on the focus distance of the eye 16. This is used to generate a bipolar focus signal that is produced by the sensor 12. Bipolar focus signals have the advantage that the position of best focus is known (when balanced) and so tracking focus in real-time is easier and more robust.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a fourth and perhaps best exemplary embodiment of digital camera autofocus apparatus 10c in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The fourth exemplary embodiment of the autofocus apparatus 10c comprises a tilted area array image sensor 12, an optical element 13 or lens 13, a first beamsplitter 14 or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14, a second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a, each of which are disposed along a first optical axis. An infrared light emitting diode illuminator 17 is disposed along a second optical axis that intersects the second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a.",
        "The fourth exemplary autofocus apparatus 10c produces a retroreflected pattern that contains a series of targets 15 at various focus depths. One way this may be accomplished is by inclining a target reticule 19 disposed between the illuminator 17 and the second beamsplitter 14a or angled partially reflective, partially transmissive mirror 14a, and inclining the sensor 12 to match the change in conjugate distance as is shown in FIG. 4. The retroreflected image has one area of the inclined target 15 in best focus. This generates near instantaneous focus measurement data and eliminates the need for moving the lens 13 or sensor 12.",
        "Again it is assumed that the reflex viewfinder 11 that does not contain any optical elements that would modify the user's focus on the scene. It is possible to use any of these above-described techniques with convention optical viewfinders 11, including zooming viewfinders 11. Care must be taken to compensate for changes in focus distance introduced by the optical power on the viewfinder 11.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary method 30 in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The exemplary method 30 comprises the following steps.",
        "A user of a digital camera 20 views 31 an image scene 15 through a viewfinder 11. The image scene 15 is retroreflected 32 from the user's eye 16. The retroreflected image scene is focused 33 onto an image sensor 12. Data relating to the focused retroreflected image is processed 34 to determine the focus distance of the eye 16. Data associated with the focus distance of the eye 16 is processed 35 to focus the digital camera 20 on the image scene 15.",
        "Additional detailed methods address operation of the various components of the above-described apparatus relating to movement of lens 13 or sensor 12. These methods should be readily apparent from reading the first part of this Detailed Description and will not be discussed in detail.",
