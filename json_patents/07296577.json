        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to intravascular prostheses for remodeling an extravascular anatomical structure.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of many different disease processes that impair myocardial function, such as coronary artery disease and hypertension. The left ventricle enlarges and the ejection fraction is reduced. The resulting increase in pulmonary venous pressure and reduction in cardiac output cause congestive heart failure. Enlargement of the mitral annulus and left ventricular cavity produce mitral valvular insufficiency. This in turn, causes volume overload that exacerbates the myopathy, leading to a vicious cycle of progressive enlargement and worsening mitral regurgitation.",
        "According to recent estimates, more than 79,000 patients are diagnosed with aortic and mitral valve disease in U.S. hospitals each year. More than 49,000 mitral valve or aortic valve replacement procedures are performed annually in the U.S., along with a significant number of heart valve repair procedures.",
        "Various surgical techniques have been developed to repair a diseased or damaged valve. One repair technique which has been shown to be effective in treating incompetence, particularly of the mitral and tricuspid valves, is annuloplasty, in which the effective size of the valve annulus is contracted by attaching a prosthetic annuloplasty ring to the endocardial surface of the heart around the valve annulus. The annuloplasty ring comprises an inner substrate of a metal such as stainless steel or titanium, or a flexible material such as silicone rubber or Dacron cordage, covered with a biocompatible fabric or cloth to allow the ring to be sutured to the heart tissue. The annuloplasty ring may be stiff or flexible, may be split or continuous, and may have a variety of shapes, including circular, D-shaped, C-shaped, or kidney-shaped. Examples are seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,917,698, 5,061,277, 5,290,300, 5,350,420, 5,104,407, 5,064,431, 5,201,880, and 5,041,130, which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Annuloplasty rings may also be utilized in combination with other repair techniques such as resection, in which a portion of a valve leaflet is excised, the remaining portions of the leaflet are sewn back together, and a prosthetic annuloplasty ring is then attached to the valve annulus to maintain the contracted size of the valve. Other valve repair techniques in current use include commissurotomy (cutting the valve commissures to separate fused valve leaflets), shortening mitral or tricuspid valve chordae tendonae, reattachment of severed mitral or tricuspid valve chordae tendonae or papillary muscle tissue, and decalcification of the valve leaflets or annulus. Annuloplasty rings may be used in conjunction with any repair procedures where contracting or stabilizing the valve annulus might be desirable.",
        "Although mitral valve repair and replacement can successfully treat many patients with mitral valvular insufficiency, techniques currently in use are attended by significant morbidity and mortality. Most valve repair and replacement procedures require a thoracotomy, usually in the form of a median stemotomy, to gain access into the patient's thoracic cavity. A saw or other cutting instrument is used to cut the sternum longitudinally, allowing the two opposing halves of the anterior or ventral portion of the rib cage to be spread apart. A large opening into the thoracic cavity is thus created, through which the surgical team may directly visualize and operate upon the heart and other thoracic contents. Alternatively, a thoracotomy may be performed on a lateral side of the chest, wherein a large incision is made generally parallel to the ribs, and the ribs are spread apart and/or removed in the region of the incision to create a large enough opening to facilitate the surgery.",
        "Surgical intervention within the heart generally requires isolation of the heart and coronary blood vessels from the remainder of the arterial system, and arrest of cardiac function. Usually, the heart is isolated from the arterial system by introducing an external aortic cross-clamp through a sternotomy and applying it to the aorta to occlude the aortic lumen between the brachiocephalic artery and the coronary ostia. Cardioplegic fluid is then injected into the coronary arteries, either directly into the coronary ostia or through a puncture in the ascending aorta, to arrest cardiac function. The patient is placed on extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass to maintain peripheral circulation of oxygenated blood.",
        "Of particular interest in the present application are techniques for the repair and replacement of the mitral valve. The mitral valve, located between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, is most easily reached through the wall of the left atrium, which normally resides on the posterior side of the heart, opposite the side of the heart that is exposed by a median sternotomy. Therefore, to access the mitral valve via a sternotomy, the heart is rotated to bring the left atrium into an anterior position. An opening, or atriotomy, is then made in the right side of the left atrium, anterior to the right pulmonary veins. The atriotomy is retracted by means of sutures or a retraction device, exposing the mitral valve adjacent to the atriotomy. One of the previously identified techniques may then be used to repair or replace the valve.",
        "An alternative technique for mitral valve access has been used when a median sternotomy and/or rotational manipulation of the heart are inappropriate. In this technique, a thoracotomy is made in the right lateral side of the chest, usually in the region of the fourth or fifth intercostal space. One or more ribs may be removed from the patient, and other ribs near the incision are retracted outward to create a large opening into the thoracic cavity. The left atrium is then exposed on the posterior side of the heart, and an atriotomy is formed in the wall of the left atrium, through which the mitral valve may be accessed for repair or replacement.",
        "Using such open-chest techniques, the large opening provided by a median stemotomy or right thoracotomy enables the surgeon to see the mitral valve directly through the left atriotomy, and to position his or her hands within the thoracic cavity in close proximity to the exterior of the heart for cannulation of the aorta and/or coronary arteries to induce cardioplegia, manipulation of surgical instruments, removal of excised tissue, and introduction of an annuloplasty ring or a replacement valve through atriotomy for attachment within the heart.",
        "Mitral valve surgery, including mitral annuloplasty, is usually applied to patients with intrinsic disease of the mitral apparatus. As described, above, these patients may have scarring, retraction, tears or fusion of valve leaflets as well as disorders of the subvalvular apparatus. Definitive repair requires direct visualization of the valve.",
        "Patients who develop mitral regurgitation as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy do not always have intrinsic mitral valve disease. Regurgitation occurs as the result of the leaflets being moved back from each other by the dilated annulus. The ventricle enlarges and becomes spherical, pulling the papillary muscles and chordae away from the plane of the valve and further enlarging the regurgitant orifice. In these patients, correction of the regurgitation does not require repair of the valve leaflets themselves, but simply a reduction in the size of the annulus and the sphericity of the left ventricle.",
        "Mitral annuloplasty without repair of the leaflets or chordae has been shown to be effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who are refractory to conventional medical therapy. Dr. Steve Bolling, at The University of Michigan and coworkers have operated on a cohort of such patients with New York Heart Association Class II and IV symptoms. Average symptom severity decreased from 3.9 preoperatively to 2.0 after surgery. Hemodynamics and ejection fraction improved significantly. Other investigators have achieved similar results as well. However, the morbidity, risks and expense of surgical annuloplasty are very high in patients with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Thus, a variety of new techniques for the treatment of congestive heart failure are being explored as adjuncts to drug therapy.",
        "Several cardiac restraint devices have been described. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,343 to Alfemess discloses a cardiac reinforcement device that is applied as a jacket over the epicardium in order to limit diastolic expansion. However, this requires an open chest operation to implant and does not directly affect the diameter of the mitral annulus. Another approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,440 to Schweich, et al., in which tension members are placed through opposite walls of the heart such that they span the ventricle. Less invasive and \u201cminimally\u201d invasive techniques for valve repair and replacement continue to evolve, both on a stopped heart and on a beating heart. These techniques may provide some benefits over open chest procedures, but they are still attended by significant morbidity and mortality risks.",
        "A need therefore remains for methods and devices for treating mitral valvular insufficiency, which are attended by significantly lower morbidity and mortality rates than are the current techniques, and therefore would be well suited to treat patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Optimally, the procedure can be accomplished through a percutaneous, transluminal approach, using simple, implantable devices which do not depend upon prosthetic valve leaflets or other moving parts.",
        "There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention a medical apparatus for remodeling a mitral valve annulus adjacent to the coronary sinus.

        "In one embodiment, the body comprises a tubular wall. In another embodiment, the tubular wall is substantially noncompressible along a first side of the central section.

The device exerts compressive force on the mitral annulus and left ventricle, reducing the severity of mitral regurgitation and the size of the left ventricular cavity. The device thus enables reduction of the mitral annulus and constraint of the diastolic expansion of the left ventricle yet without the morbidity and other risks associated with open chest surgery. Additional details are disclosed in the parent application, Ser. No. 10/066,302, filed on Jan. 30, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.",
        "The present inventors have determined that the coronary sinus and veins provide an ideal conduit for the positioning of an intravascular prosthesis, or implant, for remodeling the mitral annulus, since they are positioned adjacent the mitral annulus and interventricular septum. As used herein, the term \u201cimplant\u201d is a broad term, and should not be limited to a permanently introduced structure or device, but could additionally be a temporarily introduced device. The coronary sinus is contained within the atrioventricular groove, and is in close proximity to the posterior, lateral and anterior aspects of the mitral annulus. The coronary sinus and coronary veins are cannulated currently during any of a variety of percutaneous transvenous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Permanent placement of pacemaker and defibrillator leads within the coronary sinus and veins is both safe and well tolerated.",
        "The annuloplasty system consists of several components. Desirably, there is a delivery system intended to be introduced percutaneously into a central vein such as the internal jugular, subclavian or femoral veins and to cannulate the coronary sinus. The implant of the present invention is deployed from the delivery system, preferably a delivery catheter, into the coronary venous system or into a position within or adjacent the myocardium, to influence the annulus of the mitral valve. Additional tools may be placed through or along the delivery catheter to position the device, apply elements in place, and to control and/or cut tensioning elements (if provided) from the delivery system, as will be discussed in detail below.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a schematic view of the heart 10, having a preferred embodiment of a mitral annuloplasty and cardiac reinforcement device 40 positioned therein. The heart 10 generally comprises a right atrium 12, in communication with the superior vena cava 14 and inferior vena cava 16. The left ventricle 18 is positioned below the left atrial appendage 20. Relevant portions of the coronary vasculature include the coronary sinus 22, which extends from the ostium 24 to the junction 26 of the coronary sinus and the great cardiac vein 28. There may be anastomotic connections 29 between the great cardiac vein 28 and the middle cardiac vein 30, as is well understood in the art.",
        "One embodiment of a mitral annuloplasty and cardiac reinforcement device 40 is illustrated generally in the coronary sinus 22. In particular, the device 40 extends from a proximal end 42 to a distal end 44. The proximal end 42 lies against the posterior aspect of the interatrial septum 46. The midportion 48 of the device 40 is positioned within the coronary sinus 22. The transitional section 50 of the device 40 lies at the junction 26 of the coronary sinus 22 and the great cardiac vein 28. The distal end 44 of the device 40 is lodged in the great cardiac vein 28.",
        "The transitional region 50 is designed to reside in the proximal portion of the great cardiac vein 28. By deflecting out of a plane defined by the coronary sinus 22, it serves as an anchor 52 and prevents the device 40 from slipping out of the coronary sinus 22 when tension is applied. This embodiment of an anchor 52 is, preferably, very flaccid and flexible, thereby minimizing the risk of erosion of the device 40 through the wall of the great cardiac vein or other aspect of the coronary venous system. The proximal end 42 of the device 40 lies outside the ostium 24 of the coronary sinus 22 and is desirably curved upward so as to anchor against the posterior aspect of the interatrial septum 46. Advantageously, the proximal end 42 of the illustrated device 40 is semicircular in shape and elliptical in profile so that no edges will promote erosion of adjacent tissue.",
        "As an alternative anchor 52 to the distal extension of the device 40, any of a variety of structures may be provided. In general, the deployed device 40 will contact the wall of the coronary sinus 22 along the inside radius of its arcuate path. Thus, a tissue contacting surface 54 on the concave side of the deployed device 40 may be provided with any of a variety of friction enhancing surface structures, such as a plurality of transverse ridges, teeth or other projections, or modified surface textures to enhance friction. Alternatively, tissue engaging or piercing structures such as barbs may be provided on the surface 54 to engage the wall of the coronary sinus 22 to resist movement of the device 40, as will be discussed.",
        "While use of such structures as anchors may provide some benefit in certain applications, embodiments herein shown and described are believed to be particularly useful in one aspect specifically because they operate without the need for such aggressive tissue engagement. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill based upon this disclosure that the present embodiments provide independent device manipulation and shape control that allow for sufficient forces to be applied to the mitral valve without requiring the possibly harmful effects of puncturing and grabbing tissue within the sinus for the remodeling process. In one regard, the independent action of a barbless design allows for adjustment in both the tightening and loosening directions with reduced risk of significant tissue damage or erosion. In another regard, devices 40 according to at least certain embodiments beneficially maintains its length throughout its modified range of shapes while the sinus and adjacent valve annulus reduce their dimensions under the force of remodeling. In still a further regard, the independent action and lack of tissue piercing and grabbing anchors allow for the device to be removed from the patient after initial implantation within the sinus, such as for example in the event of complications or in applications intended to be temporary remedial measures, such as for bridging a patient to surgery. Further to this regard, various shapes and sizes of devices may be required in a given patient before the appropriate one is found according to the observed in vivo response to implantation.",
        "The specific dimensions, construction details and materials for the mitral annuloplasty and cardiac reinforcement device 40 can be varied widely, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. For example, dimensional adjustments may be made to accommodate different anatomical sizes and configurations. Materials and construction details can be varied to accommodate different tensioning mechanisms and other considerations.",
        "In general, the device 40 defines an overall length from proximal end 42 to distal end 44. Preferably, the length is within the range of from about 2 cm to about 10 cm in an embodiment such as that illustrated in FIG. 2 in which the anchor 52 comprises a distal extension of the body 66 for lodging within the great cardiac vein 28. One embodiment of the device 40 includes an elongate flexible body 66 about eight centimeters in length. In such an embodiment, the body 66 may be elliptical in cross section so that it will bend in a single plane when force is applied to the tensioning element within it, as will be discussed below. Distally the device 40 tapers and transitions to a round cross-section.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2A-B, there is illustrated an embodiment of the device 40 having a forming element 56, such as a wire, therein. Manipulation of the forming element 56 allows the device to be moved from a flexible orientation to enable percutaneous insertion into the vascular system and navigation into the coronary sinus (FIG. 2B), to an arcuate configuration for compressing at least a portion of the mitral annulus (FIG. 2A). The device 40 may be advanced from the first, flexible configuration to the second, arcuate configuration by either axial proximal retraction or distal advancement of the forming element 56 with respect to the body 66, depending upon the particular design.",
        "In general, the device 40 comprises an elongate flexible support 58, extending from a proximal end 42 at least as far as a point of attachment 60. The support 58 may be a portion of the body 66 or may be a distinct component as will be discussed. The support 58 has a fixed length, and is substantially axially non-compressible and non-expandable. Thus, proximal axial retraction of the forming element 56 relative to the proximal end of the support 58 will desirably cause the support 58 to deflect in a first direction, tending to bend the body 66 about an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the body 66. Distal axial advancement of the forming element 56 with respect to the support 58 will cause lateral deflection of the support 58 in a second direction, tending to permit the body 66 to straighten due to the inherent resiliency of the support 58. This basic steering configuration can be embodied in many forms, which can be optimized by those of skill in the art to suit a particular construction for the body 66 depending upon the desired dimensions and clinical performance.",
        "The forming element 56 extends from the proximal end 42 through the device 40 to the point of attachment 60. At the point of attachment 60, the forming element 56 is mechanically coupled, and preferably, directly coupled to the support 58. Alternatively, other suitable methods of attachment may be used. A proximal extension 64 of the forming element 56 extends from the proximal end 42 of the device 40, such as through an aperture 62. Proximal retraction of the forming element 56 through the aperture 62 causes the device 40 to bend from an implantation, or delivery orientation, for navigating the coronary vasculature during implantation, to a formed, or remodeling orientation for compression and constraint of the coronary sinus 22 and adjacent structures.",
        "In the formed, remodeling orientation, the device 40 preferably provides a compressive force against the mitral annulus as has been discussed. This is desirably accomplished by forming the device into an arcuate configuration. Generally, the best fit curve of constant radius to which the formed device conforms has a radius within the range of from about 1.0 cm to about 2.0 cm. The forming element may comprise any of a variety of materials and constructions, such as a polymeric or metal wire or strand, a multi-filament braided or woven line, a metal or polymeric ribbon, or other structure capable of retaining the device 40 under tension in the coronary sinus 22.",
        "The device 40 further comprises a support 58, which may be the body 66 of the device 40 or a separate element positioned therein. In an embodiment in which the support 58 is a separate element contained within the device 40, support 58 may comprise any of a variety of generally axially non-compressible elements such as a metal or polymeric wire or column, ribbon, or \u201cbottomed out\u201d (e.g., fully compressed) spring which facilitates lateral bending but inhibits axial compression upon proximal retraction of forming element 56. A metal ribbon comprising stainless steel, nitinol, or other known materials may be desired in certain embodiments, due to its ability to influence the plane of curvature of the device 40 when in the formed orientation.",
        "In the presently illustrated embodiment, the proximal extension 64 of the forming element 56 extends proximally throughout the length of a deployment catheter, to a control or free end which remains outside of the patient during the deployment procedure. Following placement of the device 40 in the coronary sinus, proximal traction on the proximal extension 64 will reconfigure the device 40 into the formed orientation within the coronary sinus, as will be discussed in connection with the method of use of preferred embodiments. After a sufficient tension has been placed on the coronary sinus 22, the forming element 56 is preferably locked in a fixed axial position with respect to the device 40, to resist distal movement of the forming element 56 through aperture 62. Any of a variety of suitable lock arrangements may be provided. Preferably, the lock 70 is provided on or near the proximal end 42, and, in particular, at or about the aperture 62. The lock may comprise any of a variety of structures, such as a suture knot, locking clamp or ring, an interference fit, ratchet and pawl structures, threaded engagement, an adhesive bond, or a compression fit, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.",
        "The lock 70 (on any of the embodiments herein) may be initially disengaged, so that the forming element 56 may be retracted or advanced freely through the aperture 62 while the physician adjusts the tension on the device 40. After the desired tension is achieved, the lock 70 is activated to engage the forming element in a manner which will depend upon the lock design. Alternatively, the lock 70 may be biased into an engaged configuration, such as with ratchet or cam structures, so that the forming element can only be retracted proximally. Preferably, however, the lock will allow the forming element to be released so that the physician can release tension on the device 40 in the event of momentary over tightening.",
        "The forming element 56 and support 58, with or without the tubular body discussed below, may be surrounded by a tubular jacket of ePTFE or a polyester fabric such as DACRON, or other material which is wrapped or stitched onto the forming element 56 to produce the final device 40. As a further alternative, the subassembly which includes the forming element 56, and, if present, support 58 may be positioned within a suitable length of tubing formed such as by extrusion. The tubing may be drawn down to a reduced diameter at the distal end 44. Additional post extrusion steps may be used to produce the desired cross-sectional configuration. Manufacturing techniques for the present invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.",
        "Any of a variety of additional features may be added to the device 40, depending upon the desired clinical performance. For example, the outside surface of the body 66 may be provided with any of a variety of coatings, such as poly-paraxylene, sold under the trademark PARALENE, PTFE or others to improve lubricity; heparin or other antithrombogenic agents; elastomers such as silicone, neoprene, latex or others to soften the surface and reduce the risk of trauma to the vascular intima, and the like. Adhesion enhancing surfaces may be provided, such as ePTFE patches or jackets, to promote cellular ingrowth for long term anchoring. In addition, depending upon the deployment system design, the body 66 may be provided with a guidewire lumen extending axially therethrough, to allow the body 66 to be advanced distally over a guidewire during placement at the treatment site.",
        "The device 40 may be implanted within the coronary sinus 22 either through direct surgical (e.g., thoracotomy, with or without sternotomy) access, such as in combination with another surgical procedure, via port access, or remotely by way of a percutaneous or surgical cut down access to the venous system. Preferably, the device 40 is implanted in a transluminal procedure, such as by way of a percutaneous access at one of the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins.",
        "FIGS. 3-8B illustrate an exemplary device assembly 200. In general, FIG. 3 is an overall view of assembly 200 that includes a delivery assembly 210 engaged to a prosthesis, or implant 250. According to similar overall delivery systems and methods elsewhere herein described, prosthesis 250 is adapted to be delivered in a first condition and shape into a vessel at least in part by manipulation of delivery assembly 210. Once in the desired region of the target vessel, prosthesis 250 is adapted to be adjusted to a second condition and shape within the vessel in order to influence an adjacent tissue structure. As also elsewhere herein described, a particularly beneficial mode of such operation places the prosthesis 250 within a coronary sinus for the purpose of influencing a mitral valve annulus, more specifically in order to influence the shape of the annulus in order to reduce mitral valve regurgitation.",
        "FIGS. 4-7 show the proximal aspects of device assembly 200, and in particular various details for delivery assembly 210 that includes an outer member 215 that is preferably tubular with an inner lumen 216 that is preferably sized to house an inner member 225. Inner member 225 in the variation shown is generally tubular and is substantially free to rotate within lumen 216, preferably by providing rotational force to inner member 225 proximally outside of the patient's body. According to the example shown, this rotational force is applied to inner member 225 via a thumbwheel 205 that is provided on proximal hub assembly 201 coupled to proximal end portion 211 of delivery assembly 210. Thumbwheel 205 is rotationally coupled to inner member 225 within hub assembly 201, which rotational coupling may be achieved according to a number of adaptations as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill.",
        "Rotation of inner member 225 is transmitted into rotation of a rotational coupler 280 that is engaged within a proximal end portion 252 of prosthesis 250 as follows. Inner member 225 has an aperture 228 on its distal end portion that provides a female counterpart of a mated key interface between the inner member 225 and a male counterpart, desirably provided by a shaped proximal end 281 of a rotational coupler 280 that is also rotationally engaged within a proximal end portion 252 of prosthesis 250. The keyed fitting between inner member 225 and rotational coupler 280 allows for transmission of rotational forces to rotational coupler 280. In order to maintain releasable axial engagement of this keyed coupling, a flexible member such as a filament 240 is looped through an aperture 283 through proximal end 281 of rotational coupler 280 with both filament ends 242 and 244 extending proximally through inner member 225 to a location in the proximal end of the catheter. The filament 240 is generally held in sufficient tension to keep the distal keyed fitting engaged, though it is further contemplated that the mere presence of the filament may provide an interference against uncoupling if there is a sufficiently tight tolerance in the male/female interface of the keyed fitting.",
        "Rotational coupler 280 is rotationally engaged within proximal end portion 252 of prosthesis 250 through a proximal port, or aperture 251, such that the rotational coupler 280 is adapted to rotate within and relative to the prosthesis 250. This relative rotation is converted to force a deflection of prosthesis 250 into the desired shape of the second configuration in situ as follows.",
        "According to one aspect of the rotational coupling, the prosthesis 250 is preferably held to resist rotation while rotational coupler 280 is rotated within the prosthesis 250. This may be achieved simply by frictional forces of surrounding tissue after the prosthesis 250 has been delivered into the desired vessel such as the coronary sinus. According to another example, this may be achieved by providing a releasable interface such as a friction fit between outer member 215 and proximal end portion 252 of prosthesis 250 wherein the frictional engagement of outer member 215 and prosthesis 250 are held in a relatively fixed position while inner member 225 and rotational coupler 280 are rotated. This embodiment is shown in FIG. 4. In addition, or in the alternative to the friction fit interface, a keyed interface may be employed as shown in FIGS. 6-7. According to this mode, a shaped proximal fitting 253 on the proximal end 252 of prosthesis 250 is adapted to mate as a male counterpart into a shaped aperture or fitting on the distal end 212 of outer member 215. This keyed interface allows for rotational coupling between the members in a similar manner as just described for the inner member 225 and rotational coupler 280, and may allow for a more releasable coupling with reduced friction upon axial detachment of the members.",
        "The rotational forces from rotational coupler 280 may be converted to deflection forces on the prosthesis 250 according to one example as illustrated in FIGS. 8A-B. Prosthesis 250 includes a generally tubular wall or body 260 that has an inner lumen 262 and extends from the proximal end portion 252 to the distal end portion 254 of prosthesis 250. Secured along proximal end portion 252 is a nut fitting 263 that has a grooved inner bore 264 which communicates with inner lumen 262. Further to this specific embodiment, rotational coupler 280 is a screw member with outer helical threads 285 engaged within the mating threads of an inner surface (not shown) of a bore lumen such that a distal portion of screw threads 285 extends distally within lumen 262 and terminates at a second key fitting 287 similar to the shaped proximal end portion 282 and also having an aperture 288. Similar to the proximal end of rotational coupler 280, another flexible member or filament 290 is looped through aperture 288 such that two arms 292, 294 extend distally therefrom to an attachment point along distal end portion 254 of prosthesis 250. Because nut fitting 263 is fixed in relation to outer tubular body 260, and because that tubular body is held in a relatively fixed position as provided above, rotation of rotational coupler 280 moves coupler 280 proximally relative to body 260. This proximal axial translation of rotational coupler 280 puts tension on filament 290, which puts tension on the body 260 due to the distal attachment. This tension on outer body 260 forces a deflection of the body 260. Therefore, rotational force is converted into a tensile force which, in turn, causes radial deflection of the body 260 relative to the longitudinal axis L of the device 250. In other words, the body 260 is deflected about an axis that is transverse to the longitudinal axis L. See FIG. 8B.",
        "The forced deflection described immediately above may be controlled in a particular plane by providing a composite structure within prosthesis 250 that is engineered to respond, e.g., yield, to these forces in a prescribed way. In the specific embodiment shown, a relatively noncompressible column support or spine member 270 is provided within lumen 262 of outer tubular body 260. This spine member 270 is more rigid and more resistant to axial forces, especially tensile forces, than the material of outer tubular body 260 alone. Therefore, providing spine member 270 along only one radial position along the circumference of the prosthesis 250 creates a bias on the device 250 to deflect away from the spine 270 toward a more compressive region of the device 250. Such composite design may further include a laminate structure, a composite structure\u2014such as an imbedded wire reinforced wall structure, or may be achieved by engineering material variations in the device, such as for example by thinning, thickening, hardening, or softening the material at one location along the outer tubular body 260 relative to another region to urge the body 260 to deflect at a desired location.",
        "As may be achieved by other controllable embodiments elsewhere herein described, deflection according to the present embodiment may be adjusted according to a healthcare provider's desires, and is adjustable in either direction\u2014by either tightening the radius of curvature R or opening it. See FIG. 8B. According to this specific embodiment however, the adjustability of and choice between tightening and loosening of the deflection depends upon the direction and extent of rotation placed upon the rotational force transmission system.",
        "Once the desired deflection is achieved and desired therapeutic results are observed, the prosthesis 250 may be detached from the delivery assembly 210 by severing the torque or rotational force transmission system at the keyed fitting between the inner member 225 and the rotational coupler 280. This is accomplished by first releasing at least one arm 242,244 of the proximal filament 240 while withdrawing the other arm, thereby threading the filament 240 through aperture 283 (as shown in bold arrows in FIG. 8B) until it is unthreaded completely from the aperture 283. This allows inner member 225 to be withdrawn proximally from rotational coupler 280 to detach and thereby implant the prosthesis 250.",
        "Alternatively, as with other adjustable deflection systems herein described, the prosthesis may be held in its therapeutic condition for a temporary period of time (which may nevertheless be prolonged during a hospital stay), during which time mitral valve regurgitation may be minimized, such as for example for the purpose of bridging the patient in a temporarily improved condition until other treatments may be performed, e.g. annuloplasty, valve surgery, heart transplant, etc. In this alternative temporary setting, at the appropriate time the deflected, contracted prosthesis may be adjusted back open from its cinched position around the valve, and then withdrawn without implantation by withdrawing the entire system, delivery assembly still engaged to the prosthesis. Moreover, it is further contemplated that such a temporary prosthesis may be modified to remove the detachment mechanisms herein described, which may provide for a simpler and lower cost device.",
        "Device assembly 200 is also shown in FIGS. 3 and 8A-B to include a distal guidewire tracking member with a guidewire lumen 265 which is adapted to slideably engage a guidewire 230 in order to be placed in a percutaneous transluminal procedure into the desired vessel location, such as within the coronary sinus 22. The particular guidewire lumen shown is integral within the distal aspects of prosthesis 250 as a \u201crapid exchange\u201d or \u201cmonorail\u201d design that allows for relatively independent movement of the guidewire and catheter in vivo. Moreover, this design removes the need for the guidewire to ride coaxial through the entire device assembly 200, as would be the case for example in an \u201cover the wire\u201d type system. The type shown beneficially allows for detachable engagement of prosthesis 250, which is preferably achieved after withdrawing the optional guidewire 230 from the distal lumen 265.",
        "In each of the foregoing implantation methods, the physician preferably monitors the degree of regurgitation during the step of tightening the implant. Although any reduction in mitral regurgitation may be desirable, regurgitation is preferably reduced to something less than moderate (less than 2+). In any event, at least a one grade reduction is preferably achieved. On the other hand, reconfiguration of the implant 250 is desirably not accomplished to an extent sufficient to produce mitral stenosis, or any flow limitation of hemodynamic significance.",
        "Thus, the method of implantation preferably further comprises the steps of monitoring the degree of mitral regurgitation during, and preferably also before and following the implantation and/or reconfiguration steps. The degree of mitral regurgitation may be monitored such as by transesophageal echo cardiography, intracardiac echo cardiography, fluoroscopy using radiocontrast in the left ventricle (LVgram), or left atrial or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracings, as are understood in the art, during the incremental restriction of the mitral annulus and/or left ventricle step. Once a sufficient reduction in regurgitation has been achieved for a particular patient in the physician's judgement, the device 250 may be locked and the delivery assembly 210 detached from the device 250 and removed from the patient.",
        "The method may additionally comprise the step of measuring the coronary sinus 22 and/or other coronary vein, and selecting an appropriately sized implant 250 from an array of implants of varying sizes. Such parameters may include diameter, length, or radius of curvature of the arc of the sinus. The appropriately sized implant 250 is thereafter positioned within the target vein. The implant 250 is thus preferably provided in a graduated array of sizes, so that the optimal size can be selected for each patient. The size of the coronary sinus 22 or other vein can be measured using any of a variety of techniques, such as echo cardiogram, MRI, CT Scan, or angiography as is understood in the art. Moreover, as is apparent to one of ordinary skill, measuring a parameter of the coronary sinus 22 generally provides indicia of certain parameters of the mitral valve and its annulus, such as for example mitral valve diameter, in which case either the coronary sinus parameter or the mitral valve parameter may provide the requisite information for choosing an appropriately dimensioned device 250 from the kit.",
        "It follows that such mitral valve parameters may further be measured directly, such as by various of the methods just described, in order to generate the values used for choosing the appropriate device 250. Once a parameter for an anatomical feature is measured as herein described, its value is generally estimated according to the accuracy of the respective measuring tool\u2014it is contemplated that persons without specialized medical skills or training can choose the appropriate medical device 250 from the kit once armed with this estimated value. For example, packaging for each device 250 of the kit may indicate the respective dimensions that are unique to that device 250 with respect to other devices of the kit, and the estimated value of the measured anatomical parameter may simply be compared.",
        "It is contemplated and apparent that various of the embodiments herein described are adapted to accomplish manipulation of the coronary sinus 22 for mitral annulus reduction without substantially altering the length of the device 250 within the sinus 22. This may provide a benefit by increasing the useful purchase of the device 250 along the coronary sinus 22 and circumferentially around the mitral annulus as the sinus length and/or annulus diameter may be reduced during remodeling from the radial deflection of the prosthetic device 250. This may also mean that the dimension of the device 250 in a kit of devices may not directly correspond to the estimated value of the anatomical parameter that is measured. For example, the compared value of the measured device parameter may be shorter than an estimated coronary sinus 22 length due to a possible shortening of the sinus 22 during device 250 treatment. Or, the anatomical parameter may be estimated from an initial value based upon an anticipated or desired final result from treatment and such procedurally related value be used for choosing the appropriate device (e.g. comparing an estimated final length of the sinus or mitral valve diameter with a known dimension of the device in the remodeling configuration when used in situ).",
        "As a further aspect to the present invention, the implant 250 is preferably combined with an appropriate drug therapy for treating congestive heart failure. Residual regurgitation and other hemodynamic functions are preferably measured following implantation of the implant of the present invention. Heart medications are preferably adjusted to take into account the reduction in regurgitation and/or reduction in left ventricle volume in formulating an ongoing drug therapy for the patient.",
        "Still further, the present invention contemplates temporary use in the sinus 22 for mitral valve remodeling as a bridging regime in combination with other permanent treatments such as more conventional annuloplasty or valve replacement via surgery. Such combined systems of devices 250 and respective methods of use, which may further be combined with the pharmaceutical drug regimes, provide an overall treatment regime that can provide a highly beneficial result for management of patients with harmful mitral valve regurgitation.",
        "Any of the embodiments discussed herein may additionally be provided with one or more externally facing electrically conductive axially extending strips or annular bands, to enable the device 40 to function additionally as a cardiac pacing or other diagnostic or therapeutic cardiac electrode. The electrically conductive band or bands are placed in electrical communication with a pacing source or diagnostic instrument by way of one or more electrical conductors extending away from the device 40. The conductors may be electrically connected to any of a wide variety of electronic cardiac rhythm management devices, which are well known in the art.",
        "As shown in one embodiment in FIGS. 9A and 9B, once in the coronary sinus the elongate body 320 is adapted to be adjusted from the first implantation (flexible) configuration to a second (relatively rigid) remodeling configuration that has a shape that is adapted to remodel the mitral valve annulus. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 9B, this shape is generally adapted to provide an external force onto the annulus in order to reduce its diameter along at least one transverse axis, such as according to the arcuate shape shown that at least in part grips down onto a portion of the circumference of the valve to provide a diameter reducing force. As is also shown in phantom, the arcuate shape may take different forms in terms of degree, and in a further highly beneficial application is controllable and selectable between various or through a continuous range of degrees. Such controllability according to the embodiment shown is also selective between intermediate deflectable portions 360, 370, 380, as is shown in FIG. 9B and will be further developed below.",
        "Elongate body 320 is constructed from tubular wall 325 that extends continuously along the length of the deflectable portions 360,370,380 of the elongate body 320. An array or plurality of distinct, discontinuous slots or voids 330 are formed within the wall 325, each void 330 having an elongated shape that is transverse to the longitudinal axis. Voids 330 permit axial shortening of one side of the tubular wall 325, enabling the curvature illustrated in FIG. 9B.",
        "By further reference to the specific embodiment of FIGS. 9A-F, transverse voids 330 have a central groove-shaped region with two adjoining portions 332, 334 that converge at an apex 333 along the longitudinal axis. Such a shaped void 330 is defined at least in part by two opposing complementary shaped surfaces of two adjacent, longitudinally opposing portions 340, 350 of the wall of the elongate body 320. One of these portions 340 desirably assumes a convex shape in an axial, distal direction, and the other portion 350 is desirably concave in an axial, proximal direction around the apex 333. These shaped surfaces 340, 350 are preferably in a nested configuration with the convex portion 340 positioned within the concave portion 350. In this arrangement, lateral (rotational) movement of one of the adjacent wall portions 340, 350 relative to the other portion 340, 350 is substantially prevented by a mechanical interference with the other adjacent portion 340, 350. The relative nesting of adjacent portions 340, 350 of the elongate body 320 provides a mechanical interference to radial deflection along a first plane and substantially isolates deflection of the elongate body 320 along a second plane upon application of axial bending forces.",
        "FIG. 9D shows grooved voids 330 in plan view for the purpose of simplifying the illustration for better understanding. However, as depicted in FIG. 9C and by reference to FIG. 9E, these transverse voids 330 (and the generally the entire V-shaped portion herein described in detail) span across at least about 180 degrees of the circumference of the elongate body 320. Preferably, the transverse voids 330 span across more than about 300 degrees of the circumference of the elongate body 320, and still more preferably the voids span across between about 300 degrees and about 315 degrees of the circumference. By arranging such grooved voids in a similar alignment around the circumference of the wall 325, an integral and continuous backbone or spine 327 is formed along wall 325 that runs axially along the length of the elongate body 320. This overall arrangement of voids 330 and spine 327 has been observed to provide a desirable combination of bendability, due to the voided pattern, and axial integrity, due to the remaining wall structure.",
        "The elongate body 320 of the implant 300 shown in FIGS. 9A-F generally has three deflectable portions 360, 370, 380, and one non-deflectable portion 310 along the longitudinal axis. Each deflectable portion 360, 370, 380 has a group of voids 330 as just described in order to be individually deflectable between the first and second configurations with an applied force from outside of the patient's body while the elongate body 320 is positioned within the coronary sinus. More specifically, three forming elements 365, 375, 385 may be coupled to the three deflectable portions 360, 370, 380, respectively, in order to apply a deflection force to that portion to reshape that portion between the first and second configurations. Each forming element 365, 375, 385 is preferably adapted to extend externally from the patient's body when the elongate body 320 is positioned within the coronary sinus in order to be manually manipulated to apply the deflection force to the respectively coupled deflectable portion 360, 370, 380. Deflection of each of these portions combined provides for the overall shape for the elongate body 320 in the second configuration.",
        "Forming elements 365, 375, 385 are attached to elongate body 320 at unique, longitudinally spaced points of attachment 361, 371, 381, respectively, that are each at or distal to the distal end of each respectively coupled deflectable portion 360, 370, 380. One beneficial application is shown for the attachment of the forming members 365, 375, 385 to the body 320, wherein each point of attachment 361, 371, 381 has two axially spaced apertures, which are shown as proximal and distal apertures 362, 363 for point of attachment 361, proximal and distal apertures 372, 373 for attachment point 371, and proximal and distal apertures 382, 383 for point of attachment 381. As illustrated for point of attachment 371 in FIG. 9F, a shaped distal end 377 for forming element 375 is sized to be seated within distal aperture 373 where it is secured by a securing agent 374 which may be an adhesive, melt bond, or solder, for example. Any or all of the respective forming elements 365, 375, 385 may also be welded through the apertures to the wall. Forming element 375 extends proximally from distal aperture 373 and is further secured to wall 325 by additional securing agent 374 introduced through proximal aperture 372. The securing agent 374 may be applied in one operation from outside in through both apertures 372, 373. In addition, distal end 377 may also be shaped to provide a mechanical securement means for attachment during proximal axial forces, such as is shown in phantom in FIG. 9F.",
        "According to one specific embodiment that has been observed to be useful, the apertures for this attachment embodiment are generally between about 0.020 inches and about 0.022 inches in diameter with similar longitudinal spacing, and the distal end for the seated forming elements are between about 0.012 and about 0.014 inches in diameter. Further to that embodiment, wall 325 is generally constructed from a tubular, stainless steel wall or hypotube with a plurality of grooved voids 330 formed therein according to a pattern similar to that shown and described by reference to FIG. 9D or elsewhere herein. The respective forming elements are soldered to the respective attachment points using gold/tin solder. Further to this embodiment, grooves such as shown and described by reference to FIG. 9D were formed in the underlying stainless tube by laser cutting, though other well known techniques such as hand grinding, mechanical cutting, photo-lithography, etc. may alternatively be used.",
        "As previously described herein, the applied force from the forming elements 365, 375, 385 are generally an axial force between the attachment points 361, 371, 381 to the elongate body 320 and a proximal location (not shown) along the elongate body 320 that is proximal to that deflectable portion. According to the specific embodiments shown this force is generally between the attachment points 361, 371, 381 and the proximal end portion of the elongate body 320. The elongate body 320 may generally be held during forced deflection by means of a holding device (not shown) in order to substantially fix the proximal end portion of the elongate body 320 relative to the deflectable portion so that the axial force may be applied between those portions in situ. While the proximal manipulation of the forming elements 320 in order to apply the deflection force to the deflectable portions 360, 370, 380 may be axial as just described, it may in another regard be rotational.",
        "Each deflectable portion 360, 370, 380 is substantially axially rigid and non-compressible relative to the longitudinal axis L, and therefore the overall axial length of elongate body 320 remains substantially constant between the first and second configurations. However, each deflectable portion is relatively flexible along a radial axis transverse to the longitudinal axis such that the deflectable portion is adapted to bend radially upon application of an axial force between a distal location on the elongate body at or distal to a distal end of the deflectable portion and a proximal location along the elongate body 320 proximal to that deflectable portion. In one regard, the elongate body 320 may be generally axially non-compressible or non-expandable between each deflectable portion 360, 370, 380 and the proximal end portion of the elongate body 320, such that each deflectable portion 360, 370, 380 is adapted to bend radially upon application of a compressive or tensile axial force, respectively, on the elongate body 320 between the distal location and a proximal location that is at the proximal end portion of the elongate body 320.",
        "In still a further regard, other constructions for elongate body 320 may also provide for the combination of an integral and continuous wall 325 from the proximal end portion to the distal end portion of the body and a controlled radial bending response to axially compressive or tensile forces. In addition or in the alternative to the continuous integral wall incorporating the formed voids 330, the wall 325 may also include an engineered composite support structure with engineered support elements that are arranged to control the spatial strain response to the stress of the applied forces. Other suitable shapes for voids 330 may also be acceptable.",
        "One particular variation of the patterned voids according to the nested V-pattern (or U-pattern) embodiment shown in FIGS. 9A-F is shown in FIG. 9G, wherein the nested adjoining portions 340, 350 include interfacing surfaces 342, 352 that have interlocking teeth 344, 354 which are adapted to be locked in a radially deflected pattern in the second configuration. More specifically, the interfacing pattern of teeth 344, 354 are adapted to perform like a ratchet mechanism. By positioning this region along an inner radius of curvature during the bending of forced deflection, compressive forces bring the convexly shaped tooth region 340 deeper into the fitted well formed by the concave receiving region 350. This motion provides an interference between teeth 344,354 that deflects portion 340 until further motion toward portion 350 clears tooth 354 and recovery locks tooth 344 behind 354. This interactive motion of adjacent portions in voided regions is further represented by bold arrows in FIG. 9G.",
        "FIG. 10 illustrates an additional construction of a medical device 400 adapted to position an implant 402, or prosthesis, into the coronary sinus or other treatment site. Similar to the embodiments described above, medial device 400 includes a handle assembly 404 at a proximal end, while the implant 402 is located at a distal end. The handle assembly 404 and implant 402 are connected by an elongate, flexible catheter body 406. Desirably, the body 406 is or includes an extrusion of a material having sufficient column strength, that is, it resists compression in an axial direction, while permitting the body 406 to bend in a radial direction. Any of a variety of polymers well known in the transluminal catheter arts, such as HDPE or PEBAX, is used to form the body 406. However, other suitable materials may also be used. In one embodiment, the body 406 has an outside diameter of approximately 0.094 inches.",
        "With reference to FIG. 11, a plurality of lumens or passages extend in an axial direction along the length of the catheter body 406. The illustrated extrusion includes three small lumen 408, 410, 412 and one larger lumen 414. The small lumen 408, 410, 412 may be disposed substantially within one half of the circular cross section of the body 406 and each has an inside diameter of approximately 0.024 inches. The larger lumen 414 is desirably positioned substantially within a half of the circular cross section of the body 406 opposite the small lumen 408, 410, 412 and may have a diameter of approximately 0.044 inches. Collectively, the lumen 408, 410 and 412 allow control components 400 (e.g., forming elements 365, 375, 385 of FIGS. 9A and 9B) of the medical device 400 to extend from the handle assembly 404 to the implant 402 while being protected within the shaft 406. Alternatively, only a single pull wire lumen or two pull wire lumen may be provided as needed, depending upon the desired number of pull wires. As will be described in detail below, the control components convert operational movements of the handle assembly 404 into desired resultant movement of the implant 402. The larger lumen 414 may be used to rotatably receive a driver 436 as will be discussed. Additionally, one or more of the lumen may be used to permit irrigation to the coronary sinus, infusion of drugs or contrast media, or other desired purposes.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 12 and 13, the implant 402 is shown in greater detail. FIG. 13 is an enlarged view of a portion of FIG. 12 illustrating the releasable connection between the delivery assembly 401 and the implant 402. As described above, the implant 402 is removably connected to the delivery assembly 401 such that the delivery assembly 401 and implant 402 may be disconnected once the implant 402 has been properly positioned and tensioned within the coronary sinus or other body lumen or hollow organ.",

The overall length of the implant 402 can be varied, depending upon the intended treatment site and desired clinical performance. In one application, in which the device is intended to be positioned within the coronary sinus to reduce the diameter of the mitral valve annulus across a predetermined plane, the implant 402 is generally within the range of from about 5 cm to about 15 cm in length. For most adult patients, axial lengths within the range of from about 6 cm to about 12 cm may be used. In one embodiment, the implant 402 is approximately 9 centimeters long, and may have a cross-sectional area of no more than approximately 15 mm2. Preferably, the implant 402 has a cross-sectional area of no more than about 10 mm2.",

Nut 422 is thermally welded to body portion 416 and is provided with keyway 481.

The shaft portion 430 includes external threads which mate with internal threads on the nut 422. Thus, rotation of the screw 428 relative to the body portion 416 results in the screw 428 translating axially with respect the body portion 416. This relative movement may be utilized to move the body portion 416 of the implant 402 from an implantation configuration to a remodeling configuration through any suitable construction, such as through the use of a pull wire or other forming element as is described above, for example.",

The head portion 444 of the male connector 440 has a larger diameter than the shaft portion 442. A passage 446 desirably extends axially through the male connector 440 and defines a first portion 448 and a second portion 450. The first portion 448 of the passage 446 is located proximate the head portion 444 of the male connector 440 and has a larger diameter than that of the second portion 450, which is located proximate the shaft portion 442 of the male connector 440. A transition between the first portion 448 and the second portion 450 defines a shoulder surface 452 which extends generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the male connector 440. The first portion 448 of the passage 446 is preferably sized and shaped to receive the head portion 432 of the screw 428. Desirably, the head portion 432 of the screw 428 abuts the shoulder 452 of the passage 446.",

The collar 454 includes an inner flange portion 456 which is sized and shaped to fit within the first portion 448 of the passage 446 of the male connector 440 in a press fit configuration.",
        "In a similar manner to the embodiments described above, the implant 402 desirably includes a wire 458 which is operational for moving the implant 402 from a first, delivery configuration to a second, remodeling configuration. The wire 458 is desirably anchored to a distal end of the implant 402 by thermal welding or any of the methods described above, or any other suitable method as may be determined by one of skill in the art. Desirably, the proximal end of the wire 458 is anchored to the male connector 440 and collar 454 and, preferably, is thermally welded or otherwise bonded to the male connector 440 and collar 454. However, other suitable methods of attachment may also be used, such as an adhesive or mechanical fastener, for instance. Preferably, the male connector 440, and collar 454 have slots 460 and 462 to fit the proximal end of pull wire 458 to allow the wire 458 to lay flat and not increase the outside diameter of collar 454 or connector 440.

Desirably, an inner surface of the finger portions 468 defines an annular projection 470 which corresponds with an annular groove 472 of the male connector 440. When the female connector 466 is engaged with the male connector 440, the annular projection 470 desirably rests in the annular groove 472 to assist and inhibiting undesired relative axial movement between the delivery assembly 401 and the implant 402.",

In its second position, the cover 474 inhibits undesired flexing of the finger portions 468 to assist in maintaining a connection between the female connector 466 and the male connector 440.",
        "To prevent rotational movement between the delivery system (including shaft 406 and female connector 466) and implant body portion 416, one of finger portions 468 is removed or omitted from female connector 466 to create space or keyway 483 that fits into key 485 that is thermally welded to shaft portion 442 of male connector 440.",

The proximal end 480 of the driver 436 is desirably coupled for rotation with respect to the handle assembly 404, which will be described in greater detail below. The distal end 482 is preferably non circular such as hex-shaped in cross-section and is sized to engage the corresponding hex-shaped cavity 434 of the screw 428. Thus, rotation of the driver 436 results in corresponding rotation of the screw 428. Other suitable arrangements to permit rotational coupling of the driver 436 and screw 428 may also be used, such as using complementary polygonal or other non round-cross-sectional shapes for the mating components.",

The reduced-diameter portion 490 may have a length of approximately 0.5 inches or more and a diameter of approximately 0.027 inches. However, other suitable dimensions may also be employed. Desirably, each of the transition between the reduced-diameter portion 490 and the main portion 492 of the driver 436 and the transition between the reduced-diameter portion 490 and the shoulder 484 define a chamfer 494, 495, respectively to advantageously reduce stress concentrations.",

A proximal connector 508 is desirably retained by a threaded connection with the threaded aperture 506 and extends axially from a distal end of the distal handle 502. Desirably, the distal handle 502 additionally includes a threaded aperture 510 situated substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis and intersecting the threaded aperture 506. A set screw is advantageously in threaded connection with the threaded aperture 506 and may be tightened against the proximal connector 508 to inhibit undesired axial movement of the proximal connector 508 with respect to the distal handle 502.",

Each of the wire retainers 526 include a short leg 527, which is circular in cross-section and terminates in a ball end 528, and a long leg 529, which is preferably rectangular in cross-section. Desirably, the short leg 527 and the long leg 529 define an angle of approximately 75\u00b0 between them when the wire retainer 526 is in a relaxed position.

A plurality of apertures 532 extend radially through the proximal handle 500 near its proximal end. The outer surface of the proximal handle 500 defines a shoulder 534 between the grooves 530 and the apertures 532. The shoulder 534 mechanically deflects the wire retainer 526, when secured by the release collar 524, such that the angle between the short leg 527 and long leg 529 is increased from the relaxed position of the wire retainer 526. The inner surface of the release collar 524 defines an annular groove 536, which desirably straddles the shoulder 534, at least when the release collar 524 is in a relaxed position.

The release collar 524 is movable toward the proximal end of the proximal handle 500 into a second, or release position to selectively permit the proximal handle 500 to be removed from the distal handle 502. When the release collar 524 is moved toward the release position, an edge of the groove 536 engages the wire retainer 526 to deflect the short leg 527 and move the ball end 528 out of the groove 540 of the handle connector 516, thereby releasing the proximal handle 500 from the distal handle 502.",

A set screw arrangement, similar to those described above, may be used to secure the driver holder 525 axially with respect to the proximal handle 500. A pair of set screws 535, 537 secure the driver 436 axially and rotationally with respect to the proximal handle 500. Thus, rotation of the proximal handle 500 results in rotation of the driver 436. Desirably, an end cap 541 is press fit over the proximal end of the proximal handle 500 to further secure the driver holder 525. The end cap 541 may include an aperture 540 extending axially therethrough. Desirably, the aperture 540 is substantially aligned with the driver 436.",

The detach arrangement 542 includes an annular detach collar 544 surrounding the distal handle 502. The detach collar 544 is desirably concentric with the distal handle 502 and capable of sliding axially thereon.

The detach wire 562 is secured to the cover 474 by any suitable method, such as thermal welding, adhesives, or mechanical fasteners, for example. A set screw arrangement 564, similar to those described above, is utilized to secure the detach wire 562 within the aperture 560 for axial movement with the handle pin 546. Thus, when the detach collar 544 is moved toward the proximal end of the handle assembly 404, the detach wire 562 pulls the cover 474 to uncover the finger portions 468 of the female connector 466. When the cover 474 is in this position, the female connector 466 is able to be disconnected from the male connector 440 and, thus, the delivery assembly 401 is able to be disconnected from the implant 402, as described above.",

The lock arrangement 566 preferably includes a threaded aperture 568 passing radially through the distal handle 502. A lock screw 570 is provided for threaded engagement with the threaded aperture 568. The lock screw 570 includes a head portion 572, which interferes with movement of the detach collar 544 toward a proximal end of the handle assembly 404 when the lock screw 570 is screwed substantially fully into the aperture 568. The lock screw 570 may be backed partially, or fully, out of the aperture 568 to permit desired movement of the detach collar 544 toward the proximal end of the handle assembly 404.",
        "Operation of the medical device 400 is substantially similar to the embodiments described above. Preferably, before the procedure is initiated, the lock screw 570 is positioned to prevent undesired movement of the detach collar 544, which could result in premature detachment of the delivery assembly 401 from the implant 402. Once the implant 402 has been desirably positioned within the coronary sinus by a suitable method, such as described above, the proximal handle 500 is rotated with respect to the distal handle 502 to cause rotation of the driver 436. Rotation of the driver 436 results in corresponding rotation of the screw 426 which, in turn, causes the implant 402 to move from a delivery configuration to a remodeling configuration, as described in detail above. The direction of rotation of the proximal handle 500 will vary depending on the orientation of the threaded connection between the screw 428 and the nut 422. However, if a right hand thread orientation is used, the proximal handle 500 will be rotated counter-clockwise to move the implant 402 from a delivery configuration to a remodeling configuration.",
        "When the implant 402 has achieved a desired remodeling configuration, the lock screw 570 is backed off from its locked position to permit movement of the detach collar 544. The detach collar 544 may then be moved toward the proximal end of the handle assembly 404, thereby retracting the cover 474 and exposing the finger portions 468 of the female connector 466. The handle assembly 404 may then be pulled with a sufficient force to cause the finger portions 468 of the female connector 466 to deflect radially outwardly such that the female connector 466 may be disconnected from the male connector 440, thus disconnecting the delivery assembly 401 from the implant 402. The delivery assembly 401 is then removed from the patient, leaving the implant 402 in place.",

FIG. 19 illustrates a plan view of a preferred void 602 arrangement, wherein 57 individual voids 602 are provided. In general, a first side of the implant is generally non-compressible, such as is achieved by the use of a tubular wall. The first side of the implant is radially opposite a second side of the implant, which is provided with the plurality of voids 602. The voids permit the second side of the implant to be axially expanded or contracted, thereby curving the implant as will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The number and configuration of the voids 602 will influence the bending characteristics of the implant. In general, voids which are transverse to the longitudinal axis of the implant can assist in plane bending of the implant. For most implants intended for positioning within the coronary sinus, and therefore having an axial length of within the range of from about 5 to about 16 cm, at least about 10 and often at least about 20 voids are provided. Thirty or forty or more voids may also be provided, depending upon the desired finished curvature of the implanted device as well as the dimensions of the voids and intervening solid wall material.",

Desirably, the voids 602 extend around at least about 180\u00b0 of the circumference of the implant 600 and, preferably, around at least approximately 300\u00b0 of the circumference. In some embodiments, the voids 602 extend around between approximately 300\u00b0 and 315\u00b0 of the circumference of the implant 600. Alternatively, the tubular body of the implant may comprise a spring coil in which adjacent windings are slightly spaced apart. Axial column strength on the first side of the implant is provided by an axially extending support such as a flexible ribbon or core wire which may be soldered or otherwise attached to the spring coil to inhibit axial compression along the side which carries the support. The opposing side of the coil may be compressed or expanded, to impart a curve. The coil may be provided with an outer polymeric sleeve.",

In one implementation, the end portions 603 have a diameter of approximately 0.018 inches and a circumferential distance between the centers of the two opposing circular portions 603 of a single void 602 is approximately 0.068 inches. This feature decreases the likelihood of cracks originating in the material of the implant 600 at the ends of the voids 602.",

In general, widths within the range of from about 0.010 to about 0.040 inches are often used. In the illustrated embodiment, the width WV is approximately 0.012 inches. Desirably, a distance between at least a portion of both sides of the projection 608 and recess 610 is less than the void width WV and defines a pair of interference portions 612 between the surface 604 and the surface 606.",
        "The interference portions 612 inhibit the implant 600 from moving out of a plane defined by the longitudinal axis of the implant 600 as it moves from a delivery configuration to a remodeling configuration. Advantageously, the surfaces 604, 606 contact one another in the interference portions 612 of the void 602 in response to a force urging the implant 600 to curve out of plane. Thus, with the illustrated arrangement, the implant 600 is maintained within the desired plane while moving from a delivery configuration to a remodeling configuration. Alternatively, the void 602 may be configured to permit a predetermined out of plane movement of the implant 600 if such is desirable, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.

Alternatively, the implant 100 may be configured to \u201cpush off\u201d of the opposing wall of the coronary sinus, to support advancement of central segment 110 in the direction of the mitral valve. For example, the proximal segment 108 and distal segment 112 may be configured to extend all the way across the diameter of the coronary sinus, to contact the opposing wall. This may be accomplished by remodeling the device such that the amplitude equals or exceeds the diameter of the coronary sinus. Alternatively, the proximal and distal anchors 118, 120 may take the form of a tubular structure such as a self-expanding stent, or a stent which is expanded by a dilatation balloon or other expansion structure. The tubular anchor will then restrain the implant 100 in a desired orientation within the coronary sinus. As a further alternative, the proximal and distal ends of the implant may be extended through the wall of the coronary sinus, or stitched to or otherwise adhered to the wall of the coronary sinus, to permit the remodeling described herein. Additional alternative anchor configurations will be disclosed below.",
        "Any of a variety of self expanding or mechanically expandable structures may be provided on the tubular body 102, to assist in anchoring and positioning the implant. For example, referring to FIG. 23, the proximal end 104 of the tubular body 102 is provided with a radially expandable support 140. In general, support 140 comprises a plurality of axially extending ribs or elements 142, each of which may be additionally provided with one or more barbs 144. Additional structural details of suitable support structures may be found by reference to U.S. patent application having Ser. No. 10/033,371 filed on Oct. 19, 2001 and entitled \u201cAdjustable Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Device,\u201d published on Aug. 15, 2002 as Publication No. US 2002/0111647A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 21 and 22, the implant 100 comprises an elongate forming element 122 which has been described in various forms previously. The forming element 122 extends between a distal point of attachment 124 to the body 102 and a proximal point of attachment 126 to a threaded collar or other axially moveable structure. Proximal movement of the proximal point of attachment 126 with respect to the body 102 induces a curvature in the implant 100 as has been discussed.",
        "In the illustrated configuration, the forming element 122 is attached at the proximal point of attachment to a threaded structure such as a nut 128. Alternatively, threads may be provided directly on a proximal portion of the forming element. Nut 128 is axially movably carried by a rotatable screw 130, using well understood complementary threaded engagement surfaces. Rotation of the screw 130 will cause relative axial movement of the nut 128 as will be understood by those of skill in the art.",
        "The screw 130 is provided with one or more axial retention structures to permit rotation but inhibit axial movement thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the screw 130 is provided with one or more radially outwardly extending projections such as flange 132, which is captured between a first bushing 134 and a second bushing 136 to prevent axial movement. Screw 130 may be retained against axial motion while permitting rotation using any of a variety of alternative structures, such as radially inwardly extending tabs or flanges from the inside surface of the body 102, which are slidably received by one or more radially inwardly extending annular grooves in the screw 130.",
        "The proximal end of the screw 130 is provided with a rotational coupling 138. Coupling 138 is adapted to removably receive a rotatable driver carried by the deployment catheter such that rotation of the driver within the deployment catheter will produce axial movement of the nut 128. In one implementation, the coupling 138 comprises a recess having a non-round cross-sectional configuration, such as a hexagonal wall. This cooperates with the hexagonal distal end on the driver (disclosed previously herein) to produce a removable rotational coupling.",
        "In the embodiment illustrated by FIG. 22, the forming element 122 extends through the inside of the body 102 in each of the proximal segment 108 and distal segment 112, and extends along the outside of the body 102 along the central segment 110. See also FIG. 21. This configuration, in which the forming element 122 extends through a first aperture 140 in or near the proximal transition 114, and a second aperture 142 in or near the distal transition 116, has been found to be convenient in an implant adapted to assume a \u201cw\u201d implanted configuration as shown in FIG. 21. Alternatively, the forming element 122 may extend along the inside of the body 102 throughout its length. The forming element 122 may extend along the outside of the body 102 throughout its length, or extend partially inside and partially outside of the body 102 depending upon the desired performance characteristics of the implant.",
        "In connection with any of the preceding embodiments, it may be desirable for the implant to change in axial length as it is advanced from the first, flexible configuration for transluminal delivery, to the second configuration for remodeling the mitral valve annulus. This may be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as configuring two or more sections of the tubular body in a telescoping fashion, such that a first portion of the body is axially moveably positioned within a second portion of the body. This enables the axial length of the body to be controllably altered, during or apart from the transformation of the device to its implanted configuration. In certain applications, it may be desirable for the axial length of the implant to shorten as the implant is converted to its implanted orientation. Foreshortening of the implant by a distance within the range of from about 10% to about 95% of the maximum implant axial length is presently contemplated.",
        "In one embodiment, controlled foreshortening may be accomplished by providing a plurality of foreshortening slots or chevrons in the outer wall of the tubular body. Referring to FIG. 24, there is illustrated a fragmentary view of a portion of an elongate body 320. The configuration of FIG. 24 can be applied to any of the previously disclosed embodiments, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.",
        "The elongate body 320 includes a plurality of transverse voids 330 as has been discussed. Axial compression of the elongate body 320 causes the voids 330 to axially close, thereby deflecting the elongate body 320 out of plane. In some of the previously disclosed devices, the voids 330 are aligned on a first side of the elongate body 320, and they oppose a second side of the elongate body 320 which is comparatively non collapsible and thereby acts as a spine for the device.",
        "In accordance with the present, foreshortening feature, a first plurality of foreshortening voids 331 is provided on the elongate body 320. The foreshortening voids 331 are positioned on the elongate body 320 such that they permit axial compression of the body, upon application of the axially compressive force utilized to deflect the body out of plane. In the illustrated embodiment, the first plurality of foreshortening void 331 is axially aligned along the \u201cbackbone\u201d or support side of the device, opposite to the voids 330.",
        "A second plurality of foreshortening voids 333 may also be provided, spaced circumferentially apart from the first plurality of foreshortening voids 331. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second foreshortening voids 331 and 333 are aligned along first and second longitudinal axes, which are spaced approximately 180\u00b0 apart from each other around the circumference of the elongate body 320.",
        "In general, foreshortening within the range of from about 1% to about 20% of the maximum length of the device is presently contemplated. The specific number and dimensions of the foreshortening voids may be optimized by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein, taking into account the desired clinical performance.",
        "Referring to FIG. 25, there is illustrated an alternate construction of the implant 100 in accordance with the present invention, for accomplishing the radial inward compression previously discussed in connection with FIG. 22. The implant 100 extends between a proximal end 104 and a distal end 106. The implant may be considered to be divided into two or more distinct zones, such as a central segment 110 and proximal and distal segments 108 and 112. At least one segment on the implant 100 includes a compression element 140, configured to generate radial compression such as against the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. In the illustrated design, the compression element 140 comprises a flexible ribbon 142. The flexible ribbon 142 is configured to project radially inwardly from the concave side of the implanted device 100, as the device 100 is transformed from its implantation configuration to its implanted configuration. In one embodiment, the ribbon 142 comprises a flat wire having a cross section of about 0.005 inches by about 0.020 inches, and having an axial length of from about 3 to about 4 cm.",
        "Ribbon 142 may be configured to provide a radially outwardly directed compressive force using any of a variety of mechanisms. In one implementation, the ribbon 142 has a fixed length and is attached at first and second points spaced apart along the length of the implant 100. As the concave side of the implant 100 axially shortens, the fixed axial length of the ribbon 142 causes a preset bend to progress laterally outwardly in response to the bending of the implant. Alternatively, the compression element 140 may be activated in response to an active control, such as rotation of a threaded screw or movement of an axially moveable control.",
        "In addition to a central compression element 140, additional compression elements may be provided. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 25, a proximal compression element 139 and a distal compression element 143 are also provided. The desirability of two or three or more compression elements 140 spaced axially apart along the implant depends upon the desired clinical performance of the device.",
        "In addition to the compression element 140, the implant 100 illustrated in FIG. 25 additionally carries one or two or more proximal tissue anchors 118 and distal tissue anchors 120. Preferably, the proximal anchors 118 and the distal anchors 120 are positioned fully within the tubular body of the implant 100 during transluminal navigation. The proximal anchors 118 and distal anchors 120 are extended radially outwardly from the implant 100 in an inclined orientation to engage tissue at the time of deployment, such as simultaneously with the transformation of the implant 100 from the implantation orientation to the implanted orientation. Additional details of particular anchor configurations and deployment sequences will be discussed below.",
        "Referring to FIG. 26, there is illustrated an alternate construction for the compression element 140. In this construction, the compression element 140 comprises a basket or other structure which extends radially outwardly in response to axially compressive movement. The basket 144 comprises a plurality of axially extending ribs 146 connected to the implant at a proximal hub 148 and distal hub 150. During tightening of the implant to compress the mitral valve annulus, the distal hub 150 and the proximal hub 148 are advanced towards each other, thereby axially shortening and radially expanding the wire basket 144. The basket may comprises two or three or more, and, preferably, at least about 6 axial ribbons 146. In one embodiment, the basket 144 is formed by providing a plurality of axially extending slots around the circumference of a metal tube. Any of a variety of medically compatible metals may be used, such as stainless steel, or nickel titanium alloys such as nitinol. The radially expandable support structure illustrated in FIG. 23 may also be positioned on the implant in a central segment, to function as a compression element 140.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 27 and 28, there is illustrated a further variation of the present invention. In this construction, the implant 100 comprises a proximal section 152 and a distal section 154. The bending mechanism has been relocated to the center of the device, and is illustrated as including a rotatable screw 156. The screw is rotated in response to rotation of a component 157 on a deployment device which is removably connectable to the rotatable screw. The component 157 on the deployment device is coupled to a rotatable driver positioned within the implant 100 and further rotatably coupled to the screw 156. Thus, a rotational force on the component 157 is translated to the rotatable driver 159 within the deployment device which causes the rotatable screw 156 to advance the proximal section 152 and the distal section 154 into the implanted configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 27. As the implant 100 is advanced toward the implanted configuration, one or more proximal anchors 118 and one or more distal anchors 120 are also deployed from the device 100, to engage tissue as has been discussed elsewhere herein.",
        "An alternate tensioning assembly which may be used in a device like that illustrated in FIG. 27 is shown in an enlarged fragmentary view in FIG. 28. In general, the device 110 includes a rotatable screw 156. The rotatable screw 156 includes a proximal coupling 158, having a recess 160 or other releasable connector as has been discussed elsewhere herein. In one convenient construction, the recess 160 is provided with a polygonal cross section, such as to accommodate a hex coupling on the distal end of the deployment device (not shown). Any of a variety of complementary surface structures between the proximal coupling 158 and the deployment device may be utilized as has been discussed.",
        "The proximal coupling 158 is connected to the threaded shaft 162. Threaded shaft 162 extends through an aperture 166 in a proximal block 168. Block 168 is attached to a proximal pull wire 170.",
        "The threaded shaft 162 is threadably engaged within a threaded aperture 172 in a nut 174. The nut 174 is connected to a distal pull wire 176, which extends through the distal section of the implant 100. The proximal pull wire 170 extends proximally though the device to a point of attachment with respect to the tubular body, and the distal pull wire 176 extends distally to a point of attachment with respect to the tubular body.",
        "As will be appreciated in view of the previous disclosure herein, rotation of the proximal coupling 158 will cause the threaded shaft 162 to rotate freely with respect to the aperture 166 in the proximal block 168, and to axially advance the nut 174 within the implant 110. Preferably, the aperture 166 in the proximal block 168 and the inner threads of the nut 174 are oppositely threaded with respect to one another such that the effect of rotation of the proximal coupling 158 in a first direction is to decrease the distance between the proximal block 168 and the nut 174. Of course, the threaded shaft 162 is appropriately configured with cooperating threads as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. This will have the effect of bending both the proximal section 152 and distal section 154 into the curved orientation illustrated in FIG. 27. In the illustrated construction, axial advancement of the proximal block 168 and the nut 174 towards each other will also deploy the proximal tissue anchors 118 and distal anchors 120. Preferably, the length of the threaded shaft 162 is configured such that a previously selected maximum number of rotations in a first direction cause the proximal block 168 and nut 174 to contact each other and interfere with further rotation of the screw 156. Thus, the maximum displacement of the proximal pull wire 170 and distal pull wire 176 can be selectively controlled thereby limiting the deflection of the proximal section 152 and the distal section 154 to a final desired shape.",
        "Rotation of the proximal coupling 158 in a second, opposite direction will allow the implant to straighten out and become flexible again, such as to permit repositioning, retensioning, or removal. The rotational limit of the screw 156 in a second direction can be controlled by the interference of the proximal block 168 against the proximal coupling 158. As the screw 156 is rotated in a second direction and reaches its maximum rotation, the proximal block 168 contacts the proximal coupling and thereby inhibits any further screw rotation in the second direction.",
        "The operation of the tissue anchors may be accomplished in any of a variety of ways, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. One construction may be understood by reference to FIG. 29. In this construction, the distal anchors 120 are automatically deployed in response to proximal retraction of the distal pull wire 176.",
        "Referring the FIG. 29, the distal pull wire 176 is provided with at least a first tissue barb 180 and optimally a second tissue barb 182. Additional barbs may be provided as desired. Tissue barbs 180 and 182 are inclined laterally in the proximal direction, and are aligned with openings 184 and 186, respectively, in the side wall of the implant 100. Proximal retraction of the distal pull wire 176 causes the tissue barbs 180 and 182 to advance laterally through the openings 184 and 186, at an angle which is inclined in the proximal direction, to engage tissue. Each of the tissue barbs 180 and 182 may be provided with a sharpened distal end, to facilitate penetrating tissue.",
        "The distal pull wire 176 may extend proximally to the nut 174 as discussed in connection with FIG. 28. Alternatively, the distal pull wire 176 may extend all the way to the proximal end of the implant 110, depending upon the design of the tightening mechanism.",
        "In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 29, the distal pull wire 176 exits the tubular body at an aperture 188, and extends along the outside surface of the implant 100 on the concave side of the device when in the implanted orientation. Alternatively, the distal pull wire 176 may extend within the implant 100 throughout the length of the distal pull wire 176. The proximal anchor 118 may be constructed in a similar manner, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art.",
        "When fully deployed, each of the tissue barbs 180 and 182 extend outwardly from the side of the implant for a distance within the range of from about 1 mm to about 5 mm. By adjusting the angle between the longitudinal axis of the barb 180 and the longitudinal axis of the implant, the length of the barb 180 can be adjusted while maintaining the lateral distance that the barb 180 may travel within the desired range.",
        "In certain applications of the invention, it may be desirable to control the sequence by which the distal anchors and/or proximal anchors deploy, relative to the transformation of the implant from the implantation orientation to the implanted orientation. For example, it may be desirable for the distal anchors 120 to deploy into the wall of the coronary sinus prior to the implant placing any substantial compressive pressure on the mitral valve annulus. Following compression of the annulus, the proximal anchors may desirably be deployed. Alternatively, it may be desirable to deploy both the proximal and distal anchors at the beginning of the compression cycle, to be followed by the application of pressure by the implant on the mitral valve annulus. Additionally, the proximal and/or distal anchors can be deployed before compression of the annulus. This sequence can be controlled in any of a variety of ways, such as by providing a mismatch between the angle of the barbs 180 and 182 within the implant, and the apertures 184 and 186 through which the barbs will travel. Providing friction to the deployment of the barbs will tend to delay deployment of the barbs until a sufficient tension force has been applied to the distal pull wire 176. Alternatively, by configuring the pull wire 176 and barbs 180 and 182 for minimal deployment friction, the barbs will tend to deploy prior to the application of significant compressive force on the mitral valve annulus. The sequence may be optimized by those of skill in the art in view of the desired clinical performance.",
        "Although the foregoing embodiments have been described primarily in terms of a structure having a tubular housing with various components therein, the invention may be accomplished using a nontubular structure such as a pair of adjacent axial elements. In general, the lateral bending and compression functions of the invention can be accomplished as long as a first elongate flexible structure provides column strength, and a second forming element is attached near a distal end of the column strength element. Proximal axial retraction of the forming element will cause a lateral deflection of the column strength element, provided proximal movement of the column strength element is inhibited. Similarly, axial distal advancement of the forming element, if it is selected such that it has a sufficient column strength, will cause a lateral deflection of the column strength element in an opposite direction. The column strength element may be in the form of a ribbon, wire, bottomed out spring, or other element which will resist collapse under tension. In the foregoing embodiments, one side wall of the tubular body provides column strength, and the forming element operates as a pull wire such that proximal retraction of the pull wire causes a lateral deflection of the column strength element.",
        "A further implementation of the invention may be understood by reference to FIGS. 30A and 30B. In this construction, a distal section 154 has one or more tissue anchors 120, and a proximal section 152 has one or more proximal tissue anchors 118. The distal tissue anchor 120 and/or the proximal tissue anchors 118 may either be passive (as illustrated) or active, such that the anchors are pivotably or angularly adjustably carried by the implant. Active tissue anchors may either incline in response to positioning or tightening of the device, or be controlled by a separate rotatable or axially moveable control element. The proximal tissue anchors 118 and distal tissue anchors 120 need not both be active or passive. For example, the distal tissue anchor may be actively engageable with the adjacent tissue such as by manipulation of a tissue engagement control. The proximal tissue anchor may be passively engageable with the adjacent tissue. The reverse may also be accomplished, where the distal tissue anchor is passively engageable with adjacent tissue and the proximal tissue anchor is controllably engageable utilizing a control on the deployment catheter. The foregoing discussion concerning the active or passive tissue anchors applies to all of the embodiments herein, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.",
        "A tensioning element 190 is provided at about a junction between the distal segment 154 and the proximal segment 152. The tensioning element 190 is adapted to apply tension between the proximal anchors 118 and the distal anchors 120.",
        "In one construction, at least one of the proximal section 152 and distal section 154 comprises a plurality of transverse engagement structures such as slots. See FIG. 30B. The tensioning element 190 includes a rotatable threaded shaft (not shown), oriented such that the threads engage the transverse slots on the proximal or distal section. Rotation of the threaded shaft using any of a variety of rotatable engagement configurations disclosed elsewhere herein will cause axial movement of the corresponding proximal or distal section 152, 154, as will be understood by those of skill in the art.",
        "In one particular embodiment, the proximal section 152 is secured to the tensioning element 190. The distal section 154 is axially moveably engaged with the tensioning structure 190 by engagement of one or more rotatable threads within the tensioning structure 190, in a plurality of transverse slots on the distal section 154. Rotation of a rotatable driver in a first direction will draw the distal anchor 120 in a proximal direction, thereby decreasing the distance between the proximal anchor 118 and the distal anchor 120. Alternatively, the distal section 154 may be fixed with respect to the tensioning element 190, and the proximal section 152 may be axially advanced or retracted based upon the rotation of a rotatable driver. In a further alternative, each of the proximal section 152 and the distal section 154 may engage a threaded shaft in the tensioning element 190, to enable the axial distance between the proximal anchor 118 and the distal anchor 120 to be adjusted.",
        "Each of the proximal anchors 118 and distal anchors 120 may be either actively deployed such as has been described previously herein, or may be fixed with respect to their corresponding section 152, 154. In an embodiment in which the anchor is fixed with respect to its corresponding support section, the anchors are retracted within a deployment sleeve for transluminal navigation. The deployment sleeve is advanced distally through the coronary sinus to the distal point of attachment of distal anchor 120. Proximal retraction of the outer sleeve with respect to the implant will release the distal anchor 120, which may incline radially outwardly in the proximal direction due to its own internal bias. Proximal traction on the distal anchor 120 will cause the distal anchor to engage tissue at the distal attachment site. The outer tubular sleeve may be further proximally retracted to release the proximal anchor 118. Rotation of the rotatable driver following engagement of the anchors will apply compressive force to the mitral valve annulus. Any of a variety of lateral engagement structures, such as have been previously disclosed herein, may be adapted for use with the present embodiment, to focus pressure on a specific anatomical site such as the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. See, for example, the compression element 140 illustrated in FIG. 25, and corresponding text.",
        "For example, a compression element 140 may be formed from an elongate flexible ribbon extending along the concave side of at least one of the distal section 154 and proximal section 152. A proximal end of the compression element 140 may be secured with respect to the proximal section 152, and a distal end of the compression element 140 may be secured with respect to the distal section 154. Upon manipulation of the tensioning element 190 to reduce the axial length of the implant, the compression element 140 will extend radially inwardly from the concave side of the device.",
        "In the foregoing embodiment, deployment of the compression element is responsive to shortening or tensioning of the device. In an alternate implementation of the invention, the lateral advance of the compression element 140 may be controlled independently of tensioning the tensioning element 190. In this embodiment, the tensioning element 190 may be adjusted to seat the proximal anchors 118 and distal anchors 120, and to apply a degree of tension on the mitral valve annulus. During or following the tensioning step, the compression element 140 may be laterally deployed. Lateral deployment may be accomplished by rotating a rotatable driver or axially moving an axial driver within the deployment catheter, inflating a laterally expandable balloon by way of an inflation lumen in the deployment catheter, or through any of a variety of structures which will become apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.",
        "There is provided in FIGS. 31A-C a partially cross-sectioned side elevational view of an alternate construction of an implant 900, similar to that illustrated in FIG. 30A. The implant 900 includes a proximal section 152, a distal section 154, and a tensioning element 190. The tensioning element 190 couples the proximal section 152 to the distal section 154, and is used to apply and release tension therebetween.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 31A, the proximal section 152 includes a proximal tissue anchor 118, and a proximal ribbon 902. The proximal tissue anchor 118 may be laser cut from stainless steel tube, and has an arcuate cross-sectional shape (not shown). Alternatively, any of a variety of tissue anchor designs and materials may be employed, as have been described in greater detail above, and as are known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the proximal tissue anchor 118 includes a penetrating point 904, and two barbs 906 to hold the proximal tissue anchor 118 securely in place once deployed. A variety of penetrating points 904 and barbs 906 may be used to achieve desired clinical results, and the particular proximal tissue anchor 118 design may vary depending upon the particular clinical requirements.",
        "The proximal tissue anchor 118 preferably includes two holes 908 that are used to partially rotatably couple the proximal tissue anchor 118 with a pivot 910 that is coupled to the proximal ribbon 902. One embodiment of such pivot 910 is shown in greater detail on FIG. 31C. The pivot 910 may be integral to the material of the proximal ribbon 902, or may include a pin, or other device coupled to the proximal ribbon 902. The proximal section 152 also includes a spring 912, used to bias the proximal tissue anchor 118 so that its penetrating point 904 rotates away from the proximal ribbon 902 and towards tissue when deployed. In one embodiment, the spring 912 is cut from the same tubing used to form the proximal tissue anchor 118, and is integral thereto. In another embodiment, the spring 912 has a torsional design, as is well known to those of skill in the art.",
        "The overall length of the proximal tissue anchor 118 preferably is about 6 mm, although the actual length will be selected based upon the particular requirements of the clinical setting. In one embodiment, the length of the proximal tissue anchor 118 will be selected such that it does not penetrate all the way through the wall of the coronary sinus when deployed. In general, the length of the proximal tissue anchor 118 is in the range between about 1 mm and about 15 mm.",
        "Distal section 154 preferably includes a distal tissue anchor 120, a distal ribbon 914, and a spring 912, as shown in FIG. 31A. Distal tissue anchor 120 is similar to proximal tissue anchor 118, and has similar characteristics and dimensions as described in greater detail above. Distal ribbon 914 preferably includes multiple slots 916 to interface with the tensioning element 190, as described in greater detail below. The slot 916 pitch, or center-to-center spacing of the slots 916, partially defines the resolution of the adjustability of the tension applicable between the proximal and distal tissue anchors 118, 120. In one embodiment, the slot pitch is about 1 mm. Alternatively, the slot pitch is between 0.1 mm and 3 mm. In another embodiment, the slot pitch is not constant along the length of the distal ribbon 914. The distal ribbon 914 may be designed to have a greater pitch, or slot width towards the proximal end of the distal ribbon 914, and a smaller pitch or slot width towards the distal end of the distal ribbon 914. Alternatively, the distal ribbon 914 may have no slots such that continuous instead of stepped movement of the distal ribbon 914 is used to apply tension between the proximal and distal tissue anchors 118, 120. The method of applying tension between the proximal and distal tissue anchors 118, 120 is described in greater detail below. The distal ribbon 914 also preferably includes a pull-wire disconnect 918 for removable coupling to a tab pull-wire 944, as described in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 31E-F.",

The proximal ribbon 902 preferably is attached to the inside lumen of the housing 920 using any of a variety of methods, including welding, bonding, or by using any of a variety of fasteners, as is well known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the proximal ribbon 902 is attached to the housing 920 such that the axial position of the proximal tissue anchor 118 is fixed with respect to the housing 920.",
        "The housing 920 also includes a latch 922 that preferably is attached to a spacer 924 at the latch's 922 distal end. The latch 922 includes a tang 928 that bends towards the distal ribbon 914 at an angle relative to the distal ribbon 914. The tang 928 is designed to travel through an opening 930 in the spacer 924, and engage a slot 916 in the distal ribbon 914. By engaging the slot 916 in the distal ribbon 914, the latch 922 prevents axial movement of the distal ribbon 914, and distal tissue anchor 120, in the distal direction. The opening 930 in the spacer 924 is of sufficient dimension to allow the tang 928 of the latch 922 to flex enough to disengage the slot 916 in the distal ribbon 914 when the distal ribbon 914 is moved in the proximal direction. The interface between the latch 922 of the tensioning element 190 and the slot 916 of the distal ribbon 914 functions as a ratcheting mechanism. The ratcheting mechanism allows stepped movement of the distal ribbon 914 as it is moved in the proximal direction (as described in greater detail below), yet prevents the distal ribbon 914 from moving in the distal direction. The amount of movement of each ratcheting step is related to the pitch between the distal ribbon 914 slots 916, as described above.",
        "In another embodiment, as mentioned above, the distal ribbon 914 does not contain slots. In such embodiment, friction between the tang 928 of the latch 922 and the distal ribbon 914 is sufficient to allow continuous, e.g., non-stepped, or infinitely adjustable, movement of the distal ribbon 914 in the proximal direction, yet prevent movement of the distal ribbon 914 in the distal direction. In another embodiment, shallow depressions, ribs or other texture, or partial thickness slots are added to the surface of distal ribbon 914 to provide enhanced friction against tang 928. In one embodiment, movement of the distal ribbon 914 in the proximal direction may be achieved by releasing, or disengaging the tang 928 of the latch 922 from the distal ribbon 914.",
        "In one embodiment, the housing 920 also includes a latch release ribbon 932 that preferably is disposed between the spacer 924 and the distal ribbon 914, as illustrated in FIG. 31A. The latch release ribbon 932 is also axially moveable with respect to the housing 920 and the distal ribbon 914. In one embodiment, as the latch release ribbon 932 is moved proximally, the tang 928 of the latch 922 is lifted such that it disengages the slot 916 of the distal ribbon 914. While disengaged from the latch 922, the distal ribbon 914 may be moved in the distal direction, thereby increasing the distance between the proximal and distal anchors 118, 120.",
        "In one embodiment, portions of the lumen of the housing 920 may be filled with an insert 926, as illustrated in FIG. 31B. As shown, insert 926 fills the spaces between the spacer 924 and the housing 920 of the tensioning element 190. In one embodiment, the portion of the lumen between the distal ribbon 914 and the housing 920 does not contain an insert 926, although in other embodiments it does. In one embodiment, it is advantageous to omit an insert 926 between the distal ribbon 914 and the housing 920 so as to reduce friction on the distal ribbon 914 when moving the distal ribbon 914 with respect to the housing 920.",
        "FIG. 31C illustrates one embodiment of the distal ribbon 914, as described in greater detail above. The illustrated distal ribbon 914 is about 9 cm long, although the length of the distal ribbon 914 may be selected for the clinical requirements of the particular treatment. In general, the length of the distal ribbon 914 is in the range between about 2 cm and about 20 cm. The length of the proximal ribbon 902 has similar dimensions, such that the overall length of the implant 900 is in the range between about 2 cm and about 20 cm, preferably in the range between about 5 cm and about 15 cm, and more preferably in the range between about 7 cm and about 10 cm. In one embodiment, the overall length of the implant 900 is about 9 cm.",
        "In the illustrated construction, the crossing profile of the implant 900 is determined by the diameter of the housing 920, as illustrated in FIG. 31B. In one embodiment, the diameter of the housing 920 is selected so that the implant 900 may be delivered inside of a catheter having an lumen with a diameter in the range between 6 French (approximately 0.079 inches) and 20 French (approximately 0.262 inches). In one embodiment, the length of the housing 920, as shown in FIG. 31A is in the range between about 3 mm and about 10 mm, preferably in the range between about 5 mm and about 8 mm, and more preferably in the range between about 6 mm and about 7 mm.",
        "Referring to FIG. 31D, there is illustrated a disconnect subassembly 936, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The disconnect subassembly 936 illustrates one mechanism by which the implant 900 is decoupled from a delivery catheter and handpiece, as described in greater detail below. Disconnect subassembly 936 includes the distal ribbon 914, a cover 938, a cover pull-wire 940, a tab 942, and a tab pull-wire 944. The pull-wire disconnect 918 of the distal ribbon 914 is engaged by a flange 946 protruding from the tab 942, as shown in greater detail in FIG. 31E. A tab pull-wire 944 is coupled to the tab 942 such that proximal movement of the tab pull-wire 944 with respect to a catheter 948 (as shown in FIG. 31F and described in greater detail below) translates into proximal movement of the distal ribbon 914, and distal tissue anchor 120 with respect to the proximal tissue anchor 118.",
        "A cover 938, may comprise a stainless steel tube, is slid over the tab pull-wire 944 and distal ribbon 914. The cover 938 keeps the flange 946 of the tab 942 engaged with the pull-wire disconnect 918 of the distal ribbon 914 as the tab pull-wire 944 is moved in the proximal direction. The cover 938 is coupled to a cover pull-wire 940 such that movement of the cover pull-wire 940 in the proximal direction moves the cover 938 proximally, thereby releasing the tab 942 from the pull-wire disconnect 918 of the distal ribbon 914. In one embodiment, the cover pull-wire 940 is a stainless steel hyptotube, and the tab pull-wire 944 is a stainless steel hypotube or wire of a smaller diameter than the lumen of the cover pull-wire 940. In one embodiment, the cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944 are substantially concentrically aligned, such that the tab pull-wire 944 travels within the cover pull-wire 940 from the disconnect subassembly 936 to the handpiece 958 (as shown in FIG. 32A).",
        "A catheter 948, as shown in FIG. 31F may be removably coupled to the housing 920 of the implant 900 with a catheter coupling 950. In one embodiment, the catheter coupling 950 includes a slot 952, and two fingers 954, which extend into the slot 952. The fingers 954 are attached to the catheter 948, such that axial and rotational movement of the catheter 948 translates into axial and rotational movement of the housing 920 and implant 900. The slot 952 may be located on the housing 920, and in one embodiment, is shaped so as to create a bayonet type coupling between the housing 920 and catheter 948, as is known to those of skill in the art. In other embodiments, more or less than two fingers 954 are used to removably couple the housing 920 to the catheter 948. In one embodiment, a circular ring, tabs, hooks or other devices well known to those of skill in the art, are used instead of fingers 954.",
        "In one embodiment, the fingers 954 are coupled to a release wire 956 such that proximal movement of the release wire 956 causes the fingers 954 to flex inward, and disengage from the slot 952 of the housing 920. When disengaged, the catheter 948 may be rotated and moved proximally with respect to the housing 920 so as to decouple the catheter 948 from the implant 900. In one embodiment, the release wire 956 is also coupled to the latch release ribbon 932 (shown in FIG. 31A). In one embodiment, proximal movement of the release wire 956 over a release distance causes the latch release ribbon 932 to disengage the latch 922 from the distal ribbon 914. In addition, proximal movement of the release wire 956 over the release distance does not cause the fingers 954 to flex sufficiently to disengage from the slot 952 of the housing 920, as described above.",
        "In one embodiment, the release wire 956 comprises a hypotube with a lumen of sufficient diameter to contain the cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944. In one embodiment, the release wire 956, cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944 are all substantially coaxially aligned, and arranged such that the cover pull-wire 940 is at least partially within the release wire 956, and the tab pull-wire 944 is at least partially within the cover pull-wire 940 as they travel proximally from the catheter coupling 950 and disconnect subassembly 936 to the handpiece, as described in greater detail below.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 32A, there is illustrated a handpiece 958, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. Handpiece 958 includes a strain relief 960, body 962, distal actuator 964, interlock 966, and proximal actuator 968. The release wire 956, cover pull-wire 940, and tab pull-wire 944 enter the handpiece 958 via a lumen of the strain relief 960. The release wire 956 is coupled to a distal slider 970, the cover pull-wire 940 is coupled to a center slider 972, and the tab pull-wire 944 is coupled to a proximal slider 974. The body 962 may be formed from two or more pieces that are, for example, machined from metal or plastic, and joined together. Alternatively, the body 962 may be formed from one piece of material, for example, plastic that is formed by injection molding.",
        "In one embodiment, the distal actuator 964 is threadingly engaged with the body 962 such that rotation of the distal actuator 964 results in axial movement of the distal actuator 964 with respect to the body 962. The distal actuator 964 is coupled to the distal slider 970 by at least one pin 976 (as shown in FIG. 32B) that is free to travel within an axial slot 978 in the body 962. The distal slider 970 is coupled to the release wire 956 by welding, bonding, adhesion, crimping, or other method as is known to those of skill in the art. The catheter 948 extends from the handpiece 958 to the implant 900, and is coupled to the implant 900 as described above, thereby fixing the axial position of the handpiece 958 with respect to the implant 900. As a result of the multiple couplings as described, rotation of the distal actuator 964 is translated into axial movement of the release wire 956 with respect to the handpiece 958, catheter 948, and implant 900. Proximal movement of the distal actuator 964 over the release distance, therefore causes the latch release ribbon 932 to move proximally sufficient to decouple the latch 922 from the distal ribbon 914, as described in greater detail above. Furthermore, additional proximal movement of the distal actuator 964 causes the fingers 954 of the catheter coupling 950 to disengage from the slot 952 of the housing 920, as described in greater detail above and below.",
        "In one embodiment, the proximal actuator 968 is coupled to a threaded rod 980 such that rotation of the proximal actuator 968 causes the threaded rod 980 to rotate in the same direction. The threads of the threaded rod 980 engage threads located on an inside lumen of the center slider 972, through which the threaded rod 980 extends. The inside lumen of the proximal slider 974, through which the threaded rod 980 also extends, does not contain threads. The interlock 966 includes two pins 976 which engage both the center slider 972 and the proximal slider 974, and is free to move axially within a second axial slot 982 in the body 962. The interlock 966 causes the center slider 972 and the proximal slider 974 to remain fixed with respect to one another. Therefore, as the center slider 972 is moved proximally with respect to the body 962 from rotation of the proximal actuator 968, the proximal slider 974 move proximally with respect to the body 962 as well.",
        "The interlock 966 may be removed from the handpiece 958 such that the center slider 972 and proximal slider 974 are no longer axially coupled. By removing the interlock 966, the center slider 972 is able to be moved proximally with respect to the proximal slider 974. Such adjustability is advantageous when manipulating the implant 900, and catheter 948, and during decoupling of the implant 900 from the catheter 948, as described in greater detail below.",
        "In one embodiment, the center slider 972 is coupled to the cover pull-wire 940, such that proximal movement of the center slider 972 with respect to the body 962 results in proximal movement of the cover pull-wire 940 with respect to the catheter 948. In one embodiment, the proximal slider 974 is coupled to the tab pull-wire 944, such that proximal movement of the proximal slider 974 with respect to the body 962 results in proximal movement of the tab pull-wire 944 with respect to the catheter 948.",
        "In one embodiment, the implant 900 is transluminally delivered to and deployed inside of the coronary sinus of a medical patient according to the following procedure. An outer sheath (not shown) is transluminally delivered to a distal region of the coronary sinus by using methods well known to those of skill in the art. The exact location within the coronary sinus is determined by the medical practitioner according to the clinical requirements of the particular case. The outer sheath contains a lumen of sufficient diameter to receive the implant 900. The implant 900 is coupled to the catheter 948, which is coupled to the handpiece 958, as described in greater detail above.",
        "The implant 900 is advance distally to the distal tip of the outer tube by moving the handpiece 958 in the distal direction. The position of the implant 900 with respect to the outer tube and coronary sinus may be determined using fluoroscopic techniques, as are well known to those of skill in the art. When the implant 900 is properly positioned within the outer tube, within the coronary sinus, the outer tube is moved proximally, thereby exposing the distal tissue anchor 120. As described above, the distal tissue anchor 120 is biased to rotate to engage the medial wall of the coronary sinus under the force of the distal tissue anchor 120 spring 912. The handpiece 958 is then moved proximally to force the penetrating point 904 of the distal tissue anchor 120 into the heart tissue of the coronary sinus.",
        "Once the distal tissue anchor 120 has adequately engaged the inside wall of the coronary sinus, the outer sheath is moved proximally, thereby exposing the proximal tissue anchor 118. The shape of the proximal ribbon 902 allow proximal tissue anchor 118 to engage tissue.",
        "The implant 900 is adjusted so that the distance between the proximal tissue anchor 118 and the distal tissue anchor 120 is reduced, and the shape of the mitral valve annulus is modified to improve clinical performance, as described in greater detail herein. The handpiece 958 is held and the proximal actuator 968 is rotated. Rotating the proximal actuator 968 causes the tab pull-wire 944 and cover pull-wire 940 to move proximally, as described above. Proximal movement of the tab pull-wire 944 and cover pull-wire 940 is translated into proximal movement of the distal ribbon 914, as described above. The housing 920 of the tensioning element 190 is coupled to the catheter 948 at the catheter coupling 950, and the catheter 948 is coupled to the handpiece 958. Therefore, proximal movement of the cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944 with respect to the handpiece 958 causes the distal ribbon 914 and distal tissue anchor 120 to move proximally with respect to the housing 920 and proximal tissue anchor 118.",
        "In one embodiment, the medical practitioner verifies the position and shape of the implant 900 and mitral valve annulus using visualization techniques as are well known to those of skill in the art, including fluoroscopy. If the medical practitioner determines that the distal tissue anchor 120 needs to be moved distally, in one embodiment, the following procedure is followed. The distal actuator 964 is rotated with respect to the handpiece 958 until the distal actuator 964 moves proximally a distance equal to the release distance, as described in greater detail above. By doing so, the release wire 956 is moved proximally a distance equal to the release distance, which causes the opening 930 in the latch release ribbon 932 to move proximally a distance equal to the release distance as well. Such movement lifts the tang 928 of the latch 922 out of the slot 916 of the distal ribbon 914, so that the distal ribbon 914 may thereafter be moved distally by rotating the proximal actuator 968 in the opposite direction as rotated above.",
        "When the implant 900 is properly positioned, and the distance between the proximal tissue anchor 118 and the distal tissue anchor 120 has been adjusted to the appropriate dimension, the medical practitioner may then conclude the medical treatment by removing the catheter from the medical patient. To do so, in one embodiment, the catheter 948 is decoupled from the housing 920 of the implant 900, and the cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944 are decoupled from the distal ribbon 914.",
        "To decouple the cover pull-wire 940 and tab pull-wire 944 from the distal ribbon 914, the interlock 966 is removed from the handpiece 958, and the proximal actuator 968 is rotated with respect to the handpiece 958. As the proximal actuator 968 is rotated with the interlock 966 removed, the center slider 972 moves proximally with respect to the proximal slider 974, which causes the cover pull-wire 940 to move proximally with respect to the tab pull-wire 944. Proximal movement of the cover pull-wire 940 causes the cover 938 to move proximally with respect to the tab 942, thereby allowing the tab 942 to disengage from the pull-wire disconnect 918 of the distal ribbon 914. The tab 942 may disengage from the pull-wire disconnect 918 under its own bias, or may be removed therefrom by rotating the handpiece 958, as described below.",
        "To decouple the catheter 948 from the housing 920 of the implant 900, the distal actuator 964 is rotated until it moves proximally with respect to the handpiece 958 over a distance sufficiently greater than the release distance. In one embodiment, the distal actuator 964 is rotated until its proximal movement is limited by interference between the pin 976 and the proximal edge of the axial slot 978. Such movement causes the fingers 954 attached to the distal end of the catheter 948 flex inward a distance sufficient to clear the slot 952 in the housing 920, and latch release ribbon 932 is fully withdrawn, as described above. The handpiece 958 is then rotated and moved proximally, which causes the fingers 954 of the catheter 948 to rotate and move out of the housing 920 slot 952. In one embodiment, the rotation and proximal movement of the handpiece 958 also causes the flange 946 of the tab 942 to disengage from the pull-wire disconnect 918 of the distal ribbon 914. The catheter 948 is then removed from the patient's body by pulling it proximally out of the outer tube.",
        "Referring to FIG. 33, there is illustrated a side elevational view of an implant in accordance with the present invention. The implant includes a distal anchor, 120 which is shown in additional detail in FIG. 34. The distal anchor 120 comprises a sharpened proximal end 702 for penetrating tissue. The distal end 704 is pivotally attached to the implant wall, such as by one or more pins 706 rotatably received within an aperture in the tubular wall. The distal anchor is moveable between a first position in which it extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the implant, to provide a low crossing profile, and a second position as illustrated in FIG. 34 when the tissue anchor is inclined radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis of the implant to engage tissue. Additional details of the distal anchor mechanism are illustrated in FIG. 36.",
        "The proximal end of the implant 710 is illustrated in FIG. 35. The implant includes a proximal tissue anchor 712, which inclines radially outwardly away from the implant in the distal direction, on the mitral valve side of the device, for engaging the wall of the coronary sinus. Any of a variety of deployment mechanisms may be utilized for the proximal tissue anchor 712.",
        "One or more of the proximal and distal anchors may be provided with a lateral alignment or biasing element for advancing the device laterally within the vessel so that the mitral valve side of the device is positioned against the coronary sinus wall. This will allow deployment of the proximal and distal anchors to fully engage the adjacent tissue. The lateral alignment structure illustrated in FIG. 35 is in the form of a flexible wire, strip, or loop 714 which, when released from the deployment catheter and/or advanced out of the implant, will reside within the coronary sinus and provide a lateral spring bias against the implant. In the illustrated embodiment, the loop 714 is in the form of a biased wire, such as nitinol. Any of a variety of structures may be utilized for maintaining the implant off center within the vessel, to optimize engagement of the tissue anchors with the vessel wall. For example, an inflatable side balloon on either the distal end of the deployment catheter or on the implant may be inflated during the tissue engaging step. Any of a variety of expandable wire cages may be mounted off center on either the implant or the distal end of the deployment catheter, for laterally moving the implant off center within the vessel.",
        "Referring to FIG. 36, there is illustrated a side elevational schematic view of the implant illustrated in FIGS. 33 through 35. As seen therein, the distal anchor 120 may be activated by axial proximal tension on the pull wire 720. The pull wire 720 is pivotally connected to the distal anchor 120, at a position which is offset laterally from an axis of rotation. The axis of rotation is concentric with one or more pins 706 which pivotally retain the distal anchor 120 in position at the distal end 722 of the implant. In the illustrated embodiment, proximal axial advancement of the pull wire 720 will cause the distal anchor 120 to incline radially outwardly with respect to the longitudinal axis of the implant.",
        "A spine support 722 is illustrated at the central segment of the implant. Spine support 722 may comprise any of a variety of elements, such as a flexible ribbon of stainless steel, nitinol or other material, for enhancing the column strength of the implant in this region.",
        "The proximal end 710 of the implant is illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 37. As seen therein, the anchor hoop 714 is schematically illustrated. Anchor hoop 714 may comprise any of a variety of structures, such as a loop as illustrated in FIG. 35 or other resilient element which may be biased radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis of the implant to contact the opposing side of the vessel wall and bias the proximal anchor hook 712 in the direction of the mitral valve side of the vessel wall.",
