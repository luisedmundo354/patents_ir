    "abstract": "An integrated circuit lithography technique called spectral engineering by Applicants, for bandwidth control of an electric discharge laser. In a preferred process, a computer model is used to model lithographic parameters to determine a desired laser spectrum needed to produce a desired lithographic result. A fast responding tuning mechanism is then used to adjust center wavelength of laser pulses in a burst of pulses to achieve an integrated spectrum for the burst of pulses approximating the desired laser spectrum. The laser beam bandwidth is controlled to produce an effective beam spectrum having at least two spectral peaks in order to produce improved pattern resolution in photo resist film. Line narrowing equipment is provided having at least one piezoelectric drive and a fast bandwidth detection control system having a time response of less than about 2.0 millisecond. In a preferred embodiment, a wavelength tuning mirror is dithered at dither rates of more than 500 dithers per second in phase with the repetition rate of the laser. In one case, the piezoelectric drive was driven with a square wave signal and in a second case it was driven with a sine wave signal. In another embodiment, the maximum displacement was matched on a one-to-one basis with the laser pulses in order to produce a desired average spectrum with two peaks for a series of laser pulses. Other preferred embodiments utilize three separate wavelength tuning positions producing a spectrum with three separate peaks.",

No. 09/501,160 filed Feb. 9, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,621,846. This invention relates to lasers and, in particular, to techniques for control of the bandwidth of the output beam.",
        "Lasers are used for many applications. For example, lasers, such as KrF and ArF excimer lasers, are used in stepper and scanner equipment for selectively exposing photoresist in a semiconductor wafer fabrication process. In such fabrication processes, the optics in the steppers and scanners are designed for a particular wavelength of the laser. The laser wavelength may drift over time and, thus, a feedback network is typically employed to detect the wavelength of the laser and correct the wavelength as necessary.",
        "In one type of feedback network used to detect and adjust the wavelength of a laser, an etalon receives a portion of the emitted light from the laser. The etalon creates an interference pattern having concentric bands of dark and light levels due to destructive and constructive interference by the laser light. The concentric bands surround a center bright portion. The diameter of a light band produced by an etalon is used to determine the wavelength of the laser to a fine degree, such as to within 0.01-0.03 pm. The width of a light band is used to determine the spectral width of the laser output. The interference pattern is usually referred to as a fringe pattern. A grating spectrometer is also used in prior art devices to measure wavelength to a relatively course degree. The fringe pattern and the grating signal may be optically detected by a sensitive photodetector array. A detailed description of a prior art wavemeter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,394 which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Various methods are well known for wavelength tuning of lasers. Typically the tuning takes place in a quickly replaceable modular device referred to as a line narrowing module or line narrowing package (LNP). A typical technique used for line narrowing and tuning of excimer lasers is to provide a window at the back of the discharge chamber through which a portion of the laser beam passes into the LNP. There, the portion of the beam is expanded in a beam expander and directed to a grating which reflects a narrow selected portion of the laser's natural broader spectrum back into the discharge chamber where it is amplified. The laser is typically tuned by changing the angle at which the beam illuminates the grating. This may be done by adjusting the position of the grating or providing a mirror adjustment with a pivoting mirror in the beam path. The adjustment of the grating position or the mirror position may be made by a mechanism which we will refer to as a laser wavelength adjustment mechanism.",
        "In the prior art, the typical feedback network is configured to maintain the nominal wavelength within a desired range of wavelengths. Typical specifications may establish this range at values such as \u22000.05 pm of a target wavelength such as, for example, 248,327.1 pm, for a KrF laser as applied to the average of the wavelengths of a series of pulses referred to as \u201cpulse window\u201d. A typical pulse window would be 30 pulses. Another typical specification is the standard deviation of the measured wavelength values for a series of pulses (such as 30 pulses). This value is referred to as wavelength sigma, \u03a6, and is calculated using a standard formula for standard deviations. Also, sometime specifications are in terms of 3 \u03a6 which is merely three times the measured standard deviation. A typical 3 \u03a6 specification may be 0.15 pm.",
        "The limitations of acceptable optical lens materials to fused silica and calcium fluoride for use with deep ultraviolet light at 248 nm and 193 nm wavelengths have meant that projection lenses for KrF and ArF lithography, to a large degree, cannot be corrected for wavelength variations. Chromatic aberrations emerge since the index of refraction of any optical material changes with wavelength, and hence, the imaging behavior of a lens also varies with wavelength.",
        "The detrimental effects of chromatic aberrations for an uncorrected lens can be mitigated by using a light source with a very narrow range of wavelengths. Spectral line-narrowed excimer lasers have served this purpose for deep-UV lithography. In the past, laser specifications have required the FWHM bandwidth to be smaller than a specified value such as 0.5 pm but with no lower limit on bandwidth. Specifications are also directed at the 95 percent integral bandwidth. A typical 95% I specification would be less than 1.2 ppm. However, recently integrated circuit manufacturers have noticed that the quality of their integrated circuits can be adversely affected by bandwidths, such as about 0.35 pm FWHM, which are substantially narrower than the bandwidths for which their optical systems were designed.",
        "A lithography technique, called FLEX (short for, \u201cfocus latitude enhancement exposure\u201d) has been shown (through simulation and experiment) to improve the depth of focus by utilizing multiple exposure passes of the same field with different focus settings. This technique is also commonly referred to as focus drilling, since the physical thickness of the photoresist film is exposed in multiple passes at incremental focus settings. The image in photoresist is formed by the composite of the multiple exposure passes.",
        "Several difficulties result from this FLEX process with both step and scan as well as step and repeat exposure implementations. Multiple pass exposure results in additional overlay (image placement) errors and image blurring. This has further implications on process latitude, focus repeatability as well as wafer throughput since multiple exposures require multiple imaging passes.",
        "What is needed is a better technique for providing improved quality integrated circuit lithographic exposures.",
        "The present invention provides an integrated circuit lithography technique called spectral engineering by Applicants, for bandwidth control of an electric discharge laser. In a preferred process, a computer model is used to model lithographic parameters to determine a desired laser spectrum needed to produce a desired lithographic result. A fast responding tuning mechanism is then used to adjust center wavelength of laser pulses in a burst of pulses to achieve an integrated spectrum for the burst of pulses approximating the desired laser spectrum. The laser beam bandwidth is controlled to produce an effective beam spectrum having at least two spectral peaks in order to produce improved pattern resolution in photo resist film. Line narrowing equipment is provided having at least one piezoelectric drive and a fast bandwidth detection control system having a time response of less than about 2.0 millisecond. In a preferred embodiment, a wavelength tuning mirror is dithered at dither rates of more than 500 dithers per second in phase with the repetition rate of the laser. In one case, the piezoelectric drive was driven with a square wave signal and in a second case it was driven with a sine wave signal. In another embodiment, the maximum displacement was matched on a one-to-one basis with the laser pulses in order to produce a desired average spectrum with two peaks for a series of laser pulses. Other preferred embodiments utilize three separate wavelength tuning positions producing a spectrum with three separate peaks. In another preferred embodiment, effective bandwidths in the range of 0.4 pm to 2.0 pm are produced in a series of pulses (such as a 30-pulse window of pulses).",

        "Simulation of the effects of wavelength and bandwidth changes have been performed by Applicants. The main effect of changing the exposure wavelength for a non-chromatic corrected lens is a change in the position of the focal plane. Over a fairly wide range of wavelengths, this change in focus is approximately linear with the change in the nominal wavelength (i.e., the central wavelength of the illumination spectrum). The wavelength response of a lens can be determined experimentally by manually changing the central wavelength of the laser and using the imaging sensor of the stepper to monitor the shift in focus that results. FIG. 1A shows an example of such a measurement.",
        "Given the change in focus with change in wavelength, the use of a broadband illumination spectrum means that each wavelength in the spectrum will produce an aerial image with a different best focus. The total aerial image will be a sum of the aerial images at each focal position, weighted by the relative intensity of each wavelength in the illumination spectrum. This technique is based on multiple focal plane exposures. Latest versions of a computer program PROLITH/2 (available from KLA Tencor with offices in Austin, Tex.,) incorporate these types of effects. Actual laser spectra measured on a variety of commercially available lasers were used in this work to represent laser spectra. FIG. 1B illustrates three examples of KrF laser spectra.",
        "In order to understand the impact of laser bandwidth on the lithographic process in the presence of chromatic aberrations, Applicants started from investigation of the aerial image of a 180 nm isolated line. FIG. 3 shows how changing bandwidth affects the aerial image under a specific set of conditions. (The image dimension is usually assumed to correspond to the 0.3 image intensity values.) For these simulations the following input parameters were used: NA=0.6, \u03a6=0.75, 80=248.3271 nm. Laser spectra with 0.5 pm, 1.2 pm, 2.1 pm bandwidths at FWHM and a monochromatic light source were used in this simulation study, and a chromatic aberration focus response of 0.225 \u03a6m/pm was assumed. As can be seen in FIG. 3, changes in the bandwidth causes noticeable changes in the image intensity distribution.",
        "The impact of laser bandwidths on critical dimensions (CD) variations of isolated lines with different sizes was evaluated using an aerial image threshold model. In this study the following lithography input parameter settings were used: \u03a6=0.75, 80=248.3271 nm, aerial image threshold at 30%, NA=0.6, 0.7, and 0.8. The simulations were performed for isolated lines ranging from 240 nm to 140 mn. The chromatic aberration response was assumed at 0.225 \u03a6m/pm. As shown in FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C, changes in the bandwidth (either increases or decreases) can result in substantial changes in the critical dimensions of the integrated circuit lines especially at higher numerical aperture values. As shown in FIGS. 4A-4C the smallest bandwidth (i.e., 0.35 pm) produces the smallest change in the critical dimension as a function of mask dimension. A reader might conclude from this data that lithography systems should be designed for the smallest possible bandwidth. The problem with that approach is that maintaining the bandwidth consistently at 0.35 pm over the life of the light source would be very difficult and expensive with today's technology. Therefore, the normal practice is to design lithography systems for best performance at a bandwidth which is somewhat larger than the smallest possible bandwidth, such as about 0.5 pm. But if a lithography system is designed for best performance at 0.5 pm, an \u201cimprovement\u201d in the laser bandwidth down to 0.35 pm will often lead to a worsening of critical dimensions and decreased quality of the integrated circuit.",
        "The wavelength and bandwidth monitoring equipment and the wavelength tuning equipment described in detail below permit bandwidth control of the laser beam. In a first embodiment the tuning mirror is dithered at a desired frequency and amplitude to basically widen a too narrow bandwidth to an effective bandwidth having a desired value.",
        "The technique involves monitoring the bandwidth with wavemeter 104 shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. If the bandwidth is less than the desired bandwidth the wavelength control equipment is utilized to dither mirror 14 shown in FIG. 5 at frequent intervals to cause very slight shifts in the spectrum on a pulse to pulse basis so that the average integrated spectrum over a window of pulses simulates approximately a constant spectrum with bandwidth approximating the desired bandwidth.",
        "For example, if the optical equipment for a scanner is designed for a bandwidth of 0.4 pm and because of a decrease in the fluorine concentration the bandwidth of individual pulses is 0.3 pm, mirror 14 may be dithered about its nominal position to produce plus and minus shifts in the nominal wavelength of about 0.05 pm in order to maintain the same nominal wavelength with the effective increase by 0.1 pm. For a typical commercial excimer laser of the type discussed above, a change in the pivot position of mirror 14 of about 2 nm is required to produce a 0.05 pm shift in the wavelength. This change in mirror position is easily provided by the piezoelectric drivers referred to above and shown in FIG. 5A as item 80. Typically in the integrated circuit fabrication each spot on the wafer is illuminated with a number of pulses usually in the range of about 30 to 150 pulses so that the dither rate should be sufficient so that each die spot receives about equal portions of pulses from both sides of the dither.",
        "Thus, if the number of pulses illuminating a spot is 30 the dither rate should be at least about \u00bc the pulse rate. So if the pulse rate is 2000 Hz the dither rate preferably would be at least 500 Hz. This is no problem for the equipment and software referred to above.",
        "FIG. 2A shows the variation of focus with centerline wavelength for a modem 0.6 NA stepper type lithography using a line narrowed KrF light source having a FWHM bandwidth of about 0.35 pm. FIG. 2A also include a plot of the laser spectrum plotted as normalized intensity versus deviation from the centerline wavelength. The focus versus centerline wavelength slope for this system is \u22120.23 \u03a6m/pm.",
        "Applicants have shown that substantial improvements in lithographic imaging can be provided using a spectral engineering techniques developed by Applicants. Applicants refer to this technique as RELAX which is an acronym for Resolution Enhancement by Laser-Spectrum Adjusted Exposure. In these techniques, the wafer is illuminated with two or more specific narrowband centerline wavelength during a single illumination period. This produces results which are improved over the dither technique referred to above. The results are similar to the FLEX technique discussed in the background section of this specification but constitutes a major improvement over FLEX since Applicants' technique involves only one positioning of the lithography equipment. Therefore, errors associated with adjustments of this equipment are avoided.",
        "The results of simulations performed by Applicants show proof of concept for use of a dual-mode illumination spectrum to improve resolution in photo resist film. In this dual mode simulation work, Applicants simulated the process parameters for 200 nm isolated, semi-dense (1:2) and dense (1:1) contact hole patterns. A binary (chrome on glass) reticle pattern and conventional illumination (e.g., a stepper system with a numerical aperture, NA of 0.7 and a 0.75 sigma) at KrF exposure central wavelengths, (8\u2245,=248.385 nm) were modeled in the simulation. The photo resist was modeled as UV6, 5200 A casting thickness on AR2 bottom anti-reflective coating in order to quantify the obtained resolution enhancement of the imaged pattern. The double-mode spectrum used as the simulation input is shown in FIG. 2B. In this case, the spectrum is generated by summation of a single mode (nominal) spectrum (bandwidth: FWHM=0.45 pm, E95%=1.86 pm) and its copy with a 4 pm wavelength offset. If S(8) represents the spectral density function of the nominal (0.45 pm/1.86 pm FWHM/E95%) spectrum, the spectral density of the double-peak RELAX spectrum [SRELAX(8)] can be expressed as SRELAX(8)=S(8)+S(8+4 pm). Technologies for actual generation of such spectral properties are discussed in the following section. The longitudinal focus plane to centerline wavelength slope used for this model is \u22120.225:m/pm which is shown in FIG. 2A.",
        "The results of this simulation of the double-peak RELAX technique are compared in FIG. 2C with similar simulations of a monochromatic beam and a conventional single peak spectrum with FWHM bandwidth of 0.45 pm and a 95% integral bandwidth of 1.86 pm. The critical dimension response to focus and dose are presented for 1:1 dense contact holes for three illumination spectral distributions; (1) monochromatic illumination, (2) conventional laser spectrum and (3) the 4 pm double mode RELAX illumination with a spectrum as shown in FIG. 2B (i.e., two 0.45 pm FWHM spectral bands with centerlines separated by 4.0 pm).",
        "FIG. 2D presents plots of the resist feature widths of holes which have a target diameter of 200 nm as a function of depth of the holes. The figures are plotted for several doses ranging from 17 J/cm2 to 26 J/cm2 in the monochromatic example and from 25 J/cm2 to 32 J/cm2 in the RELAX example. This ordinant is feature width and the absissa is labeled focus but actually represents the depth of the feature in microns with zero taken as the focal plane of the centerline wavelength. An \u201cideal\u201d graph would be a straight line at 200 nm over a depth of at least 1.0 micron, with insignificant variation in width with exposure dose. The FIG. 1D plots reveal that the RELAX simulation produces a set of plots much closer to the \u201cideal\u201d graph than either the conventional or monochromatic example.",
        "FIG. 2D is another set of graphs made from the same data as was used for the FIG. 2C plots. In this case, Applicants selected the plot for each of the examples and plotted for that exposure the exposure latitude (i.e., the percent of the dose can vary without causing the critical dimension to vary more than 10% from a target value) as a function of the depth of a hole having a target width of 200 nm. Again, these three graphs show a great improvement in performance resulting from the use of the RELAX techniques.",
        "The dramatic improvement in the depth for which the critical dimension can be controlled to within 10% with the RELAX approach is apparent. The improvement in depth of focus is larger than fourfold at the 5% exposure latitude level compared to the monochromatic and conventional results for dense contacts. Some exposure latitude loss is observed by using the double-mode spectrum. This loss in exposure latitude is most pronounced near best focus (i.e., 0.0 depth of focus). As compared with the conventional spectrum example, the slight increase in the target dose (from about 25 mJ/cm2 to about 29 mJ/cm2) for the RELAX case as compared to the conventional example should be noted.",
        "The simulation results for the other pattern configurations referred to above were tested with the result that the two-peak RELAX technique produced better pattern resolution as compared to both monochromatic and the conventional spectrum for every example tested. Therefore, we conclude that the RELAX application (using a dual-mode spectrum with 4 pm mode separation) for focus drilling provides dramatic improvement in the overall process window area. A tradeoff is realized between depth of focus improvement and loss of exposure latitude, however, the DOF increases at a higher rate than the reduction of exposure latitude. In contact hole imaging especially, as well as many other imaging applications of lines and spaces, the DOF is a limiting process performance factor. Isolated lines and line-space patterns are also expected to exhibit process window changes for modified illumination spectra.",
        "Applicants have demonstrated the feasibility of technique for wavelength control needed for this spectral engineering as shown in FIGS. 2E and 2F. PZT driver 80 shown in FIG. 5A was programmed to control the wavelength of a KrF laser operating at 120 Hz to adjust each pulse by plus or minus steps of 4.0 pm. The integrated intensity values recorded on wavemeter photodiode array 180 shown in FIG. 6 are plotted in FIG. 2E. This plot shows sharp peaks at pixel 450 and 618 which correspond to a centerline wavelength shaft of 4.0 pm.",
        "Similar results are shown in FIG. 2F where the PZT driver is driven in a sine wave to vary the wavelength by about 2 pm at a frequency of one half the laser pulse rate of 120 Hz.",
        "The basic concept behind spectral engineering is to determine, using lithography simulation, the optimal spectral shape, which will provide the maximum improvement of a given parameter. In particular examples, lithography simulations are provided for two dual-mode illumination spectra and three three-mode illumination spectra shown in FIGS. 2G1, 2G2 and 2G3. In these examples, the parameter, which is maximized is the depth of focus, for 150 nm dense lines. From FIG. 2H1, we see that the two dual-peak spectra (3 pm and 4 pm separation) are least sensitive to defocus and therefore have a maximum depth of focus. From the depth of focus changes, it appears that spectral modification (going from monochromatic, to three to two mode illumination spectrum) provides significant (up to 2\u00d7) improvement of DOF. From this alone, either the 3 pm or 4 pm dual-mode illumination appears optimal for imaging of these features.",
        "If we consider the tradeoff between exposure latitude (EL) and depth of focus as a function of the different illumination spectra (shown in FIG. 2H2), we may choose to use the 1.5 pm-offset 50% weighted three-mode illumination in order to prevent the reduction in exposure latitude below 12% at best focus. The three-mode spectrum still provides an appreciable increase in depth of focus. In addition the three-mode spectrum (with 1.5 pm peak separation) provides the least amount of contrast loss from the monochromatic case as shown in FIG. 2H3.",
        "From this 150 nm dense line example, it is clear that the implementation of RELAX requires a very careful tradeoff design in order to maximize the benefits of a subset of imaging parameters at lowest cost to other parameters. The RELAX application will therefore be most successful in cases where a single parameter limits the overall process margin (process latitude). In that case, the limiting process parameter can be improved (relaxed) in order to improve to overall process margin for manufacturability. Optical proximity correction (OPC-resolution enhancement technique using reticle feature corrections) can be used in conjunction with RELAX for comprehensive lithography process engineering and maximum benefits.",
        "The tuning of the RELAX spectral illumination, from a continuum of theoretical choices can be done using lithography simulation and an iterative optimization algorithm. The simulation predictions also need to be verified and fine-tuned using experimental methods (such as design of experiments-DOE). Both approaches have been discussed in more detail previously (section IV-B 05/25/01 disclosure). FIG. 2I shows the confluence of simulation and experiments (DOE) for either S(\u03bb) spectrum optimization only or for a comprehensive lithography process optimization (variable lithography inputs) using RELAX.",
        "In prior art devices the feedback control of pulse energy has been on a pulse-to-pulse basis, i.e., the pulse energy of each pulse is measured quickly enough so that the resulting data can be used in the control algorithm to control the energy of the immediately following pulse. For a 1,000 Hz system this means the measurement and the control for the next pulse must take less than 1/1000 second. For a 4000 Hz system speeds need to be four times as fast.

Because the laser repetition rate may be 4,000 Hz to 6,000 Hz, it is necessary to use algorithms which are accurate but not computationally intensive in order to achieve the desired performance with economical and compact processing electronics. Calculational algorithm therefore preferably should use integer as opposed to floating point math, and mathematical operations should preferably be computation efficient (no use of square root, sine, log, etc.).",
        "The specific details of a preferred algorithm used in this preferred embodiment will now be described. FIG. 6D is a curve with 5 peaks as shown which represents a typical etalon fringe signal as measured by linear photo diode array 180. The central peak is drawn lower in height than the others. As different wavelengths of light enter the etalon, the central peak will rise and fall, sometimes going to zero. This aspect renders the central peak unsuitable for the wavelength measurements. The other peaks will move toward or away from the central peak in response to changes in wavelength, so the position of these peaks can be used to determine the wavelength, while their width measures the bandwidth of the laser. Two regions, each labeled data window, are shown in FIG. 6D. The data windows are located so that the fringe nearest the central peak is normally used for the analysis.",
        "However, when the wavelength changes to move the fringe too close to the central peak (which will cause distortion and resulting errors), the first peak is outside the window, but the second closest peak will be inside the window, and the software causes the processor in control module 197 to use the second peak. Conversely, when the wavelength shifts to move the current peak outside the data window away from the central peak the software will jump to an inner fringe within the data window. The data windows are also depicted on FIG. 6B.",

This was a relatively time consuming process even with a computer processor because about 400 pixel intensity values had to be analyzed to look for and describe the etalon fringes for each calculation of wavelength and bandwidth. A preferred embodiment of the present invention greatly speeds up this process by providing a processor for finding the important fringes which operates in parallel with the processor calculating the wavelength information.",

Logic device 402 also identifies which of the sets of fringe data represent fringe data of interest. Then when a calculation of center wavelength and bandwidth are needed, microprocessor merely picks up the data from the identified pixels of interest and calculates the needed values of center wavelength and bandwidth. This process reduces the calculation time for microprocessor by about a factor of about 10.",
        "Specific steps in the process of calculating center wavelength and bandwidth are as follows:\n\n    1) With PDA 180 clocked to operate at 2.5 MHz, PDA 180 is directed by processor 400 to collect data at a from pixels 1 to 600 at a scan rate of 4,000 Hz and to read pixels 1 to 1028 at a rate of 100 Hz.\n    2) The analog pixel intensity data produced by PDA 180 is converted from analog intensity values into digital 8 bit values (0 to 255) by analog to digital converter 410 and the digital data are stored temporily in RAM buffer 408 as 8 bit values representing intensity at each pixel of photodiode array 180.\n    3) Programmable logic device 402 analyzes the data passing out of RAM buffer 408 continuously on an almost real time basis looking for fringes, stores all the data in RAM memory 406, identifies all fringes for each pulse, produces a table of fringes for each pulse and stores the tables in RAM 406, and identifies for further analysis one best set of two fringes for each pulse. The technique used by logic device 402 is as follows:\n    \n        A) PLD 402 analyzes each pixel value coming through buffer 408 to determine if it exceeds an intensity threshold while keeping track of the minimum pixel intensity value. If the threshold is exceeded this is an indication that a fringe peak is coming. The PLD identifies the first pixel above threshold as the \u201crising edge\u201d pixel number and saves the minimum pixel value of the pixels preceding the \u201crising edge\u201d pixel. The intensity value of this pixel is identified as the \u201cminimum\u201d of the fringe.\n        B) PLD 402 then monitors subsequent pixel intensity values to search for the peak of the fringe. It does this by keeping track of the highest intensity value until the intensity drops below the threshold intensity.\n        C) When a pixel having a value below threshold is found, the PLD identifies it as the falling edge pixel number and saves the maximum value. The PLD then calculates the \u201cwidth\u201d of the fringe by subtracting the rising edge pixel number from the falling edge pixel number.\n        D) The four values of rising edge pixel number, maximum fringe intensity, minimum fringe intensity and width of the fringe are stored in the circular table of fringes section of RAM memory bank 406. Data representing up to 15 fringes can be stored for each pulse although most pulses only produce 2 to 5 fringes in the two windows.\n        E) PLD 402 also is programmed to identify with respect to each pulse the \u201cbest\u201d two fringes for each pulse. It does this by identifying the last fringe completely within the 0 to 199 window and the first fringe completely within the 400 to 599 window.",
        "The total time required after a pulse for (1) the collection of the pixel data, and (2) the formation of the circular table of fringes for the pulse is only about 200 micro seconds. The principal time saving advantages of this technique is that the search for fringes is occurring as the fringe data is being read out, digitized and stored. Once the two best fringes are identified for a particular pulse, microprocessor 400 secures the raw pixel data in the region of the two fringes from RAM memory bank 406 and calculates from that data the bandwidth and center wavelength. The calculation is as follows:",
        "Typical shape of the etalon fringes are shown in FIG. 6D. Based on the prior work of PLD 402 the fringe having a maximum at about pixel 180 and the fringe having a maximum at about pixel 450 will be identified to microprocessor 400. The pixel data surrounding these two maxima are analyzed by microprocessor 400 to define the shape and location of the fringe. This is done as follows:",
        "A half maximum value is determined by subtracting the fringe minimum from the fringe maximum dividing the difference by 2 and adding the result to the fringe minimum. For each rising edge and each falling edge of the two fringes the two pixels having values of closest above and closest below the half maximum value. Microprocessor then extrapolates between the two pixel values in each case to define the end points of D1 and D2 as shown in FIG. 6D with a precision of 1/32 pixel. From these values the inner diameter D1 and the outer diameter D2 of the circular fringe are determined.",
        "The fine wavelength calculation is made using the course wavelength measured value and the measured values of D1 and D2.",
        "The basic equation for wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb=(2*n*d/m) cos (R/f)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere\n\n    \n    \n        \u03bb is the wavelength, in picometers,\n        n is the internal index of refraction of the etalon, about 1.0003,\n        d is the etalon spacing, about 1542 um for KrF lasers and about 934:m for ArF lasers, controlled to +/\u22121 um,\n        m is the order, the integral number of wavelengths at the fringe peak, about 12440,\n        R is the fringe radius, 130 to 280 PDA pixels, a pixel being 25 microns,\n        f is the focal distance from the lens to the PDA plane.",
        "Expanding the cos term and discarding high order terms that are negligibly small yields:\n\n\u03bb=(2*n*d/m)[1\u2212(\u00bd)(R/f)2]\u2003\u2003(2)",

        "The wavemeter's principal task is to calculate \u03bb from D. This requires knowing f, n, d and m. Since n and d are both intrinsic to the etalon we combine them into a single calibration constant named ND. We consider f to be another calibration constant named FD with units of pixels to match the units of D for a pure ratio. The integer order m varies depending on the wavelength and which fringe pair we choose. m is determined using the coarse fringe wavelength, which is sufficiently accurate for the purpose.",
        "A couple of nice things about these equations is that all the big numbers are positive values. The WCM's microcontroller is capable of calculating this while maintaining nearly 32 bits of precision. We refer to the bracketed terms as FRAC.\n\nFRAC=[1\u2212(\u215b)(D/FD)2]\u2003\u2003(4)",
        "Internally FRAC is represented as an unsigned 32 bit value with its radix point to the left of the most significant bit. FRAC is always just slightly less than one, so we get maximal precision there. FRAC ranges from [1-120E-6] to [1-25E-6] for D range of {560\u02dc260} pixels.",
        "When the ND calibration is entered, the wavemeter calculates an internal unsigned 64 bit value named 2ND=2*ND with internal wavelength units of femtometers (fm)=10\u221215 meter=0.001 pm. Internally we represent the wavelength \u03bb as FWL for the fine wavelength, also in fm units. Restating the equation in terms of these variables:\n\nFWL=FRAC*2ND/m\u2003\u2003(5)",

        "The bandwidth of the laser is computed as (82\u221281)/2. A fixed correction factor is applied to account for the intrinsic width of the etalon peak adding to the true laser bandwidth.

        "This embodiment utilizes an improved etalon. Conventional etalon mounting schemes typically employ an elastomer to mount the optical elements to the surrounding structure, to constrain the position of the elements but minimize forces applied to the elements. A compound commonly used for this is room-temperature vulcanizing silicone (RTV). However, various organic vapors emitted from these elastomers can deposit onto the optical surfaces, degrading their performance. In order to prolong etalon performance lifetime, it is desirable to mount the etalon in a sealed enclosure that does not contain any elastomer compounds.",
        "A preferred embodiment includes an improved etalon assembly shown at 184 in FIGS. 6 and 6E. The fused silica etalon 79 shown in FIG. 6G itself is comprised of a top plate 80 having a flange 81 and a lower plate 82, both plates being comprised of premium grade fused silica. The etalon is designed to produce fringes having free spectral range of 20.00 pm at 193.35 nm when surrounded by gas with an index of refraction of 1.0003 and a finesse equal to or greater than 25. Three fused silica spacers 83 with ultra low thermal expansion separate the plates and are 934 micrometer \u2200 1 micrometer thick. These hold the etalon together by optical contact using a technique well known in the optics manufacturing art. The reflectance of the inside surfaces of the etalon are each about 88 percent and the outside surfaces are anti-reflection coated. The transmission of the etalon is about 50 percent.",
        "The etalon 79 is held in place in aluminum housing 84 only by gravity and three low force springs 86 pressing the flange against three pads not shown but positioned on 120 degree centers under the bottom edge of flange 81 at the radial location indicated by leader 85. A clearance of only 0.004 inch along the top edge of flange 81 at 87 assures that the etalon will remain approximately in its proper position. This close tolerance fit also ensures that if any shock or impulse is transferred to the etalon system through the mounting, the relative velocities between the optical components and the housing contact points will be kept to a minimum. Other optical components of etalon assembly 184 include diffuser 88, window 89 and focusing lens 90 having a focal length of 458.4 mm.",
        "The diffuser 88 may be a standard prior art diffuser commonly used up-stream of an etalon to produce a great variety of incident angles needed for the proper operation of the etalon. A problem with prior art diffusers is that about 90 percent of the light passing through the diffuser is not at a useful angle and consequently is not focused on the photo diode array. This wasted light, however, adds to the heating of the optical system and can contribute to degradation of optical surfaces. In a much preferred embodiment, a diffractive lens array is used as the diffuser 88. With this type of diffuser, a pattern is produced in the diffractive lens array which scatters the light thoroughly but only within an angle of about 5 degrees. The result is that about 90 percent of the light falling on the etalon is incident at useful angles and a much greater portion of the light incident on the etalon is ultimately detected by the photo diode array. The result is the light incident on the etalon can be greatly reduced which greatly increases optical component life. Applicants estimate that the incident light can be reduced to less than 5% or 10% of prior art values with equivalent light on the photo diode array.",
        "FIG. 6H shows features of a preferred embodiment providing even further reduction of light intensity passing through the etalon. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment discussed above. The sample beam from mirror 182 (approximately 15 mm\u00d73 mm) passes upward through condensing lens 400 and is then re-collimated by lens 402. The beam now colliminated and reduced in dimension to about 5 mm\u00d71 mm passes through etalon housing window 404 and then passes through a diffractive diffusing element 406 which in this case (for an ArF laser) is a diffractive diffusing element provided by Mems Optical, Inc. with offices in Huntsville, Ala. The element is part number D023-193 which converts substantially all 193 nm light in any incoming collimated beam of any cross sectional configuration into a beam expanding in a first direction at 2E and in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction at 4E. Lens 410 then Afocuses\u2245the expanding beam onto a rectangular pattern covering photodiode array 180 shown in FIG. 6. The active area of the photo diode array is about 0.5 mm wide and 25.6 mm long and the spot pattern formed by lens 410 is about 15 mm\u00d730 mm. Diffractive diffusing element thoroughly mixes the spatial components of the beam but maintains substantially all of the beam energy within the 2E and 4E limits so that the light passing through the etalon can be substantially reduced and efficiently utilized. The reader should recognize that further reductions in beam energy passing through the etalon could be realized by reducing the spot pattern in the short dimension of the photo diode array. However, further reductions to less than 15 mm will make optical alignment more difficult. Therefore, the designer should consider the spot pattern size to be a trade-off issue.",

In this embodiment and in the ArF embodiment, the spacing between the two lenses can be properly positioned with spacer 416.

Earlier methods of mirror positioning required about 7 ms to move mirror 14, making pulse-to-pulse wavelength correction at 2000 Hz out of the question. In that earlier technique, a lever arm pivoted about a pivot axis to produce a 1 to 26.5 reduction in the mirror movement compared to the stepper position movement. The prior art stepper has a total travel of \u00bd inch (12.7 mm) and 6000 steps so that each step is a distance of about 2 microns. With the 1-26.5 reduction, one step moves the mirror about 75 nm which typically changes the wavelength of the laser wavelength about 0.1 pm.

In a preferred embodiment the control for each pulse at 4000 Hz pulse rate is based not on the previous pulse but the pulse prior to the previous pulse to allow plenty of time for the wavelength calculation. However, this embodiment provides a factor of 7 improvement over the prior art design with a 7 millisecond latency. Therefore, much faster feedback control can be provided. One preferred feedback control algorithm is described in FIG. 8D. In this algorithm the wavelength is measured for each pulse and an average wavelength for the last four and last two pulses is calculated. If either of the averages deviate from the target wavelength by less than 0.02 pm, no adjustment is made. If both deviate more than 0.02 pm from the target, an adjustment is made to the mirror assembly by piezoelectric stack 80 to provide a wavelength correction. Which of the two averages is used is determined by how much time had elapsed since the last adjustment. The piezoelectric stack is maintained within its control range by stepping the stepper motor as the stack approaches 30 and 70 percent of its range (or to provide more available range, 45 and 55 percent could be used instead of the 30 and 70 percent range values). Since the stepper motor requires about 7 ms to complete a step, the algorithm may make several piezo adjustments during a stepper motor step.",

The heavy line represents the actual wavelength output by the laser. The simulation was started with the input signal to actuator, u(t), set equal to zero for all 30 pulses. The simulation shows that within 250 ms, nearly perfect following of the commanded input has been achieved.",
        "An additional refinement can be made to the control law analogous to using the basis functions of Equation 7. Instead of allowing the controller to cancel the signal at all harmonics, we can limit the cancellation to just the first few harmonics by not including all of the terms in Equation 17.",

        "An example of the loop transfer function which results for n=3 is shown in FIG. 9C. Infinite gain is achieved only at DC and the first three harmonics. Again, a Nyquist plot (not shown) reveals that stability is still being maximized. Application of this control law would yield optimal matching of the desired wavelength pattern r, subject to the constraint that the control signal is band limited.",
        "FIG. 9D shows the simulation using the FIG. 9C transfer function. As before the light line represents the desired pattern and the heavy line represents the actual wavelength of the laser. Note that while the cancellation is no longer perfect, convergence was achieved in only 40 ms, an 84% reduction over the full order case.",
        "For reasons discussed in the previous section, care must be exercised in applying controls to the PZT in order to vary the center line wavelength to simulate a broader bandwidth for a series of pulses. This is because the response of the PZT controlled tuning mirror system is not linear for periodic signal inputs. The apparent gain of the PZT device increases with higher voltage inputs. Further, even if the system were perfectly linear, the dynamics might vary over time. A system initially producing the desired wavelength and bandwidth values would eventually produce distorted values as the dynamics drifted away from the design point. In fact, substantial resonances are present in the typical system at high frequency input signals. FIGS. 9A and 9C indicate the general shapes of damping functions needed to compensate for resonances at frequencies higher than about 50 Hz.",
        "The PZT driver can be programmed to simulate virtually any desired spectrum. Some of the techniques for precisely controlling the wavelength with the PZT driving the tuning mirror 14 are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/027,210 filed simultaneously with this application and incorporated by reference herein. For example, FIG. 10A shows a desired Gaussian spectrum with FWHM of 3.3 pm and a simulated fit for a 30-pulse window of pulses having a FWHM of 0.8 pm. FIG. 10B shows a proposed sequence of pulses for the 30-pulse window in which the center line wavelength follows a generally sine pattern. FIG. 10C compares the frequency content of a smooth wavelength sequence such as the FIG. 10B with a random sequence. FIGS. 10D and 10E show the effect of 133 Hz sine pattern and a 30-pulse window and a 40 Hz sine with a 100-pulse window. FIGS. 10F and 10G show how to produce a flat-top spectrum.",
        "The reader should understand that rapid changes in mirror position result in substantial non-linearities. One solution could be to syncronize mirror motion with pulse repetition rate such as shown in FIG. 10H and FIG. 10I.",
        "While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention in its broader aspects. For example, partially line narrowed lasers where the bandwidth is line narrowed with a plurality of prisms and the beam is reflected with a tuning mirror. This technique would involve dithering the tuning mirror. The peak separation could vary from the examples shown. Normally, however, the peaks would be offset by at least 0.5 pm. In lithography, bursts of pulses normally contain about 20 to 400 pulses. Most lithography units now operate at 1000 Hz or greater. It should also be recognized that these dithering techniques helps to eliminate coherence problems. Instead of dithering the mirror to increase the effective bandwidth, the grating could be dithered with a dither pattern chosen to produce an effective larger bandwidth or desired effective spectrum. Therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention."
