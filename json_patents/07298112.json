        "The present invention relates to a deadbeat control method and a deadbeat control unit for an asynchronous rotary electrical machine and to a storage medium for use in that deadbeat control method.",
        "In the remainder of the description, the term \u201cmotor\u201d refers to an asynchronous rotary electrical machine. By way of a preamble to the description given below, it should be pointed out here that an asynchronous rotary electrical machine is an isotropic motor, i.e. a motor in which the direct inductances are equal to the quadrature inductances. In the case of isotropic machines, the dimensions m and n as defined below are made smaller by writing matrices and vectors in the complex plane.",
        "Deadbeat control methods can use the state equation formalism known in the art that is based on the principle that the state of a motor is entirely described by known values taken by parameters representing its degrees of freedom. The state of a motor can be characterized by an n-dimensional state vector {right arrow over (X)} where n is equal to the number of degrees of freedom. Changes in the machine resulting from a control input represented by an m-dimensional control vector {right arrow over (V)} adapted to control the machine are then described by the following system of linear state equations, which will be familiar to the person skilled in the art of automatic control:\n\n{right arrow over ({dot over (X)}=A\u00b7{right arrow over (X)}+B\u00b7{right arrow over (V)}\u2003\u2003(1)",
        "where:\n\n    \n    \n        {right arrow over ({dot over (X)} is the derivative with respect to time of the state vector {right arrow over (X)};\n        {right arrow over (V)} is the instantaneous control vector;\n        A is an n.n-dimensional matrix of free behavior of the machine in the absence of any control input; and\n        B is an n.m-dimensional control matrix.",
        "In the case of isotropic motors, the dimensions n and m are made smaller by writing matrices and vectors in the complex plane.",
        "The two matrices A and B represent a linear model of the motor and are obtained from electrical differential equations of the motor for a given dynamic state. A model that is not linear must be linearized about an operating point and in this case it is therefore necessary to have a plurality of models available.",
        "To determine the state of the motor at the end of an interval T of continuous application of an average control vector {right arrow over ( V, it is necessary to integrate equation (1) between two times tn and tn+1 spaced in time by the interval T. The result may be put into the form of a discrete system of state equations known in the art:\n\n{right arrow over (X)}(tn+1)=F(T)\u00b7{right arrow over (X)}(tn)+G(T)\u00b7{right arrow over ( V(tn\u2192n+1)\u2003\u2003(2)",
        "where:\n\n    \n    \n        F(T) is an n.n-dimensional transition matrix of the motor defined by F=eA.T;\n        G(T) is an n.m-dimensional control matrix defined by G=A\u22121\u00b7(eA\u00b7T\u02dcInn)\u00b7B where Inn is the n.n-dimensional unit matrix;\n        {right arrow over (X)}(tn+1) and {right arrow over (X)}(tn) are the state vectors at the times tn+1 and tn, respectively; and\n        {right arrow over ( V(tn\u2192n+1) is the average control vector applied during the interval T, i.e. from the time tn to the time tn+1.",
        "The average control vector {right arrow over ( V is either an instantaneous vector applied continuously during the interval T or the average of a time succession of instantaneous control vectors {right arrow over (V)} applied directly to the motor during the interval T. In the case of a time succession of instantaneous vectors, each instantaneous vector is applied for a time period that is very short compared to the time constants of the motor, with the result that the application of this succession of instantaneous vectors produces the same effects as the continuous application of a single instantaneous vector of selected phase and amplitude during the same time interval T.",
        "A succession of instantaneous vectors is often used because most motor drives can produce only a limited number of amplitudes and phases of the instantaneous control vectors. For example, a three-phase inverter can produce only six different non-zero instantaneous control vectors. This being so, to be able to obtain a control vector of any amplitude and phase from a three-phase inverter, it is standard practice to apply directly to the motor a time",
        "succession of instantaneous control vectors whose average value {right arrow over ( V between the times tn and tn+1 is equal to an average control vector whose phase and amplitude are selected at will. For example, a pulse width modulation method produces an average control vector whose phase and amplitude may be chosen at will from a power supply device able to produce only a limited number of phases and amplitudes of the instantaneous control vectors.",
        "In the remainder of the description, unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201ccontrol vector\u201d refers to an average control vector.",
        "A control vector is typically a voltage vector applying a specific voltage to all phases of the motor simultaneously.",
        "If a model (A, B) of the motor and an initial state {right arrow over (X)}0={right arrow over (X)}(tn), which may be measured, for example, or estimated on the basis of an observer such as a Kalman filter, are known, it becomes possible to predict the new state {right arrow over (X)}p={right arrow over (X)}(tn+T) after continuous application of the control vector {right arrow over ( V during the interval T.",
        "In contrast, it is possible to calculate the control vector {right arrow over ( V to be applied for the predicted state to coincide with a set point state, which amounts to replacing {right arrow over (X)}p with a set point state {right arrow over (X)}c. The discrete system of state equations then becomes:\n\n{right arrow over (X)}c=F(T)\u00b7{right arrow over (X)}0+G(T)\u00b7{right arrow over ( V\u2003\u2003(3)",
        "However, the matrix G(T) is not square and therefore cannot be inverted, with the result that we do not know how to calculate analytically the control vector {right arrow over ( V that is the solution of the system of equations (3).",
        "This being the case, the system of equations is conventionally inverted and the control vector calculated by means of approximate methods. In the case of rotary motors or rotary electrical machines in which the magnetic flux varies slowly, the approximation comprises assuming the magnetic flux of the motor is established under steady state conditions.",
        "By means of this kind of approximation, it is then possible to calculate a control vector enabling a set point torque to be achieved at the end of the interval T. European Patent Application EP-A-1 045 514 discloses one example of the above kind of deadbeat control method.",
        "However, when this kind of deadbeat control method is used in practice, the motor becomes progressively demagnetized. These control methods therefore have the drawback that it is necessary to add a loop to slave the magnetic flux of the motor to a set point flux to prevent demagnetization of the motor by the deadbeat control method.",
        "The invention aims to solve this problem by proposing a deadbeat control method in which it is not necessary to use an additional loop to slave the magnetic flux of the motor.",
        "Thus the invention comprises a deadbeat control method of controlling a motor whose magnetic flux depends on its energization current, the method comprising:",
        "a) a step of establishing a set point current that is adapted to achieve at the end of the interval T both the mechanical force set point and a set point magnetic flux and is established on the basis of a relationship between the set point current, the set point magnetic flux and initial current and magnetic flux values at the beginning of the interval T; and\n\nb) a step of calculating the average control vector to be applied continuously during the interval T to obtain at the end of the interval T a current equal to the set point current established during the step a).",
        "In contrast to the prior art deadbeat control method, the above method first establishes a current set point for achieving both the mechanical force set point and a set point magnetic flux before calculating the control vector for achieving the set point current. The magnetization of the motor is therefore preserved without it being necessary to add a magnetic flux control loop for this purpose, since the magnetic flux is kept equal to the set point magnetic flux.",
        "Embodiments of this control method may have one or more of the following features:\n\n    \n    \n        the set point current is a solution of the following relationship in the complex plane:\n\n(a2\u00b7p11\u2212a1\u00b7p21)\u00b7{right arrow over (I)}c+(a2\u00b7p12\u2212a1\u00b7p22)\u00b7{right arrow over (\u03a6)}c=(a2\u00b7e1\u00b7p11\u2212a1\u00b7e2p21)\u00b7{right arrow over (I)}0+(a2\u00b7e1\u00b7p12 \u2212a1\u00b7e2\u00b7p22)\u00b7{right arrow over (\u03a6)}0",

        "For a rotary electrical machine, since the objective is to obtain a mechanical force, it is practical to choose a state vector {right arrow over (X)} made up of the state of the energization current of the machine and the state of the magnetic flux of the machine. In fact, through a simple vector product, the amplitudes and the angle between a current vector and a magnetic flux vector translate a force objective into objectives as to the coordinates of those vectors in a system of axes chosen to simplify their expressions. Here the system of axes is an orthogonal system of axes whose abscissa axis is aligned with the magnetic flux vector. In this case, the Laplace law vector product is expressed by the product of the modulus of the magnetic flux and the modulus of the projection of the current vector onto the ordinate axis at the same time, ignoring a constant depending on the machine. Moreover, the product of the modulus of the magnetic flux and the modulus of the projection of the current vector onto the abscissa axis at the same time defines the scalar product of the current and magnetic flux vectors and therefore the magnetic energy of the machine in a Park representation, ignoring a multiplication constant depending on the machine.",

This transformation \u0393T depends of course on the value of the interval T, since it goes from the set point system of axes to the initial system of axes (the system is assumed to be causal with this form of representation).

        "Note that if the coefficient (a2\u00b7p11\u2212a1\u00b7p21) is zero, the mutual dependency of the set point current and the set point flux across the initial state disappears completely, which in practice means that it is not possible to control the flux vector from the current vector. The flux is therefore either constant or controlled in some other way, and the deadbeat control method described here does not apply.",

        "Because the control vector is applied here to a three-phase rotary electrical motor in a system of axes fixed relative to the stator, a state vector is selected that is made up of the stator current vector {right arrow over (I)}s and the rotor flux vector \u03a6r as seen from the stator in the orthogonal system of axes usually called (\u03b1,\u03b2), fixed relative to the stator of the motor after reduction by the number of pairs of magnetic poles of the motor. The Concordia transformation is used for this change from the three-phase system to the two-phase system in this reference orthogonal system of axes (\u03b1,\u03b2). The \u03b1 axis may be selected in the electrical polar direction of the phase R, for example.",
        "The stator current vector can be measured with the aid of current sensors disposed externally of the motor and in series with the phases or some of the phases of the motor. The rotor flux vector is known from the motor voltages and currents or can be observed. These two vectors are used to estimate or calculate an initial state. They are also used conjointly to translate a mechanical torque set point by their vector product and therefore by their coordinates as well as a magnetic energy set point, if necessary.",
        "The selected state vector is therefore 4-dimensional in this case. There are four electrical degrees of freedom. It may be denoted interchangeably with two vectors selected to simplify the notation or with complex numbers representing them in the complex system of axes (\u03b1,\u03b2), \u03b2 being the pure imaginary axis, to simplify the calculation of the eigenvalues by reducing the rank of the matrices from four to two (in the complex plane).",

Moreover we prepare to calculate the control vector to be applied so that these set points are obtained simultaneously at the end of the interval T taking account of the electrical time constants by way of the model. The calculation is therefore an exact calculation necessitating no slaving or decoupling of the two axes.",

To be more precise, under the control of a control unit 18, the inverter 14 converts the DC voltage from a DC voltage supply 16 into a three-phase supply voltage for the motor 12.",

Each of the sensors 20 to 22 is adapted to measure the stator current in one phase of the motor 12. Each of the sensors 24 to 26 is adapted to measure the stator voltage in a respective phase of the motor 12.",
        "The unit 18 is also adapted to receive measurements of the angular speed of the rotor of the motor 12 effected by a sensor 28. However, measurement of the mechanical speed of the rotor may be replaced by an estimate thereof, for example an extended KALMAN estimate.",

        "In the case of a voltage inverter, the control vector is a voltage vector whose coordinates are defined in a fixed system of axes of the inverter.",
        "To calculate this control vector, the unit 18 includes in particular a module 30 for establishing the set point current enabling the set points Cc and \u03a6c to be achieved at the end of the interval T and a module 32 for calculating the control vector to be applied continuously during the interval T to obtain at the end of that interval T a current equal to the set point current established by the module 30.",

        "The method and the system are described here in the particular situation in which the exact analytical solution yielding both the current set point vector and the control vector is implemented. Alternatively, terms of these exact analytic solutions that are negligible can be omitted, as a function of the specific application envisaged.

        "The system 10 has been described in the particular situation where the motor is controlled by an inverter. However, the description applies equally to motors controlled by switch mode controllers, amplifiers or rectifiers capable of producing the calculated control voltage.",
        "Finally, as indicated in the introduction, if the system of state equations describing the operation of the motor is not linear, it is possible to linearize it around a plurality of operating points and to apply the method and the system described above to each linearized system."
