        "The development of films or coatings as protective films for display devices such as a CRT screen is well documented in the art. These include antireflective coatings, hardcoats, optical coatings, and the like. Nevertheless, there continues to be a need for further improvement in the development of polymerizable high index materials for optical applications. Exemplary applications include antireflective coatings, hardcoats, and brightness enhancement film materials. Many polymerizable films have a refractive index of 1.5 or less. Because of the optical advantages, however, an increase of the refractive index to 1.58 or more would be a desirable improvement. Furthermore, there is a need for durable, inexpensive, and yet high quality antireflective coatings that exhibit a relatively low reflectance, that is less than 1%.",
        "The above-referenced concerns are resolved by the development of new ultraviolet curable monomers employing a substituted fluorene structure. Bromine is readily substituted at the 2 position in the mono brominated derivative, the 2 and 7 positions in the dibrominated derivative and the 2, 3, and 7 positions in the tribrominated derivative. The fluorene backbone of the monomers of the present invention may also be functionalized with one or more polymerizable or reactive functionalities, and most readily at the 9 position. In particular, preferred embodiments incorporate reactive, pendant acrylate groups.",
        "Compositions of the present invention include the reactive bromosubstituted fluorenes combined with inorganic nanoparticles, particularly nanoparticles with reactive surface modifiers exhibiting polymerizable functionality. Reactive high index nanoparticles such as zirconia are preferred, although other high index nanoparticles such as titania are acceptable. Photoinitiators may also be employed in the present compositions thereby enhancing free radical curing by ultraviolet light for example.",
        "One advantage of the monomers of the present invention is the copolymerizability and high refractive index of the monomers. A second advantage is the compatibility of the monomers with the solvents employed in dispersing functionalized nanoparticles thereby forming stable coating formulations. Another advantage of the high refractive index monomers is that antireflective coatings including the high refractive index monomers within high index optical layer(s) may be provided, thereby enhancing the optical properties of the antireflective coating.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates an antireflective coating construction containing an optical coating, in accordance with the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a fluorene structure and the nine positions referred to throughout the specification.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates the structures of Examples 1-4 and Comparative Example 1.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a typical display device in accordance with the present invention.",
        "The present invention includes the development of bromosubstituted fluorenes as a coating matrix. The incorporation of bromine is believed to raise the refractive index and is readily substituted at the 2 position in the mono brominated derivative, the 2 and 7 positions in the dibrominated derivative and the 2, 3, and 7 positions in the tribrominated derivative. The substituted polymers are also functionalized with one or more polymerizable functionalities along the fluorene backbone, and preferably at the 9 position. FIG. 2 illustrates a fluorene structure that may be substituted about the positions shown. The functional groups particularly emphasized include reactive, pendant acrylate groups. Co-polymers may be made from other acrylates and methacrylates, and from monofunctional derivatives represented by the generic structure shown below. Pendant acrylate groups include those selected from the group of acrylate, methacrylate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate compounds formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, trimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate, and trimethoxysilylpropylacrylate, for example.",
        "The use of the new monomers of the invention are envisioned in combination with other monomers, multifunctional acrylates, crosslinking monomers, fillers, nanoparticles, adhesion promoters, slip agents, initiators, photoinitiators, dyes, and solvents, and are given in weight percent ranges relative to the total weight of the optical coating composition. The weight percents of each constituent are given relative to the total weight of the compositions, absent the solvent used in the processing thereof. For UV curable formulations, the photoinitiators may be employed between 0.05% and 10%, although preferably between 1-4%. For the films of the invention, the nanoparticles were provided at 20-60 wt % and even more preferably in a range of 30-38.5 wt %, whereby the weight percents given reflect the weight of nanoparticles not yet surface modified. In accordance with the present invention, the nanoparticle surface modifier weight percent ratio preferably ranges from about 2.70:1 to 6:1. Stated another way, the weight percent range for nanoparticles with surface modifiers is the sum of the two. To illustrate, example 12 has 30% ZrO2+11.1% surface modifier, so that the weight percent of the surface modified particles is 41.1%. Similarly, example 16 exhibits a 35.32% wt % of surface modified nanoparticles, wherein the wt % is also relative to the total compositional weight. Table 1 below gives exemplary nanoparticle/surface modifier combinations of the present invention.",

        "The bromosubstituted monomers of the invention were generally provided at about 25-60 wt % and more preferably at about 31-58 wt %. The multifunctional acrylates or crosslinkers are generally provided at about 25-50 wt %.",
        "",
        "Two classes of bromo-substituted fluorene monomers are characterized by the structures illustrated above. Examples 1-4, illustrated in FIG. 3, exemplify molecules that may be formed as given above. As such, a preferred group of bromo substituted fluorene monomers may be selected from the group including acrylic acid 3-[9-(3-acryloyloxy-propyl)-2,3,7-tribromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-propyl ester, acrylic acid 3-{9-[3-acyloyloxy-propoxy)-propyl]-2,3,7-tribromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl}-propyl ester, 3-[9-(3-acryloyloxy-propyl)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-propyl ester, and 2-[9-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-ethyl ester. It has been found that the bromosubstituted monomers of the present invention as exemplified by this preferred group, possess a high refractive index (greater than or about 1.58 to 1.6), good solubility, good miscibility with the nanoparticles, and reasonable durability after curing, especially when formulated with zirconia nanoparticles.",
        "Polymerizable compositions of the present invention incorporating the bromosubstituted fluorene described above may be characterized as nanocomposites. Nanocomposites are defined as a polymer matrix that contains well-dispersed nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are defined as particles that are smaller than 100 nanometers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,776 exemplifies the current understanding of nanocomposites incorporated within polyamides and is herein incorporated by reference. A nanoparticle is generally an inorganic particle such as a metal, metal oxide, metal nitride, metal carbide or metal chloride. In accordance with the present invention, the use of high index nanoparticles increases the refractive index of compositions incorporating the same. Preferred nanoparticles include crystalline zirconia, although other high index nanoparticles such as titania, antimony, mixtures of metal oxides, and mixed metal oxides are acceptable. Crystalline zirconia is preferred over amorphous zirconia due to the greater refractive index of compositions containing crystalline zirconia. Functionalized silica nanoparticles may be used for added reinforcement, although it lowers the refractive index of the cured coating. Examples of useful zirconia are those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,590, and examples of titania are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,526, both incorporated by reference in their entirety.",
        "Surface modification of the nanoparticles relates to the reaction of specific molecules on the surface of particles, and is useful in achieving good dispersion within the polymer matrix. Accordingly, the nanoparticles are preferably treated with surface modifying agents such as carboxylic acids, silanes and/or dispersants to help compatibilize them with the polymer matrix. U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,058 exemplifies typical surface modifiers and is herein incorporated by reference. In essence, it is believed that surface modification prevents particle agglomeration thereby facilitating particle dispersion within the monomers and resins, and therefore enhancing the transparency of the coating. Preferred surface modifiers are carboxylic acids and silanes including methoxyethoxyethoxyacetic acid (MEEAA) and A1230 (a polyethersilane or PEG-silane). The use of surface modifiers with high refractive index is also preferred and includes naphthyl acetic acid and trimethoxy phenyl silane.",
        "The nanoparticles of the present invention may also be surface modified by reactive surface modifiers. Reactive surface modification means that surface modifiers are employed that include functional groups that facilitate polymerization in addition to functionality that can either adsorb or covalently bond with the particle surface. When a coating of the present invention is polymerized (or cured), it forms a nanocomposite having particles covalently linked to the polymer matrix. When employing mixtures of nanoparticles, a combination of benefits may be realized. For example, surface modified zirconia may be added to raise the refractive index, while surface modified silica may be added to further enhance durability.",
        "Compositions of the present invention may further contain any of the well known Type I and Type II UV photoinitiators, such as the substituted acetophenones, benzoins, phosphine oxides, benzophenone/amine combinations, and other photoinitiator classes well known to those in the art. Exemplary photoinitiators include Irgacure\u2122 819, Darocure\u2122 1173, or TPO supplied for example by Ciba Geigy of Tarrytown, N.Y. It is believed that radical photoinitiators cleave in the presence of ultraviolet light to form radicals that initiate the polymerization of the acrylate and methacrylate functional groups in the formulation to form the crosslinked nanocomposite. Known types and classes of radical photoinitiators may be employed as described in, \u201cChemistry and Technology of UV & EB Formulation For Coatings, Inks, & Paints\u201d of Volume 3 of Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cationic Polymerization, published by SITA Technology Ltd., Gardiner House, Broomhill Road, LONDON SW18184JQ ENGLAND, herein incorporated by reference.",
        "Specific photoinitiators which are useful in the compositions of the invention include onium salts as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,676, herein incorporated by reference. Onium salts have been found to be useful as coinitiators in high speed visible light curing of free radically polymerizable systems. Photoinitiators are typically employed from about 0.05 wt % to about 10 wt %, and more preferably at about 1 to 4 wt %.",

        "Films made in accordance with the present invention may be coupled, layered, laminated, and/or otherwise coupled to other films or display devices in accordance with the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,378, herein incorporated by reference, describes a process of bonding layers of film together and also of bonding the an antireflective film, for example, upon a display device. The same process may be employed in accordance with the present invention. Known techniques of preparing multilayer films may be employed to include spin coating, knife coating, and the like.",
        "In yet another aspect of the invention, the optical films described above are included within an antireflective film construction. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, a coating 10, and preferably an antireflective coating, contains a substrate 12 formed from PET or polycarbonate, or any other material recognized for its utility as a substrate in antireflective films. An optional adhesive 14 may be provided on one side of the substrate 12 whereby the substrate 12 is coupled to a display device 16 and also to a juxtaposed layer outwardly oriented from the substrate 12. In accordance with the present invention, a hardcoat layer 18 is coupled to and layered over or otherwise fixed to substrate 12 in a known manner thereby forming an outwardly oriented layer in physical contact with substrate 12. An optical layer 20 having a relatively high refractive index of at least 1.6, formed as described above, is next coupled to and/or layered over hardcoat layer 18. If desired, the construct 10 may include other layers typically used in antireflective film such as a relatively lower refractive index layer 22, or an anti-smudge layer (not shown) as known in the art.",
        "The low index layer 20 may be formed as known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 6,723,423 exemplifies the known understanding of forming a low refractive index layer and is herein incorporated by reference, although not by way of limitation. An exemplary low index layer may be formed from low refractive index fluoropolymer compositions and derived from an interpenetrating polymer network or semi-interpenetrating polymer network which includes a reactive fluoroplastic and/or a fluoroelastomer (i.e. the functional fluoropolymer phase) blended with multi-functional acrylates (i.e. the acrylate phase) such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and optionally additional fluorinated mono-functional acrylates or multi-functional fluorinated acrylates which can be coated and cured by ultraviolet light or by thermal means. The presence of an acrylate crosslinker provides a composition with both low refractive index and improved adhesion to high index polymer substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (\u201cPET\u201d) or hard coated PET films. The low index coating mixture preferably describes a reactive high molecular weight fluoropolymer(s) that can participate in the crosslinking reactions between the monomeric multi-functional acrylates. This enhances the crosslinkability of the fluoropolymer phase to the forming polyacrylate phase and produces a co-crosslinked, interpenetrating or semi-interpenetrating polymer network with enhanced interfacial contact between the high index layer and the low index layer and thereby improves durability and low refractive index.",
        "Various optional permanent and removable grade adhesive compositions 14 may be coated on the opposite side of the substrate 12 (i.e. to that of the hardcoat 18) so the article 10 can be easily mounted to a display surface. Typically, the adhesive 14, substrate 12, and hard coating layer 18 are prepackaged as a film 19 having a release layer (not shown) attached to the adhesive 14. The release layer is then removed and the adhesive layer 14 coupled to a housing or other area of the display 16 to form the optical display 16.",
        "Suitable optional adhesive compositions 14 include (e.g. hydrogenated) block copolymers such as those commercially available from Kraton Polymers, Westhollow, Tex. under the trade designation \u201cKraton G-1657\u201d, as well as other (e.g. similar) thermoplastic rubbers. Other exemplary adhesives include acrylic-based, urethane-based, silicone-based and epoxy-based adhesives. Preferred adhesives are of sufficient optical quality and light stability such that the adhesive does not yellow with time or upon weather exposure so as to degrade the viewing quality of the optical display. The adhesive can be applied using a variety of known coating techniques such as transfer coating, knife coating, spin coating, die coating and the like. Exemplary adhesives are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0012936, herein incorporated by reference. Several of such adhesives are commercially available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. under the trade designations 8141, 8142, and 8161. The substrate layer 12 may consist of any of a wide variety of non-polymeric materials, such as glass, or polymeric materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), bisphenol A polycarbonate, cellulose triacetate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and biaxially oriented polypropylene which are commonly used in various optical devices.",
        "It is contemplated that the present invention will find primary application in optical coatings and films including antireflective film, for example. However, it is not limited thereto. It will also be understood that the foregoing description of an embodiment of the present invention is for illustrative purposes only. As such, the various structural and operational features herein disclosed are susceptible to a number of modifications commensurate with the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art, none of which departs from the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims."
