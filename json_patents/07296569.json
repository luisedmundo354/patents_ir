        "The present application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/696,208, filed Oct. 26, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,575,159, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/162,133, filed Oct. 29, 1999. The disclosure of the above-referenced provisional patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to a portable liquid oxygen unit.",
        "2. Description of the Background Art",
        "Therapeutic oxygen is the delivery of substantially pure oxygen to a patient in order to facilitate breathing. When a patient suffers from pulmonary/respiratory problems, delivery of oxygen helps the patient get an adequate level of oxygen into his or her bloodstream.",
        "Therapeutic oxygen may be warranted in cases where a patient suffers from a loss of lung capacity. Medical conditions that may make oxygen necessary are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including asthma, emphysema, etc., as well as cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, lung injuries, and cardiovascular diseases, for example.",
        "Related art practice has been to provide portable oxygen in two ways. In a first approach, compressed oxygen gas is provided in a pressure bottle, and the gas is output through a pressure regulator and a hose to the nostrils of the patient. The bottle is often wheeled so that the patient may be mobile. The drawback of compressed, gaseous oxygen is that a full charge of a bottle that is portable does not last very long.",
        "In order to get around this limitation, in a second approach a related art liquid oxygen (LOX) apparatus has been used wherein LOX is stored in a container and the gaseous oxygen that evaporates from the LOX is inhaled by the patient.",
        "The related art LOX apparatus enjoys a longer usable charge than the compressed gas apparatus for a given size and weight, but has its own drawbacks. LOX, being a liquid that is very cold, requires a vacuum-insulated container.",
        "Related art portable LOX units typically are formed with necks that can fill with LOX when tipped, and thus are to be used and carried only in a generally vertical position. This can be impractical at times, such as when driving a vehicle, for example. A vertically positioned related art portable LOX unit is unstable and could potentially cause problems for both the oxygen user and for other drivers if it shifts, slides, or tumbles.",
        "There remains a need in the art, therefore, for an improved portable LOX unit.",
        "A portable liquid oxygen (LOX) storage/delivery apparatus is provided according to the invention. The portable liquid oxygen (LOX) storage/delivery apparatus comprises an insulated (LOX) container having an interior for containing LOX, the LOX container having a top portion, a bottom portion and a sidewall between the top and bottom portions, the sidewall including a first side portion extending between the top portion and the bottom portion of the container, and a second side portion extending between the top portion and the bottom portion of the container, the second side portion being on an opposite side of the container from the first side portion, a port system in communication with the interior of the container for charging the container with LOX, and for withdrawing LOX and gaseous oxygen from the container, wherein the gaseous oxygen is withdrawn from the container through a first outlet communicating with the interior of the container, the first outlet being located adjacent a first juncture between the top portion and the first side portion of the container; wherein LOX is withdrawn from the container through a second outlet communicating with the interior of the container, the second outlet being located adjacent a second juncture between the bottom portion and the second side portion, and wherein gaseous oxygen can be withdrawn from the container through the first outlet and LOX can be withdrawn from the container through the second outlet when the container is positioned in a first orientation with the sidewall vertically oriented, as well as when the container is positioned in a second orientation with the second side portion oriented downwardly and with the first side portion oriented upwardly and overlying the second side portion, and in all positions in between.",
        "The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will be further understood from the following description of the preferred embodiment thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 schematically shows one embodiment of a portable liquid oxygen unit of the present invention in a first position;",
        "FIG. 2 schematically shows an alternate position of the portable LOX unit illustrating how the portable LOX unit of the present invention may be used in different orientations;",
        "FIG. 3 schematically shows a detail of an insulated support system of the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 4 schematically shows the portable LOX unit of the present invention being used in a portable LOX system.",
        "FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a portable liquid oxygen unit 100 of the present invention. The portable LOX unit includes an outer shell 101 and a container 104 within the outer shell 101.",
        "A space 110 exists around the container 104 and is preferably evacuated to at least a partial vacuum. In the illustrated embodiment, the container 104 is held and supported within the outer shell 101 by an optional top support 118 and an optional bottom support 119 (discussed below in conjunction with FIG. 3). The container 104 may be insulated or may be formed of a material having heat insulating properties.",
        "The container 104 is formed of a top portion 105, a bottom portion 106, and a sidewall 107. The sidewall 107 includes a first side portion 108 and a second side portion 109, both extending between the top portion 105 and the bottom portion 106, but with the second side portion 109 being on an opposite side of the container 104 from the first side portion 108.",
        "The container 104 also includes a liquid withdrawal conduit 113 and a gaseous withdrawal conduit 116. The gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 allows withdrawal of gaseous oxygen from the container 104. The gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 enters the container 104 and has a first outlet 117 communicating with an interior of the container 104. The first outlet 117 is located adjacent a first juncture between the top portion 105 and the first side portion 108 of the container 104.",
        "The gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 exits both the container 104 and the outer shell 101, and forms a first port 440 in the container 104 and in the outer shell 101 (see FIG. 4). The first port 440 is located adjacent the first juncture between the top portion 105 and the first side portion 108 of the container 104.",
        "The liquid withdrawal conduit 113 allows withdrawal of LOX from the container 104. The liquid withdrawal conduit 113 extends diagonally across the interior of the container 104 and has a liquid withdrawal (second) outlet 114 positioned in the bottom portion 106 of the container 104. The second outlet 114 is located adjacent a second juncture between the bottom portion 106 and the second side portion 109. The liquid withdrawal conduit 113 may exit through a second port 441 adjacent the first port 440, with the second port 441 preferably being concentric with the gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 and exiting within the first port 440. Thus, at least a portion of the liquid withdrawal conduit 113 may be located within the gaseous withdrawal conduit 116.",
        "FIG. 2 shows an alternate position of the portable LOX unit 100 illustrating how the portable LOX unit 100 may be used in different orientations. As can be seen from the figure, the second outlet 114 of the liquid withdrawal conduit 113 still resides at a low point of the container 104. It can also be seen from the figure that the first outlet 117 of the gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 remains at a high point in the portable LOX unit 100. Even in a horizontal orientation, the portable LOX unit 100 maintains the liquid withdrawal conduit 113 and the gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 at desired positions to enable both LOX and gaseous oxygen withdrawal. Therefore, the position of the portable LOX unit 100 is not limited by the internal configuration of withdrawal conduits.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a detail of the insulated support system 119. The insulated support system 119 supports and positions the container 104 within the outer shell 101 (see FIGS. 1 and 2). A top insulated support 118 is centrally located on the top portion 105 of the container 104 and extends upwardly from the top portion 105. A bottom insulated support 119 is centrally located on the bottom portion 106 of the container 104 and extends downwardly from the bottom portion 106.",
        "The insulated support system 119 includes an outer shell support 121, a container support 124, and an insulated support 127. The outer shell support 121 is attached to the outer shell 101 (top or bottom), while the container support 124 is attached to the container 104. The insulated support 127 is attached to neither and is merely placed between the two for the purposes of cushioning and insulating. Therefore, the container supports 124 of both the top and bottom insulated support systems 118 and 119 are telescopically received by the respective outer shell supports 121.",
        "It should be noted that the insulated support 127 is preferably made of an insulating material. This is done to minimize heat transfer from the outer shell 101 to the container 104. Due to the insulated support 127, the container support 124 does not come into contact with the outer shell support 121.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the portable LOX unit 100 of the present invention being used in a portable LOX system 400. The portable LOX unit 100 further includes a third port 401 and a LOX delivery conduit 402. The LOX delivery conduit 402 enters the outer shell 101 through a third port 401 and also enters the container 104. The third port 401 is located adjacent a third juncture between the first side portion 108 and the bottom portion 106 (see FIG. 1). The LOX delivery conduit 402 terminates with an open end 404 located within the container 104 and adjacent the top portion 105 of the container 104. Preferably, the open end 404 is centrally located within the top portion 105, so that when LOX is being charged into the container, it flows along the internal sidewall portions of the container so as to minimize turbulence of LOX within the container, thereby facilitating maximal filling of the container with LOX.",
        "Also shown in FIG. 4 is the emergence of the gaseous withdrawal conduit 116 and the liquid withdrawal conduit 113 from the portable LOX unit 100. In this embodiment, both conduits 113 and 116 concentrically emerge from the container 104, and then emerge from the outer shell 101 at the first port 440.",
        "While the invention has been described in detail above and shown in the drawings, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments as described and shown."
