        "The present invention relates to polymers for controlled delivery of substances, and more specifically encompasses biodegradable polyanhydrides with ester and amide bonds and methods for making the same.",
        "There has been extensive research in the area of biodegradable materials for controlled release of drugs. Biodegradable matrices for drug delivery are useful because they obviate the need to remove non-degradable drug depleted devices. The ideal polymeric matrix would combine the characteristics of hydrophobicity, storage stability, solubility in organic solvents, melting point below 100\u00b0 C. to allow injection molding processing, predetermined controlled degradation profile, versatile degradation and drug release profiles, and flexible and non-fragile so that it does not crumble or fragment during shipment or use.",
        "Such a polymer must be hydrophobic so that it retains its integrity and the incorporated drug for a suitable period of time when placed in biological systems, such as the body, and stable at common storage conditions, preferable room temperature for an extended period before use.",
        "Controlled release devices are typically prepared in one of several ways. For example, the polymer can be melted, mixed with the active substance and cast,or injection mold into a device. Such melt fabrication require polymers having a melting point that is below the temperature at which the substance to be delivered and polymer degrade or become reactive. The device can be prepared by solvent casting where the polymer is dissolved in a solvent and the drug dissolved or dispersed in the polymer solution and the solvent is evaporated. Solvent process requires that the polymer be soluble in organic solvents. Another method is the compression molding of mixed powders of the polymer and the drug or polymer particles loaded with the active agent.",
        "Many biodegradable polymers have been evaluated for their suitability for use as a matrix for drugs including polyesters, polycarbonates, natural and synthetic polyamides, polyphosphate esters, polyphosphazenes and polyanhydrides. While these polymers were found useful applications as drug carriers, still there is a need for a reliable polymer for short term drug release (1 to 20 weeks) that degrade and eliminated from an implant site within 30 weeks.",
        "Polyanhydrides are useful bioabsorbable materials for controlled drug delivery. They hydrolyze to dicarboxylic acid monomers when placed in aqueous medium. Since their introduction to the field of controlled drug delivery, about 15 years ago, extensive research has been conducted to study their chemistry as well as their toxicity and medical applications. Several review articles have been published on polyanhydrides for controlled drug delivery applications (Domb et al. 1992, Leong et al. 1989, Laurencin 1995).",
        "Since the discovery of polyanhydrides in 1909, hundreds of polymer structures have been reported (Encyclopedia 1969). Polyanhydrides intended for use in medicine that have been developed since 1980 include: Unsaturated polymer prepared from fumaric acid; Amino acid based polymers; Aliphatic-Aromatic homopolyanhydrides; Poly(ester-anhydrides) made from di- and tri-block copolymers of poly(caprolactone); and ester containing polyanhydride.",
        "The stability of polyanhydrides in solid state and dry chloroform solution was studied (Domb and Langer 1989b). Polyanhydrides such as PSA decreased in molecular weight over time. The decrease in molecular weight shows first-order kinetics, with activation energies of 7.5 Kcal/mole- \u00b0 K. The decrease in molecular weight was explained by an internal anhydride interchange mechanism, as revealed from elemental and spectral analysis. A similar decrease in molecular weight as function of time was also observed among the aliphatic-aromatic co-polyanhydrides and imide containing co-polyanhydrides. (Domb et al. 1989, Staubli et al. 1991, 1991b).",
        "The low melting point and the solubility of aliphatic polyanhydrides in common organic solvents such as methylene chloride, allows for the easy dispersion of drug into the polymer matrix. Drugs can also be incorporated via compression or melt molding processes. For example, drugs can be incorporated into a slab either by melt mixing the drug into the melted polymer or by solvent casting. Polymer slabs loaded with a drug can also be prepared by compression molding a powder containing the drug. Similarly, one can injection molded the drug-polymer formulation into beads or rods polymer films can be prepared by solvent evaporation by casting the polymer solution containing the drug onto a Teflon coated dish. Microspheres based delivery systems can be formulated by the common techniques including solvent removal, hot-melt encapsulation and spray drying (Mathiowitz et al. 1987, Pekarek et al. 1994, Bindschaedler et al. 1988, Tabata et al. 1994). However, it is essential that all processes be performed under anhydrous conditions to avoid hydrolysis of the polymer or absorption of water in the polymer mass which degrade the polymer with time during storage.",
        "The degradation of polyanhydrides, in general, varies with a number of factors. These factors include, the chemical nature and the hydrophobicity of the monomers used to produce the polymer, the level of drug loading in the polymeric matrix, the pH of the surrounding medium (the higher the pH, the more rapidly the polymers degrade), the shape and geometry of the implant (the degradation is a function of the surface area) and the accessibility of the implant to water (porous materials will degrade more rapidly than non-porous). The porosity in an implant is dependent on the method of fabrication. For example, a compression-molded device will degrade at a much more rapid rate than an injection molded device due to the presence of a higher porosity in the polymer as compared to the latter.",
        "The degradation rates for a number of polyanhydrides are available in the literature (Leong et al. 1986, Shieh et al. 1994, Domb et al. 1995b, Tamada and Langer 1993, Dang et al. 1996). Most studies focused on the degradation of the clinically tested polyanhydrides namely, poly(CPP-SA) and poly(FAD-SA). In general, during the initial 10 to 24 hours of water incubation in aqueous medium, the molecular weight dropped rapidly with no loss in wafer mass loss. This period was followed by a fast decrease in wafer mass accompanied by a very small change in polymer molecular weight. The period of extensive mass loss starts when the polymer molecular weight reaches a number average molecular weight (Mn) of about 2,000 regardless of the initial molecular weight of the polymer. During this period which last for about one week, sebacic acid, the relatively water soluble comonomer, is released from the wafer leaving the less soluble comonomer, CPP or FAD, which is slow to soluble (Dang et al. 1996) increasing the content of sebacic acid in the copolymer increases the hydrophilicity of the copolymer, which results in a higher erosion rate and hence higher drug release rates. This could be explained by the fact that the anhydride linkages in the polymer are hydrolyzed subsequent to penetration of water into the polymer. The penetration of water or water uptake depends on the hydrophobicity of the polymer and therefore, the hydrophobic polymers which prevent water uptake, have slower erosion rates and lower drug release rates. This is valuable information since one can alter the hydrophobicity of the polymer by altering the structure and/or the content of the copolymer, thereby being able to alter the drug release rate. Since in the P(CPP-SA) and P(FAD-SA) series of copolymers, a 10 fold increase in drug release rate was achieved by alteration of the ratio of the monomers, both polymers can be used to deliver drugs over a wide range of release rates.",
        "Several attempts were made to improve the physical properties, drug release and storage stability of polyanhydrides by using fatty acid based comonomers , using linear fatty acid chain terminals or by blending the polymers with fats and other biodegradable polymers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,812 and (Domb et al. 1993). describes the synthesis of polyanhydrides from dimer and trimer erucic acid. Theses polymers were amorphous with a crystallinity in the range of 20%, they were hydrophobic and pliable and released the incorporated drugs for a few weeks in buffer solutions. However, these dimer fatty acid based polymers were not stable on storage at room temperature or refrigeration and rapidly decreased in molecular weight which requires storage under freezing conditions (\u221220\u00b0 C.). Another major problem occurred with this class of polymers is their incomplete degradation and elimination from dogs after subcutaneous or intramuscular implantation probably due to the C\u2014C bond between the two connected fatty acids.",
        "To solve the problem of the FAD polymer elimination in vivo, diacid fat with hydrolyzable ester bond has been synthesized and evaluated as carrier for drugs. Polyanhydrides synthesized from nonlinear hydrophobic fatty acid esters based on ricinoleic, maleic acid and sebacic acid, possessed desired physico-chemical properties such as low melting point, hydrophobicity and flexibility to the polymer formed in addition to biocompatibility and biodegradability. (Domb et al. 1995). Although these polymers showed to be fully degradable in vivo with suitable properties as drug carriers, the major problem of storage stability and the high polydispersity remain. These polymers' molecular weight was drastically decrease within 2-3 days when stored at room temperature and the polydispersity was over 10.",
        "Another attempt to obtain stable polyanhydrides that are useful for controlled drug delivery was the formation of polyanhydrides with linear fatty acid terminals (U.S. Pat. No. 5,179,189). This invention describes linear polyanhydrides made of aliphatic or aromatic diacids terminated with linear fatty acids such as stearic acid. Although these polymers posses longer drug release period and degradation time, they remain crystalline (>50%) and not pliable similar to the corresponding polymers with acid or acetyl terminals. More important, the polymers are not stable at room temperature or at refrigeration and depolymerize and hydrolyze to a low molecular weight polymer a few days of storage and form a fragile and easy to crumble polymer mass. Another attempt was the blending of polyanhydrides with biodegradable polyesters or fatty acids and triglycerides (Abuganima 1996, Domb 1993c). The resulted polymeric mixtures did not form uniform blends, the polyanhydride component in the mixture degraded at a similar rate as the pure polymer leaving the hydrophobic component intact, and the storage stability did not improve.",
        "While hundreds of polyanhydride structures are available for use as drug carriers, they suffer from a few major limitations as practical carriers for drugs: 1. many of them are made of synthetic monomers such as aromatic and heterocyclic diacid monomers which present a risk of toxicity and slow elimination rate from an implanted animal or human (these hydrophobic co-monomers are used to control the drug release and polymer degradation); 2. high sensitivity to heat and moisture which makes these polymers unstable at room temperature or even at refrigeration storage conditions which require storage at \u221220\u00b0 C. or below. This storage stability problem is essential for a medical product to be distributed to hospitals, distribution and storage at \u221220\u00b0 C. is very difficult logistically, expensive and somewhat impractical. The only polyanhydride device in clinical use is the Gliadel brain implant which is manufactured by Guilford Pharm. Baltimore which requires an all time storage at \u221220\u00b0 C. as at higher temperature the molecular weight of the polymer carrier drops to below 20,000 which affect the drug release rate and rejection of the device; 3 polymers made of linear aliphatic acids are crystalline and fragile which makes them impractical for use as drug carriers as they may fragment during shipment or use.",
        "There remains a strong need for a polymer having the desired characteristics of hydrophobicity, pliability, low melting point and solubility in solvents, versatility in polymer degradation and drug release profile which are stable at non freezing conditions.",

        "Ricinoleic acid was transformed into a non-linear fatty acid by esterification with fatty acid chlorides of C8 to C18 chain length in the presence of pyridine. Ricinoleic acid is a natural hydroxy fatty acid, which accounts for about 85% of the triglyceride fatty acids of castor oil, the other 15% are linear non-hydroxy fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic and stearic acid [7]. Technical ricinoleic acid [Fluka] used in this study contains about 10% of linear fatty acids, which do not form non-linear fatty acid when reacting with fatty acid chloride. Pure non-linear fatty acids were obtained by purification of the reaction product using column chromatography. 1H-NMR spectrum of ricinoleic acid fatty acid ester show peak at 4.9-5 ppm attributed to the methine \u03bc to the ester, indicating successful esterification. No impurities of the ricinoleic starting material which, usually appear at 4.7 ppm (\u03bc11 dehydration impurity), 3.6 ppm (unreacted ricinoleic acid) and 2.78 ppm (linoleic acid) are seen in the spectrum. Non-linear fatty acid terminated poly(sebacic anhydride) were synthesized by melt condensation to yield waxy off-white materials. All polymers have typical IR absorption at 1740 and 1810 cm\u22121 (symmetrical and asymmetrical anhydride C\u2550O stretching bands). The physical properties of poly(sebacic acid) terminated with 30% by weight of various non-linear fatty acids with a side chain length from C8 to C18 are shown in Table I. Polymers with molecular weights in the range of 5,000 to 9,000 were obtained. The 30% w/w content of the non-linear fatty acid was chosen since it was previously found that up to this ratio, the final product is mainly fatty terminated polymer with up to about 5% w/w of the symmetric fatty anhydride. Above this ratio, the molecular weight dropped to a level of 2000-3000 and the percent of the symmetric anhydride increased to 10-40% [8]. All terminated polymers melted at temperatures between 70 and 79\u00b0 C., which makes them suitable for drug incorporation by melt molding process. The heat capacity values (\u03bcH) of all polymers were lower to that of PSA (68-80 J/g), which indicates that these non-linear fatty terminated polymers are less crystalline relative to poly(sebacic acid). This effect is attributed to the presence of the ricinoleic acid based non-linear terminals. When PSA was terminated with 30% (W/W) ricinoleic acid acetyl ester a value of 45 J/g was obtained.",
        "In Vitro Hydrolysis of Polymers",

The weight average molecular weight of the degraded samples were monitored by SEC, a sharp decrease in molecular weight was observed during the first 48 h, followed by a slow degradation phase which kept the Mw at 3000 for another 7 days. PSA lost about 70% of its initial weight after 6 days, during this period the non-linear fatty acid terminated polymers lost up to 40% of their initial weight. The period of mass loss starts when the polymer molecular weight reaches a number average molecular weight (Mn) of about 2,000, regardless of the initial molecular weight of the polymer. During this period which last for about one week, the relatively water soluble component, sebacic acid, is released from the wafer leaving the hydrophobic component, ricinoleic acid based non-linear fatty acid, which is slow to solubilize.",

        "The release characteristics of drugs from these non-linear fatty acid terminated polyanhydrides were determined using methotrexate (MTX) as a model drug. At earlier. stages MTX was released at the same rate from all the polymers. After 3 days the release is depended on the length of the fatty acid side chain, the longer the side-chain the slower is the release. This data correlates with the data obtained from the degradation studies that showed that during the period of 3 to 7 days the device contains higher amounts of the hydrophobic non-linear fatty acid which retard water from penetrating into the polymer matrix to cleave the labile anhydride bonds and release the drug.",
        "The rate of drug release increased linearly with loading, and identical release profile were found for both concentrations also attribute to the surface erosion process. It was previously reported [15, 16] that since the penetration of water into the polymer matrix is the key event in the release of the drug and the degradation of the polymer, MRI offer a potentially valuable tool for following this process. MRI images of eroding P(RAMYRE:SA) loaded with 5% MTX were taken. Bright areas on the images indicates high amount of water, no MRI images were attainable with dry tablets. One of the advantages of the MRI technique is that the detected device can be virtually sliced to a very thin slices and each slice can be analyzed for water penetration. At t=0 both slices are black since water did rot penetrate into the device. In the contrary after two days in buffer solution, a signal enhancement from outside to the inside of the polymer was observed. The surface of the polymer (slice No. 1) is composed mainly from white and gray areas where in the second slice the core is absolutely black indicating that water did not penetrate yet but the edges that were exposed to water do absorb some water. This data combined with the visual observation of the device, which indicated a porous white solid and fragile eroding zone, indicates that the polymer degradation and drug release is mainly due to surface erosion front mechanism [17]. This mechanism is characterized with degradation occurring in a region of finite thickness of the device known as the erosion zone. This zone is a dynamic region where degradation occurs while at the intact zone, (the inner area) degradation proceeds slowly or does not take place at all.",
        "Polymer Stability",
        "Polyanhydrides are considered as air sensitive material and are usually stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. under argon atmosphere. The stability of blank and MTX-loaded formulations of non-linear fatty acid terminated PSA was studied. Three rectangular samples packed in glass bottles under argon atmosphere were stored at \u221210, 4 and 25\u00b0 C. and the molecular weight, drug content and drug release rate were determined. For both, the blank and MTX loaded polymers, the molecular weight remained between 7,000 and 10,000 throughout the first 40 days at \u221210 and 4\u00b0 C., while a slight drop of the initial value for the samples stored at 25\u00b0 C. was observed. The polymer retained its initial molecular weight for 1 year at \u221210\u00b0 C. and for six months at 4\u00b0 C. In contrary, PSA without terminating fatty acids retained its initial molecular weight only at \u221210\u00b0 C., while at the other two temperatures the molecular weight dropped much faster than the terminated PSA. Polyanhydrides may decrease in molecular weight during storage either as a result, of hydrolysis caused by entrapped water during preparation or from penetration of water vapors into the package during storing. Under freezing temperature (\u221210\u00b0 C.) there is minimal active water to cause anhydride hydrolysis, thus both terminated and non-terminated PSA retained their initial molecular weight. This is not the case at the other two temperatures, nonlinear terminated PSA kept its initial molecular weight for 3 weeks at room temperature, and for 6 months at 4\u00b0 C. The insertion of non-linear hydrophobic side chains into the polymer backbone increases its hydrophobicity which, retards water from penetrating into the polymer mass and decreasing its molecular weight. The decrease in molecular weight after 40 days at roon temperature did not affect the release profile of MTX from the non-linear fatty acid terminated polymers. Similar results were obtained for other polyanhydrides, where matrices prepared from polymers of molecular weights ranging from 10,000 and 50,000 degraded and released the incorporated drug for a similar time period [7, 18].",

        "In Vitro Hydrolytic Degradation of Polymers",
        "The hydrolysis of the polymers was evaluated by placing rectangular samples of polymer (3\u00d75\u00d75 mm, 100 mg ) in 10 mL 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0 C. with continuous shaking (100 rpm). At each time point polymer sample was taken out of the buffer and dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. The hydrolysis of the polymer was monitored by (a) weight loss of the sample, (b) disappearance of the anhydride bonds by IR spectroscopy, (c) changes in polymer molecular weight as determined by GPC, (d) Lactic acid release by reagent lactate. All experiments were carried out in triplicates.",
        "Transesterification of poly(sebacic acid) (PSA) is a one-pot reaction that starts with a high molecular weight polymer based on anhydride bonds and yields polymer based on random anhydride ester bonds. In order to convert poly(anhydride) to poly(ester-anhydride) we react the polymer with hydroxy fatty acid (HFA). The hydroxyl group of HFA attacks the anhydride bond in a transesterification reaction. The products of the reaction are carboxyl group ended olygomers based one pure anhydride bonds or random mixed ester anhydride bonds.",
        "In principal, any hydroxy alkyl acid is suitable for that type of reaction. The purpose of the final product (biodegradable polymer for suspended drug delivery) limits us to non-irritant and pure hydroxy acids. Conditions of the reaction dictate another limitation\u2014melting point below 200\u00b0 C. or solubility in common organic solvents. The list of hydroxy acids include: lactic acid or its oligomers, glycolic acid or its olygomers, ricinoleic acid, lithocholic acid, and hydroxybenzoic acid. That study focuses on two hydroxy fatty acids: ricinoleic acid and lithocholic acid. Ricinoleic acid (D-12-hydroxyoctadec-cic-9-enoic acid) is a hydroxylated fatty acid that accumulates in the seeds of castor been (Ricinus communis L.) plants and ather species. Technical ricinoleic acid (Fluka) used in that study contains about 15% of linear and not linear fatty acids, which do not contain hydroxyl group therefor can not react in transesterification reaction.",
        "Lithocholic acid is bile acid. Bile acids are natural, amphiphilic compounds stored in the gallbladder and serve as emulsifiers for solubilization of fats and lipids in food. When such biocompounds are used in the preparation of polymer materials, they should be better tolerated in the biological environment, especially in the gastrointestinal tract.",
        "As known, fast eroding polymers are suitable candidates to control drug release through erosion mechanism. Those are polymers that have a fast hydrolyzing bond such as polyanhydrides. Incorporation of ester bonds into anhydride framework reduces the hydrolysis, because ester bonds hydrolyze slower then anhydride. Still said polymers have all the properties of a biodegradable polymer that anhydride bonds provide. Thus there is provided a surface eroding polymer with longer degradation time.",
        "Materials",
        "Ricinoleic acid, technically 85% pure (Fluca, Buch, Switzerland); sebacic acid 99% pure and lithocholic acid 98% (Aldrich Milwaukee, Wis.); acetic anhydride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used in this study. All solvents were analytical grade from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.) or Frutarom (Haifa, Isral).",
        "Procedure",
        "The prepolymer of sebacic (SA) acid was prepared from purified diacid monomer by refluxing in excess (1:5 w/v) acetic anhydride for 30 min with constant stirring and evaporating the solvent to dryness. The hot clear viscous residue was dissolved in an equal volume of dichloromethane (DCM) and precipitated in a mixture of ether/petroleum ether (1:1 v/v). The white precipitate was collected by filtration and dried by vacuum at room temperature. The polymer of SA (PSA) was prepared by melt condensation of the prepolymer at 160\u00b0 C. The polymerization was continued for 3 hours under a vacuum of 0.1 mmHg with constant stirring. The polymerization was followed by GPC analysis of samples withdrawn from the polymerization flask during polymerization every 30 min. The final molecular weight was 36000. The polymer has typical IR absorption at 1740 and 1810 cm\u22121 (symmetrical and asymmetrical anhydride C\u2550O stretching bands.",
        "The poly(ester-anhydrides) were prepared in a one-pot reaction in two steps: (a) transesterification: typically, PSA and hydroxy acid were dissolved in excess toluene in dry 100 ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and Dean-Stark glassware. The reaction took place at 120\u00b0 C. followed by GPC analysis of withdrawn from the reaction flask during the reaction. The reaction was stopped as soon as the product achieved minimal stable molecular weight (according to the theory). The duration of the transesterification reaction was 1.5-3 hours depending on the kind and percentage of hydroxy acid. (b) polymerization: the off-white paste product (prepolymer) was dissolved in acetic anhydride (1:1 w/v) and refluxed for 30 min. The solvent was evaporated to dryness. The poly(ester-anhydrides) were prepared by melt condensation of the prepolymer at 160\u00b0 C. The polymerization was continued for 1.5-4 hours under a vacuum of 0.1 mmHg with constant stirring. Duration of the polymerization depended on theoretical molecular weight of the final product. The polymerization was followed by GPC analysis of samples withdrawn from the polymerization flask during polymerization every 30 min. All solid polymers of that family melted at temperatures between 64 and 77\u00b0 C. which makes them suitable for drug incorporation via melt molding process. The melting point of lithocholic acid based poly(ester-anhydrides) was higher than of the corresponding ricinoleic acid based poly(ester-anhydrides). Ricinoleic acid based poly(ester-anhydrides) are yellow solids for PSA-RA ratios 9:1-5:5. PSA-RA 6:4 polymer is waxy and very viscose. PSA-RA 3:7 and 2:8 polymers are pasty and suitable for injection. Lithocholic acid based poly(ester-anhydrides) are solid for all ratios PSA-LitA 9:1-2:8.
