        "Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Impatiens hawkeri.",
        "Varietal denomination: \u2018Ingmulros\u2019.",
        "The present invention comprises a new and distinct New Guinea Impatiens plant botanically known as Impatiens hawkeri and referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Ingmulros.\u2019",
        "The new cultivar was developed in a controlled breeding program conducted by the inventor in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The new New Guinea Impatiens cultivar is very floriferous with small flowers and small foliage, early flowering on compact, spreading plant with good heat tolerance.",
        "The new cultivar is propagated from cuttings resulting from the cross in September 2000 of the proprietary New Guinea Impatiens selection identified as \u2018G207-1\u2019 as female parent and the proprietary New Guinea Impatiens selection identified as \u2018G318-1\u2019 as male parent. \u2018G207-1\u2019 is not commercially available and has not been patented. \u2018G318-1\u2019 is not commercially available and has not been patented.",
        "As a result of this cross the present cultivar was selected as a single plant in September 2001 in Enkhuizen, Netherlands and has been repeated asexually reproduced by cuttings in Enkhuizen, Netherlands, in Gilroy, Calif., and in Angers, France over a period of several years. The distinctive characteristics of this new Impatiens are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction. It takes 6 to 8 weeks to produce a finished plant, starting from a rooted plug and planted in a 12 cm pot, depending on the temperature.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Ingmulros.\u2019 These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Ingmulros\u2019 as a new and distinct New Guinea Impatiens cultivar:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Small, light red flowers with a dark spot in the center\n        2. Very early flowering with very floriferious habit\n        3. Small foliage\n        4. Compact, spreading habit and good heat tolerance",
        "Plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens differ primarily from the plants of the female parent selection in the following characteristics:",
        "Plants of the New Guinea Impatiens have small foliage and a compact, spreading plant habit, whereas the plants of the female parent selection have larger foliage and an upright plant habit.",
        "Plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens differ primarily from the plants of the male parent selection in the following characteristics:",
        "Plants of the New Guinea Impatiens have light red flowers with dark spot in the center, whereas the plants of the male parent selection have light salmon with dark salmon spot in the center flowers.",
        "Plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens can be compared to plants of \u2018Kinic,\u2019 U.S. Pat. No. 11,412. in side-by-side comparisons conducted in Enkhuizen, Netherlands, plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens differed from plants of the cultivar \u2018Kinic\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens have small light red flowers with a dark spot in the center, whereas the plants of the cultivar \u2018Kinic\u2019 have small deep pink flowers with a rose spot in the center.\n        2. Plants of the new New Guinea Impatiens have green leaves, whereas \u2018Kinic\u2019 has dark green leaves.\n        3. Plant of the new New Guinea Impatiens have a good branching, spreading plant habit, whereas plants of \u2018Kinic\u2019 have a branching, upright plant habit.",
        "This new New Guinea Impatiens plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographic drawing which shows blooms, buds and foliage of the plant in full color, the color showing being as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures.",
        "The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of this new New Guinea Impatiens. The data which defines these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The plant history was taken on 20 week old plants, blossomed under natural light in the field.",
