        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an ink jet ink, a method for producing an ink jet ink, an ink jet recording method and an ink cartridge.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "An ink jet recording method is a recording method of applying a small ink droplet to any one of recording media such as plain paper, glossy media and the like to form an image, and has become rapidly widespread owing to reduction in its costs and improvement in its recording rate. In addition to the improved quality of the recorded image, and concurrently with the rapid spread of digital cameras, users of ink jet printers now demand to output recorded matter which are comparable to a silver halide photograph.",
        "As a necessary requirement for a recorded matter which is obtained from an ink jet recording method and is comparable to a silver halide photograph, it is cited that both high color developability and durability of the obtained recorded matter are realized simultaneously. In particular, if a recorded matter obtained using yellow ink is left for a long period of time in a high-humidity environment, in some cases the image is susceptible to varying in color tone and fading due to migration of the coloring material in the image. That is, there is the problem that, in some cases, the durability (especially humidity resistance) of a recorded matter obtained using yellow ink is worse than that of a recorded matter obtained using cyan ink or magenta ink. In the past various technological improvements have been carried out to resolve this problem.",
        "For example, to improve humidity resistance of a recorded matter, inks which include a coloring material having a specific structure such as C.I. Direct Yellow 173 or C.I. Direct Yellow 86 have been proposed (e.g. see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open H02-233781 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open H04-233975). Inks which include a novel coloring material having humidity resistance, light resistance, moisture resistance, a hue and vividness suitable for an ink jet recording method have also been proposed (e.g. see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2003-321627).",
        "As described above, there is a need for an ink jet ink which can provide images that have both high color developability and humidity resistance. However, regarding the color developability and humidity resistance of a recorded matter obtained from an ink jet recording method, there are users who are satisfied with the level of color developability and humidity resistance that can be obtained from a conventional ink jet ink.",
        "In view of this, although there are at present a variety of recording media for an ink jet recording method, it was discovered from investigations carried out by the present inventors that depending on the types of recording media and storage environment, a conventional ink jet ink may result in unsatisfactory color developability and humidity resistance even for such users.",
        "Therefore, it turned out that it is necessary to improve the color developability and humidity resistance even in some degree over those of conventional ink jet inks.",
        "Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet ink which provides an image having excellent color developability and humidity resistance.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an ink jet ink which provides images having excellent color developability and humidity resistance.",
        "Still another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording method and an ink cartridge which use the above-described ink jet ink.",
        "The above objects are achieved by the following present invention. That is, the ink jet ink of the present invention comprises at least a coloring material, wherein the coloring material comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59, and a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or a salt thereof.",
        "",
        "The method for producing an ink jet ink according to another embodiment of the present invention comprises a step of filling an ink jet ink tank which stores an ink jet ink comprising, as a coloring material, a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or salt thereof, with an ink jet ink comprising, as a coloring material, at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59.",

        "According to the present invention, an ink jet ink can be provided which provides an image having excellent color developability and humidity resistance. Further, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for producing an ink jet ink can be provided which provides an image having excellent color developability and humidity resistance.

        "It is essential that the ink according to the present invention comprise as a coloring material at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59. These coloring materials have excellent color developability, whereby images comparable in color developability of a silver-halide photograph can be formed by using an ink containing such a coloring material.",
        "In addition to the above-described coloring materials, it is essential that the ink according to the present invention comprise a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or a salt thereof. Since the compound represented by the following the general formula (I) or salts thereof have extremely high humidity resistance as well as good color developability, the humidity resistance of the coloring material which is at least one selected from the group consisting C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59, can be improved even if they are contained in a minute amount in the ink. Further, a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or a salt thereof does not impair the excellent inherent color developability of the coloring material, which is at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59.",
        "Specific examples of a counter ion in the salt of the compound represented by the general formula (I) include, for example, an alkali metal ion of lithium, sodium, potassium or the like, or an ammonium ion.",
        "",
        "The total content (mass %) of the coloring material in the ink according to the present invention is preferably from 0.1 mass % or more to 10.0 mass % or less with respect to the total mass of the ink. If the total content of the coloring material is less than 0.1 mass %, the humidity resistance and image density may not be sufficiently attained. If the total content of the coloring material exceeds 10.0 mass %, reliability as an ink jet ink, for instance the sticking properties or similar properties, may be lowered. The content (mass %) of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof is preferably from 0.05 mass % or more to 2.0 mass % or less with respect to the total mass of the ink. If the content of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof is less than 0.05 mass %, or if the content exceeds 2.0 mass %, the color developability and the humidity resistance may not be attained. Further, the ratio of the content (mass %) of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof (mass %) to the total content of the coloring material is preferably from 1.6 mass % or more to 20.0 mass % or less. If the ratio is less than 1.6 mass %, or if the ratio exceeds 20.0 mass %, the color developability and the humidity resistance may not be sufficiently attained.",
        "It is noted that neither the upper limit of the content of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, nor the upper limit of the content ratio of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof is particularly restricted. As long as the ink according to present invention comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I.

        "An example of an ink cartridge suitable for conducting recording by using the ink according to the present invention includes an ink cartridge which is provided with an ink storage portion for storing the ink. Specific examples of such an ink cartridge will be described below.",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic explanatory view of a liquid-storing container serving as an ink cartridge. In FIG. 1, the liquid-storing container (ink tank) has a structure such that it is in communication with the atmosphere at an upper section via an air communication opening 112, is in communication with an ink supply port at a lower section, and is partitioned by a partitioning wall 138 into a negative-pressure generation member holding chamber 134, which holds a negative-pressure generation member, and a liquid-storing chamber 136, which is essentially sealed, that stores the liquid ink. The negative-pressure generation member holding chamber 134 and the liquid-storing chamber 136 are in communication with each other only through a communication hole 140 formed in the partitioning wall 138 near a bottom section of the liquid-storing container (ink tank), and an air lead-in groove (air lead-in path) 150, whose purpose is to promote the introduction of air into the liquid-storing chamber during liquid supply operation. A plurality of ribs are formed in an integrated manner on an upper wall of the liquid-storing container (ink tank) which forms the negative-pressure generation member holding chamber 134 so as to project into the inside, wherein the ribs are brought into contact with the negative-pressure generation member, which is held in a compressed state, in the negative-pressure generation member holding chamber 134. These ribs form an air buffer chamber between the upper wall and an upper surface of the negative-pressure generation member. A pressure contact member 146 which has greater capillary force than the negative-pressure generation member and possesses great physical strength, is provided on an ink supply pipe provided with a liquid-supply port 114, whereby the ink supply pipe is brought into pressure contact with the negative-pressure generation member.",
        "Two capillary force generation type negative-pressure generation members, composed of a first negative-pressure generation member 132B and a second negative-pressure generation member 132A made from an olefin resin fiber such as polyethylene, are held as the negative-pressure generation member in the negative-pressure generation member holding chamber 134. The member 132C is a boundary layer between these two negative-pressure generation members, wherein the intersection of the boundary layer 132C with the partitioning wall 138 exists above the upper edge of the air lead-in groove (air lead-in path) 150 in the configuration in which the liquid-storing container is being used with its communication part positioned downward. The ink held in the negative-pressure generation members is present at a level higher than the above-described boundary layer 132C, as indicated by the liquid surface L of the ink.",
        "Here, the first negative-pressure generation member 132B is brought into pressure contact with the boundary layer of the second negative-pressure generation member 132A, so that the compression ratio in the vicinity of the boundary layer of the negative-pressure generation members is higher than that in the other sections, whereby strong capillary force is generated. That is, if the capillary force of the first negative-pressure generation member 132B is represented by P1, the capillary force of the second negative-pressure generation member 132A by P2 and the capillary force possessed by the interface between the negative-pressure generation members by PS, the relationship P2<P1<PS is satisfied.",

The liquid-storing container (ink tank) illustrated in FIG. 2 has a container 41 for storing three colors of inks (yellow (Y), magenta (M) and cyan (C)), and a cap member 42 which covers the container 41. The interior of the container 41 is partitioned into three spaces which have an approximately equal capacity by two partitioning plates 411 and 412 disposed parallel to each other for storing the three ink colors. These three spaces are aligned in the direction in which the ink tank is inserted when mounting the ink tanks onto an ink tank holder. Theses three spaces hold respectively an ink absorbing body 44Y for absorbing and retaining a yellow ink, an ink absorbing body 44M for absorbing and retaining a magenta ink, and an ink absorbing body 44C for absorbing and retaining a cyan ink. The inks held in these absorbing bodies 44Y, 44M and 44C, which act as negative-pressure generation members, are present at a level higher than the upper sections of the respective absorbing bodies, as indicated by the liquid surface L of the ink.",
        "In FIG. 2, the reference characters 43Y, 43M and 43C, as well as 45Y, 45M and 45C, denote respectively yellow (Y), magenta (M) and cyan (C) ink supply ports and ink supply members of the three colors of inks. Further, reference characters 46, 47, 47C, 48 and 49 denote respectively a retaining claw, a latch lever, a bottom incline, a latch claw and a bump portion.",
        "<Method for Producing Ink Jet Ink>",
        "There is no specific limitation concerning the method for producing the ink jet ink according to the present invention, as long as the constitutional requirements necessary for the ink according to the present invention are satisfied, i.e. provided that the ink contains, as a coloring material, at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59, and, a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof.",
        "In the present invention, it is particularly preferable that the method has a step of filling an ink tank storing an ink in which a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof is contained as a coloring material, with the ink containing, as a coloring material, at least one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Direct Yellow 86, C.I. Acid Yellow 23, C.I. Direct Yellow 173, C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 59. This is because it is possible to reduce costs through the reuse of an ink containing a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, which has excellent durability, and an ink cartridge which stores such ink. In addition to the above advantages, this is also because an ink cartridge which has once stored ink can provide such an accompanying advantage that ink refill is easy.",
