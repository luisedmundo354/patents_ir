        "Lancing devices are known in the medical health-care products industry for piercing the skin to produce blood for analysis. Typically, a drop of blood for this type of analysis is obtained by making a small incision in the fingertip, creating a small wound, which generates a small blood droplet on the surface of the skin.",
        "Early methods of lancing included piercing or slicing the skin with a needle or razor. Current methods utilize lancing devices that contain a multitude of spring, cam and mass actuators to drive the lancet. These include cantilever springs, diaphragms, coil springs, as well as gravity plumbs used to drive the lancet. The device may be held against the skin and mechanically triggered to ballistically launch the lancet. Unfortunately, the pain associated with each lancing event using known technology discourages patients from testing. In addition to vibratory stimulation of the skin as the driver impacts the end of a launcher stop, known spring based devices have the possibility of firing lancets that harmonically oscillate against the patient tissue, causing multiple strikes due to recoil. This recoil and multiple strikes of the lancet is one major impediment to patient compliance with a structured glucose monitoring regime.",
        "Another impediment to patient compliance is the lack of spontaneous blood flow generated by known lancing technology. In addition to the pain as discussed above, a patient may need more than one lancing event to obtain a blood sample since spontaneous blood generation is unreliable using known lancing technology. Thus the pain is multiplied by the number of attempts required by a patient to successfully generate spontaneous blood flow. Different skin thickness may yield different results in terms of pain perception, blood yield and success rate of obtaining blood between different users of the lancing device. Known devices poorly account for these skin thickness variations.",
        "A still further impediment to improved compliance with glucose monitoring are the many steps and inconvenience associated with each lancing event. Many diabetic patients that are insulin dependent may need to self-test for blood glucose levels five to six times daily. The large number of steps required in traditional methods of glucose testing, ranging from lancing, to milking of blood, applying blood to a test strip, and getting the measurements from the test strip, discourages many diabetic patients from testing their blood glucose levels as often as recommended. Older patients and those with deteriorating motor skills encounter difficulty loading lancets into launcher devices, transferring blood onto a test strip, or inserting thin test strips into slots on glucose measurement meters. Additionally, the wound channel left on the patient by known systems may also be of a size that discourages those who are active with their hands or who are worried about healing of those wound channels from testing their glucose levels.",
        "The present invention provides solutions for at least some of the drawbacks discussed above. Specifically, some embodiments of the present invention provide a multiple lancet solution to measuring analyte levels in the body. The invention may use a high density design. The invention may provide an indicator of the point of impact of a lancet or penetrating member used to sample fluid from tissue. At least some of these and other objectives described herein will be met by embodiments of the present invention.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a device is provided for use with a body fluid sampling device for extracting bodily fluid from an anatomical feature. The device comprises a cartridge having a plurality of cavities. The device may include a plurality of penetrating members each at least partially contained in the cavities of the cartridge wherein the penetrating members are slidably movable to extend outward from openings on the cartridge to penetrate tissue.

In one embodiment, at least one of the chambers includes an opening on one of its surfaces, wherein one of the analyte detecting members is visible through the opening.",

        "The present invention provides a multiple analyte detecting member solution for body fluid sampling. Specifically, some embodiments of the present invention provides a multiple analyte detecting member and multiple lancet solution to measuring analyte levels in the body. The invention may use a high density design. It may use lancets of smaller size, such as but not limited to diameter or length, than known lancets. The device may be used for multiple lancing events without having to remove a disposable from the device. The invention may provide improved sensing capabilities. At least some of these and other objectives described herein will be met by embodiments of the present invention.",

For example, if a device optionally contains a feature for analyzing a blood sample, this means that the analysis feature may or may not be present, and, thus, the description includes structures wherein a device possesses the analysis feature and structures wherein the analysis feature is not present.",
        "\u201cAnalyte detecting member\u201d refers to any use, singly or in combination, of chemical test reagents and methods, electrical test circuits and methods, physical test components and methods, optical test components and methods, and biological test reagents and methods to yield information about a blood sample. Such methods are well known in the art and may be based on teachings of, e.g. Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry, 3d Ed., Sec. V, pp. 776-78 (Burtis & Ashwood, Eds., W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1999); U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,817 to Chrismore et al. (Dec. 7, 1999); U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,394 to Phillips et al. (Oct. 22, 1991); U.S. Pat. No. 5,001,054 to Wagner et al.

        "FIGS. 1-11 of the accompanying drawings illustrates one embodiment of a system 10 for piercing tissue to obtain a blood sample. The system 10 may include a replaceable cartridge 12 and an apparatus 14 for removably receiving the cartridge 12 and for manipulating components of the cartridge 12.",
        "Referring jointly to FIGS. 1 and 2, the cartridge 12 may include a plurality of penetrating members 18. The cartridge 12 may be in the form of a circular disc and has an outer circular surface 20 and an opening forming an inner circular surface 22. A plurality of grooves 24 are formed in a planar surface 26 of the cartridge 12. Each groove 24 is elongated and extends radially out from a center point of the cartridge 12. Each groove 24 is formed through the outer circular surface 20. Although not shown, it should be understood that the grooves 24 are formed over the entire circumference of the planar surface 26. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, each groove 24 is relatively narrow closer to the center point of the cartridge 12 and slightly wider further from the center point. These grooves 24 may be molded into the cartridge 12, machined into the cartridge, forged, pressed, or formed using other methods useful in the manufacture of medical devices.",
        "In the present embodiment, each penetrating member 18 has an elongated body 26 and a sharpened distal end 27 having a sharp tip 30. The penetrating member 18 may have a circular cross-section with a diameter in this embodiment of about 0.315 mm. All outer surfaces of the penetrating member 18 may have the same coefficient of friction. The penetrating member may be, but is not necessarily, a bare lancet. The lancet is \u201cbare\u201d, in the sense that no raised formations or molded parts are formed thereon that are complementarily engageable with another structure. Traditional lancets include large plastic molded parts that are used to facilitate engagement. Unfortunately, such attachments add size and cost. In the most basic sense, a bare lancet or bare penetrating member is an elongate wire having sharpened end. If it is of sufficiently small diameter, the tip may be penetrating without having to be sharpened. A bare lancet may be bent and still be considered a bare lancet. The bare lancet in one embodiment may be made of one material.",
        "In the present embodiment, each penetrating member 18 is located in a respective one of the grooves 24. The penetrating members 18 have their sharpened distal ends 27 pointed radially out from the center point of the cartridge 12. A proximal end of each penetrating member 15 may engage in an interference fit with opposing sides of a respective groove 24 as shown in FIG. 3. Other embodiments of the cartridge 12 may not use such an interference fit. As a nonlimiting example, they may use a fracturable adhesive to releasably secure the penetrating member 18 to the cartridge 12. As shown in FIG. 4, more distal portions of the penetrating member 18 are not engaged with the opposing sides of the groove 24 due to the larger spacing between the sides.",
        "The cartridge 12 may further include a sterilization barrier 28 attached to the upper surface 26. The sterilization barrier 28 is located over the penetrating members 18 and serves to insulate the penetrating members 18 from external contaminants. The sterilization barrier 28 is made of a material that can easily be broken when an edge of a device applies a force thereto. The sterilization barrier 28 alone or in combination with other barriers may be used to create a sterile environment about at least the tip of the penetrating member prior to lancing or actuation. The sterilization barrier 28 may be made of a variety of materials such as but not limited to metallic foil, aluminum foil, paper, polymeric material, or laminates combining any of the above. Other details of the sterilization barrier are detailed herein.",
        "In the present embodiment, the apparatus 14 may include a housing 30, an initiator button 32, a penetrating member movement subassembly 34, a cartridge advance subassembly 36, batteries 38, a capacitor 40, a microprocessor controller 42, and switches 44. The housing 30 may have a lower portion 46 and a lid 48. The lid 48 is secured to the lower portion 46 with a hinge 50. The lower portion 46 may have a recess 52. A circular opening 54 in the lower portion 46 defines an outer boundary of the recess 52 and a level platform 56 of the lower portion 46 defines a base of the recess 52.",
        "In use, the lid 48 of the present embodiment is pivoted into a position as shown in FIG. 1. The cartridge 12 is flipped over and positioned in the recess 52. The planar surface 26 rests against the level platform 56 and the circular opening 54 contacts the outer circular surface 20 to prevent movement of the cartridge 12 in a plane thereof. The lid 48 is then pivoted in a direction 60 and closes the cartridge 12.",
        "Referring to the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the penetrating member movement subassembly 34 includes a lever 62, a penetrating member accelerator 64, a linear actuator 66, and a spring 68. Other suitable actuators including but not limited to rotary actuators are described in commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/127,395 filed Apr. 19, 2002. The lever 62 may be pivotably secured to the lower portion 46. The button 32 is located in an accessible position external of the lower portion 46 and is connected by a shaft 70 through the lower portion 46 to one end of the lever 62. The penetrating member accelerator 64 is mounted to an opposing end of the lever 62. A user depresses the button 32 in an upward direction 66 so that the shaft 70 pivots the end of the lever 62 to which it is connected in an upward direction. The opposing end of the lever pivots in a downward direction 66. The spring 46 is positioned between the button 32 and the base 40 and compresses when the button 32 is depressed to create a force that tends to move the button 32 down and pivot the penetrating member accelerator upward in a direction opposite to the direction 64.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B in this particular embodiment, the movement of the button into the position shown in FIG. 5 also causes contact between a terminal 74 on the shaft 20 with a terminal 70 secured to the lower portion 46. Contact between the terminals 74 and 76 indicates that the button 32 has been fully depressed. With the button 32 depressed, the cartridge 12 can be rotated without interference by the penetrating member actuator 64. To this effect, the cartridge advancer subsystem 36 includes a pinion gear 80 and a stepper motor 82. The stepper motor 82 is secured to the lower portion 46. The pinion gear 80 is secured to the stepper motor 82 and is rotated by the stepper motor 82. Teeth on the pinion gear 80 engage with teeth on the inner circular surface 22 of the cartridge 12. Rotation of the pinion gear 80 causes rotation of the cartridge 12 about the center point thereof. Each time that the terminals 74 and 76 make contact, the stepper motor 82 is operated to rotate the cartridge 12 through a discrete angle equal to an angular spacing from a centerline of one of the penetrating members 18 to a centerline of an adjacent penetrating member. A select penetrating member 18 is so moved over the penetrating member accelerator 64, as shown in FIG. 6B. Subsequent depressions of the button 32 will cause rotation of subsequent adjacent penetrating members 18 into a position over the penetrating member accelerator 64.",
        "The user then releases pressure from the button, as shown in FIG. 7A. The force created by the spring 68 or other resilient member moves the button 32 in a downward direction 76. The shaft 70 is pivotably secured to the lever 62 so that the shaft 70 moves the end of the lever 62 to which it is connected down. The opposite end of the lever 62 pivots the penetrating member accelerator 64 upward in a direction 80. As shown in FIG. 7B, an edge 82 of the penetrating member accelerator 64 breaks through a portion of the sterilization barrier 28 and comes in to physical contact with a lower side surface of the penetrating member 18.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8A, the linear actuator 66 includes separate advancing coils 86A and retracting coils 86B, and a magnetizable slug 90 within the coils 86A and 86B. The coils 86A and 86B are secured to the lower portion of 46, and the slug 90 can move within the coils 86A and 88B. Once the penetrating member accelerator 64 is located in the position shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, electric current is provided to the advancing coils 86 only. The current in the advancing coils 86 creates a force in a direction 88 on the slug 90 according to conventional principles relating to electromagnetics.",
        "A bearing 91 is secured to the lever and the penetrating member accelerator 64 has a slot 92 over the bearing 91. The slot 92 allows for the movement of the penetrating member accelerator 64 in the direction 88 relative to the lever 62, so that the force created on the slug moves the penetrating member accelerator 64 in the direction 88.",
        "The spring 68 is not entirely relaxed, so that the spring 68, through the lever 62, biases the penetrating member accelerator 64 against the lower side surface of the penetrating member 18 with a force F1. The penetrating member 18 rests against a base 88 of the cartridge 12. An equal and opposing force F2 is created by the base 88 on an upper side surface of the penetrating member 18.",
        "The edge 82 of the penetrating member accelerator 64 has a much higher coefficient of friction than the base 88 of the cartridge 12. The higher coefficient of friction of the edge contributes to a relatively high friction force F3 on the lower side surface of the penetrating member 18. The relatively low coefficient of friction of the base 88 creates a relatively small friction force F4 on the upper side surface of the penetrating member 18. A difference between the force F3 and F4 is a resultant force that accelerates the penetrating member in the direction 88 relative to the cartridge 12. The penetrating member is moved out of the interference fit illustrated in FIG. 3. The bare penetrating member 18 is moved without the need for any engagement formations on the penetrating member. Current devices, in contrast, often make use a plastic body molded onto each penetrating member to aid in manipulating the penetrating members. Movement of the penetrating member 18 moves the sharpened end thereof through an opening 90 in a side of the lower portion 46. The sharp end 30 of the penetrating member 18 is thereby moved from a retracted and safe position within the lower portion 46 into a position wherein it extends out of the opening 90. Accelerated, high-speed movement of the penetrating member is used so that the sharp tip 30 penetrates skin of a person. A blood sample can then be taken from the person, typically for diabetic analysis.",
        "Reference is now made to FIGS. 9A and 9B. After the penetrating member is accelerated (for example, but not limitation, less than 0.25 seconds thereafter), the current to the accelerating coils 86A is turned off and the current is provided to the retracting coils 86B. The slug 90 moves in an opposite direction 92 together with the penetrating member accelerator 64. The penetrating member accelerator 64 then returns the used penetrating member into its original position, i.e., the same as shown in FIG. 7B.",
        "Subsequent depression of the button as shown in FIG. 5 will then cause one repetition of the process described, but with an adjacent sterile penetrating member. Subsequent sterile penetrating members can so be used until all the penetrating members have been used, i.e., after one complete revolution of the cartridge 12. In this embodiment, a second revolution of the cartridge 12 is disallowed to prevent the use of penetrating members that have been used in a previous revolution and have become contaminated. The only way in which the user can continue to use the apparatus 14 is by opening \u2018the lid 48 as shown in FIG. 1, removing the used cartridge 12, and replacing the used cartridge with another cartridge. A detector (not shown) detects whenever a cartridge is removed and replaced with another cartridge. Such a detector may be but is not limited to an optical sensor, an electrical contact sensor, a bar code reader, or the like.",
        "FIG. 10 illustrates the manner in which the electrical components may be functionally interconnected for the present embodiment. The battery 38 provides power to the capacitor 40 and the controller 42. The terminal 76 is connected to the controller 42 so that the controller recognizes when the button 32 is depressed. The capacitor to provide power (electric potential and current) individually through the switches (such as field-effect transistors) to the advancing coils 86A, retracting coils 86B and the stepper motor 82. The switches 44A, B, and C are all under the control of the controller 42. A memory 100 is connected to the controller. A set of instructions is stored in the memory 100 and is readable by the controller 42. Further functioning of the controller 42 in combination with the terminal 76 and the switches 44A, B, and C should be evident from the foregoing description.",
        "FIG. 11 illustrates a configuration for another embodiment of a cartridge having penetrating members. The cartridge 112 has a corrugated configuration and a plurality of penetrating members 118 in grooves 124 formed in opposing sides of the cartridge 112. Sterilization barriers 126 and 128 are attached over the penetrating members 118 at the top and the penetrating members 118 at the bottom, respectively. Such an arrangement provides large surfaces for attachment of the sterilization barriers 126 and 128. All the penetrating members 118 on the one side are used first, whereafter the cartridge 112 is turned over and the penetrating members 118 on the other side are used. Additional aspects of such a cartridge are also discussed in FIGS. 42-44.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 12-13, a friction based method of coupling with and driving bare lancets or bare penetrating members will be described in further detail. Any embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein may be adapted to use these methods. As seen in FIG. 12, surface 201 is physically in contact with penetrating member 202. Surface 203 is also physically in contact with penetrating member 202. In the present embodiment of the invention, surface 201 is stainless steel, penetrating member 202 is stainless steel, and surface 203 is polytetrafluoroethylene-coated stainless steel.",
        "FIG. 13 illustrates one embodiment of the friction based coupling in use. Normal force 206 may be applied vertically to surface 201, pressing it against penetrating member 202. Penetrating member 202 is thereby pressed against surface 203. Normal force 206 is transmitted through surface 201 and penetrating member 202 to also act between penetrating member 202 and surface 203. Surface 203 is held rigid or stationary with respect to a target of the lancet. Using the classical static friction model, the maximum frictional force between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 is equal to the friction coefficient between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 multiplied by the normal force between surface 201 and penetrating member 202. In this embodiment, the maximum frictional force between surface 203 and penetrating member 202 is equal to the coefficient of friction between the surface 203 and the penetrating member 202 multiplied by the normal force between the-surface 203 and the penetrating member 202. Because friction coefficient between surface 203 and penetrating member 202 is less than friction coefficient between surface 201 and penetrating member 202, the interface between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 can develop a higher maximum static friction force than can the interface between surface 203 and penetrating member 202.",
        "Driving force as indicated by arrow 207 is applied to surface 201 perpendicular to normal force 206. The sum of the forces acting horizontally on surface 201 is the sum of driving force 207 and the friction force developed at the interface of surface 201 and penetrating member 202, which acts in opposition to driving force 207. Since the coefficient of friction between surface 203 and penetrating member 202 is less than the coefficient of friction between surface 201 and penetrating member 202, penetrating member 202 and surface 201 will remain stationary with respect to each other and can be considered to behave as one piece when driving force 207 just exceeds the maximum frictional force that can be supported by the interface between surface 203 and penetrating member 202. Surface 201 and penetrating member 202 can be considered one piece because the coefficient of friction between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 is high enough to prevent relative motion between the two.",
        "In one embodiment, the coefficient of friction between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 is approximately 0.8 corresponding to the coefficient of friction between two surfaces of stainless steel, while the coefficient of friction between surface 203 and penetrating member 202 is approximately 0.04, corresponding to the coefficient of friction between a surface of stainless steel and one of polytetrafluoroethylene. Normal force 206 has a value of 202 Newtons. Using these values, the maximum frictional force that the interface between surface 201 and penetrating member 202 can support is 1.6 Newtons, while the maximum frictional force that the interface between surface 203 and penetrating member 202 can support is 0.08 Newtons. If driving force 207 exceeds 0.08 Newtons, surface 201 and penetrating member 202 will begin to accelerate together with respect to surface 203. Likewise, if driving force 207 exceeds 1.6 Newtons and penetrating member 202 encounters a rigid barrier, surface 201 would move relative to penetrating member 202.",
        "Another condition, for example, for surface 201 to move relative to penetrating member 202 would be in the case of extreme acceleration. In an embodiment, penetrating member 202 has a mass of 8.24\u00d710-6 kg. An acceleration of 194,174 m/s2 of penetrating member 202 would therefore be required to exceed the frictional force between penetrating member 202 and surface 201, corresponding to approximately 19,800 g's. Without being bound to any particular embodiment or theory of operation, other methods of applying friction base coupling may also be used. For example, the penetrating member 202 may be engaged by a coupler using a interference fit to create the frictional engagement with the member.",
        "FIG. 14 illustrates a polytetrafluoroethylene coating on stainless steel surface 203 in detail. It should be understood that the surface 203 may be coated with other materials such as but not limited to Telfon\u00ae, silicon, polymer or glass. The coating may cover all of the penetrating member, only the proximal portions, only the distal portions, only the tip, only some other portion, or some combination of some or all of the above. FIG. 15 illustrates a doping of lead applied to surface 201, which conforms to penetrating member 202 microscopically when pressed against it. Both of these embodiments and other coated embodiments of a penetrating member may be used with the actuation methods described herein.",
        "The shapes and configurations of surface 201 and surface 102 could be some form other than shown in FIGS. 12-15. For example, surface 201 could be the surface of a wheel, which when rotated causes penetrating member 202 to advance or retract relative to surface 203. Surface 201 could be coated with another conformable material besides lead, such as a plastic. It could also be coated with particles, such as diamond dust, or given a surface texture to enhance the friction coefficient of surface 201 with penetrating member 202. Surface 202 could be made of or coated with diamond, fluorinated ethylene propylene, perfluoroalkoxy, a copolymer of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene, a copolymer of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene, or any other material with a coefficient of friction with penetrating member 202 lower than that of the material used for surface 201.",
        "Referring to FIG. 16, a portion of a base plate 210 of an embodiment of a penetrating member cartridge is shown with a plurality of penetrating member slots 212 disposed in a radial direction cut into a top surface 214 of the base plate. A drive member 216 is shown with a distal edge 218 disposed within one of the penetrating member slots 212 of the base plate 210. The distal edge 218 of the drive member 216 is configured to slide within the penetrating member slots 212 with a minimum of friction but with a close fit to minimize lateral movement during a lancing cycle.",
        "FIG. 17 shows a distal portion 220 of a coated penetrating member 222 in partial longitudinal section. The coated penetrating member 222 has a core portion 224, a coating 226 and a tapered distal end portion 228. A portion of a coated drive member 230 is shown having a coating 234 with penetrating member contact surface 236. The penetrating member contact surface 236 forms an interface 238 with an outer surface 240 of the coated penetrating member 222. The interface 238 has a characteristic friction coefficient that will depend in part on the choice of materials for the penetrating member coating 226 and the drive member coating 234. If silver is used as the penetrating member and drive member coating 226 and 236, this yields a friction coefficient of about 1.3 to about 1.5. Other materials can be used for coatings 226 and 236 to achieve the desired friction coefficient. For example, gold, platinum, stainless steel and other materials may be used for coatings 226 and 236. It may be desirable to use combinations of different materials for coatings 226 and 236. For example, an embodiment may include silver for a penetrating member coating 226 and gold for a drive member coating. Some embodiments of the interface 238 can have friction coefficients of about 1.15 to about 5.0, specifically, about 1.3 to about 2.0.",
        "Embodiments of the penetrating member 222 can have an outer transverse dimension or diameter of about 200 to about 400 microns, specifically, about 275 to about 325 microns. Embodiments of penetrating member 222 can have a length of about 10 to about 30 millimeters, specifically, about 15 to about 25 millimeters. Penetrating member 222 can be made from any suitable high strength alloy such as stainless steel or the like.",
        "FIG. 18 is a perspective view of a lancing device 242 having features of the invention. A penetrating member cartridge 244 is disposed about a driver 246 that is coupled to a drive member 248 by a coupler rod 250. The penetrating member cartridge 244 has a plurality of penetrating member slots 252 disposed in a radial configuration in a top surface 254 a base plate 256 of the penetrating member cartridge 244. The distal ends 253 of the penetrating member slots 252 are disposed at an outer surface 260 of the base plate 256. A fracturable sterility barrier 258, shown partially cut away, is disposed on the top surface 254 of base plate 256 over the plurality of penetrating member slots 252. The sterility barrier 258 is also disposed over the outer surface 260 of the base plate 256 in order to seal the penetrating member slots from contamination prior to a lancing cycle. A distal portion of a penetrating member 262 is shown extending radially from the penetrating member cartridge 244 in the direction of a patient's finger 264.",
        "FIG. 19 illustrates a portion of the base plate 256 used with the lancing device 242 in more detail and without sterility barrier 258 in place (for ease of illustration). The base plate 256 includes a plurality of penetrating member slots 252 which are in radial alignment with corresponding drive member slots 266. The drive member slots 266 have an optional tapered input configuration that may facilitate alignment of the drive member 248 during downward movement into the drive member slot 266 and penetrating member slot 252. Penetrating member slots 252 are sized and configured to accept a penetrating member 262 disposed therein and allow axial movement of the penetrating member 262 within the penetrating member slots 252 without substantial lateral movement.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 18, in use, the present embodiment of penetrating member cartridge 242 is placed in an operational configuration with the driver 246. A lancing cycle is initiated and the drive member 248 is brought down through the sterility barrier 258 and into a penetrating member slot 252. A penetrating member contact surface of the drive member then makes contact with an outside surface of the penetrating member 262 and is driven distally toward the patient's finger 264 as described above with regard to the embodiment discussed in FIG. 20. The friction coefficient between the penetrating member contact surface of the drive member 248 and the penetrating member 262 is greater than the friction coefficient between the penetrating member 262 and an interior surface of the penetrating member slots 252. As such, the drive member 248 is able to drive the penetrating member 262 distally through the sterility barrier 258 and into the patient's finger 264 without any relative movement or substantial relative movement between the drive member 248 and the penetrating member 262.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 20-22, a lancing cycle sequence is shown for a lancing device 242 with another embodiment of a penetrating member cartridge 244 as shown in FIGS. 23 and 24.

        "Referring again to FIG. 20, the penetrating member 262 is shown in the proximally retracted starting position within the penetrating member slot 252. The outer surface of the penetrating member 276 is in contact with the penetrating member contact surface 278 of the drive member 248. The friction coefficient between the penetrating member contact surface 278 of the drive member 248 and the outer surface 276 of the penetrating member 262 is greater than the friction coefficient between the penetrating member 262 and an interior surface 280 of the penetrating member slots 252.

        "FIGS. 25 and 26 illustrate an embodiment of a multiple layer sterility barrier 258 in the process of being penetrated by a penetrating member 62. It should be understood that this barrier 258 may be adapted for use with any embodiment of the present invention. The sterility barrier 258 shown in FIGS. 25 and 26 is a two layer sterility barrier 258 that facilitates maintaining sterility of the penetrating member 262 as it passes through and exits the sterility barrier 258. In FIG. 25, the distal end 286 of the penetrating member 262 is applying an axial force in a distal direction against an inside surface 288 of a first layer 290 of the sterility barrier 258, so as to deform the first layer 290 of the sterility barrier 258. The deformation 291 of the first layer 290 in turn applies a distorting force to the second layer 292 of the sterility barrier 258. The second layer of the sterility barrier is configured to have a lower tensile strength that the first layer 290. As such, the second layer 292 fails prior to the first layer 290 due to the strain imposed on the first layer 290 by the distal end 286 of the penetrating member 262, as shown in FIG. 26. After the second layer 292 fails, it then retracts from the deformed portion 291 of the first layer 290 as shown by arrows 294 in FIG. 26. As long as the inside surface 288 and outside surface 296 of the first layer 290 are sterile prior to failure of the second layer 292, the penetrating member 262 will remain sterile as it passes through the first layer 290 once the first layer eventually fails. Such a multiple layer sterility barrier 258 can be used for any of the embodiments discussed herein. The multiple layer sterility barrier 258 can also include three or more layers.",

It should be understood that a cartridge may include some, none, or all of these features, but they are shown in FIG. 52 for ease of illustration. The underside may include indentations or holes 510 close to the inner periphery for purpose of properly positioning the cartridge to engage a penetrating member gripper and/or to allow an advancing device (shown in FIGS. 56B and 56C) to rotate the cartridge 500. Indentations or holes 511 may be formed along various locations on the underside of cartridge 500 and may assume various shapes such as but not limited to, circular, rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, square, or combinations of any or all of the previous shapes. Notches 512 may also be formed along the inner surface of the cartridge 500 to assist in alignment and/or rotation of the cartridge. It should be understood of course that some of these features may also be placed on the topside of the cartridge in areas not occupied by cavities 501 that house the penetrating members. Notches 513 may also be incorporated along the outer periphery of the cartridge. These notches 513 may be used to gather excess material from the sterility barrier 28 (not shown) that may be used to cover the angled portion 514 of the cartridge. In the present embodiment, the cartridge has a flat top surface and an angled surface around the outside. Welding a foil type sterility barrier over that angled surface, the foil folds because of the change in the surfaces which is now at 45 degrees. This creates excess material.

        "As previously discussed, each cavity on the cartridge may be individually sealed with a foil cover or other sterile enclosure material to maintain sterility until or just before the time of use. In the present embodiment, penetrating members are released from their sterile environments just prior to actuation and are loaded onto a launcher mechanism for use. Releasing the penetrating member from the sterile environment prior to launch allows the penetrating member in the present embodiment to be actuated without having to pierce any sterile enclosure material which may dull the tip of the penetrating member or place contaminants on the member as it travels towards a target tissue. A variety of methods may be used accomplish this goal.",
        "FIG. 53A shows one embodiment of penetrating member release device, which in this embodiment is a punch plate 520 that is shown in a see-through depiction for ease of illustration. The punch plate 520 may include a first portion 521 for piercing sterile material covering the longitudinal opening 502 and a second portion 522 for piercing material covering the lateral opening 503. A slot 523 allows the penetrating member gripper to pass through the punch plate 520 and engage a penetrating member housed in the cartridge 500. The second portion 522 of the punch plate down to engage sterility barrier angled at about a 45 degree slope. Of course, the slope of the barrier may be varied. The punch portion 522 first contacts the rear of the front pocket sterility barrier and as it goes down, the cracks runs down each side and the barrier is pressed down to the bottom of the front cavity. The rear edge of the barrier first contacted by the punch portion 522 is broken off and the barrier is pressed down, substantially cleared out of the way. These features may be more clearly seen in FIG. 53B. The punch portion 521 may include a blade portion down the centerline. As the punch comes down, that blade may be aligned with the center of the cavity, cutting the sterility barrier into two pieces. The wider part of the punch 521 then pushes down on the barrier so the they align parallel to the sides of the cavity. This creates a complete and clear path for the gripper throughout the longitudinal opening of the cavity. Additionally, as seen in FIGS. 53B and 54A, a plurality of protrusion 524 are positioned to engage a cam (FIG. 55A) which sequences the punching and other vertical movement of punch plate 520 and cartridge pusher 525.

FIG. 54A shows the release and loading mechanism in rest state with a dirty bare penetrating member 527 held in a penetrating member gripper 530. This is the condition of the device between lancing events. When the time comes for the patient to initiate another lancing event, the used penetrating member is cleared and a new penetrating member is loaded, just prior to the actual lancing event. The patient begins the loading of a new penetrating member by operating a setting lever to initiate the process. The setting lever may operate mechanically to rotate a cam (see FIG. 55A) that moves the punch plate 520 and cartridge pusher 525. In other embodiments, a stepper motor or other mover such as but not limited to, a pneumatic actuator, hydraulic actuator, or the like are used to drive the loading sequence.",
        "FIG. 54B shows one embodiment of penetrating member gripper 530 in more detail. The penetrating member gripper 530 may be in the form of a tuning fork with sharp edges along the inside of the legs contacting the penetrating member. In some embodiments, the penetrating member may be notched, recessed, or otherwise shaped to receive the penetrating member gripper. As the gripper 530 is pushed down on the penetrating member, the legs are spread open elastically to create a frictional grip with the penetrating member such as but not limited to bare elongate wires without attachments molded or otherwise attached thereon. In some embodiments, the penetrating member is made of a homogenous material without any additional attachments that are molded, adhered, glued or otherwise added onto the penetrating member.",
        "In some embodiments, the gripper 530 may cut into the sides of the penetrating member. The penetrating member in one embodiment may be about 300 microns wide. The grooves that form in the side of the penetrating member by the knife edges are on the order of about 5-10 microns deep and are quite small. In this particular embodiment, the knife edges allow the apparatus to use a small insertion force to get the gripper onto the penetrating member, compared to the force to remove the penetrating member from the gripper the longitudinal axis of an elongate penetrating member. Thus, the risk of a penetrating member being detached during actuation are reduced. The gripper 530 may be made of a variety of materials such as, but not limited to high strength carbon steel that is heat treated to increased hardness, ceramic, substrates with diamond coating, composite reinforced plastic, elastomer, polymer, and sintered metals. Additionally, the steel may be surface treated. The gripper 130 may have high gripping force with low friction drag on solenoid or other driver.",
        "As seen in FIG. 54C, the sequence begins with punch plate 520 being pushed down. This results in the opening of the next sterile cavity 532. In some embodiment, this movement of punch plate 520 may also result in the crimping of the dirty penetrating member to prevent it from being used again. This crimping may result from a protrusion on the punch plate bending the penetrating member or pushing the penetrating member into a groove in the cartridge that hold the penetrating member in place through an interference fit. As seen in FIGS. 53B and 54C, the punch plate 520 has a protrusion or punch shaped to penetrate a longitudinal opening 502 and a lateral opening 503 on the cartridge. The first portion 521 of the punch that opens cavity 532 is shaped to first pierce the sterility barrier and then push, compresses, or otherwise moves sterile enclosure material towards the sides of the longitudinal opening 502. The second portion 522 of the punch pushes down the sterility barrier at lateral opening or penetrating member exit 503 such that the penetrating member does not pierce any materials when it is actuated toward a tissue site.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 54D, the cartridge pusher 525 is engaged by the cam 550 (not shown) and begins to push down on the cartridge 500. The punch plate 520 may also travel downward with the cartridge 500 until it is pushed down to it maximum downward position, while the penetrating member gripper 530 remains vertically stationary. This joint downward motion away from the penetrating member gripper 530 will remove the penetrating member from the gripper. The punch plate 520 essentially pushes against the penetrating member with protrusion 534 (FIG. 55A), holding the penetrating member with the cartridge, while the cartridge 500 and the punch plate 520 is lowered away from the penetrating member gripper 530 which in this embodiment remains vertically stationary. This causes the stripping of the used penetrating member from the gripper 530 (FIG. 45D) as the cartridge moves relative to the gripper.",
        "At this point as seen in FIG. 54E, the punch plate 520 retracts upward and the cartridge 500 is pushed fully down, clear of the gripper 530. Now cleared of obstructions and in a rotatable position, the cartridge 500 increments one pocket or cavity in the direction that brings the newly released, sterile penetrating member in cavity 532 into alignment with the penetrating member gripper 530, as see in FIG. 54F. The rotation of the cartridge occurs due to fingers engaging the holes or indentations 533 on the cartridge, as seen in FIG. 54A. In some embodiments, these indentations 533 do not pass completely through cartridge 500. In other embodiments, these indentations are holes passing completely through. The cartridge has a plurality of little indentations 533 on the top surface near the center of the cartridge, along the inside diameter. In the one embodiment, the sterility barrier is cut short so as not to cover these plurality of indentations 533. It should be understood of course that these holes may be located on bottom, side or other accessible surface. These indentations 533 have two purposes. The apparatus may have one or a plurality of locator pins, static pins, or other keying feature that dos not move. In this embodiment, the cartridge will only set down into positions where the gripper 530 is gripping the penetrating member. To index the cassette, the cartridge is lifted off those pins or other keyed feature, rotated around, and dropped onto those pins for the next position. The rotating device is through the use of two fingers: one is a static pawl and the other one is a sliding finger. They engage with the holes 533. The fingers are driven by a slider that may be automatically actuated or actuated by the user. This maybe occur mechanically or through electric or other powered devices. Halfway through the stroke, a finger may engage and rotate around the cartridge. A more complete description can be found with text associated with FIGS. 56B-56C.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 54G, with the sterile penetrating member in alignment, the cartridge 500 is released as indicated by arrows 540 and brought back into contact with the penetrating member gripper 530. The new penetrating member 541 is inserted into the gripper 530, and the apparatus is ready to fire once again. After launch and in between lancing events for the present embodiment, the bare lancet or penetrating member 541 is held in place by gripper 530, preventing the penetrating member from accidentally protruding or sliding out of the cartridge 500.",
        "It should be understood of course, that variations can be added to the above embodiment without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the penetrating member 541 may be placed in a parked position in the cartridge 500 prior to launch. As seen in FIG. 55A, the penetrating member is held by a narrowed portion 542 of the cartridge, creating an interference fit which pinches the proximal end of the penetrating member. Friction from the molding or cartridge holds the penetrating member during rest, preventing the penetrating member from sliding back and forth. Of course, other methods of holding the penetrating member may also be used. As seen in FIG. 55B prior to launch, the penetrating member gripper 530 may pull the penetrating member 541 out of the portion 542. The penetrating member 541 may remain in this portion until actuated by the solenoid or other force generator coupled to the penetrating member gripper. A cam surface 544 may be used to pull the penetrating member out of the portion 542. This mechanical cam surface may be coupled to the mechanical slider driven by the patient, which may be considered a separate force generator. Thus, energy from the patient extracts the penetrating member and this reduces the drain on the device's battery if the solenoid or electric driver were to pull out the penetrating member. The penetrating member may be moved forward a small distance (on the order of about 1 mm or less) from its parked position to pull the penetrating member from the rest position gripper. After penetrating tissue, the penetrating member may be returned to the cartridge and eventually placed into the parked position. This may also occur, though not necessarily, through force provided by the patient. In one embodiment, the placing of the lancet into the parked position does not occur until the process for loading a new penetrating member is initiated by the patient. In other embodiments, the pulling out of the parked position occurs in the same motion as the penetrating member actuation. The return into the parked position may also be considered a continuous motion.",
        "FIG. 55A also shows one embodiment of the cam and other surfaces used to coordinate the motion of the punch plate 520. For example, cam 550 in this embodiment is circular and engages the protrusions 524 on the punch plate 520 and the cartridge pusher 525. FIG. 55A also more clearly shows protrusion 534 which helps to hold the penetrating member in the cartridge 500 while the penetrating member gripper 530 pulls away from the member, relatively speaking. A ratchet surface 552 that rotates with the cam 550 may be used to prevent the cam from rotating backwards. The raising and lower of cartridge 500 and punch plate 50 used to load/unload penetrating members may be mechanically actuated by a variety of cam surfaces, springs, or the like as may be determined by one skilled in the art. Some embodiments may also use electrical or magnetic device to perform the loading, unloading, and release of bare penetrating members. Although the punch plate 520 is shown to be punching downward to displace, remove, or move the foil or other sterile environment enclosure, it should be understood that other methods such as stripping, pulling, tearing, or some combination of one or more of these methods may be used to remove the foil or sterile enclosure. For example, in other embodiments, the punch plate 520 may be located on an underside of the cartridge and punch upward. In other embodiments, the cartridge may remain vertically stationary while other parts such as the penetrating member gripper and punch plate move to load a sterile penetrating member on to the penetrating member gripper.",
        "FIG. 55B also shows other features that may be included in the present apparatus. A fire button 560 may be included for the user to actuate the penetrating member. A front end interface 561 may be included to allow a patient to seat their finger or other target tissue for lancing. The interface 561 may be removable to be cleaned or replaced. A visual display 562 may be included to show device status, lancing performance, error reports, or the like to the patient.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 56A, a mechanical slider 564 used by the patient to load new penetrating member may also be incorporated on the housing. The slider 564 may also be coupled to activate an LCD or visual display on the lancing apparatus. In addition to providing a source of energy to index the cartridge, the slider 564 may also switch the electronics to start the display. The user may use the display to select the depth of lancing or other feature. The display may go back to sleep again until it is activated again by motion of the slider 564. The underside the housing 566 may also be hinged or otherwise removable to allow the insertion of cartridge 500 into the device. The cartridge 500 may be inserted using technology current used for insertion of a compact disc or other disc into a compact disc player. In one embodiment, there may be a tray which is deployed outward to receive or to remove a cartridge. The tray may be withdrawn into the apparatus where it may be elevated, lowered, or otherwise transported into position for use with the penetrating member driver. In other embodiments, the apparatus may have a slot into which the cartridge is partially inserted at which point a mechanical apparatus will assist in completing insertion of the cartridge and load the cartridge into proper position inside the apparatus. Such device is akin to the type of compact disc player found on automobiles. The insertions/ejection and loading apparatus of these compact disc players uses gears, pulleys, cables, trays, and/or other parts that may be adapted for use with the present invention.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 56B, a more detailed view of one embodiment of the slider 564 is provided. In this embodiment, the slider 564 will move initially as indicated by arrow 567. To complete the cycle, the patient will return the slider to its home position or original starting position as indicated by arrow 568. The slider 564 has an arm 569 which moves with the slider to rotate the cam 550 and engage portions 522. The motion of the slider 564 is also mechanically coupled to a finger 570 which engage the indentations 571 on cartridge 500. The finger 570 is synchronized to rotate the cartridge 500 by pulling as indicated by arrow 572 in the same plane as the cartridge. It should be understood that in some embodiments, the finger 570 pushes instead of pulls to rotate the cartridge in the correct direction. The finger 570 may also be adapted to engage ratchet surfaces 706 as seen in FIG. 66 to rotate a cartridge. The finger 570 may also incorporate vertical motion to coordinate with the rising and lowering of the cartridge 500. The motion of finger 570 may also be powered by electric actuators such as a stepper motor or other device useful for achieving motion. FIG. 56B also shows a portion of the encoder 573 used in position sensing.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 56C, a still further view of the slider 564 and arm 569 is shown. The arm 569 moves to engage portion 522 as indicated by arrow 575 and this causes the cam 550 to rotate as indicated by arrow 577. In this particular embodiment, the cam 550 rotates about 1/8 of an rotation with each pull of the slider 564. When the slider 564 is return to its home or start position, the arm 569 rides over the portion 522. The movement of the slider also allows the cam surface 544 to rotate about pivot point 579. A resilient member 580 may be coupled to the cam surface 544 to cause it to rotate counterclockwise when the arm 569 moves in the direction of arrow 567. The pin 580 will remain in contact with the arm 569. As the cam surface 544 rotates a first surface 582 will contact the pin 583 on the gripper block 584 and pull the pin 583 back to park a penetrating member into a coupling or narrowed portion 542 of the cartridge 500 as seen in FIG. 55A. As the arm 569 is brought back to the home position, the cam surface 544 rotates back and a second surface 586 that rotates clockwise and pushes the penetrating member forward to be released from the narrowed portion 542 resulting in a position as seen in FIG. 55B. It should be understood that in some embodiments, the release and/or parking of lancet from portion 542 may be powered by the driver 588 without using the mechanical assistance from cam surface 544.",
        "In another embodiment of the cartridge device, a mechanical feature may be included on the cartridge so that there is only one way to load it into the apparatus. For example, in one embodiment holding 50 penetrating members, the cartridge may have 51 pockets or cavities. The 51st pocket will go into the firing position when the device is loaded, thus providing a location for the gripper to rest in the cartridge without releasing a penetrating member from a sterile environment. The gripper 530 in that zeroth position is inside the pocket or cavity and that is the reason why one of the pockets may be empty. Of course, some embodiments may have the gripper 530 positioned to grip a penetrating member as the cartridge 500 is loaded into the device, with the patient lancing themselves soon afterwards so that the penetrating member is not contaminated due to prolonged exposure outside the sterile enclosure. That zeroth position may be the start and finish position. The cartridge may also be notched to engaged a protrusion on the apparatus, thus also providing a method for allowing the penetrating member to loaded or unloaded only in one orientation. Essentially, the cartridge 500 may be keyed or slotted in association with the apparatus so that the cartridge 500 can only be inserted or removed at one orientation. For example as seen in FIG. 56D, the cartridge 592 may have a keyed slot 593 that matches the outline of a protrusion 594 such that the cartridge 592 may only be removed upon alignment of the slot 593 and protrusion 594 upon at the start or end positions. It should be understood that other keyed technology may be used and the slot or key may be located on an outer periphery or other location on the cartridge 592 in manner useful for allowing insertion or removal of the cartridge from only one or a select number of orientations.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 57, a cross-section of another embodiment of a cavity 600 housing a penetrating member is shown. The cavity 600 may include a depression 602 for allowing the gripper 530 to penetrate sufficiently deeply into the cavity to frictionally engage the penetrating member 541. The penetrating member may also be housed in a groove 604 that holds the penetrating member in place prior to and after actuation. The penetrating member 541 is lifted upward to clear the groove 604 during actuation and exits through opening 506.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 58, another variation on the system according to the present invention will now be described. FIG. 58 shows a lancing system 610 wherein the penetrating members have their sharpened tip pointed radially inward. The finger or other tissue of the patient is inserted through the center hole 611 to be pierced by the member 612. The penetrating member gripper 530 coupled to drive force generator 613 operate in substantially the same manner as described in FIGS. 54A-G. The punch portions 521 and 522 operate in substantially the same manner to release the penetrating members from the sterile enclosures. The punch portion 522 may be placed on the inner periphery of the device, where the penetrating member exit is now located, so that sterile enclosure material is cleared out of the path of the penetrating member exit.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 59, a still further variation on the lancing system according to the present invention will now be described. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 53-54, the penetrating member gripper 530 approaches the penetrating member from above and at least a portion of the drive system is located in a different plane from that of the cartridge 500. FIG. 59 shows an embodiment where the penetrating member driver 620 is in substantially the same plane as the penetrating member 622. The coupler 624 engages a bent or L shaped portion 626 of the member 622. The cartridge 628 can rotate to engage a new penetrating member with the coupler 624 without having to move the cartridge or coupler vertically. The next penetrating member rotates into position in the slot provided by the coupler 624. A narrowed portion of the cartridge acts as a penetrating member guide 630 near the distal end of the penetrating member to align the penetrating member as it exits the cartridge.",
        "The coupler 624 may come in a variety of configurations. For example, FIG. 60A shows a coupler 632 which can engage a penetrating member 633 that does not have a bent or L-shaped portion. A radial cartridge carrying such a penetrating member 633 may rotate to slide penetrating member into the groove 634 of the coupler 632. FIG. 60B is a front view showing that the coupler 632 may include a tapered portion 636 to guide the penetrating member 633 into the slot 634. FIG. 60C shows an embodiment of the driver 620 using a coupler 637 having a slot 638 for receiving a T-shaped penetrating member. The coupler 637 may further include a protrusion 639 that may be guided in an overhead slot to maintain alignment of the drive shaft during actuation.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 61, a cartridge 640 for use with an in-plane driver 620 is shown. The cartridge 640 includes an empty slot 642 that allows the cartridge to be placed in position with the driver 620. In this embodiment, the empty slot 642 allows the coupler 644 to be positioned to engage an unused penetrating member 645 that may be rotated into position as shown by arrow 646. As seen in FIG. 61, the cartridge 640 may also be designed so that only the portion of the penetrating member that needs to remain sterile (i.e. the portions that may actually be penetrating into tissue) are enclosed. As seen in FIG. 61, a proximal portion 647 of the penetrating member is exposed. This exposed proximal portion may be about 70% of the penetrating member. In other embodiments it may be between about 69% to about 5% of the penetrating member. The cartridge 640 may further include, but not necessarily, sealing protrusions 648. These protrusions 648 are releasably coupled to the cartridge 640 and are removed from the cartridge 640 by remover 649 as the cartridge rotates to place penetrating member 645 into the position of the active penetrating member. The sterile environment is broken prior to actuation of the member 645 and the member does not penetrate sterile enclosure material that may dull the tip of the penetrating member during actuation. A fracturable seal material 650 may be applied to the member to seal against an inner peripheral portion of the cartridge.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 62, a still further embodiment of a cartridge for use with the present invention will be described. This cartridge 652 includes a tapered portion 654 for allowing the coupler 655 to enter the cavity 656. A narrowed portion 657 guides the penetrating member 658. The coupler 655 may have, but does not necessarily have, movable jaws 659 that engage to grip the penetrating member 658. Allowing the coupler to enter the cavity 656 allows the alignment of the penetrating member to be better maintained during actuation. This tapered portion 654 may be adapted for use with any embodiment of the cartridge disclosed herein.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 63, a linear cartridge 660 for use with the present invention will be described. Although the present invention has been shown in use with radial cartridges, the lancing system may be adapted for use with cartridges of other shapes. FIGS. 79-83 show other cartridges of varying shapes adaptable for use with the present invention. FIG. 63 illustrates a cartridge 660 with only a portion 662 providing sterile protection for the penetrating members. The cartridge 660, however, provides a base 664 on which a penetrating member 665 can rest. This provides a level of protection of the penetrating member during handling. The base 664 may also be shaped to provide slots 666 in which a penetrating member 667 may be held. The slot 666 may also be adapted to have a tapered portion 668. These configurations may be adapted for use with any of the embodiments disclosed herein, such as the cartridge 652.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 64A-64C, a variety of different devices are shown for releasing the sterility seal covering a lateral opening 503 on the cartridge 500. FIG. 64A shows a rotating punch device 670 that has protrusions 672 that punch out the sterility barrier creating openings 674 from which a penetrating member can exit without touching the sterility barrier material. FIG. 64B shows a vertically rotating device 676 with shaped protrusions 678 that punch down the sterility barrier 679 as it is rotated to be in the active, firing position. FIG. 64C shows a punch 680 which is positioned to punch out barrier 682 when the cartridge is lowered onto the punch. The cartridge is rotated and the punch 680 rotates with the cartridge. After the cartridge is rotated to the proper position and lifted up, the punch 680 is spring loaded or otherwise configured to return to the position to engage the sterility barrier covering the next unused penetrating member.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 65A-65B, another type of punch mechanism for use with a punch plate 520 will now be described. The device shown in FIGS. 53-54 shows a mechanism that first punches and then rotates or indexes the released penetrating member into position. In this present embodiment, the cartridge is rotated first and then the gripper and punch may move down simultaneously. FIG. 65A shows a punch 685 having a first portion 686 and a second portion 687. As seen in cross-sectional view of FIG. 65B, the penetrating member gripper 690 is located inside the punch 685. Thus the penetrating of the sterility barrier is integrated into the step of engaging the penetrating member with the gripper 690. The punch 685 may include a slot 692 allowing a portion 694 of the gripper 690 to extend upward. A lateral opening 695 is provided from which a penetrating member may exit. In some embodiments, the punch portion 687 is not included with punch 686, instead relying on some other mechanism such as those shown in FIGS. 64A-64C to press down on barrier material covering a lateral opening 503.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 66, a still further embodiment of a cartridge according to the present invention will be described. FIG. 66 shows a cartridge 700 with a plurality of cavities 702 and individual deflectable portions or fingers 704. The ends of the protective cavities 702 may be divided into individual fingers (such as one for each cavity) on the outer periphery of the disc. Each finger 704 may be individually sealed with a foil cover (not shown for ease of illustration) to maintain sterility until the time of use. Along the inner periphery of the cartridge 700 are raised step portions 706 to create a ratchet type mechanism. As seen in FIG. 67, a penetrating member 708 may be housed in each cavity. The penetrating member may rest on a raised portion 710. A narrowed portion 712 pinches the proximal portions of the penetration member 708. Each cavity may include a wall portion 714 into which the penetrating member 708 may be driven after the penetrating member has been used. FIG. 68 shows the penetrating member gripper 716 lowered to engage a penetrating member 708. For ease of illustration, a sterility barrier covering each of the cavities is not shown.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 69A-69L, the sequence of steps for actuating a penetrating member in a cartridge 700 will be described. It should be understood that in other embodiments, steps may be combined or reduced without departing from the sprit of the present invention. The last penetrating member to be used may be left in a retracted position, captured by a gripper 716. The end of the protective cavity 704 may be deflected downward by the previous actuation. The user may operate a mechanism such as but not limited to a thumbwheel, lever, crank, slider, etc . . . that advances a new penetrating member 720 into launch position as seen in FIG. 69A. The mechanism lifts a bar that allows the protective cavity to return to its original position in the plane of the disc.",
        "In this embodiment as shown in FIG. 69B, the penetrating member guide 722 presses through foil in rear of pocket to \u201chome\u201d penetrating member and control vertical clearance. For ease of illustration, actuation devices for moving the penetrating member guide 722 and other mechanisms are not shown. They may be springs, cams, or other devices that can lower and move the components shown in these figures. In some embodiments, the cartridge 700 may be raised or lowered to engage the penetrating member guide 722 and other devices.",
        "As seen in FIG. 69C, the plough or sterile enclosure release device 724 is lowered to engage the cartridge 700. In some embodiments, the disc or cartridge 700 may raised part way upward until a plough or plow blade 724 pierces the sterility barrier 726 which may be a foil covering.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 69D, the plough 724 clears foil from front of pocket and leaves it attached to cartridge 700. The plough 724 is driven radially inward, cutting open the sterility barrier and rolling the scrap into a coil ahead of the plough. Foil naturally curls over and forms tight coil when plough lead angle is around 55 degs to horizontal. If angle of the plough may be between about 60-40 degs, preferably closer to 55 degs. In some embodiments, the foil may be removed in such a manner that the penetrating member does not need to pierce any sterile enclosure materials during launch.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 69E, the gripper 716 may be lowered to engage the bare penetrating member or piercing member 720. Optionally, the disc or cartridge 8000 may be raised until the penetrating member 720 is pressed firmly into the gripper 716. Although not shown in the present figure, the penetrating member driver or actuator of the present embodiment may remain in the same horizontal plane as the penetrating member.",
        "As seen in FIG. 69F, a bar 730 may be pressed downward on the outer end 732 of the protective cavity to deflect it so it is clear of the path of the penetrating member. In the present embodiment, the bar 730 is shaped to allow the bare penetrating member 720 to pass through. It should be understood that other shapes and orientations of the bar (such as contacting only one side or part of end 732) may be used to engage the end 732.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 69G, an electrical solenoid or other electronic or feed-back controllable drive may actuate the gripper 716 radially outward, carrying the bare penetrating member 720 with it. The bare penetrating member projects from the protective case and into the skin of a finger or other tissue site that has been placed over the aperture of the actuator assembly. Suitable penetrating member drivers are described in commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/127,395 filed Apr. 19, 2002.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 69H, the solenoid or other suitable penetrating member driver retracts the bare penetrating member 720 into a retracted position where it parks until the beginning of the next lancing cycle.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 691, bar 730 may be released so that the end 150 returns to an in-plane configuration with the cartridge 800.",
        "As seen in FIG. 69J, the gripper 716 may drive a used bare penetrating member radially outward until the sharpened tip is embedded into a plastic wall 714 at or near the outward end 732 of the cavity thus immobilizing the contaminated penetrating member.",
        "As seen in FIGS. 69K and 69L, the plough 724, the gripper 716, and penetrating member guide 722 may all be disengaged from the bare penetrating member 720. Optionally, it should be understood that the advance mechanism may lower the cartridge 700 from the gripper 716. The used penetrating member, restrained by the tip embedded in plastic, and by the cover foil at the opposite end, is stripped from the gripper. The disc or cartridge 700 may be rotated until a new, sealed; sterile penetrating member is in position under the launch mechanism.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 70 and 71, one object for some embodiments of the invention is to include blood sampling and sensing on this penetrating member actuation device. In the present embodiment, the drive mechanism (gripper 738 and solenoid drive coil 739) may be used to drive a penetrating member into the skin and couple this lancing event to acquire the blood sample as it forms at the surface of the finger. In a first embodiment shown in FIG. 70, microfluidic module 740 bearing the analyte detecting member chemistry and detection device 742 (FIG. 71) is couple on to the shaft of the penetrating member 720. The drive cycle described above may also actuate the module 740 so that it rests at the surface of the finger to acquire blood once the penetrating member retracts from the wound. The module 740 is allowed to remain on the surface of the finger or other tissue site until the gripper 738 has reached the back end 744 of the microfluidics module 740, at which point the module is also retracted into the casing. The amount of time the module 740 remains on the finger, in this embodiment, may be varied based on the distance the end 744 is located and the amount of time it takes the gripper to engage it on the withdrawal stroke. The blood filled module 740, filled while the module remains on pierced tissue site, may then undergo analyte detection by means such as optical or electrochemical sensing.",
        "The blood may be filled in the lumen that the penetrating member was in or the module may have separately defined sample chambers to the side of the penetrating member lumen. The analyte detecting member may also be placed right at the immediate vicinity or slightly setback from the module opening receiving blood so that low blood volumes will still reach the analyte detecting member. In some embodiments, the analyte sensing device and a visual display or other interface may be on board the apparatus and thus provide a readout of analyte levels without need to plug apparatus or a test strip into a separate reader device. As seen in FIG. 71, the cover 746 may also be clear to allow for light to pass through for optical sensing. The analyte detecting member may be used with low volumes such as less than about 1 microliter of sample, preferably less than about 0.6 microliter, more preferably less than about 0.3 microliter, and most preferably less than about 0.1 microliter of sample.",
        "In another embodiment as seen in FIG. 72, sensing elements 760 may be directly printed or formed on the top of bottom of the penetrating member cartridge 700, depending on orientation. The bare penetrating member 720 is then actuated through a hole 762 in the plastic facing, withdrawn into the radial cavity followed by the blood sample. Electrochemical or optical detection for analyte sensing may then be carried out (FIG. 72). Again the cavity 766 may have a clear portion to allow light to pass for optical sensing. In one embodiment, a multiplicity of miniaturized analyte detecting member fields may be placed on the floor of the radial cavity as shown in FIG. 72 or on the microfluidic module shown in FIG. 71 to allow many tests on a single analyte form a single drop of blood to improve accuracy and precision of measurement. Although not limited in this manner, additional analyte detecting member fields or regions may also be included for calibration or other purposes.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 73, a still further embodiment of a cartridge according to the present invention will be described. FIG. 73 shows one embodiment of a cartridge 800 which may be removably inserted into an apparatus for driving penetrating members to pierce skin or tissue. The cartridge 800 has a plurality of penetrating members 802 that may be individually or otherwise selectively actuated so that the penetrating members 802 may extend outward from the cartridge, as indicated by arrow 804, to penetrate tissue. In the present embodiment, the cartridge 800 may be based on a flat disc with a number of penetrating members such as, but in no way limited to, (25, 50, 75, 100, . . . ) arranged radially on the disc or cartridge 800. It should be understood that although the cartridge 800 is shown as a disc or a disc-shaped housing, other shapes or configurations of the cartridge may also work without departing from the spirit of the present invention of placing a plurality of penetrating members to be engaged, singly or in some combination, by a penetrating member driver.",
        "Each penetrating member 802 may be contained in a cavity 806 in the cartridge 800 with the penetrating member's sharpened end facing radially outward and may be in the same plane as that of the cartridge. The cavity 806 may be molded, pressed, forged, or otherwise formed in the cartridge. Although not limited in this manner, the ends of the cavities 806 may be divided into individual fingers (such as one for each cavity) on the outer periphery of the disc. The particular shape of each cavity 806 may be designed to suit the size or shape of the penetrating member therein or the amount of space desired for placement of the analyte detecting members 808. For example and not limitation, the cavity 806 may have a V-shaped cross-section, a U-shaped cross-section, C-shaped cross-section, a multi-level cross section or the other cross-sections. The opening 810 through which a penetrating member 802 may exit to penetrate tissue may also have a variety of shapes, such as but not limited to, a circular opening, a square or rectangular opening, a U-shaped opening, a narrow opening that only allows the penetrating member to pass, an opening with more clearance on the sides, a slit, a configuration as shown in FIG. 75, or the other shapes.",
        "In this embodiment, after actuation, the penetrating member 802 is returned into the cartridge and may be held within the cartridge 800 in a manner so that it is not able to be used again. By way of example and not limitation, a used penetrating member may be returned into the cartridge and held by the launcher in position until the next lancing event. At the time of the next lancing, the launcher may disengage the used penetrating member with the cartridge 800 turned or indexed to the next clean penetrating member such that the cavity holding the used penetrating member is position so that it is not accessible to the user (i.e. turn away from a penetrating member exit opening). In some embodiments, the tip of a used penetrating member may be driven into a protective stop that hold the penetrating member in place after use. The cartridge 800 is replaceable with a new cartridge 800 once all the penetrating members have been used or at such other time or condition as deemed desirable by the user.",
        "Referring still to the embodiment in FIG. 73, the cartridge 800 may provide sterile environments for penetrating members via seals, foils, covers, polymeric, or similar materials used to seal the cavities and provide enclosed areas for the penetrating members to rest in. In the present embodiment, a foil or seal layer 820 is applied to one surface of the cartridge 800. The seal layer 820 may be made of a variety of materials such as a metallic foil or other seal materials and may be of a tensile strength and other quality that may provide a sealed, sterile environment until the seal layer 820 is penetrate by a suitable or penetrating device providing a preselected or selected amount of force to open the sealed, sterile environment. Each cavity 806 may be individually sealed with a layer 820 in a manner such that the opening of one cavity does not interfere with the sterility in an adjacent or other cavity in the cartridge 800. As seen in the embodiment of FIG. 73, the seal layer 820 may be a planar material that is adhered to a top surface of the cartridge 800.",
        "Depending on the orientation of the cartridge 800 in the penetrating member driver apparatus, the seal layer 820 may be on the top surface, side surface, bottom surface, or other positioned surface. For ease of illustration and discussion of the embodiment of FIG. 73, the layer 820 is placed on a top surface of the cartridge 800. The cavities 806 holding the penetrating members 802 are sealed on by the foil layer 820 and thus create the sterile environments for the penetrating members. The foil layer 820 may seal a plurality of cavities 806 or only a select number of cavities as desired.",
        "In a still further feature of FIG. 73, the cartridge 800 may optionally include a plurality of analyte detecting members 808 on a substrate 822 which may be attached to a bottom surface of the cartridge 800. The substrate may be made of a material such as, but not limited to, a polymer, a foil, or other material suitable for attaching to a cartridge and holding the analyte detecting members 808. As seen in FIG. 73, the substrate 822 may hold a plurality of analyte detecting members, such as but not limited to, about 10-50, 50-100, or other combinations of analyte detecting members. This facilitates the assembly and integration of analyte detecting members 808 with cartridge 800. These analyte detecting members 808 may enable an integrated body fluid sampling system where the penetrating members 802 create a wound tract in a target tissue, which expresses body fluid that flows into the cartridge for analyte detection by at least one of the analyte detecting members 808. The substrate 822 may contain any number of analyte detecting members 808 suitable for detecting analytes in cartridge having a plurality of cavities 806. In one embodiment, many analyte detecting members 808 may be printed onto a single substrate 822 which is then adhered to the cartridge to facilitate manufacturing and simplify assembly. The analyte detecting members 808 may be electrochemical in nature. The analyte detecting members 808 may further contain enzymes, dyes, or other detectors which react when exposed to the desired analyte. Additionally, the analyte detecting members 808 may comprise of clear optical windows that allow light to pass into the body fluid for analyte analysis. The number, location, and type of analyte detecting member 808 may be varied as desired, based in part on the design of the cartridge, number of analytes to be measured, the need for analyte detecting member calibration, and the sensitivity of the analyte detecting members. If the cartridge 800 uses an analyte detecting member arrangement where the analyte detecting members are on a substrate attached to the bottom of the cartridge, there may be through holes (as shown in FIG. 76), wicking elements, capillary tube or other devices on the cartridge 800 to allow body fluid to flow from the cartridge to the analyte detecting members 808 for analysis. In other configurations, the analyte detecting members 808 may be printed, formed, or otherwise located directly in the cavities housing the penetrating members 802 or areas on the cartridge surface that receive blood after lancing.",
        "The use of the seal layer 820 and substrate or analyte detecting member layer 822 may facilitate the manufacture of these cartridges 10. For example, a single seal layer 820 may be adhered, attached, or otherwise coupled to the cartridge 800 as indicated by arrows 824 to seal many of the cavities 806 at one time. A sheet 822 of analyte detecting members may also be adhered, attached, or otherwise coupled to the cartridge 800 as indicated by arrows 825 to provide many analyte detecting members on the cartridge at one time. During manufacturing of one embodiment of the present invention, the cartridge 800 may be loaded with penetrating members 802, sealed with layer 820 and a temporary layer (not shown) on the bottom where substrate 822 would later go, to provide a sealed environment for the penetrating members. This assembly with the temporary bottom layer is then taken to be sterilized. After sterilization, the assembly is taken to a clean room (or it may already be in a clear room or equivalent environment) where the temporary bottom layer is removed and the substrate 822 with analyte detecting members is coupled to the cartridge as shown in FIG. 73. This process allows for the sterile assembly of the cartridge with the penetrating members 802 using processes and/or temperatures that may degrade the accuracy or functionality of the analyte detecting members on substrate 822. As a nonlimiting example, the entire cartridge 800 may then be placed in a further sealed container such as a pouch, bag, plastic molded container, etc . . . to facilitate contact, improve ruggedness, and/or allow for easier handling.",
        "In some embodiments, more than one seal layer 820 may be used to seal the cavities 806. As examples of some embodiments, multiple layers may be placed over each cavity 806, half or some selected portion of the cavities may be sealed with one layer with the other half or selected portion of the cavities sealed with another sheet or layer, different shaped cavities may use different seal layer, or the like. The seal layer 820 may have different physical properties, such as those covering the penetrating members 802 near the end of the cartridge may have a different color such as red to indicate to the user (if visually inspectable) that the user is down to say 10, 5, or other number of penetrating members before the cartridge should be changed out.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 74 and 75, one embodiment of the microfluidics used with the analyte detecting members 808 in cartridge 800 will now be described. For ease of illustration, the shape of cavity 806 has been simplified into a simple wedge shape. It should be understood that more sophisticated configurations such as that shown in FIG. 73 may be used. FIG. 74 shows a channel 826 that assists in drawing body fluid towards the analyte detecting members 808. In the present embodiment, two analyte detecting members 808 are shown in the cavity 806. This is purely for illustrative purposes as the cavity 806 may have one analyte detecting member or any other number of analyte detecting members as desired. Body fluid entering cavity 806, while filling part of the cavity, will also be drawn by capillary action through the groove 826 towards the analyte detecting members 808. The analyte detecting members 808 may all perform the same analysis, they may each perform different types of analysis, or there may be some combination of the two (some sensors perform same analysis while others perform other analysis).",
        "FIG. 75 shows a perspective view of a cutout of the cavity 806. The penetrating member 802 (shown in phantom) is housed in the cavity 806 and may extend outward through a penetrating member exit opening 830 as indicated by arrow 832. The position of the tip of penetrating member 802 may vary, such as being near the penetrating member exit port or spaced apart from the exit. The location of the tip relative to the analyte detecting member 808 may also be varied, such as being spaced apart or away from the analyte detecting member or collocated or in the immediate vicinity of the analyte detecting member. Fluid may then enter the cavity 806 and directed by channel 826. The channel 826 as shown in FIG. 75 is a groove that is open on top. The channel 826 may be entirely a groove with an open top or it may have a portion that is has a sealed top forming a lumen, or still further, the groove may be closed except for an opening near the penetrating member exit opening 830. It should be understood that capillary action can be achieved using a groove having one surface uncovered. In some embodiments, the analyte detecting member 808 is positioned close to the penetrating member exit opening 830 so that the analyte detecting member 808 may not need a capillary groove or channel to draw body fluid, such as in FIG. 78.",
        "As seen in FIGS. 75 and 76, the cavity 806 may include the substrate 822 coupled to its bottom surface containing the analyte detecting members 808. With the analyte detecting members 808 located on the underside of the cartridge 800 as seen in the embodiment of FIG. 76, the cartridge 800 may include at least one through hole 834 to provide a passage for body fluid to pass from the cavity 806 to the analyte detecting member 808. The size, location, shape, and other features of the through hole 834 may be varied based on the cavity 806 and number of analyte detecting members 808 to be provided. In other embodiments, wicking elements or the like may be used to draw body fluid from the groove 826 to down to the analyte detecting member 808 via the through hole or holes 834.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 77, a variety of groove and analyte detecting member configurations are shown on a single cartridge. These configurations are shown only for illustrative purposes and a single cartridge may not incorporate each of these configurations. Some embodiments may use any of the detecting members, singly or in combination. It should be understood, however, that analyte detecting member configuration could be customized for each cavity, such as but not limited to, using a different number and location of analyte detecting members depending lancing variables associated with that cavity, such as but not limited to, the time of day of the lancing event, the type of analyte to be measured, the test site to be lanced, stratum corneum hydration, or other lancing parameter. As a nonlimiting example, the detecting members may be moved closer towards the outer edge of the disc, more on the side walls, any combination, or the like.",
        "FIG. 77 shows a penetrating member 802 in a cavity 838 with three analyte detecting members 808 in the cavity. For ease of illustration, the penetrating member 802 is omitted from the remaining cavities so that the analyte detecting member configurations can be more easily seen. Cavity 840 has a channel 826 with two analyte detecting members 808. Cavity 842 has a channel 844 coupled to a single analyte detecting member 808. Cavities 846 and 848 have one and two analyte detecting members 808, respectively. The analyte detecting members 808 in those cavities may be located directly at the penetrating member exit from the cartridge or substantially at the penetrating member exit. Other analyte detecting member configurations are also possible, such as but not limited to, placing one or more analyte detecting members on a side wall of the cavity, placing the analyte detecting members in particular arrays (for example, a linear array, triangular array, square array, etc.) on the side wall or bottom surface, using mixed types of analyte detecting members (for example, electrochemical and optical, or some other combination), or mixed positioning of analyte detecting members (for example, at least one analyte detecting member on the substrate below the cartridge and at least one analyte detecting member in the cavity).",
        "FIG. 78 shows an embodiment of cartridge 800 where the analyte detecting member 850 is located near the distal end of cavity 806. The analyte detecting member 850 may be formed, deposited, or otherwise attached there to the cartridge 800. In another embodiment, the analyte detecting member 850 may be a well or indentation having a bottom with sufficient transparency to allow an optical analyte detecting member to detect analytes in fluid deposited in the well or indentation. The well or indentation may also include some analyte reagent that reacts (fluoresces, changes colors, or presents other detectable qualities) when body fluid is placed in the well. In a still further embodiment, analyte detecting member 850 may be replaced with a through hole that allow fluid to pass there through. An analyte detecting member 808 on a substrate 822 may be attached to the underside of the cartridge 800, accessing fluid passing from the cavity 806 down to the analyte detecting member 808.",
        "As mentioned above, the analyte detecting members 808 may also be placed right at the immediate vicinity or slightly setback from the module opening receiving blood so that low blood volumes will still reach the analyte detecting member. The analyte detecting members 808 may be used with low volumes such as less than about I microliter of sample, preferably less than about 0.6 microliter, more preferably less than about 0.3 microliter, and most preferably less than about 0.1 .microliter of sample. Analyte detecting members 808 may also be directly printed or formed on the bottom of the penetrating member cartridge 800. In one embodiment, a multiplicity of miniaturized analyte detecting member fields may be placed on the floor of the radial cavity or on the microfluidic module to allow many tests on a single analyte form a single drop of blood to improve accuracy and precision of measurement. Although not limited in this manner, additional analyte detecting member fields or regions may also be included for calibration or other purposes.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 79-84, further embodiments of the cartridge 800 will now be described. FIG. 79 shows a cartridge 860 having a half-circular shape. FIG. 80 shows a cartridge 862 in the shape of a partial curve. FIG. 80 also shows that the cartridges 862 may be stacked in various configurations such as vertically, horizontally, or in other orientations. FIG. 81 shows a cartridge 864 having a substantially straight, linear configuration. FIG. 82 shows a plurality of cartridges 864 arranged to extend radially outward from a center 866. Each cartridge may be on a slide (not shown for simplicity) that allows the cartridge 864 to slide radially outward to be aligned with a penetrating member launcher. After use, the cartridge 864 is slide back towards the center 866 and the entire assembly is rotated as indicated by arrow 868 to bring a new cartridge 864 into position for use with a penetrating member driver. FIG. 83 shows a still further embodiment where a plurality of cartridges 800 may be stacked for use with a penetrating member driver (see FIG. 85). The driver may be moved to align itself with each cartridge 800 or the cartridges may be moved to alight themselves with the driver. FIG. 84 shows a still further embodiment where a plurality of cartridge 864 are coupled together with a flexible support to define an array. A roller 870 may be used to move the cartridges 864 into position to be actuated by the penetrating member driver 872.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 85, one embodiment of an apparatus 880 using a radial cartridge 800 with a penetrating member driver 882 is shown. A contoured surface 884 is located near a penetrating member exit port 886, allowing for a patient to place their finger in position for lancing. Although not shown, the apparatus 880 may include a human readable or other type of visual display to relay status to the user. The display may also show measured analyte levels or other measurement or feedback to the user without the need to plug apparatus 880 or a separate test strip into a separate analyte reader device. The apparatus 880 may include a processor or other logic for actuating the penetrating member or for measuring the analyte levels. The cartridge 800 may be loaded into the apparatus 880 by opening a top housing of the apparatus which may be hinged or removably coupled to a bottom housing. The cartridge 800 may also drawn into the apparatus 880 using a loading mechanism similar in spirit to that found on a compact disc player or the like. In such an embodiment, the apparatus may have a slot (similar to a CD player in an automobile) that allows for the insertion of the cartridge 800 into the apparatus 880 which is then automatically loaded into position or otherwise seated in the apparatus for operation therein. The loading mechanism may be mechanically powered or electrically powered. In some embodiments, the loading mechanism may use a loading tray in addition to the slot. The slot may be placed higher on the housing so that the cartridge 800 will have enough clearance to be loaded into the device and then dropped down over the penetrating member driver 882. The cartridge 800 may have an indicator mark or indexing device that allows the cartridge to be properly aligned by the loading mechanism or an aligning mechanism once the cartridge 800 is placed into the apparatus 880. The cartridge 800 may rest on a radial platform that rotates about the penetrating member driver 882, thus providing a method for advancing the cartridge to bring unused penetrating members to engagement with the penetrating member driver. The cartridge 800 on its underside or other surface, may shaped or contoured such as with notches, grooves, tractor holes, optical markers, or the like to facilitate handling and/or indexing of the cartridge. These shapes or surfaces may also be varied so as to indicate that the cartridge is almost out of unused penetrating members, that there are only five penetrating members left, or some other cartridge status indicator as desired.",
        "A suitable method and apparatus for loading penetrating members has been described previously in commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent applications and are included here by reference for all purposes. Suitable devices for engaging the penetrating members and for removing protective materials associated with the penetrating member cavity are described in commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 60/422,988 and 60/424,429, and are included here by reference for all purposes. For example in the embodiment of FIG. 78, the foil or seal layer 820 may cover the cavity by extending across the cavity along a top surface 890 and down along the angled surface 892 to provide a sealed, sterile environment for the penetrating member and analyte detecting members therein. A piercing element described in U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 60/424,429 has a piercing element and then a shaped portion behind the element which pushes the foil to the sides of the cavity or other position so that the penetrating member 802 may be actuated and body fluid may flow into the cavity.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 86, a still further embodiment of a lancing system according to the present invention will be described. A radial cartridge 500 may be incorporated for use with a penetrating member driver 882. A penetrating member may be driven outward as indicated by arrow 894. A plurality of analyte detecting members are presented on a roll 895 that is laid out near a penetrating member exit. The roll 895 may be advanced as indicated by arrow 896 so that used analyte detecting members are moved away from the active site. The roll 895 may also be replaced by a disc holding a plurality of analyte detecting members, wherein the analyte detecting member disc (not shown) is oriented in a plane substantially orthogonal to the plane of cartridge 500. The analyte detecting member disc may also be at other angles not parallel to the plane of cartridge 500 so as to be able to rotate and present new, unused analyte detecting member in sequence with new unused penetrating members of cartridge 500.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 87A, the cartridge 500 provides a high density packaging system for a lancing system. This form factor allows a patient to load a large number penetrating members through a single cartridge while maintaining a substantially handheld device. Of course such a cartridge 500 may also be used in non-handheld devices. The present cartridge 500 provide a high test density per volume of the disposable. For embodiments of a cartridge that includes analyte detecting members in addition to penetrating members such as cartridge 800, the density may also be measured in terms of density of analyte detecting members and penetrating members in a disposable. In other embodiments, the density may also be expressed in terms of analyte detecting members per disposable. For example, by taking the physical volume of one embodiment or the total envelope, this number can be divided by the number of penetrating members or number of tests. This result is the volume per penetrating member or per test in a cassetted fashion. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the total volume of the cartridge 500 is determined to be 4.53 cubic centimeters. In this one embodiment, the cartridge 500 holds 50 penetrating members. Dividing the volume by 50, the volume per test is arrived at 0.090 cubic centimeters. Conventional test devices such as drum is in the range of 0.720 or 0.670 cubic centimeters and that is simply the volume to hold a plurality of test strips. This does not include penetrating members as does the present embodiment 800. Thus, the present embodiment is at a substantially higher density. Even a slightly lower density device having penetrating members and analyte detecting members in the 0.500 cubic centimeter range would be a vast improvement over known devices since the numbers listed above for known devices does not include penetrating members, only packaging per test strip.",
        "Each penetrating member (or penetrating member and analyte detecting member, as the case may be ) may have a packing density, or occupied volume, in cartridge 500. In various embodiments, the packing density or occupied volume of each penetrating member in cartridge 500 may be no more than about 0.66 cm3, 0.05 cm3, 0.4 cm3, 0.3 cm3, 0.2 cm3, 0.1 cm3, 0.075 cm3, 0.05 cm3, 0.025 cm3, 0.01 cm3, 0.090 cm3, 0.080 cm3, and the like. These numbers applicable to volumes for penetrating members alone, or for combined penetrating members and analyte detecting members. In other words, the volume required for each penetrating member does not exceed 0.66 cm3/penetrating member, 0.05 cm3/penetrating member, 0.4 cm3/penetrating member, 0.3 cm3/penetrating member, 0.2 cm3/penetrating member, 0.1 cm3/penetrating member, 0.075 cm3/penetrating member, 0.05 cm3/penetrating member, 0.025 cm3/penetrating member, 0.01 cm3/penetrating member, 0.090 cm3/penetrating member and the like. So, if the total package volume of the cartridge is defined as X and the cartridge includes Y number of penetrating members, penetrating members and test area, or other unit 395, the volume for each unit does not exceed 0.66 cm3, 0.05 cm3, 0.4 cm3, 0.3 cm3, 0.2 cm3, 0.1 cm3, 0.075 cm3, 0.05 cm3, 0.025 cm3, 0.01 cm3, 0.090 cm3, 0.080 cm3, and the like.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 87B, a still further embodiment of a cartridge according to the present invention will now be described. FIG. 87B shows a cross-section of a conical shaped cartridge with the penetrating member being oriented in one embodiment to move radially outward as indicated by arrow 897. In another embodiment, the penetrating member may be oriented to move radially inward as indicated by arrow 895. The gripper may be positioned to engage the penetrating member from an inner surface or an outer surface of the cartridge.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 88, nanowires may also be used to create low volume analyte detecting members used with the cartridge 800. Further details of a nanowire device is described in commonly assigned, copending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/433,286 filed Dec. 13, 2002, fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. These nanowire analyte detecting members 898 may be incorporated into the cavity 806 housing the penetrating member 802. They may be placed on the floor or bottom surface of the cavity 806, on the wall, on the top surface, or any combinations of some or all of these possibilities. The analyte detecting members 898 may be designed to have different sensitivity ranges so as to enhance the overall sensitivity of an array of such analyte detecting members. Methods to achieve this may include, but are not limited to, using nanowires of varying sizes, varying the number of nanowires, or varying the amount of glucose oxidase or other glucose detection material on the nanowires. These nanowire analyte detecting members may be designed to use low volumes of body fluid for each sample, due to their size. In some embodiments, each of the analyte detecting members are accurate using volumes of body fluid sample less than about 500 nanoliters. In some embodiments, each of the analyte detecting members are accurate using volumes of body fluid sample less than about 300 nanoliters. In still other embodiments, each analyte detecting member is accurate with less than about 50 nanoliters, less than about 30 nanoliters, less than about 10 nanoliters, less than about 5 nanoliters, and less than about 1 nanoliters of body fluid sample. In some embodiments, the combined array of analyte detecting members uses less than 300 nanoliters of body fluid to arrive at an analyte measurement.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 89, a still further embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 89 shows one embodiment of an optical illumination system 910 for use with optical analyte detecting members (FIG. 91) that may be in contact with a body fluid sample. The overall system may include a plurality of analyte detecting members which provide some optical indicator, a light source 912 for providing light to shine on the analyte detecting members, at least one light detector 914, and a processor (not shown). The analyte detecting member or analyte detecting members are exposed to a sample of the fluid of unknown composition. A plurality of analyte detecting members may be arranged into an array of analyte detecting members exposed to one fluid sample, each group targeting a specific analyte and may contain an analyte-specific chemical that interacts more specifically with one analyte than with some other analytes to be analyzed. Each analyte detecting member may also have different sensitivity ranges so as to maximize overall sensitivity of an array of such analyte detecting members. The light source 912 shines light on at least one analyte detecting member to cause light interaction. The differences in the analyte detecting members may lead to differences in the light interaction. The light detector detects the light interaction by the analyte detecting members. The processor analyzes the light interaction by the analyte detecting members to take into account interference in light interaction among the analytes, thereby determining the concentration of the desired analyte in the fluid.",
        "Referring still to the embodiment of FIG. 89, the light source 912 may be but is not limited to an LED. An alternative LED 915 may also be used with the present invention. Light, illumination, or excitation energy from LED 912 travels along a path through a pinhole 916, a filter 917, and a lens 918. The light then comes into contact with a beamsplitter 919 such as a dichroic mirror or other device useful for beamsplitting. The light is then directed towards lens 920 as indicated by arrow 921. The lens 920 focuses light onto the analyte detecting member (FIG. 91). This excitation energy may cause a detectable optical indicator from the analyte detecting member. By way of example and not limitation, fluorescence energy may be reflected bay up the lens 920. This energy passes through the beamsplitter 919 and to lens 922 which is then received by detector 914 as indicated by arrow 923. The detector 914 measures the energy and this information is passed on to the processor (not shown) to determine analyte levels. The illumination system 910 may also include cells 924 on the disc surface. In this specific embodiment, a penetrating member 925 drive by a force generator 926 such as but not limited to a solenoid may be used to obtain the fluid sample. A detent 927 may also be included with the device along with other bare lancets or penetrating members 928.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 90, another embodiment of the illumination system 910 is shown for use with a cartridge 929. Cartridge 929 is similar to cartridge 800. Cartridge 929 is a single cartridge having a plurality of penetrating members and a plurality of optical analyte detecting members (not shown). The cartridge 929 further includes a plurality of optically transparent portions 930 which may be but is not limited to windows or the like for the light from LED 912 to shine into a cavity of the cartridge 929. In one embodiment, each cavity of the cartridge 929 may include at least one transparent portion 930. This allows the light to generate energy that may be read by analyte detecting member 914. The cartridge 929 may be used a driver 882 to actuate penetrating members and the cartridge 929 may rotate as indicated by arrow 931.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 91, a cross-section of a similar embodiment of the illumination system is shown. This system 932 has source 912 with a lens 933 having an excitation filter 934. This excitation filter 934, in one embodiment, only allows excitation energy to pass. This filter 934 allows the excitation energy to pass to dichroic mirror 935, but does not let it return to source 912. Excitation energy is reflected down as indicated by arrow 936. Lens 937 focuses the energy to optical analyte detecting member 938. Fluorescence energy 939 passes through the dichroic mirror 935 and towards a fluorescent filter 940. In one embodiment, the fluorescent filter 940 only allows fluorescent energy to pass through to lens 941. Thus, the detector 914 only receives fluorescent energy from the analyte detecting member 938. It should be understood of course, that the filter may be changed to allow the type of energy being generated by analyte detecting member 938 to pass. In some embodiments, no filter may be used. The dichroic mirror 935 may be a Bk7 substrate, 63\u00d740\u00d78 mm. The filters may also be a Bk7 substrate about 40 mm in diameter and about 6 mm thick. The lens 933, 937, and 941 may be achormat:bfl=53.6, working aperture 38 mm.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 92, a still further embodiment of an illumination system 942 will be described. This system does not use a beamsplitter or dichroic mirror. Instead, both the source or LED 912 and detector 914 have direct line of sight to the optical analyte detecting member 938. In this embodiment, multiple elements are combined into a single housing. For example, lens 943, lens 944, and filter 945 are combined while lens 946, lens 947, and filter 948 are also combined.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 93, a cross-section of a system similar to that of FIG. 89 is shown in a housing 950. LED 912 sends light to mirror 919 to a light path 951 to cells 924 on a surface of the disc. A finger access 952 allows a sample to be obtained and flow along a fluid pathway 953 to be analyzed. A processor 954 may be coupled to detector 914 to analyze the results.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 94, a cross-section of a system similar to that of FIG. 90 will be further described. This shows a cartridge 929 used with a driver 882. This allows for a radial design where the penetrating members extend radially outward as indicated by arrow 955. The driver 882 may have a coupler portion that reciprocates as indicated by arrow 956. FIGS. 95 and 96 provide further views of a system similar to that of FIG. 89. The embodiment of FIGS. 95 and 96 may include additional lenses or filters as may be useful to refine energy detection.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 97, the area of interest is the velocity profile 1000 while the lancet is cutting through the skin layers in the finger until it reaches a predetermined depth. More specifically, variation of lancet velocity through different phases of the inbound trajectory is shown in FIG. 97. In this embodiment, Phase I corresponds to the stratum corneum, phase II to the epidermis and phase III to the dermis. At each phase (and during the phase), the options are to maintain current velocity, increase current velocity or decrease current velocity. Based on the thickness of the stratum corneum, velocity could be monitored and changed in this embodiment at 9 points in the stratum corneum, 6 points in the epidermis, and 29 points in the dermis using the four edge detection algorithm and the 360 strips per inch encoder strip. It should be noted that although the embodiment of the driver discussed herein produces the previously discussed number of monitoring points for a given displacement, other driver and position sensor embodiments may be used that would give higher or lower resolution.",
        "For the purposes of the present discussion for this nonlimiting example, the skin is viewed as having three distinct regions or tissue layers: the stratum corneum SC (Phase I), the epidermis E (Phase II) and the dermis D (Phase III). In one embodiment, the lancet or penetrating member 10 is accelerated to a first desired velocity. This velocity may be predetermined or it may be calculated by the processor during actuation. The processor is also used to control the lancet velocity in tissue. At this velocity, the lancet 10 will impact the skin and initiate cutting through the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum is hard, hence in this embodiment, maximum velocity of the penetrating member 10 may be employed to efficiently cut through this layer, and this velocity may be maintained constant until the lancet passes through the layer. Power will likely need to be applied to the lancet drive 12 while the lancet is cutting through the stratum corneum in order to maintain the first velocity. Average stratum corneum thickness is about 225 \u03bcm. Using a four-edge detection algorithm for the position sensor 14 of this embodiment, the opportunity to verify and feed back velocity information can be carried out at 225/17 or roughly 13 points. In another embodiment accelerating through the stratum corneum following impact may improve cutting efficiency. Acceleration may be possible if the lancet has not reached its target or desired velocity before impact. FIG. 4 shows the result of increasing ((a) arrows, maintaining ((b) arrows) or reducing ((c) arrows) velocity on the lancet trajectory for each of the tissue layers.",
        "On reaching the epidermis E (Phase II), an embodiment of a method may decrease the velocity ((c) arrows) from the first velocity so that tissue compression is reduced in this second tissue layer. Thus the lancet 10, in this nonlimiting example, may have a second desired velocity that is less than the first velocity. The reduced speed in the second tissue layer may reduce the pain experienced by the mechano receptor nerve cells in the dermal layer (third tissue layer). In the absence of tissue compression effects on the dermal layer, however, lancet velocity may be kept constant for efficient cutting (i.e. second velocity may be maintained the same as the first velocity). In another embodiment, velocity may be increased in the second tissue layer from the first velocity.",
        "In Phase III, the lancet or penetrating member 10 may reach the blood vessels and cut them to yield blood. The innervation of this third tissue layer and hence pain perception during lancing could be easily affected by the velocity profile chosen. In one embodiment, a third desired velocity may be chosen. The velocity may be chosen to minimize nerve stimulation while maintaining cutting efficiency. One embodiment would involve reducing velocity from the second velocity to minimize pain, and may increase it just before the blood vessels to be cut. The number of velocity measurement steps possible for the position sensor described above in the dermis is approximately 58. The user would determine the best velocity/cutting profile by usage. The profile with the least amount of pain on lancing, yielding a successful blood sample would be programmable into the device.",
        "Currently users optimize depth settings on mechanical launchers by testing various settings and through usage, settle on a desired setting based on lancing comfort. Embodiments of the device and methods discussed herein provide a variety of velocity profiles (FIG. 97), which can be optimized by the user for controlled lancing, and may include: controlling the culling speed of a lancet with the lancet within the skin; adjusting the velocity profile of the lancet while the lancet is in the skin based upon the composition of the skin layers; lancing according to precise regional velocity profiles based on variation in cell type from the surface of the skin down through the epidermis and dennis; lancing at a desired velocity through any tissue layer and varying the velocity for each layer. This may include maximum velocity through the stratum corneum, mediation of velocity through epidermis to minimize shock waves to pain sensors in dermis, and mediation of velocity through dermis for efficient cutting of blood vessels without stimulating pain receptors. Additional details may be found in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/420,535 filed Apr. 21, 2003, included herein by reference.",
        "If the distance of the penetrating member tip from the target tissue is known, acceleration and displacement of the lancet is known and the start position of the penetrating member is know, the time and position of tissue contact and depth of penetration can be determined by the processor.",
        "The position sensor can accurately measure the distance from the initialization point to the point of contact, where the resistance to advancement of the penetrating member stops the penetrating member movement. The penetrating member is then retracted to the initialization point having measured the distance to the target tissue without creating any discomfort to the user.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 98, another embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Some embodiments of the present invention may provide an accurate method to locate the point on the body where the sample will be taken. As a nonlimiting example, a beam of light may be used. Additionally, the beam may be used to indicate readiness to sample. In a still further embodiment, the reflected light beam may be used to arm the device for use or to actually activate the device.",
        "As seen in the embodiment of FIG. 98, a light source 1000 may be used to project a light beam on to the surface of the skin or tissue. A variety of light sources may be used. The light source include but are not limited to an incandescent, light emitting diode, fluorescent, electroluminescent or other type of light sources. The light source 1000, in most embodiments, emits radiation in the spectrum visible to the human eye. The light source 1000 may also emit radiation at other wavelengths such as but not limited to ultraviolet, infrared, or the like and would be detected by a separate detector device. One example may be similar to the device of FIG. 99. Although the embodiment of FIG. 98 uses a plurality of light sources 1000, it should be understood that some embodiments may only use a single light source 1000.",
        "In the embodiment of FIG. 98, an element may be provided to guide the light to the target area of the body. This may be accomplished by using a light source with a built in collimating means such as a lens. Another way to guide the light is to allow it to escape through one or more apertures 1002 in the device. An end cap or front end 103 may be provided to facilitate finger positioning. A still further way is to use a form of fiber optics or light pipe technology that makes a beam of light on the body. The light pipe technology may have lenses (such as, but not limited to, conventional or Fresnel) built into them. As seen in FIG. 98, the lancet or penetrating member 1004 exits through an opening 1006. The device may include a coupler 1008 attaching a driver to the penetrating member 1004. Wires or leads 110 may be used to deliver power to drive the light source 1000. It should be understood that the number of light beams may vary. The light beams may be one, two, or more individual beams or a continuous ring or other shape of light (such as but limited to a circle, a dot, an X, an icon, an logo, etc . . . ) to mark the point of impact. The light source 1000 may also project different color of light. As a nonlimiting example, a first color of light may be used for targeting, and a second color of light when the device is aimed correct or at a desired target. For example, a red light may be used initially and a green light when the device is accurately targeted. Two different light sources 1000 may be used to provide the different colors of light.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 99, an additional feature could allow a photo diode or similar sensor 1020 to detect the reflected light from the source 1000, which may be used for a variety of purposes such as arming the device for actuation, determining skin characteristics, or using the reflected signal to initiate the lancing operation. In the embodiment of FIG. 99, fiber optics 1022 may be used to carry light from the source 1000 for projection. In one embodiment, the light beam may be modulated at a fairly high frequency that may enhance the detection process, by detecting an AC coupled detector signal. The reflection of the location light beam may be used to detect proximity of the anatomical feature. Modulation provides one method to reject ambient light levels that would falsely indicate proximity of the anatomical feature. The light is projected to a point of sampling S, where the lancet or penetrating if actuated, will create a wound.",
        "There are additional uses for the light source 1000\u2014the light may be used with an electronic actuator to indicate that the device is ready to lance. In addition to the beam illuminating the site of lancing, the light could be visible within the body of the device as an easy to see ready to use signal. In this case a switch would turn on and off the light source to indicate the status of the device. In another embodiment, a visual indicator 1040 on the device may light up or change color when the device is properly aimed. An indicator, change of image, flashing of black and white on an LCD display screen on the device may also be used to indicate proper aim. In some situations, when the device is aimed over a ridge on the finger (i.e. ridge associated with lines on a finger that creates fingerprints), the light may indicate one color and a second color when the device aimed over a valley or trough between ridges. In some embodiments, a second light beam or second image is projected when the device is aimed as desired. The beam of light may be controlled to indicate readiness for service to the operator. Additionally, the beam may be made visible by a secondary light conduction path (other than the light beam).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 100, in this embodiment, it is shown the light source 1000 does not need to be located in front of the cartridge 500. It should be understood that the light source 100 may have an overlapping configuration where the source may be above, below, or to the side of the cartridge. The light source 1000 may be used with a device that only contains one penetrating member 1004 or a device that contains multiple penetrating members. In some embodiments which use a light source 912 for analyte detection or measurement, the light source 912 may also be used to provide a light for aiming purposes via an optical train 1042 such as but not limited to optical fiber, mirrors, or lens. For ease of illustration, the other optical components used for light source 912 to perform its analyte measurement functions are not shown in FIG. 100.",
        "Referring now to the embodiments in FIGS. 100 and 101, a portion 1050 of the housing 1052 may be transparent to facilitate viewing of the finger as it is positioned to be lanced. The embodiment in FIG. 101 provides a substantially larger area to be clear while the embodiment in FIG. 102 provides a clear area in a round, circular, square, rectangular, polygonal, other shaped window near the lancing location. It should be understood that any of the light beam embodiments, clear housing embodiments, and other features used for aiming may be combined with any of the embodiments disclosed herein or with embodiments in references enclosed herein by reference.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 103, a still further embodiment of the present invention will now be described. FIG. 103 is an exploded view showing a cartridge 1100, a layer 1102 with a plurality of analyte detecting member 1104, and a sterility barrier 1106. The analyte detecting members 1104 on layer 1102 may have leads or connectors 1108 that extend along the layer 1102. In some embodiments, these leads 1108 extend all the way to the inner circumference of the layer 1102. In other embodiments, the leads 1108 may not extend all the way to the inner circumference. As indicated by arrows 1110 and 1112, the layer 1102 and sterility barrier 1106 may be coupled to the cartridge 1100 to form a device for use with a lancing apparatus 880. In most embodiments, penetrating members (not shown) are contained in the cartridge 1100 prior to coupling the sterility barrier 1106 to the cartridge 1100.",
        "Referring now to the embodiment of FIG. 104, a cartridge 1114 is shown wherein cavities 1116 are of extended length and have a penetrating member grip or park area 1118. This area 1118 holds the penetrating member (not shown) in place prior to actuation. It may also be used to hold the penetrating member in place after actuation. The cartridge 1114 may also have notches 1120 formed along the inner circumference of the cartridge. These notches 1120 may be used for positioning purposes, for purposes of rotating the cartridge, or any combination of the two or other reasons. For non-circular configurations, the notches 1120 are formed along the walls of an opening through the noncircular cartridge.",
        "FIG. 105 is an enlarged view of a portion of the cartridge 1114. Along the outer periphery of the cartridge 1114, a chamber 1122 is formed. In one embodiment, blood or other body fluid from a wound created by the lancing will gather in the chamber 1122. A channel 1124 may be present to draw fluid towards an opening 1126. In one embodiment, an analyte detecting member (not shown) may occupy the opening 1126. In some embodiments, the analyte detecting member forms the bottom wall of the opening 1126, instead of occupying the opening 1126. In some embodiments, there are no fluid bearing structures on the underside of the cartridge 1114.",
        "Referring now to the embodiments of FIGS. 106 and 107, configurations for the underside of the cartridge 1114 are shown. In this embodiment, opening 1126 leads to a fluid channel 1128 on the underside of the cartridge 1114. The channel 1128 may be selected of a length sufficient to contain a volume of blood sufficient to substantially fill the expanded fluid area 1130. As a nonlimiting example, the channel 1128 may be configured to hold at least about 1.5 \u03bcl, 1.4 \u03bcl, 1.3 \u03bcl, 1.2 \u03bcl, 1.1 \u03bcl, 1.0 \u03bcl, 0.9 \u03bcl, 0.8 \u03bcl, 0.7 \u03bcl, 0.6 \u03bcl, 0.5 \u03bcl, 0.4 \u03bcl, 0.3 \u03bcl, 0.2 \u03bcl, 0.1 \u03bcl, 0.05 \u03bcl, or 0.01 \u03bcl. As another nonlimiting example, the channel 1128 may also be viewed as holding no more than about 1.5 \u03bcl, 1.4 \u03bcl, 1.3 \u03bcl, 1.2 \u03bcl, 1.1 \u03bcl, 1.0 \u03bcl, 0.9 \u03bcl, 0.8 \u03bcl, 0.7 \u03bcl, 0.6 \u03bcl, 0.5 \u03bcl, 0.4 \u03bcl, 0.3 \u03bcl, 0.2 \u03bcl, 0.1 \u03bcl, 0.05 \u03bcl, or 0.01 \u03bcl, prior to the fluid entering the area 1130. In a still further embodiment, the amount of fluid flowing from the channel 1128 into the area 1130 will not exceed about 1.5 \u03bcl, 1.4 \u03bcl, 1.3 \u03bcl, 1.2 \u03bcl, 1.1 \u03bcl, 1.0 \u03bcl, 0.9 \u03bcl, 0.8 \u03bcl, 0.7 \u03bcl, 0.6 \u03bcl, 0.5 \u03bcl, 0.4 \u03bcl, 0.3 \u03bcl, 0.2 \u03bcl, 0.1 \u03bcl, 0.05 \u03bcl, or 0.01 \u03bcl, depending on the amount desired by the various detecting members. The analyte detecting member (not shown), in one embodiment, will occupy or will correspond in location to the area 1130. When fluid fills the fluid channel 1128 and enters the area 1130, the sudden expansion of width will cause fluid to rush into the area 1130, preferably in a volume sufficient to substantially fill the area or at least in sufficient volume for an analyte detecting member to make a reading. The area 1130 may hold about 1.5 \u03bcl, 1.4 \u03bcl, 1.3 \u03bcl, 1.2 \u03bcl, 1.1 \u03bcl, 1.0 \u03bcl, 0.9 \u03bcl, 0.8 \u03bcl, 0.7 \u03bcl, 0.6 \u03bcl, 0.5 \u03bcl, 0.4 \u03bcl, 0.3 \u03bcl, 0.2 \u03bcl, 0.1 \u03bcl, 0.05 \u03bcl, or 0.01 \u03bcl. In some embodiments, the area 1130 is designed to hold a volume slightly less than the amount of that can be held in the channel 1128 prior to the fluid reaching the area 1130. In one nonlimiting example, this may be about 0.01 \u03bcl, 0.05 \u03bcl, or 0.1 \u03bcl less. A vent 1132 may be fluidly coupled to the expanded fluid area 1130 to handle any overflow of fluid. The vent 1132 reconnects to the cavity 1116 on the other side of the cartridge.",
        "FIGS. 108 and 109 show a still further embodiment according to the present invention. FIG. 108 shows an embodiment where the opening 1134 is moved even closer to the outer periphery of the chamber 1122. Again, in some embodiments, the cartridge 1114 may not have any fluid bearing channels or structures. An analyte detecting member may occupy the opening 1134, form the underside of the opening 1134, or some combination of the two. FIG. 108 also shows a groove 1136 for gathering excess material from a sterility barrier 1106. FIG. 109 shows an embodiment where the opening 1134 opens directly into expanded area 1138. There is no channel to bring the fluid to the expanded area 1138. In this embodiment, three analyte detecting members 1140, 1142, and 1144 may be associated with each area 1138. In any of the embodiments of the present invention, it should be understood that a single or a plurality of analyte detecting members may be associated with each area, such as area 1138.

The chamber 1150 is positioned to receive body fluid from a wound created by the lancing event. The rib 1146 may be formed from a variety of materials such as, but not limited to, a cyclic olefin or other plastic well known in the art. In some embodiments, it can be made hydrophilic by surface treatments or the surrounding area can be made hydrophobic. In one embodiment, the rib 1146 may be made very thin, on the order of about 100 microns. The rib 1146 may also have other thicknesses such as less than about 200 microns or less than about 300 microns. It should be understood that in one embodiment, the rib 1146 may be integrally formed with the cartridge or it may be attached or coupled to the cartridge after the cartridge is formed. An analyte detecting member may occupy the opening 1148, forms the underside of the opening 1148, or some combination of the two. The analyte detecting member may formed, configured, or shaped to receive fluid being spread off of the rib 1146. In some embodiments, there are no fluid bearing structures on the underside of the cartridge.",
        "FIG. 111 shows the underside of one embodiment of a cartridge 1152. For ease of illustration, the rib 1146 is made to appear thicker than it may actually be.

In some embodiments, the analyte sensor forms the bottom surface of the chamber 1150 and can be viewed as being one \u201cwall\u201d of that chamber. The analyte detecting member may be visible though the opening 1148 when the cartridge 1152 is assembled (and the sterility barrier is punctured). A vent channel 1156 may be configured, in some embodiments, to draw excess fluid towards the vent 1158 via an opening 1160. In other embodiments, the vent channel 1156 is not present and excess blood or fluid simply fills the chamber 1150 or flows towards the narrowing 1162 (as seen in FIG. 10).",

        "While the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations, changes, modifications, substitutions, deletions, or additions of procedures and protocols may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, with any of the above embodiments, the location of the penetrating member drive device may be varied, relative to the penetrating members or the cartridge. With any of the above embodiments, the penetrating member tips may be uncovered during actuation (i.e. penetrating members do not pierce the penetrating member enclosure or protective foil during launch). With any of the above embodiments, the penetrating members may be a bare penetrating member during launch. With any of the above embodiments, the penetrating members may be bare penetrating members prior to launch as this may allow for significantly tighter densities of penetrating members. In some embodiments, the penetrating members may be bent, curved, textured, shaped, or otherwise treated at a proximal end or area to facilitate handling by an actuator. The penetrating member may be configured to have a notch or groove to facilitate coupling to a gripper. The notch or groove may be formed along an elongate portion of the penetrating member. With any of the above embodiments, the cavity may be on the bottom or the top of the cartridge, with the gripper on the other side. In some embodiments, analyte detecting members may be printed on the top, bottom, or side of the cavities. The front end of the cartridge maybe in contact with a user during lancing. The same driver may be used for advancing and retraction of the penetrating member. The penetrating member may have a diameters and length suitable for obtaining the blood volumes described herein. The penetrating member driver may also be in substantially the same plane as the cartridge. The driver may use a through hole or other opening to engage a proximal end of a penetrating member to actuate the penetrating member along a path into and out of the tissue.",
        "Any of the features described in this application or any reference disclosed herein may be adapted for use with any embodiment of the present invention.

No. 10/127,395 filed Apr. 19, 2002. An analyte detecting member to detect the presence of foil may also be included in the lancing apparatus. For example, if a cavity has been used before, the foil or sterility barrier will be punched. The analyte detecting member can detect if the cavity is fresh or not based on the status of the barrier. It should be understood that in optional embodiments, the sterility barrier may be designed to pierce a sterility barrier of thickness that does not dull a tip of the penetrating member. The lancing apparatus may also use improved drive mechanisms. For example, a solenoid force generator may be improved to try to increase the amount of force the solenoid can generate for a given current. A solenoid for use with the present invention may have five coils and in the present embodiment the slug is roughly the size of two coils. One change is to increase the thickness of the outer metal shell or windings surround the coils. By increasing the thickness, the flux will also be increased. The slug may be split; two smaller slugs may also be used and offset by \u00bd of a coil pitch. This allows more slugs to be approaching a coil where it could be accelerated. This creates more events where a slug is approaching a coil, creating a more efficient system.",
        "In another optional alternative embodiment, a gripper in the inner end of the protective cavity may hold the penetrating member during shipment and after use, eliminating the feature of using the foil, protective end, or other part to retain the used penetrating member. Some other advantages of the disclosed embodiments and features of additional embodiments include: same mechanism for transferring the used penetrating members to a storage area; a high number of penetrating members such as 25, 50, 75, 100, 500, or more penetrating members may be put on a disk or cartridge; molded body about a lancet becomes unnecessary; manufacturing of multiple penetrating member devices is simplified through the use of cartridges; handling is possible of bare rods metal wires, without any additional structural features, to actuate them into tissue; maintaining extreme (better than 50 micron\u2014lateral\u2014and better than 20 micron vertical) precision in guiding; and storage system for new and used penetrating members, with individual cavities/slots is provided. The housing of the lancing device may also be sized to be ergonomically pleasing. In one embodiment, the device has a width of about 56 mm, a length of about 105 mm and a thickness of about 15 mm. Additionally, some embodiments of the present invention may be used with non-electrical force generators or drive mechanism. For example, the punch device and methods for releasing the penetrating members from sterile enclosures could be adapted for use with spring based launchers. The gripper using a frictional coupling may also be adapted for use with other drive technologies.",
        "Still further optional features may be included with the present invention. For example, with any of the above embodiments, the location of the penetrating member drive device may be varied, relative to the penetrating members or the cartridge. With any of the above embodiments, the penetrating member tips may be uncovered during actuation (i.e. penetrating members do not pierce the penetrating member enclosure or protective foil during launch). The penetrating members may be a bare penetrating member during launch. The same driver may be used for advancing and retraction of the penetrating member. Different analyte detecting members detecting different ranges of glucose concentration, different analytes, or the like may be combined for use with each penetrating member. Non-potentiometric measurement techniques may also be used for analyte detection. For example, direct electron transfer of glucose oxidase molecules adsorbed onto carbon nanotube powder microelectrode may be used to measure glucose levels. In some embodiments, the analyte detecting members may formed to flush with the cartridge so that a \u201cwell\u201d is not formed. In some other embodiments, the analyte detecting members may formed to be substantially flush (within 200 microns or 100 microns) with the cartridge surfaces. In all methods, nanoscopic wire growth can be carried out via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In all of the embodiments of the invention, preferred nanoscopic wires may be nanotubes. Any method useful for depositing a glucose oxidase or other analyte detection material on a nanowire or nanotube may be used with the present invention. Additionally, for some embodiments, any of the cartridge shown above may be configured without any of the penetrating members, so that the cartridge is simply an analyte detecting device. Still further, the indexing of the cartridge may be such that adjacent cavities may not necessarily be used serially or sequentially. As a nonlimiting example, every second cavity may be used sequentially, which means that the cartridge will go through two rotations before every or substantially all of the cavities are used. As another nonlimiting example, a cavity that is 3 cavities away, 4 cavities away, or N cavities away may be the next one used. This may allow for greater separation between cavities containing penetrating members that were just used and a fresh penetrating member to be used next.
