        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a photoelectric conversion device for converting an optical signal into an electric signal, and more particularly, to an image sensor IC which is a photoelectric conversion device to be applied to an image reader such as a facsimile machine or an image scanner, and a contact image sensor having one or more of the image sensor IC.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Up to now, improvements have been made on a photoelectric conversion device in terms of enhancement of sensitivity and a reduction of random noise.",
        "In order to eliminate reset noise by virtue of a circuit, as shown in FIG. 15, there has been an attempt to offset the reset noise by disposing a noise signal holding circuit.",
        "However, according to such the conventional photoelectric conversion device, the noise signal holding circuits must be provided as many as light receiving elements, which increases a chip area. Also, in order to enhance the sensitivity of the light receiving elements, it is necessary to increase the amplification factor of a downstream signal processor circuit. However, thermal noise of the circuits other than the reset circuit is also amplified at the same time. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the high sensitivity/noise ratio. In particular, the signal processor circuit must operate at a high-frequency read frequency, normally at the frequency of 5 MHz or higher. In this case, the noise of a high frequency band is also amplified, making it difficult to attain the high sensitivity/noise ratio.",
        "In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention provides a photoelectric conversion device, including: a plurality of photoelectric conversion circuits whose output potentials change according to an amount of incident light; a plurality of reset circuits each connected to an output of each of the photoelectric conversion circuits; a plurality of amplification circuits for amplifying the output potentials of the photoelectric conversion circuits, the amplification circuits each being connected to the outputs of the respective photoelectric conversion circuits; a plurality of signal read circuits for reading the outputs from the amplification circuits; and a plurality of holding circuits for temporarily holding the read outputs from the amplification circuits, in which the plurality of amplification circuits is noninverting amplification circuits.",
        "Further, each of the noninverting amplification circuits includes: an operational amplifier; a capacitor disposed between an input terminal of the operational amplifier and a fixed potential; a capacitor disposed between the input terminal of the operational amplifier and an output of the operational amplifier; and a switch circuit disposed between the input terminal of the operational amplifier and the output of the operational amplifier, in which the signal read circuits are turned on when the switch circuit is turned off.",
        "Also, in a photoelectric conversion device for sequentially reading output signals from plural photoelectric conversion circuits to a common signal line, the common signal line is reset to a given potential, a predetermined potential is common to the potential of a reference voltage terminal, the photoelectric conversion device incorporates a signal processor circuit having the common signal line inputted thereto, and a reference voltage of the signal processor circuit is electrically connected to a reference voltage terminal.",
        "Also, an image sensor includes the plurality of photoelectric conversion devices, in which the reference voltage terminals are electrically connected to one another.",
        "Also, a photoelectric conversion device for sequentially reading output signals from a plurality of photoelectric conversion circuits to a common signal line, in which the common signal line is reset to a given potential in a posterior half of a period during which signals are read from respective light receiving elements, the photoelectric conversion device incorporates a signal processing circuit having the common signal line inputted thereto, the signal processing circuit includes a clamp circuit, and the clamp circuit is fixed to the given potential in the posterior half of the period during which the signals are read from respective light receiving elements.",
        "According to the photoelectric conversion device, the signal is amplified by plural amplifier circuits which are connected to the outputs of the photoelectric conversion circuits and amplify the output potentials of the photoelectric conversion circuits, while the operating speed of the amplifier circuits remains low. Accordingly, the noise of a high frequency band can be cut out, and the signal can be amplified with low noise. In addition, the amplification factor of the signal processor circuit that requires the high speed operation can be set to be low because the signal is amplified upstream, which makes it possible to reduce the noise of the output signal. From the above fact, it is possible to obtain the photoelectric conversion device with the high sensitivity/noise ratio at low cost, without using the noise signal holding circuit.",

In the operation of the image sensor IC 41 according to the present invention, the initialization of all of the photoelectric conversion blocks An and the photoelectric charge storage operation are conducted simultaneously at certain timings.

Immediately after the initialization switch 2 is turned off, a transfer switch 15 is turned on by a pulse of the position of R1 of \u03a6RIN, and a reference signal after initialization of the photodiode 1 is read to the capacitor 13. The voltage V(REF) is represented as follows when the offset of the operational amplifier 3 is ignored, and the reset voltage is set to Vreset:\n\nV(REF)=VRESET\u2212Voff(R1+R2)/R2\n\nwhere the resistances of the resistors 4 and 5 are R1 and R2, respectively.",

The amplification factor of the noninverting amplifier is normally set to about 2 times to 20 times.",
        "Also, a high period of \u03a6R, \u03a6RIN, and \u03a6SIN that can be set to a relatively long period of time allows the through rate of the noninverting amplifier to be set to be small. For this reason, the components of the high band of noises of the noninverting amplifier do not affect the output. Accordingly, the noises can be reduced.",
        "Subsequently, a succeeding storage operation is repeated after repeating the initialization, prior to the photoelectric charge storage operation at the second timing TS2.",
        "Then, the operation of reading the reference signal and the optical signal will be described. The transfer switches 16 and 17 are turned on by the pulse of \u03a6SCH(n) at the same time during the storage period of TS2 in FIG. 12 to read the optical signal and the reference signal which have been held by the capacitors 12 and 13, to the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR, respectively.",
        "A difference between the optical signal and the reference signal is taken in the signal processor circuit 42 described below, so that voltage difference caused by light can be taken.",
        "Then, during a posterior half of the pulse of \u03a6SCH(n), the common signal line reset switches 9 and 10 are turned on by the pulse of \u03a6SR to initialize the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR to the voltage of Vreset2. As shown in FIG. 2, when Vreset2 is connected to VREF, the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR are initialized to the voltage of VREF. At this time, VREF is stabilized by an external large capacitor 48, which allows the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR to be surely initialized to a constant voltage of VREF.",
        "Subsequently, when the transfer switches 16 and 17 of the subsequent bit are turned on by \u03a6SCH(n+1) after turning off the transfer switches 16 and 17 of the n-th bit by \u03a6SCH(n), the optical signal and the reference signal of the subsequent bit start to be read.",
        "In the following description, for convenience, a first half of the high period of \u03a6SCH(n) during which the optical signal and the reference signal are read to the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR is referred to as anterior half period, and a latter half period of the high period of \u03a6SCH(n) during which the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR are initialized to the voltage of VREF is referred to as posterior half period.",
        "Next, the operation of the signal processor circuit 42 will be described. The VIN1 terminal and the VIN2 terminal are connected with the common signal line BITS and the common signal line BITR, respectively. During the anterior half period, the optical signal and the reference signal are inputted to the subtractor through the buffer amplifiers 22 and 23. During the posterior half period, the voltage of VREF is inputted to the subtractor through the buffer amplifiers 22 and 23. Accordingly, in the anterior half period, the output of the subtractor becomes a level resulting from adding a VREF level to a level obtained by multiplying the difference between the optical signal and the reference signal by the gain times. In the posterior half period, the output of the subtractor becomes a level of VREF. Also, the levels in both of the anterior half period and the posterior half period are effected by the offset of the buffer amplifiers 22, 23, and the subtractor 24.",
        "A clamp pulse \u03a6CLAMP is so added as to be on in the posterior half period and off in the anterior half period. As a result, an output of the clamp circuit 25 is clamped to a VREF level each time in the posterior half period. Accordingly, the output of the clamp circuit 25 in the anterior half period becomes a level resulting from adding the VREF level to a level obtained by subtracting the posterior half output of the bit which is one bit before the anterior half output of the subtractor. As a result, the output of the clamp circuit in the anterior half period becomes a level resulting from adding VREF to the level obtained by multiplying a difference between the optical signal and the reference signal by the gain. These levels are not effected by the offset of the buffer amplifiers 22, 23, and the subtractor 24.",
        "The sample and hold pulse \u03a6SH is so added to turn on in the anterior half period and to turn off in the posterior half period. Accordingly, the output in the anterior half period of the output after clamping is sampled and held in the posterior half period. Therefore, it is possible to maintain the output level for a long period of time.",
        "FIG. 4 is a schematic circuit diagram showing a photoelectric conversion block An according to another embodiment of the present invention. Different from the photoelectric conversion block An shown in FIG. 3, the resistors 4 and 5 are replaced with capacitors 6 and 7, and a switch 8 is inserted between the input and the output of the operational amplifier 3. One terminal of the capacitor 6 is set to a ground (GND), but may be set to another potential if the potential is fixed. Other structures are identical with those in FIG. 3.",
        "In the first embodiment, in order to reduce the current consumption, it is necessary to set the resistances R1 and R2 to be higher. To achieve this, a high resistant polysilicon is required, which increases the costs of the process. However, in the second embodiment, the high resistors are replaced with the capacitors to reduce the costs of the process.",
        "FIG. 13 is a timing chart showing a method of operation of the photoelectric conversion block 43 and the signal processor circuit 42 according to the second embodiment of the present invention.",
        "First, the operation of the n-th bit photoelectric conversion block will be described.",
        "The initialization switch 2 and the switch 8 are turned on by the pulses R1 of \u03a6R and \u03a6SW to structure the operational amplifier 3 as a voltage follower amplifier. Accordingly, the output terminal Vdi of the photodiode 1 is fixed to the reference voltage Vreset, and the output of the operational amplifier 3 also becomes the reference voltage Vreset.",
        "Subsequently, when the initialization switch 2 is turned off, the voltage becomes a value resulting from adding the off noise Voff to the voltage Vreset of Vdi. Then, the switch 8 is turned off.",
        "Immediately after the switch 8 is turned off, the transfer switch 15 is turned on by the pulse of the position of R1 of \u03a6RIN to read the reference signal after the photodiode 1 has been initialized, to the capacitor 13. When the influences of the offset of the operational amplifier 3 and the off noise of the switch 8 are ignored, and the reset voltage is Vreset, the voltage V(REF) is represented as follows:\n\nV(REF)=VRESET\u2212Voff(C1+C2)/C2\n\nwhere the capacitances of the capacitors 6 and 7 are C1 and C2, respectively.",
        "Next, in the photoelectric charge storage operation at the first timing TS1, the photoelectric charges that have been captured by the photodiode 1 are stored. The photoelectric charges are stored in the photodiode 1, and the potential of Vdi changes according to the amount of photoelectric charges. The storage period is from the end of the pulse R1 of \u03a6R to the end of the pulse S1 of \u03a6SIN in a succeeding cycle, which corresponds to a period of the first timing TS1 shown in FIG. 12, and the same periods are set for all of the bits.",

        "The noise of the switch 8 and the noise of the operational amplifier 3 are sampled and held to a terminal between the capacitors 6 and 8 when the switch 8 turns off, thereby causing the noises in the output. However, when the switch 8 turns off, the load capacitor of the VO terminal in FIG. 4 is increased, thereby making it possible to reduce the influence of those noises. Other operations are identical with those in the second embodiment.",
        "In the above-mentioned embodiments, while the photodiode is conducting the storage operation in the TS2 period, it is possible to read the optical signal that has been stored in the previous storage period TS1. Accordingly, the LEDs of three colors of RGB are sequentially lighted to thereby read color image data. For example, it is possible that the red LED is lighted in the TS1 period to read the red component, the green LED is lighted in the TS2 period to read the green component, and the blue LED is lighted in the next TS2 period to read the blue component. In this case, the red optical signal is read within the TS2 period.",
