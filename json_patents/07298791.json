        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates generally to the modulation of signals and more particularly to a system for modulating a digital input signal onto a carrier to produce an analog output wherein the system operates at multiple data rates, employs a direct digital synthesis (DDS) operation to produce the analog output signal and provides filtering to reduce system noise and discontinuities in the modulated signal.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "It is well known to modulate signals of interest upon a carrier signal to produce a modulated signal. Typical applications of such modulation include wired and wireless communication systems. A wireless communication system employs a radio frequency (RF) signal upon which signals of interest are carried. Such signals of interest may include voice signals and digitized data. In such systems the data and/or voice signals are modulated onto the RF carrier at a transmitting location and are wirelessly transmitted to a receiving location. At the receiving location, the modulated RF signal is typically down mixed to an intermediate frequency and then demodulated to reproduce the signal of interest.",
        "Many varied methods of modulation are commonly employed in such systems. Such modulation techniques include frequency modulation (FM), amplitude modulation (AM), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase shift keying (PSK) and frequency shift keying (FSK), along with various other modulation techniques. A particular modification of FSK modulation includes incorporating Gaussian filtering to produce a filtered modulated signal. Gaussian filtering operates to reduce side lobes and other non-carrier frequency components of the modulated signal. Such modulation technique is typically referred to as Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK).",
        "In most communication systems, however, the modulation of signals is not a simple task. Problems with modulation result from various factors, not all of which may be contemplated in the design of the modulation circuitry. In one particular application wherein GFSK modulation is used, modulation causes the carrier signal to have a varying frequency, such variation dependent upon the bit pattern modulated onto the carrier. This frequency variation is controlled by the level of a baseband signal. This signal consists of symbols, each of which occupies the same amount of time and represents one or more bits. In a typical GFSK application, a positive peak may be three volts while a negative peak may be negative three volts. In two GFSK operation, wherein a single data bit is modulated onto each symbol period of the carrier signal, a logic zero is represented by a negative three volt peak while a logic one is represented by a positive three volt peak. In four GSFK modulation, wherein two data bits are modulated onto each symbol period of the carrier signal, additional levels are required to represent bit patterns (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Likewise, in eight GSFK modulation, still further levels are required to represent the still greater number of bit patterns. Thus, the relative frequency of a particular symbol period of the carrier frequency which represents the bit pattern for the particular symbol must be accurately generated.",

        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a particular embodiment of a multiple data rate modulation circuit 200 constructed according to the present invention and previously generally described with reference to FIG. 1. The modulation circuit 200 includes a multi-rate converter 202, a multi-rate filter ROM 204, a multi-rate ROM output scaler 206, a delay circuit 207, an adder 208 and DDS circuitry 210. The multi-rate converter 202 receives digital data 212, a symbol clock 214 and a data rate indicator 216. In the embodiment illustrated, the symbol clock 214 serves to validate the digital data 212 appearing at the multi-rate converter 202, clocking the digital data 212 into the multi-rate converter 202. Based upon the state of the data rate indicator 216, the multi-rate converter 202 converts the digital data 212 present at its input to converted data 218. As will be further described herein, one such method of converting the digital data 212 to the converted data 218 includes converting single bit data received as the digital data 212 to multiple bit converted data 218.",
        "The multi-rate filter ROM 204 receives the converted data 218 and produces filtered data 220 at its output. One fashion in which the multi-rate filter ROM 204 operates is to receive multiple samples of the converted data 218 and, based upon the value of the multiple samples, select filtering functions to produce the filtered data 220. One particular operating situation that may be encountered involves the transition of the converted data 218 from a first data rate to a second data rate. Such transitions often involve a step change in the value of the converted data 218. For example, in two GFSK modulation, a logic zero is represented as a \u22121 volt amplitude and a positive peak is represented as a +1 amplitude, assuming a positive peak of the baseband signal of +1 volts and a negative peak of the modulated signal of \u22121 volts. However, in four GFSK operation, the digital data (0,0) is represented as a \u22121.35 volt amplitude, the digital data (0,1) as a \u22120.45 volt amplitude, the digital data (1,1) as a +0.45 volt amplitude and the digital data (1,0) as a +1.35 volt amplitude. The difference in voltage levels between two GFSK and four GFSK is that the modulated signal 226 occupies the same bandwidth regardless of the data rate. Thus, at any point in operation when the data rate changes, an abrupt transition from one of the values to another of the values typically occurs. Thus, the multi-rate filter ROM 204 compensates for such abrupt transitions and produces filtered data 220 that smooths such abrupt transitions.",
        "According to the present invention, a multi-rate ROM output scaler 206 allows a single GFSK ROM look up table to be used to produce the filtered data 220. As will be further described herein, differing data rates require that the DDS input data 224 have specific output levels that represent the digital data 212. The filtered data 220 is scaled according to the data rate indicator 216. In the disclosed embodiment of the invention, the multi-rate ROM output scaler 206 utilizes a delayed version of the data rate indicator 216 provided by the delay circuit 207. The delay approximates the propagation delay of data through the multi-rate filter ROM 204.",
        "As compared to systems which may use multiple filter ROMs, each of which operates with a respective data rate, the modulation circuitry 200 of the present invention uses a single multi-rate filter ROM 204 and a multi-rate ROM output scaler 206 to operate in any of the various data rates. This allows the modulation circuitry 200 to dynamically switch data rates, which multiple-ROM systems cannot do without considerable added complexity.",

The adder 208 may also receive additional signals which determine whether the scaled and filtered data 222 and the DDS center frequency 223 are added or are subtracted by the adder 208. Such add and subtract signal is based upon the value of the data to be modulated. The output of the adder 208 serves as the DDS input data 224.

The output of the 2/4 level converter is parallel digital data having data bits D1 and D0. Based upon the data rate indicator 326, the 2/4 level converter produces either two or four of the possible combination of data bits D1 and D0. The output of the 2/4 level converter 302 is produced at a particular clocking frequency known as the symbol rate.

The adder/subtractor 316 also receives the most significant bit B5 (add/sub) produced by the 4 level GFSK shift register 304. Based upon the add/sub signal received from the 4 level GFSK shift register 304, the adder/subtractor either adds the output from the ROM output scaler 308 to the DDS center frequency input 332 or subtracts the output from the ROM output scaler 308 from the DDS center frequency input 332.",

The quadrant logic, based upon a portion of the 12 bit input, determines a 10 bit output signal that is provided to the DDS ROM 310. The DDS ROM 310 performs a look up function based upon the 10 bit input and produces an 8 bit output. This 8 bit output is received by the 2's complement to unsigned converter 318 which produces an unsigned output having 8 bits which is provided to digital analog converter (DAC) 320.

The shift register 402 effectively provides a delay from D1 and D0 to B3 and B2, respectively, plus additional delay elements for the values of D1 and D0 in the symbol periods immediately before and after. Thus, B3 and B2 reflect a delayed version of the current symbol, B1 and B0 reflect the previous symbol, and B5 and B4 reflect the next symbols. With this information, the GFSK ROM 306 of the disclosed embodiment can produce a smooth transition from midway between the previous and current symbol levels to the current symbol level, and from the current symbol level to midway between the current and next symbols. For the following symbol period, the current symbol (B3, B2) becomes the previous symbol (B1\u2032, B0\u2032), the next symbol (B5, B4) becomes the current symbol (B3\u2032, B2\u2032).

        "Equations (3) and (4) illustrate how 4 GFSK operation may be achieved with the 8 GFSK filter data look up table 612 by setting line 618 logic high (the output of multiplexor 608), by providing data bit D1 through multiplexor 610 as line 620 and by providing data bit D0 as input 616 to the filter data look up table 616 via multiplexor 606. Thus, according to the present invention, multiple data rates may be accomplished in a single filter data look up table 616 in conjunction with a scaled output element 206 to provide multi-data rate operation, all supported by a single unit.\n\nf4(x,y)=(h4/h8)\u00b7f8(x,1,y)\u2003\u2003Equation (3)\n\nf4(x,y)=2\u00b7f8(x,1,y)\u2003\u2003Equation (4)",
        "As can be seen, modulation outputs are mapped to appropriate locations in the filter data lookup table 616 by the data rate decode circuitry 604 and multiplexors 606, 608, and 610. In order to minimize the size of the discontinuity of the scaled and filtered data 222 (FIG. 2) when the data rate changes, the mapping may be chosen to keep the ratio of the output scaling factors near unity. In the 2/4-level case discussed above, for example, the 2-level inputs are mapped to the extreme 4-level output levels in order to produce the scaling factor ratio nearest unity (1.35 or 1/1.35=0.74 as opposed to 0.45 or 1/0.45=2.22). Similarly, for the 2/4/8-level case, the third expression for f2(x) in Equation (2) may be used because the relative scaling factor (1.125) is closest to unity.",
        "In the disclosed embodiment, only one mapping from f8( ) to f4( ) is shown. However, the resulting scaling factor of 2 is relatively large (the scaled filter output will double or halve at transitions between 4-level and 8-level signaling), suggesting that this method could be enhanced by adding two additional levels to the 8 GFSK filter data lookup table 616 (at the cost of added complexity). Accordingly, it is contemplated that improved results may be obtained by mapping the \u201couter\u201d 4-GFSK levels to the \u201couter\u201d 8-GFSK levels and creating new table entries for the \u201cinner\u201d 4-GFSK levels. These new levels might be, for example, at \u00b17/3\u00b7(h8)\u00b7f3 with a resulting 4-GFSK output scaling factor of 6/7\u22480.857. In addition, it should be noted that the scaling factor for the highest order modulation output need not be unity.",

The particular installation contemplated is a wireless terminal 700 that includes multi-rate data encoding circuitry 702 and DDS circuitry 706 constructed in accordance with previously described circuits. The multi-rate data encoding circuitry 702 receives digital data from connected data processing circuitry 704, encodes the data dependent upon operating conditions and provides the encoded data to the DDS circuitry 706. Such encoding considers current data rate requirements and other operating conditions.

Such IF signal is provided to the demodulation circuitry 712 which demodulates the IF signal. Such IF signal is provided to the demodulation circuitry 712 which demodulates the IF signal. Upon demodulation, the demodulation circuitry 712 provides the demodulated signal to data conversion circuitry 714 which reproduces a digital signal of interest. Such digital signal of interest is then passed to the data processing circuitry for further use. Such use may be had with attached conventional circuitry 716.",

As shown, D flip flops 828, 830 and 832 form a four level shift register such as the four level GFSK shift register 304 described above in conjunction with FIG. 3. Each of the D flip flops 828, 830 and 832 provide dual outputs corresponding to two of the bits of output data B5 through B0. Splitter 842 receives the outputs of the D flip flop 828, providing the least significant bit to a concatenation circuit 836 and the most significant bit to the input of a D flip flop 844. A second concatenation circuit 834 receives the outputs of the D flip flops 830 and 832. The concatenated outputs are provided to the concatenation circuit 836.",

The five bit address output of the concatenation circuit 836 is inverted by inverter 838 and selector 840 based on the logic level of the most significant bit output of the splitter 842. The five bit address effectively identifies one ten sample portion of the address space of the 4 level GFSK ROM 808. Concatenation circuit 810 combines the five bit address provided by the selector 840 with a sample counter value which repeatedly counts between zero and nine. The sample counter value is synchronized with the symbol clock 324 so that it counts between zero and nine once for each symbol. The output of the concatenation circuit 810 is provided to address input of the 4 level GFSK ROM 808.",

The optional D flip flop 806 is coupled between the 4 level GFSK ROM 808 and the ROM output scaler 812 for purposes of introducing a pipelining delay in certain implementations of the GFSK filter 800. Other optional pipelining D flip flops include D flip flops 804, 806, 844 and 852. D flip flops 816 and 846 form a second pipeline stage in the disclosed embodiment of the invention. The pipelining D flip flops are clocked by clocking signal SMPL_CLK 328, which operates at ten times the frequency of the symbol clock 324 of the disclosed embodiment of the invention. The pipelining flip flops are not required for functional operation of the GFSK filter 800, but may be useful to shorten delays through the various stages of the GFSK filter 800.",

Operation of the switch 814 is controlled by an enable signal TXMOD 854, which is latched and delayed (if needed) by the D flip flops 848, 850 and 852. D flip flops 848 and 850 are included in the disclosed embodiment for purposes of matching the delays introduced by D flip flops 828 and 830. In the event modulation is disabled, a constant value of zero is provided at the output of the switch 814.",

A multiplier circuit 822 receives the scaled output of the pass through circuit 820 and multiplies the output by a factor of two. The output of either pass through circuit 820 or the multiplier circuit 822 is provided to the input of an adder/subtractor 826 via a switch 824.

        "The adder/subtractor 826 also receives the DDS center frequency input CF<16> and the most significant bit B5 (add/sub) produced by the 4 level GFSK shift register. The most significant bit B5 is provided by an output of the D flip flop 846. Based upon this output, the adder/subtractor 826 either adds the output from the ROM output scaler 812 to the DDS center frequency input CF<16> or subtracts the output from the ROM output scaler 812 from the DDS center frequency input CF<16>. In either case, the adder/subtractor 826 produces a 16 bit output which is provided to a phase accumulator such as phase accumulator 314.",
        "Many variations to the disclosed embodiments of the invention are contemplated. For example, the modulator may comprise a DDS circuit (using FSK, PSK, ASK/AM, QAM, etc.) followed by a DAC. Alternatively, the modulator may comprise a DAC followed by analog circuitry (e.g., a voltage controlled oscillator).",
        "In view of the above detailed description of the present invention and associated drawings, other modifications and variations will now become apparent to those skilled in the art. It should also be apparent that such other modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims which follow."
