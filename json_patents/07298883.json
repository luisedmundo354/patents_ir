    "abstract": "A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme to aid in the detection, characterization, diagnosis, and/or assessment of normal and diseased states (including lesions and/or images). The scheme employs lesion features for characterizing the lesion and includes non-parametric classification, to aid in the development of CAD methods in a limited database scenario to distinguish between malignant and benign lesions. The non-parametric classification is robust to kernel size.",

        "Breast cancer remains a disease without a cure unless it is found at a sufficiently early stage and subsequently surgically removed, irradiated, or eradicated with chemotherapy. Major research issues include those focused on genetic and molecular forms of detection and treatment, and those focused on anatomical levels of prevention, detection, and treatment. In these various areas, the role of the human interpreter (e.g., oncologist, radiologist, pathologist, surgeon, primary care physician) varies. However, the very presence of a human interpreter introduces subjective judgment into the decision-making process\u2014whether it be in the initial detection (or miss) of a lesion on a mammogram or in the surgical decision regarding the type of incision. Thus, while ongoing research is needed in the biological aspects of cancer, in the physical aspects of instrumentation to better \u201csee\u201d the cancer, and in the biological/chemical/physical aspects of therapy, research is also needed for improving the role of the human in the overall management of the patient. Multi-modality and multi-disciplinary decision making on patient management, requiring inputs from oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, and risk clinic physicians, can be quite subjective, as is often evident during case management conferences. Although \u201csubjective\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201cpoor judgement\u201d, it does permit sub-optimal and inconsistent decision making.",
        "Breast cancer is the leading cause of death for women in developed countries. Detection of breast cancer in an early stage increases success of treatment dramatically, and hence screening for breast cancer of women over 40 years of age is generally recommended. Current methods for detecting and diagnosing breast cancer include mammography, sonography (also referred to as ultrasound), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
        "Mammography is the most effective method for the early detection of breast cancer, and it has been shown that periodic screening of asymptomatic women does reduce mortality (Refs. 1-6). Many breast cancers are detected and referred for surgical biopsy on the basis of a radiographically detected mass lesion or cluster of microcalcifications. Although general rules for the differentiation between benign and malignant mammographically identified breast lesions exist, considerable misclassification of lesions occurs with the current methods. On average, less than 30% of masses referred for surgical breast biopsy are actually malignant.",
        "Computerized analysis schemes are being developed to aid in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions in order to improve both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate). Comprehensive summaries of investigations in the field of mammography CAD (computer aided diagnosis) have been published by Giger and colleagues (Refs. 7-9). Investigators have used computers to aid in the decision-making process regarding likelihood of malignancy and patient management using human-extracted features and BI-RADS (Refs. 10-13). Such methods are dependent on the subjective identification and interpretation of the mammographic data by human observers. Gale et al. (Ref. 14) and Getty et al. (Ref. 15) both developed computer-based classifiers, which take as input diagnostically-relevant features obtained from radiologists' readings of breast images. Getty et al. found that with the aid of the classifier, community radiologists performed as well as unaided expert mammographers in making benign-malignant decisions. Swett et al. (Ref. 16) developed an expert system to provide visual and cognitive feedback to the radiologist using a critiquing approach combined with an expert system. Other investigators have been developing methods based on computer-extracted features (Refs. 17-24). The benefit of using computer-extracted features is the objectivity and reproducibility of the result. Radiologists employ many radiographic image features, which they seem to extract and interpret simultaneously and instantaneously. Thus, the development of methods using computer-extracted features requires, besides the determination of which individual features are clinically significant, the computerized means for the extraction of each such feature. Spatial features, which are characteristic of lesions, have been shown to be extractable by a computer analysis of the mammograms and to be useful in distinguishing between malignant and benign. Most methods are evaluated in terms of their ability to distinguish between malignant and benign lesions, however, a few have been evaluated in terms of patient management (i.e., return to screening vs. biopsy). It is important to state that while one of the aims of computerized classification is to increase sensitivity (true positive rate), another aim of computerized classification is to reduce the number of benign cases sent for biopsy. Such a reduction will be clinically acceptable only if it does not result in unbiopsied malignant cases, however, since the \u201ccost\u201d of a missed cancer is much greater than misclassification of a benign case. Thus, computer classification schemes should be developed to improve specificity (true negative rate) but not at the loss of sensitivity (true positive rate). We have shown that the computerized analysis of mass lesions (Refs. 17, 21) and clustered microcalcifications (Refs. 18, 22) on digitized mammograms yields performances similar to an expert mammographer and significantly better than average radiologists in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions.",
        "We are investigating the potential usefulness of computer-aided diagnosis as an aid to radiologists in the characterization and classification of mass lesions in mammography. Observer studies have shown that such a system can aid in increasing the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists both in terms of sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate). Our mass classification method includes three components: 1) automated segmentation of mass regions, 2) automated feature-extraction, and 3) automated classification. The method was initially trained with 95 mammograms containing masses from 65 patients. Features related to the margin, shape, and density of each mass are extracted automatically from the image data and merged into an estimate of the likelihood of malignancy (Refs. 17, 21, 23, 24). These features include a spiculation measure (FIG. 1), a margin definition feature (FIG. 2), and two density measures. The round-robin performance of the computer in distinguishing between benign and malignant masses was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Ref. 21). Our computer classification scheme yielded an Az value of 0.94, similar to that of an experienced mammographer (Az=0.91) and statistically significantly higher than the average performance of five radiologists with less mammographic experience (Az=0.81) (FIG. 3). With the database we used, the computer scheme achieved, at 100% sensitivity, a positive predictive value of 83%, which was 12% higher than that of the experienced mammographer and 21% higher than that of the average performance of the less experienced mammographers at a p-value of less than 0.001 (Ref. 21).",
        "The computerized mass classification method was independently evaluated on a 110-case database consisting of 50 malignant and 60 benign cases (Ref. 24). The effects of variations in both case mix and in film digitization technique on the performance of the method were assessed. Categorization of lesions as malignant or benign using the computer achieved an Az value (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.90 on the prior training database (Fuji scanner digitization) in a round-robin evaluation, and Az values of 0.82 and 0.81 on the independent database for Konica and Lumisys digitization formats, respectively. However, in the statistical comparison of these performances, we failed to show a statistical significant difference between the performance on the training database and that on the independent validation database (p-values>0.10). Thus, our computer-based method for the classification of lesions on mammograms was shown to be robust to variations in case mix and film digitization technique (Ref. 24).",
        "Subsequently we have developed advanced classifiers for the merging of features\u2014characteristics of the lesion or image\u2014into a probability or status of disease. These classifiers have potential to aid in the development of CAD methods in a limited database scenario.",

A particular example is given here using non-parametric classification in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign mammographic lesions.",
        "Radiographically, mass lesions can be characterized (Refs. 7, 9) by, for example:\n\n    \n    \n        Lesion Feature 1: degree of spiculation (spiked versus rounded),\n        Lesion Feature 2: margin definition (margin sharpness),\n        Lesion Feature 3: shape,\n        Lesion Feature 4: density (determined using average gray level, contrast, texture),\n        Lesion Feature 5: homogeneity (texture),\n        Lesion Feature 6: asymmetry,\n        Lesion Feature 7: temporal stability,\n        and so forth.\n\nMass lesions from mammograms may be characterized using the inventors' earlier work (Refs. 17, 21, 23, 24) in which a characterization scheme based on the degree of spiculation is determined from a cumulative edge gradient histogram analysis in which the gradient is analyzed relative to the radial angle (FIG. 2). The mass is first extracted from the anatomic background of the mammogram using automatic region-growing techniques (Ref. 17). Features extracted are then obtained using cumulative edge gradient histogram analysis. In the cumulative edge-gradient analysis, the maximum gradient and angle of this gradient relative to the radial direction is calculated.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates the calculation of the FWHM (full width at half max) from the cumulative gradient orientation histogram for a spiculated mass and a smooth mass. Note that here the spiculation feature (based on the radial direction) is used in distinguishing between spiculated lesions and round lesions. Also, the average gradient along the margin of a mass will be calculated to describe the sharpness of the margin. Higher values indicate a sharper margin and thus a higher likelihood that the lesion is benign.",

        "Although the radiographic density of a mass may not be by itself as powerful a predictor in distinguishing between benign and malignant masses as its margin features, taken with these features, density assessment can be extremely useful. The evaluation of the density of a mass is of particular importance in diagnosing circumscribed, lobulated, indistinct, or obscured masses that are not spiculated.",
        "In order to assess the density of a mass radiographically, the present invention uses three density-related measures (average gray level, contrast, and texture measure) that characterize different aspects of the density of a mass. These measures are similar to those used intuitively by radiologists. Average gray level is obtained by averaging the gray level values of each point within the grown region of a mass. Contrast is the difference between the average gray level of the grown mass and the average gray level of the surrounding fatty areas (areas with gray-level values in the lower 20% of the histogram for the total surrounding area). Texture is defined here as the standard deviation of the average gradient within a mass and it is used to quantify patterns arising from veins, trabeculae, and other structures that may be visible through a low-density mass, but not through a high-density mass. A mass of low radiographic density should have low values of average gray level and contrast, and a high value of the texture measure, whereas a mass of high radiographic density should have high values of average gray level and contrast, and a low value of the texture measure.",
        "FIG. 3 shows the relationship between measures of spiculation and margin definition for malignant and benign mammographic masses.",
        "Non-parametric methods have been used for curve fitting in statistical analysis (Refs. 27-29). In the present invention however non-parametric classifiers are used to merge features (i.e., characteristics of the lesion or image) into a probability or status of disease. These classifiers are used to aid in the development of CAD methods in a limited database scenario.",
        "A signal/noise classifier based on the ratio of density probabilities at the observed point produces the maximal area under the ROC curve, being in this sense the \u201cbest\u201d classifier possible. Such a classifier is created by (1) constructing estimators of the signal and noise densities and (2) classifying observations based on the ratio of the estimated probability densities. Non-parametric density methods may also be used to estimate probability densities of unknown functional forms. Non-parametric estimates are unbiased in the large number limit. One embodiment of the invention is the application of the approach outlined above for the classification of breast lesions detected on mammography, using a database of breast lesions (malignant or benign) which already have been analyzed by a computer system yielding computer-extracted lesion features. The non-parametric density estimate is the product of \u2018blurring\u2019 the observations (treated as Dirac \u2018delta\u2019 functions) with a suitably chosen kernel. A number of blurring kernels are available to construct the probability density estimates. Parabolic kernels of fixed size (1-x2 and (1-x2)2, for |x|<1) are optimal in some cases. Alternatively, the Gaussian kernel may be used as it produce smooth, unbounded, density estimates (closer to our perception of what the \u201ctrue\u201d probability density should be). The kernel may be of fixed size, or it can be adaptative (wider in regions where data are more sparse, narrower in regions where data are more dense). In some cases adaptative kernels offer faster convergence, but fixed-size kernels are preferable as they are more robust to implement. In addition, the size of a fixed kernel can be found based on theoretical criteria.",
        "The probability densities in the feature space for benign and malignant lesions in a database can be estimated by summing up the blurring kernels centered in the observations, thus yielding the likelihood ratios. In the evaluation, lesions from an independent database can be classified based on the ratio of the estimated probability densities. The quality of fit will be estimated by the area beneath the corresponding ROC curve.",

The kernel was a Gaussian kernel with the kernel width for a specific feature being a percentage of the range of the values for that feature over all the lesions. Note that for a given feature, the kernel width was kept fixed in determining the PDF. In an alternative embodiment the width could be varied to be, for example, larger when less data points are available.
