        "This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 10/791,195, filed Mar. 2, 2004, pending.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and circuits and, more particularly, to compliant contact pins and methods of fabrication for connecting electrical signals to integrated circuits.",
        "2. State of the Art",
        "Semiconductor devices, from microprocessors to memory chips, are fabricated by performing a long series of processes and steps including etching, masking, depositing, and the like, on a semiconductor wafer or other bulk semiconductor substrate. Many integrated circuits may be fabricated on a single semiconductor wafer by placing them in arrays across the wafer. Ultimately, the individual circuits are singulated from the wafer and are either further processed, including packaging and additional testing, or discarded when they are determined to be undesirable.",
        "Due to processing or other defects in the semiconductor wafer, certain ones of the integrated circuits may not function as designed. Such defects may be detected initially or may not become apparent until the integrated circuit has been in operation for a period of time. Therefore, it is important to test and electrically stress the integrated circuits to determine which circuits are operational and which ones are defective or are likely to become defective.",
        "Semiconductor integrated circuits are typically subjected to a series of test procedures during the manufacturing process in order to verify functionality and reliability. Typical test approaches include wafer probe testing in which integrated circuits are individually tested to determine the operational characteristic of each before singulation from the semiconductor wafer.",
        "Conventionally following initial testing, the integrated circuits are singulated into individual integrated circuit chips with the operational chips being further assembled into packages. The packaged devices are then \u201cburned-in\u201d by loading the packaged devices into sockets on burn-in boards and electrically operating the packaged devices at elevated temperatures for an extended testing period. Such elevated temperatures induce failure in marginally operative or nonoperative devices, which allows such devices to be screened-out and discarded before they are integrated into higher level assemblies or sold. Burning-in and testing of packaged devices are typically accomplished through the use of sockets suited for the burn-in conditions and high speed testing. Accordingly, conventional manufacturing and testing processes are expensive and time consuming because of the repeated handling and testing of individual devices; therefore, individually tested and handled devices that ultimately fail have wasted costly resources and time.",
        "A considerable advantage in cost and in process time could be attained by burning-in and testing a semiconductor wafer before it is singulated into discrete devices. Additional savings may be recognized by forgoing packaging of devices that ultimately fail once subjected to burn-in conditions. A considerable effort has been expended to develop effective methods for wafer level testing. One such approach utilizes cantilevered or spring-wire probes that are arranged on a contact or probe card for simultaneous contact to all of the devices on the semiconductor wafer. Such contactor cards are expensive to manufacture and result in undesirable electrical characteristics such as increased inductance along parallel wires.",
        "Therefore, there is a need for providing a contact methodology that results in a highly economically manufacturable method of contacting individual semiconductor devices in a wafer-level testing environment.",
        "Furthermore, individual dice generally need to be packaged into a higher assembly before they may be integrated into a system environment. These higher assemblies or packages generally need to accommodate or compensate for differences in thermal expansion between the individual die and the system level substrate. Therefore, there is a need for providing a contact methodology that mediates stresses between dissimilar materials.",
        "A compliant contact pin assembly, card, and methods associated therewith are provided in various embodiments. In one embodiment of the present invention, a contact pin assembly includes a contact pin formed in place from a portion of a substrate. The contact pin is compliantly held suspended within the substrate by a compliant coupling structure. The suspension within the substrate results in a compliant deflection orthogonal to the plane of the substrate.",
        "In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for forming a contact pin assembly is provided. A location for the contact pin is defined on a substrate in a location that corresponds to a target contact pad on, for example, a wafer to be tested. The substrate around the location is thinned for approximately the length of travel of the contact pin on the side defined as the contact end side. The substrate is locally thinned to a depth of at least the length of the contact pin immediately around the location of the contact pin to form a void surrounding the contact pin. The void is filled with compliant coupling material and the opposite side of the substrate is thinned to release the contact pin from the remaining substrate.",
        "In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for forming a contact pin assembly wherein the substrate provides the compliant action for the contact pin is provided. The location for the contact pin is defined on the substrate and the substrate is thinned around the location. Further thinning around the contact pin forms a void. The opposite side of the substrate is thinned, but not all the way through to the void. Instead, the remaining substrate on the opposite side flexes when the contact end of the contact pin encounters and presses against a pad on a wafer or other device-under-test.",
        "In yet a further embodiment of the present invention, a device assembly for coupling with a device to form an assembly for coupling with a substrate having a contact pad thereon includes a contact pin assembly and a device attached thereto.",
        "In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a contactor card for interfacing between a tester and a device-under-test is provided. The contactor card includes a substrate configured for attachment with a semiconductor tester. The substrate further includes at least one contact pin assembly aligned for compliantly coupling with a device-under-test, such as a wafer. In a further embodiment, a method for making a contactor card is provided. The method forms at least one contact pin assembly on the substrate of the contactor card.",
        "In yet a further embodiment, a method of testing a semiconductor wafer is provided. The method aligns the contact pads on a semiconductor wafer with the corresponding contact pad assemblies of a contactor card and then mates the card together such that the contact pins compliantly mate with the contact pads. Test signals are applied and monitored through the contactor card. In still another embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor wafer testing system is provided and includes a contactor card as described and a tester for generating and analyzing test signals.",

        "The present invention, according to the various embodiments described, is drawn to compliant contacting structure and methods for providing electrically conductive contact pins formed from and within a generally planar substrate. The various views and diagrams are illustrated generally as cross-sectional views for clarity; however, the specific formed profiles and devices may be arranged across the surface of the substrate and with various orientations and geometries as are desirable, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "In FIG. 1A, substrate 10 has defined thereon a location 12 for the formation of a contact pin. Substrate 10 may comprise a silicon wafer, a ceramic substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, or other suitable material. At the location 12, a mask layer 14 is placed on the top or contact end side of substrate 10. The profile of mask layer 14 identifies the general cross-sectional geometry of an emerging contact pin to be formed at location 12. Mask layer 14 may be thermally grown silicon oxide, CVD silicon oxide, or CVD silicon nitride. Substrate 10 preferably includes a crystal orientation allowing for selectively etching as an isotropic etch. In FIG. 1B, the silicon etch is stopped at a distance 16 corresponding to an approximate contact pin travel distance. The contact pin travel distance may be heuristically derived as a function of the elasticity or flexibility of the compliant coupling means described below. As illustrated, the etch is preferably an isotropic etch resulting in side walls 18 that exhibit an approximate orthogonal relationship to thinned contact end surface 20.",
        "In FIG. 1C, additional mask layers 22 of the same general nature as mask layer 14 are placed on thinned contact end surface 20 for the formation of stops that regulate the travel distance of the contact pin under fabrication. It is noted that the stops may be discrete or generally continuous in circumscribing the emerging contact pin formed at location 12.",
        "In FIG. 1D, substrate 10 has been further thinned or etched to form stops 24 that limit the distance of travel of the contact pin as well as provide a stand-off for particles or contaminants that may be present on the further thinned contact end surface 26 of substrate 10. In FIG. 1E, the maximum depth of the emerging contact pin 34 is defined through the formation of a void 28 surrounding the emerging contact pin 34. Void 28 may be formed in one of several manners including a photo etch process, wherein other portions of the substrate 10 are masked and protected from the etching process. Alternatively, void 28 may be formed through laser ablation or machining. Laser machining may be performed by a micro machining laser such as the XCISE 200 available from XSTL Ltd. of Dublin, Ireland.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1E, a thickness 30 of substrate 10 remains intact to support the emerging contact pin 34 through further manufacturing processes. If substrate 10 is comprised of a semiconductive or conductive material, an insulative layer 31, such as an oxide layer, is formed on the sidewalls of void 28. When substrate 10 is comprised of a nonconductive material, then an insulative layer is unnecessary. In one embodiment, the emerging contact pin 34, in addition to the surfaces defining void 28, are conductively coated by depositing a conductive material 32 generally over the emerging contact pin 34 and throughout the void 28. In one particular embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1F, conductive material 32 is formed through a metallic plating process, which results in conductive surfaces on remaining substrate portions 36 and on emerging contact pin 34.",
        "A compliant coupling structure couples emerging contact pin 34 with remaining substrate portions 36 of substrate 10. By way of example and not limitation, FIG. 1G illustrates one such structure as compliant coupling material 38. Compliant coupling material 38 at least partially fills void 28 and forms a resilient compliant interface between emerging contact pin 34 and remaining substrate portions 36 of substrate 10. One suitable type of compliant coupling material includes conductive filled elastomers, for example, those available from A. I. Technology, Inc. of Princeton Junction, N.J., and conductive filled polymers such as, for example, E3114-5 conductive polymer available from Epoxy Technology of Billerica, Mass.",
        "To enable compliant movement relative to the remaining substrate portions 36, the contact pin is released from the remaining substrate portions 36. In FIG. 1H, the back or opposite surface 40 of substrate 10 is thinned, either through an etching process or through a mechanical grinding process, for at least a thickness or distance 30 to release or free contact pin 42 from adjacent portions of substrate 10. As illustrated, contact pin 42 is formed from a portion of substrate 10 and remains positioned at original location 12 through compliant coupling means, namely compliant coupling material 38.",
        "In a specific embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 11, contact pin 42 is further coated with additional conductive material 44 at a bottom or interconnect end 51 to encapsulate the contact pin with additional conductive material. Consistent with the formation of conductive material 32 about the contact end 29 of contact pin 42 and throughout void 28, conductive material 44 may be formed through various processing steps including electroplating or other plating or coating techniques.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a contact pin assembly 46, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A compliant axis 48 illustrates the axis of motion of contact pin 42 as a result of the resilient or elastic nature of compliant coupling material 38\u2032. Furthermore, in one exemplary embodiment, the compliant coupling material is electrically conductive and is illustrated as compliant coupling material 38\u2032. Electrical continuity exists from contact tip or contact end 50 of contact pin 42 to substrate 10 by way of conductive material 32 electrically coupled with electrically conductive compliant coupling material 38\u2032, which further is electrically coupled to a portion 52 of the conductive material affixed to the remaining substrate 10. Routing of a signal detected at contact end 50 of contact pin 42 may be further routed via one or more conductive traces 54 to other desirable locations. Conductive trace 54 may be formed according to various interconnection techniques including masking, deposition, and etching techniques, the specifics of which are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "In FIG. 3, contact pin assembly 46 is illustrated in a compliant state responsive to a device-under-test 56, for example, a semiconductor wafer, with a contact pad 58. The mating or coupling of the device-under-test 56 causes the displacement of contact pin 42 along a compliant axis 48 as compliant coupling material 38\u2032 resiliently deforms or compliantly responds thereto. As illustrated, stops 24 restrict the distance of travel of contact pin 42 and further protect the device-under-test 56 and contact pin assembly 46 from damage due to contaminants, for example, particles between device-under-test 56 and further thinned contact end surface 26.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a contact pin assembly, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Contact pin assembly 46\u2032 includes a contact pin 42 compliantly retained in substrate 10 by way of a nonconductive compliant coupling material 38\u2033. Because of the nonconductive nature of compliant coupling material 38\u2033, electrical coupling must be provided from contact pin 42 to surrounding substrate 10. In the present embodiment, a wire bond 60 is applied between contact pin 42 and conductive trace 54. Wire bonding techniques are known by those of ordinary skill in the art and further discussion of such process is not contained herein.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates a coupling of a device-under-test 56 having a contact pad 58 mating with contact pin assembly 46\u2032. As illustrated, contact pin 42 compliantly deflects along compliant axis 48 due to the resiliency of compliant coupling material 38\u2033. Also illustrated, wire bond 60 further deforms in response to the compliant motion of contact pin 42, thereby maintaining electrical continuity between contact pin 42 and conductive trace 54.",
        "FIGS. 6A-6D illustrate yet another method of formation of a contact pin for use in a contact pin assembly, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, processing of substrate 10 follows preliminary processing steps according to FIGS. 1A-1E. Prior thereto, however, a bore 62 is formed entirely through substrate 10, for example, centered within location 12, and through the emerging contact pin. Boring techniques may include those utilized for the formation of voids 28, namely etching and or laser ablating techniques. In FIG. 6B, bore 62 (FIG. 6A) is filled with a conductive material 64, which may be formed using plating, sputtering, squeegeeing or other conductive fill techniques known by those of ordinary skill in the art. This may also be effected prior to the steps of FIGS. 1A-1E. In FIG. 6C, voids 28 (FIG. 6A) are filled with compliant coupling material 38 according to techniques described above with reference to FIG. 1G. In FIG. 6D, an etching or abrasive process, such as mechanical grinding or abrasive planarization such as Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP), removes the back side of substrate 10 for at least a distance or thickness 30 to release the emerging contact pin to form contact pin 66.",
        "FIG. 6E illustrates an alternative approach for releasing the emerging contact pin to form contact pin 67. In the present embodiment of the present invention, contact pin 67 is released by isolating contact pin 67 from remaining substrate portions 69 of substrate 10 by forming voids 71 through one or more substrate removal processes previously described. Such processes include etching, laser machining, and mechanical routing, etc.",
        "The ends of contact pin 66 are preferably conductively coated to further facilitate electrical coupling. FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 illustrate various contact ends or tips that may be formed upon contact pins 66, 67, in accordance with respective embodiments of the present invention.
