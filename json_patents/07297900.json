        "The present invention is generally directed to arc welding assemblies, and is specifically directed to arc welding assemblies comprising bypass torches used to divert current away from the work piece.",
        "In conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) assemblies, the welding speed depends on the speed of formation of the weld pool used to form the weld join. In GMAW assemblies, a power source delivers current to melt a consumable electrode wire to produce the weld pool. As a result, some arc welding assemblies increase the amount of welding current provided to the consumable electrode wire and work piece to be welded, consequently increasing the melting rate and the welding speed. Providing heat to the work piece is important, because it may facilitate greater penetration of the weld pool inside the work piece, thereby improving the weld strength. However, too much welding current delivered to the work piece may overheat the work piece, and weaken the weld strength.",
        "To reduce overheating of the work piece, a double electrode gas metal arc welding (GMAW) assembly 1 as shown in FIG. 1 has been utilized. Referring to FIG. 1, the assembly 1 comprises a welding contact tip 10 having a consumable wire electrode 12 at its end. The assembly further comprises a bypass torch 20 with a tip 22, which is configured to divert a portion of the welding current away from the work piece. The assembly 1 is configured to provide enough current to increase the melting rate of the consumable wire 12 and the weld speed, while diverting current that would result in the overheating of the work piece.",
        "These benefits notwithstanding, the large size and configuration of the double electrode arc welding assembly 1 and its components prevent the user from accessing the weld joints and work piece, especially for narrower joints. As welding demands increase, the need arises for improvements in bypass torch configurations and components thereof, which provide the user with increased access to the weld joints and work piece, increased maneuverability, and/or lower cost.",

        "In a second embodiment of the present invention, an arc welding assembly is provided. The arc welding assembly comprises a power source configured to provide a welding current, and a single weld housing. The single weld housing comprises a welding torch, which comprises a consumable electrode wire.

In one exemplary embodiment, the consumable electrode wire 122 may comprise steel, and/or various steel alloys. In a further embodiment, the electrode wire 122 comprises a metal material substantially similar to the metal material of the work piece.",
        "Referring to the embodiment of FIG. 2 (see also FIGS. 3-4), the arc welding assembly 100 may further comprise a gas diffuser 140 configured to deliver shielding gas in proximity to the weld area. The shielding gases are used to protect a welding area from atmospheric gases. The shielding gases provided by the gas diffuser 140 include, but are not limited to, inert gases or carbon dioxide. The gas diffuser 140 generally comprises a non-conductive material, for example, polymers or synthetic resins, which may include plastic or bakelite. In a further embodiment, the arc welding assembly 100 further comprises a gas nozzle 142 at least partially surrounding at the welding torch 120. The gas nozzle 142, which is coupled to the weld housing, is configured to maintain the shielding gases in the weld area and is further configured to at least partially protect against atmospheric gases in the weld area. The gas nozzle 142 may comprise any suitable durable material known to one or ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the gas nozzle 142 may comprise a composition composed at least partially of a conductive metal. In some exemplary embodiments, the gas nozzle 142 may include, but is not limited to, nickel, iron, molybdenum, tungsten based material, carbon steel, or alloys and combinations thereof.",

As shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 2-4, it is readily apparent that bypass torches may comprise various configurations, shapes and dimensions in the arc welding assembly. As shown in FIG. 2 (see also FIGS. 3-4), the bypass torch 130 may occupy at least part of the outer surface of the weld housing 110. In another embodiment, the bypass torch 130 may define an elongated member substantially parallel to the welding torch 120.",
        "Referring to an embodiment as shown in FIG. 2, the bypass torch 130 may define a substantially elongated rod 132 with a slanted end portion. The slanted end portion may comprise a bypass electrode wire 131 coupled to the elongated rod 132. As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 2, the bypass electrode wire 131 is arranged at an angle, for example, an acute angle, relative to the elongated rod 132. The bypass electrode wire 131 may be coupled to the elongated rod 132 via various coupling mechanisms familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, screw, bolt, etc. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the coupling mechanism is a spring plunger 180. The elongated rod 132 and bypass electrode wire 131 both comprise a conductive metal material, for example, steel, tungsten, copper, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the rod 132 comprises steel, and the bypass electrode wire 131 comprises tungsten.",
        "The bypass torch 130 may, in a further embodiment, comprise an electrical contact 190 for delivering the current back to the power source 160. The electrical contact 190, which typically is adjacent or coupled to the elongated rod 132, may comprise any suitable conductive material, for example, copper. The bypass electrical contact 190 may be coupled to the power source 160 via an electrical cable 192. In operation, the diverted current 174 passes through the bypass electrode wire 131 and elongated rod 132, and is then conducted through the electrical contact 190 to the power source 160 via the electrical cable 192.",
        "Referring to another embodiment as shown in FIG. 3, the bypass torch 230 defines a substantially elongated member having a curved edge portion. In a further embodiment, the bypass torch 230 may be coupled to or bonded to the gas nozzle 242. In this embodiment, the gas nozzle 242 would, in addition to maintaining shielding gases in the weld area, constitute a component of the bypass torch 230. The gas nozzle 242 acts as a conductive member configured to deliver diverted current 274 to the bypass contact 290. Consequently, the gas nozzle 242 is preferably comprised of conductive material, such as a conductive tungsten based ceramic material. Referring to the FIG. 3 embodiment, the weld housing 210 may define a coaxial arrangement wherein the welding torch 220 extends through the center of the weld housing 210 and the bypass torch 230 extends along the outer circumference of the housing 210, thereby at least partially surrounding the welding torch 220.",

As shown in FIG. 4, the bypass torch 330 may be coupled to the weld housing 310, specifically by coupling with the gas nozzle 342. Similar to the FIG. 3 embodiment, the gas nozzle 342 may act as a component of the bypass torch 330. Referring to FIG. 4, the bypass torch 330 is coupled to the weld housing via a spring plunger 380 as shown; however, other coupling mechanisms are also contemplated herein.",
        "In each of the examples provided in FIGS. 2-4, the bypass torch 130/230/330 is connected (directly or indirectly) to the welding torch 120/220/320. In one embodiment, the bypass torch 130/230/330 may intersect with the welding torch, or specifically the consumable electrode wire 122/222/322. In another embodiment, the bypass torch 130/230/330 and welding torch 120/220/320 do not intersect, but maintain a distance close enough to allow the bypass torch 130/230/330 to divert a portion of the welding current 170/270/370 from the welding torch 120/220/320. In a few exemplary embodiments, the largest distance between a portion of the bypass torch 130/230/330 and the welding torch 120/220/320 is less than about 2 mm to about 3 mm.",
        "The amount of current provided to the work piece or diverted through the bypass torch may vary depending on the work piece material and the weld material i.e. the composition of the consumable electrode wire 122. In a further embodiment as shown in FIG. 2, the welding current 170, the diverted current 174, and the non-diverted current 172 may be regulated by a control component 162. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the control component 162 is part of the power source 160; however a separate control component is contemplated herein. In a few exemplary embodiments, the control component 160 may comprise a processor, a computer, programmable logic controller or the like.",
        "For illustration of how welding current 170 is diverted, the following numerical example is provided. As a threshold, the welding current 170 approximately equals the sum of the diverted current 174 and non-diverted current 172. The power source provides 250 amps of welding current to melt the wire 122. The bypass torch 130 may divert as much or as little current as desired. For example, the bypass torch 130 may divert 125 amps back to the power, so that the remaining 125 amps flow to the work piece.",
        "In a further embodiment, the arc welding assembly may further comprise a water cooling attachment 150, for example, a water cooled fixture, operable to cool the arc welding assembly 100. The water cooled fixture 150 may comprise any suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, copper or stainless steel. The water cooled fixture 150 may be placed in various locations on the arc welding assembly 100. Referring to FIG. 2, the water cooled fixture 150 is provided adjacent the bypass torch 130 for cooling the bypass torch components 130 as well as the weld housing 110 as a whole.",
        "Referring generally to FIGS. 2-4, the arc welding assemblies comprise the single weld housing 110 configuration, which include the welding torch 120 and the bypass torch 130. This single weld housing configuration can be more easily maneuvered and can be brought close to a variety of weld joints and work pieces, especially those with narrow weld openings. The assembly 100 increases access to the weld joints and the work piece, while also reducing costs.",
