        "This application is a divisional patent application of commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/669,634, filed Sep. 24, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,055,603, entitled \u201cCement Compositions Comprising Strength-Enhancing Lost Circulation Materials and Methods of Cementing in Subterranean Formations,\u201d by William J. Caveny, et al., which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to subterranean cementing operations, and more particularly, to cement compositions comprising strength-enhancing lost circulation materials, and methods of using such cementing compositions in subterranean formations.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Hydraulic cement compositions are commonly utilized in subterranean operations, particularly subterranean well completion and remedial operations. For example, hydraulic cement compositions are used in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings such as casings and liners are cemented in well bores. In performing primary cementing, hydraulic cement compositions are pumped into the annular space between the walls of a well bore and the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened substantially impermeable cement therein that substantially supports and positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surface of the pipe string to the walls of the well bore. Hydraulic cement compositions also are used in remedial cementing operations such as plugging highly permeable zones or fractures in well bores, plugging cracks and holes in pipe strings, and the like.",
        "Subterranean formations transversed by well bores are often weak, highly permeable, and extensively fractured. In some cases, such formations may be unable to withstand the hydrostatic head pressure normally associated with fluids (e.g., cement compositions and the like) being injected into the formation. In such cases, the hydrostatic pressure may be sufficient to force such fluids into the fractures and/or permeable zones of the formation, which may result in a significant loss of fluid into the formation. This loss of fluid circulation is problematic for a number of reasons. For example, where the loss of circulation occurs during a cementing operation, excessive fluid loss may cause a cement composition to be prematurely dehydrated and may decrease the compressive strength of the cement composition. Excessive fluid loss into the formation may also prevent or reduce bond strength between the set cement composition and the subterranean zone, the walls of pipe, and/or the walls of the well bore.",
        "Previous attempts to minimize the loss of circulation into the subterranean formation involved the addition to the cement composition of a variety of additives including, but not limited to, asphaltines, ground coal, cellulosic, plastic materials, and the like. The addition of such additives was an attempt to plug or bridge the fractures and/or the permeable zones in the formation where the treatment fluids are typically lost. However, during a cementing operation, the addition of the lost circulation materials often has been detrimental to the compressive strength of the cement composition because, inter alia, such additives do not bond to the cement. Because one function of the cement is to support the pipe string in the well bore, such reduction in the compressive strength of the cement composition is undesirable.",
        "The present invention relates to subterranean cementing operations, and more particularly, to cement compositions comprising strength-enhancing lost circulation materials, and methods of using such cementing compositions in subterranean formations.",
        "An example of a composition of the present invention is a cement composition comprising: cement selected from the group consisting of Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, soil cements, calcium phosphate cements, high alumina content cements, silica cements, and high alkalinity cements; a strength-enhancing lost circulation material of sufficient size to reduce loss of circulation of the cement composition into a subterranean formation; and water.",
        "Another example of a composition of the present invention is a cement composition comprising: cement selected from the group consisting of Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, soil cements, calcium phosphate cements, high alumina content cements, silica cements, and high alkalinity cements; vitrified shale of sufficient size to reduce loss of circulation of the cement composition into a subterranean formation; and water.",
        "The features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the description of the preferred embodiments which follows.",
        "The present invention relates to subterranean cementing operations, and more particularly, to cement compositions comprising strength-enhancing lost circulation materials, and methods of using such cementing compositions in subterranean formations.",
        "The improved cement compositions of the present invention generally comprise cement, water, and a strength-enhancing lost circulation material. Optionally, other additives suitable for use in conjunction with subterranean cementing operations may be added to these cement compositions if desired. Typically, the cement compositions of the present invention have a density in the range of from about 4 lb/gallon to about 20 lb/gallon. In certain exemplary embodiments, the cement compositions of the present invention have a density in the range of from about 8 lb/gallon to about 17 lb/gallon. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the appropriate density of the cement composition for a chosen application.",
        "The water utilized in the cement compositions of the present invention can be fresh water, salt water (e.g., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated salt water), or seawater. Generally, the water can be from any source provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds, e.g., dissolved organics, that may adversely affect other components in the cement composition. The density of the water may vary based, inter alia, on the salt content. In certain exemplary embodiments, the water has a density in the range of from about 8.3 lb/gallon to about 9.5 lb/gallon. Further, the water may be present in an amount sufficient to form a pumpable slurry. In certain exemplary embodiments, the water is present in the cement compositions in an amount in the range of from about 30% to about 180% by weight of the cement (\u201cbwoc\u201d) therein. In certain exemplary embodiments, the water is present in the cement composition in the range of from about 40% to about 90% bwoc therein. In certain exemplary embodiments, the water is present in the cement composition in the range of from about 40% to about 50% bwoc therein. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the appropriate amount of water for a chosen application.",
        "Any cements suitable for use in subterranean applications are suitable for use in the present invention. In one embodiment, the improved cement compositions of the present invention comprise a hydraulic cement. A variety of hydraulic cements are suitable for use including those comprised of calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and/or sulfur which set and harden by reaction with water. Such hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to, Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, soil cements, calcium phosphate cements, high alumina content cements, silica cements, high alkalinity cements, and mixtures thereof.",
        "The cement compositions of the present invention further comprise a strength-enhancing lost circulation material. The strength-enhancing lost circulation material may be any material that provides a desired level of lost circulation control from the cement composition into the formation with minimal adverse impact to the compressive strength of the cement composition. Among other things, certain embodiments of the strength-enhancing lost circulation material of the present invention bridge and/or plug fractures and permeable zones in the formation so as to minimize loss of fluid circulation into the formation. Certain exemplary embodiments of the strength-enhancing lost circulation material of the present invention have a density such that they do not rise to the surface of the well bore if circulation of the cement composition should cease. Generally, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material chemically and/or mechanically bonds to the matrix of the cement. Generally, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material may have any particle size distribution that provides a desired level of lost circulation control. In an exemplary embodiment, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material may have a particle size distribution in the range of from about 37 micrometers to about 4,750 micrometers. In an exemplary embodiment, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material is vitrified shale. A variety of vitrified shales are suitable for use including those comprised of silicon, aluminum, calcium, and/or magnesium. In an exemplary embodiment, the vitrified shale may be fine grain vitrified shale whereby the fine vitrified shale particles may have a particle size distribution in the range of from about 74 micrometers to about 4,750 micrometers. An example of a suitable fine grain vitrified shale is \u201cPRESSUR-SEAL\u00ae FINE LCM,\u201d which is commercially available from TXI Energy Services, Inc., in Houston, Tex. In an exemplary embodiment, the vitrified shale may be coarse grain vitrified shale whereby the coarse vitrified shale particles may have a particle size distribution in the range of from about 149 micrometers to about 4,750 micrometers. An example of a suitable coarse grain vitrified shale is \u201cPRESSUR-SEAL\u00ae COARSE LCM,\u201d which is commercially available from TXI Energy Services, Inc., in Houston, Tex.",
        "Generally, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material may be present in the cement compositions in an amount sufficient to provide a desired level of lost circulation control. In one embodiment, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material is present in the cement composition in an amount in the range of from about 1% to about 50% bwoc. In certain exemplary embodiments, the strength-enhancing lost circulation material is present in the cement composition in an amount in the range of from about 5% to about 10% bwoc. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the appropriate amount of the strength-enhancing lost circulation material for a chosen application.",
        "Optionally, the cement composition may further comprise a conventional lost circulation material. The conventional lost circulation material may be any material that minimizes the loss of fluid circulation into the fractures and/or permeable zones of the formation. Conventional lost circulation materials typically comprise a variety of materials, which include, but are not limited to, asphaltines, ground coal, cellulosic, plastic materials, and the like. The conventional lost circulation materials may be provided in particulate form. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the appropriate amount of the conventional lost circulation material for a chosen application.",
        "Additional additives may be added to the cement compositions of the present invention as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. Examples of such additives include, inter alia, fly ash, silica compounds, fluid loss control additives, a surfactant, a dispersant, an accelerator, a retarder, a salt, mica, fiber, a formation conditioning agent, fumed silica, bentonite, expanding additives, microspheres, weighting materials, a defoamer, and the like. For example, the cement compositions of the present invention may be foamed cement compositions wherein an expanding additive that produces gas within the cement composition has been added in order, inter alia, to reduce such composition's density. An example of a suitable expanding additive comprises a blend containing gypsum and is commercially available under the tradename \u201cMICROBOND\u201d from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. at various locations. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the proper amount of an expanding additive to use in order to provide a foamed cement composition having a desired density. An example of a suitable fluid loss control additive comprises an acrylamide copolymer derivative, a dispersant, and a hydratable polymer, and is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/608,748 filed on Jul. 21, 2003, the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. An example of a suitable fly ash is an ASTM class F fly ash which is commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services of Dallas, Tex. under the trade designation \u201cPOZMIX\u00ae A.\u201d",
