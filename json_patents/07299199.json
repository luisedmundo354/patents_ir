        "In general, the present invention relates to an information-processing system, an information-processing apparatus and an information-processing method. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information-processing system, an information-processing apparatus and an information-processing method that allow, for example, a content purchased by the user to be kept in a server.",
        "In recent years, portable information terminal devices, such as a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and a digital portable telephone, have been utilized. Due to their small weight, it is convenient to connect the portable information terminals to the Internet for obtaining audio or video data content through a purchase arrangement or free download.",
        "However, memory embedded in the portable information terminal device does not have sufficient storage capacity. Thus, when new content is purchased with limited available memory, that is, a state in which a number of contents has been already stored in the memory, the user must erase a content already stored in the memory or, as an alternative, the user must erase a content already stored in the memory after copying the content to another memory, typically a memory card if the user does not want to lose the content.",
        "As described above, as the number of contents to be used increases, the user must prepare a memory card for extra capacity, or, in the case of only one memory card available, contents stored in the memory card must be further copied to a large-capacity hard disk of a personal computer. As a result, operations to be carried out by the user become complicated.",
        "In addition, when the user wants to use a content, which was once copied to the hard disk of a personal computer, in the portable information terminal device, the content must be copied back from the hard disk to the portable information terminal device by way of the memory card or it is necessary to connect the portable information terminal device to the personal computer and copy the content from the personal computer to the portable information terminal. In this case, the operations to be carried out by the user also become complicated as well.",
        "The present invention addresses the problems described above to provide an information-processing system that allows the user to purchase a content and preserve the purchased content in a server so that it is not necessary for the user to worry about the storage capacity of a portable information terminal device's memory for storing contents.",

        "In the information management apparatus of the information-processing system provided by the present invention, a request for a transmission of a predetermined content is received from the information-processing apparatus, the predetermined content is extracted from a plurality of recorded contents and the predetermined content is transmitted to the information-processing apparatus. In addition, a third ID is generated on the basis of a first ID for identifying the information-processing apparatus and on the basis of a second ID for identifying the predetermined content, and issued to the information-processing apparatus. The issued third ID is stored, being associated with the second ID. In the information-recording apparatus of the information-processing system provided by the present invention, on the other hand, a request is issued to the information management apparatus to transmit a predetermined content and the predetermined content transmitted by the information management apparatus on the basis of the request is acquired. Then, a request is issued to the information management apparatus to preserve the predetermined content and a third ID transmitted by the information management apparatus in response to the request is acquired and stored.",

The information includes the user's address, name and phone number. The user ID issued by the server is stored typically in a flash ROM 23 employed in the PDA 1 as shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Subsequently, a particular one of the PDAs 1-1 to 1-N, which was operated by the user, receives the content transmitted by the server 3 on the basis of the purchase request, and stores the content in a memory card 10 shown in FIG. 2. Then, the user operates the particular one of the PDAs 1-1 to 1-N to transmit a request to the server 3, asking the server 3 that the purchased content be preserved, and to acquire a preservation ID issued by the server 3 in response to the request, storing the preservation ID in the memory card 10.",

        "The user rotates or presses the jog dial 13 against the body of the PDA 1 in order to select one of items such as an icon, a thumbnail and a text, which are appearing on the display unit 11. If the user rotates the jog dial 13 with a plurality of icons appearing on the display unit 11, for example, a desired icon can be selected among the displayed icons. If the user further presses the jog dial 13 against the body of the PDA 1, the selection of the selected icon is confirmed. If the selected icon corresponds to an application program, the application program is activated when the selection of the selected icon is confirmed.",
        "In addition, the PDA 1 can be designed so that an operation to rotate the jog dial 13 while pressing the jog dial 13 is interpreted as an instruction different from the ordinary rotating operation. Nevertheless, relations between operations of the jog dial 13 and instructions corresponding to the operations are not limited to what is described above.",

        "If the result of the judgment formed at the step S15 indicates that the server 3 has received the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA 1, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S16 at which the communication unit 86 receives the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA 1 through the Internet 2, and passes on the request to the content distribution program 101 under control of the input/output management program 104. Then, the preservation-ID issuance program 102 is activated.",
        "By execution of the preservation-ID issuance program 102, a preservation ID is generated on the basis of the user ID authenticated in the processing carried out at the steps S11 and S12 and on the basis of the content ID of the content transmitted to the PDA 1 in the processing carried out at the step S14. Then, the communication unit 86 transmits (delivers) the preservation ID to the PDA 1 through the Internet 2 under control of the input/output management program 104.",
        "Typically, a preservation ID is a hash value obtained by extracting data with a proper length from a result of applying a hash function to a user ID and a content ID. A hash value used as a preservation ID is a value obtained as a result of applying a hash function to data, which is a user ID and a content ID in this case. A hash function is a one-directional function of mapping data generally having a variable length onto a value having a fixed length. A hash function has a property that makes collisions among hash values difficult to occur.",
        "At a step S17, by execution of the preservation-ID issuance program 102, the preservation ID issued in the processing carried out at the step S16 is stored in the preservation-ID database 5, being associated with the content ID as shown in FIG. 7.",
        "At a step S6, the communication unit 34 employed in the PDA 1 receives the preservation ID from the server 3 through the Internet 2 under control of the data communication program 64. By execution of the content purchase program 61, the preservation ID is then stored in the memory card 10 or the flash memory 23.",
        "As described above, the user of the PDA 1 is allowed to preserve a purchased content in the server 3 so that it is not necessary to store a purchased content in the memory card 10 or the flash memory 23.",
        "Thus, by merely storing a preservation ID issued by the server 3 in response to a request for a preservation of a purchased content in the server 3, the PDA 1 is capable of downloading the purchased content from the server 3 if necessary at any time.",
        "As described above, when a content is purchased, processing is carried out to form a judgment as to whether or not the purchased content needs to be preserved in the server 3. It is to be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited to this scheme. For example, a request for a preservation of a purchased content can be made when such a preservation becomes necessary at a later time after the purchase of the content. That is to say, a purchased content can be preserved in the server 3 at any time.",
        "By referring to a flowchart shown in FIG. 10, the following description explains a process carried out by the PDA 1 to download a purchased content preserved in the server 3.",
        "First of all, when the user of the PDA 1 wants to download a purchased content preserved in the server 3 under management executed by the server 3 at a request made earlier by the user to preserve the content in the server 3, the user activates the content exchange program 62 by operating the keyboard 12, the jog dial 13 or the touch pad 11a of the display unit 11. In this way, the CPU 21 employed in the PDA 1 executes the content exchange program 62 stored in the EDO DRAM 24 or the flash ROM 23. By execution of the content exchange program 62, the user selects a preservation ID among those stored in the memory card 10 or the flash ROM 23 and carries out an operation to make a request for a transmission of a purchased content identified by the preservation ID from the server 3.",
        "At a step S31, by execution of the content exchange program 62, from the user, the PDA 1 receives a request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID from the server 3. The communication unit 34 transmits a signal representing the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID to the server 3 by way of the Internet 2 under control of the data communication program 64.",
        "At a step S41, in the server 3, the communication unit 86 receives the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID from the PDA 1 through the Internet 2, and passes on the request to the CPU 81 under control of the input/output management program 104. The CPU 81 then executes the content distribution program 101 to handle the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID. As part of the execution of the content distribution program 101, the authentication program 103 is activated.",
        "The authentication program 103 is then executed to determine whether or not the preservation ID included in the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID is valid. A result of the authentication is then supplied to the content distribution program 101.",
        "At the next step S42, by execution of the content distribution program 101, the CPU 81 forms a judgment as to whether or not the authentication of the preservation ID was successful on the basis of the authentication result received from the authentication program 103. If the authentication of the preservation ID was unsuccessful due to, for example, the fact that the preservation ID has been falsified, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S43 at which the communication unit 86 transmits a message indicating the unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID to the PDA 1 by way of the Internet 2 under control of the input/output management program 104. The processing is then ended without executing subsequent steps.",
        "If the result of the judgment formed at the step S42 indicates a successful authentication of the preservation ID, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S44 at which, by execution of the content distribution program 1001, the CPU 81 reads out a content ID associated with the preservation ID from the preservation-ID database 5 and, then, reads out a content, which is identified by the content ID read out from the preservation-ID database 5, from the content database 4. Subsequently, the communication unit 86 transmits the content to the PDA 1 by way of the Internet 2 under control of the input/output management program 104.",
        "At a step S32, by execution of the content exchange program 62, the PDA 1 forms a judgment as to whether or not a message received from the server 3 indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID. If the result of the judgment shows that the message received from the server 3 indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID, the processing is ended without executing subsequent steps.",
        "If the result of the judgment formed at the step S32 shows that no message was received from the server 3 to indicate an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S33 at which the communication unit 34 receives the content from the server 3 through the Internet 2, and passes on the content to the content exchange program 62 under control of the data communication program 64. If necessary, the content is stored in the memory card 10 or the flash ROM 23.",
        "As described above, the user of the PDA 1 is capable of downloading a purchased content associated with a preservation ID issued by the server 3 when necessary. Thus, it is not necessary to store a purchased content in the memory card 10 or the flash ROM 23 in advance.",
        "Thus, the user can purchase a content without worrying about the storage capacity of the memory employed in the PDA 1 owned by the user.",
        "In addition, by using a PDA 1, a content can be purchased and preservation of the purchased content can be requested as described above. However, the present invention is not limited to the use of a PDA 1. For example, a wide range of other information-processing apparatus connectable to a digital portable telephone, a portable personal computer and the server 3 through the network such as the Internet 2 can also be applied.",
        "The series of processes described above can be carried out by using hardware or by execution of software. If the series of processes is carried out by execution of software, programs composing the software are installed in a computer from program storage media. The computer can be a computer including embedded special-purpose hardware or a computer capable of carrying out a variety of functions by execution of a variety of programs installed therein. An example of the latter computer is a general-purpose personal computer.",
        "The program storage media for storing programs to be installed into a storage medium employed in a computer is so-called package media. Examples of the package media are the magnetic disk 51 or 91 including a flexible disk, the optical disk 52 or 92 including a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) and a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), the magneto-optical disk 53 or 93 or an MD (Mini-Disc, trademark) and the memory card 10 or the semiconductor memory 94 as shown in FIG. 3 or 5. The installed programs are then loaded from the storage medium into a memory such as a RAM employed in the computer in a state of being executable by the computer. The storage medium for installing programs is embedded in the hard disk drive 87. Instead of installing programs into the hard disk drive 87 as described above, the programs can be stored in advance in the flash ROM 23. The hard disk drive 87 and the flash ROM 23 are each a storage medium that can be used for storing programs temporarily or permanently. As an alternative, the programs can be installed into the storage medium employed in the computer not from the package media but, if necessary, from a remote source by way of communication media and an interface employed in the computer. The communication media includes a wire communication medium such as the Internet 2 and a radio communication medium such as the digital satellite broadcasting. The Internet 2 includes a public line network and a local area network. On the other hand, the interface employed in the computer is the communication unit 34 or 86, which is typically implemented by a router or a modem.",
        "It is to be noted that in this specification, steps prescribing a program stored in a recording medium can of course be pieces of processing, which are carried out in a prescribed order along the time series, but do not have to be executed sequentially. That is to say, the steps can be pieces of processing, which are carried out concurrently or individually.",
        "In addition, the word \u2018system\u2019 used in this specification means the whole system including a plurality of apparatuses.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, the user can preserve a purchased content in a server. Thus, the user can purchase a content without worrying about the storage capacity of a memory employed in an apparatus used by the user. In addition, the server is capable of managing contents purchased by users with ease."
