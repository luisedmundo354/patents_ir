        "Optical discs, such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) are forms of computer readable media which provide extensive storage for digital information. One side of an optical disc may contain data and is referred to as a data side. The data side may be read only, or may also be written to. The other side of the optical disc that does not contain data may provide for a label and is referred to as the label side. In particular cases, a side or both sides may provide for both data and a label.",
        "An optical disc drive (ODD) of a computer may be used to read from and may write to a data side of an optical disc. An optical pickup unit (OPU), included within the optical disc drive, is configured with a laser and sensors adapted for reading, and possibly writing, data. Various ODDs and OPUs are available, and are manufactured to specifically read and write to the data side of optical discs.",
        "Using emerging technology, the OPU assembly may be used to produce an image on the label surface of an optical disc configured for such a labeling process. Producing the image includes defining tacks which are concentric circles of the optical disc where the image is written, and focusing focal optics of a laser beam that performs the actual printing of the image on the optical disc.",
        "An ODD typically includes a voice coil motor (VCM) configured as a sled motor that moves an OPU assembly in a radial direction to a position that is adjacent particular tracks of the optical disc. An OPU assembly may also include a VCM configured as a focus motor that moves focal optics to a particular distance orthogonal to a surface of the disc such as a height above or below the disc, to focus a laser beam for labeling. The VCMs are responsive to an input signal (voltage or current) and move to a particular location when a particular input signal is applied. Therefore, when an input signal is applied to the sled VCM, the OPU assembly is moved adjacent to a particular track. Likewise, when an input signal is applied to the focus VCM, the focal optics are moved to a particular focus position. The VCMs are typically calibrated to move a particular distance when a particular input signal is applied. The calibration is performed at a particular temperature.",
        "However, a VCM includes metal windings whose electrical conductivity is affected by temperature changes. Therefore when the VCM is heated, the resistance of the metal windings goes up and electrical conductivity increases. Since a VCM is calibrated at a particular temperature to move a particular distance based on a particular input signal, not accounting for temperature changes can result in inaccurate positioning. For example, if a VCM is operated at a temperature different from the calibration temperature, a particular input signal may move the OPU assembly to an incorrect track position or the focal optics to an incorrect focus position.",

        "Exemplary ODD Embodiment",
        "FIG. 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the ODD system 175 shown in FIG. 1. The ODD system 175 includes an optical pickup unit (OPU) assembly 200 that includes a sled 205, a laser 210, a photo sensor 212, focal optics 215 and a voice coil motor (VCM) 220. The VCM 220 responds to an input signal (voltage or current) to cause the focal optics 215 to move the focal point of a laser beam generated by laser 210.",
        "For purposes of illustration, the focal optics 215 are carried by lens supports 225(1), 225(2). The focal optics 215 are configured for travel (i.e. adjustment of the focal point) along a \u201cz\u201d axis 230 perpendicular to a surface of an optical disc 235. Photo sensor 212 determines a distance along \u201cz\u201d axis 230 at which an \u201cin focus\u201d condition of the laser beam exists with respect to a particular location on the surface of optical disc 235. VCM 220 is calibrated to move to this particular distance by receiving a particular input signal. However, if the operating temperature when labeling is performed is different from the temperature at which the VCM was calibrated, the laser beam may be out of focus since a different z-axis position value results from the unadjusted input signal. Therefore as discussed below, an adjustment is made to compensate for the change in temperature in order to determine the proper input signal needed to arrive at the desired z-axis position corresponding to the \u201cin focus\u201d position.",
        "However, in some embodiments it may be desirable to further adjust the z-axis position so as to intentionally defocus the laser beam. This focus offset may be provided in order to provide a better image quality using a marking laser. For example, the size of the visible spots created by a focused laser may be too small to allow efficient labeling, so a defocused laser beam may be used to created larger visible spots. Or the marking laser may create such distortion from its heat when marking a surface, as to provide a need for an adjusted focus offset. A predetermined amount of focus offset may be achieved by providing a corresponding focus offset value for the input signal. This offset value is also typically determined at the calibration temperature of the VCM. Therefore, variances in actual operating temperature may also provide a need to adjust the focus offset value based on the temperature variance.",
        "A laser beam 240 is generated by the laser 210 and directed onto (reflected on) a label side surface 245 of optical disc 235. The laser beam 240 creates laser marks that correspond to label image data to produce an image of the label side 245 of the optical disc 235.",
        "The ODD system 175 includes a spindle motor 250, a VCM 255, and a controller 260. VCM 255 acts as a sled motor that moves OPU assembly 200 adjacent to particular radial positions or tracks of optical disc 235. VCM 255 is calibrated to move to this particular distance by receiving a particular input signal. VCM 255 may be referred to as a sled or radial VCM since it provides movement in the radial direction. VCM 255 may be calibrated for gain\u2014in other words input signal (e.g., millivolts) per movement (microns), such that for example, a particular number of millivolts results in a movement in distance.",
        "A separate stepper motor 256 provides a coarse adjustment for radial movement, and particularly is calibrated to move per a step size increment as instructed by controller 260. VCM 255 includes a fine adjust feature 257. While stepper motor 256 is calibrated to move per a step size increment, fine adjust feature 257 is calibrated to adjust to a finer increment. For example, if stepper motor 256 is calibrated for a step size of 120 microns, and fine adjust feature 256 is calibrated for a smaller increment, when 80 microns of movement is requested, stepper motor 256 moves the sled 205 by 120 microns, and fine adjust feature 257 moves the sled 205 back by 40 microns.",
        "The gain or movement of VCM 255 (i.e., fine adjust feature 256) is affected by temperature changes The gain of VCM 255 is calibrated at a particular operating temperature (i.e., a predetermined operating temperature gain); however variances in actual operating affect the actual gain of VCM.",

        "In general, a spindle driver drives the spindle motor 250 to control a rotational speed of optical disc 235 via a spindle 272. The spindle driver operates in conjunction with a sled diver which drives the VCM 255 to control radial (track) positioning of OPU assembly 200 with respect to disc 235 along a sled drive mechanism 275. In a labeling implementation the sled 205 of the OPU assembly 200 is moved along the sled drive mechanism 275 to various radii (track) positions of optical disc 235.",

        "A laser driver controls the activation and intensity of laser beam 240 to write laser marks corresponding to a label image onto the label side surface 245. Additionally, the laser driver controls the activation and intensity of the laser beam 240 to read data maintained on the data side 278 of the optical disc 235 when the disc is positioned such that the data side 278 passes over the laser beam 240. In certain cases, the same side is used for data and labeling.",

Furthermore, another driver is included for VCM 255 executable on processor 263 to adjust a VCM input signal source 284 which provides an input to VCM 255. Input signals may be either current or voltage. As discussed, VCMs 220 and 255 are calibrated at a particular operating temperature, therefore input signals are based on the particular calibrated operating temperature. However, when the OPU assembly is operated at temperatures other than the calibrated operating temperature may result in different distances from the VCMs 220 and 255.",

In this exemplary implementation two temperature sensing apparatuses are provided, temperature sensing apparatus 290 for VCM 220 and temperature sensing apparatus 293 for VCM 255 to measure operating temperatures at the respective VCMs. In other implementations, a single temperature sensing apparatus may be used to determine general operating temperatures for the VCMs. For better accuracy separate temperature sensing apparatuses are placed at the windings of VCM 220 and VCM 255 respectively.

Preferably, temperature sensing apparatus 290 is placed in close proximity to the windings of VCM 220 and temperature sensing apparatus 293 is place in close proximity to the windings of VCM 255. In other embodiments, a single temperature sensing apparatus is used for VCM 220 and VCM 255.",

The calibration temperature may be store in a nonvolatile section of memory 266 and recalled by controller 266 or processors 263. Therefore two delta temperature values are calculated for VCMs 220 and VCM 255. The following equation describes each delta temperature value, where Operatingtemp is the measured operating temperature and Calibratedtemp is the temperature at which the VCM was calibrated.\n\n\u0394temp(VCM)=Operatingtemp\u2212Calibratedtemp",
        "Each delta temperature value is multiplied by the temperature coefficient (TC) of the respective VCMs 220 and 255. The resultant value is the voltage adjustment needed for the input signal value. Note that, in one embodiment, the TC may be predominantly based on the value of the thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the metal used for the windings of the VCMs. To more accurately gauge thermal effects, however, the TC (temperature coefficient) of the entire system (or VCM), which includes more than just the winding metal TCR, is generally considered. To account for such thermal effects, the TC of the VCM may be determined by design and manufacturing, which typically results in a nominal TC for the system, and minimum and maximum limits for the TC of the system.",
        "An example of a metal used in a winding for VCM 220 and 255 is copper. The TCR of copper is 0.393% per degree centigrade The following equation is calculated to derive an input signal adjustment, in this example a voltage input adjustment.\n\nAdjustment=\u0394temp(VCM)*(TC)",

        "Therefore if an input signal value or voltage value is 70 mV, it is adjusted by +7.5% to arrive at a temperature compensated value of 75.25 mV. This is the voltage applied to the voice coil motor to position the objective lens or the sled.",
        "With regard to the focus VCM 220, a focus offset value may be included in the input signal adjustment For example, if a 30 micron (um) focus offset is desired, an example VCM gain measurement at the calibrated temperature of 36 degrees centigrade is 0.426 mm/V. Therefore to account for this focus offset an additional voltage (input) value is added to the input signal value. In this example, the derived additional voltage is 0.030 mm/(0.426 mm/V)=70.42 mV. However, a temperature compensated additional voltage value where the operating temperature is 55 degrees centigrade is (0.030 mm/0.426 mm/V)(100%+7.50%)=75.70 mV. To achieve the same focus offset at the operating temperature 75.70 mV is added, instead of 70.42 mV.",
