In particular, the present invention relates to a three-dimensional structure using wires on the order of nanometers (referred to as nano) to micrometers formed by etching utilizing the crystallinity of silicon etc. as elements, a method for producing the same, and a device including the same.",
        "Conventionally, a plate or block structure composed of silicon or a structure formed by bending a metal conducting wire provides elements such as oscillators and coils.",
