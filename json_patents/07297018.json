For patch panel systems, the approach is based upon a distributed architecture that may be modularly scalable and may reduce, if not eliminate, the need for a centralized signal processor and complex cabling between patch panels and the centralized signal processor. Each patch panel may determine port level connectivity independently. Polling delays and polling-related overhead processing may be reduced or eliminated by supporting real-time monitoring of port connectivity at the port level. The approach provides improved real-time reporting of patch panel connectivity with reduced cabling complexity, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. In addition, the approach is compatible with (i.e., may communicate with and be controlled by) a multipurpose network management system (NMS). In addition, a compatible revision system is provided.",

        "FIG. 1 presents an example of a prior art patch panel bank 100 in which individual patch panels 102(a-g) have been adapted to support the automated compilation of patch cord connectivity information. As shown in FIG. 1, each patch panel 102 has a plurality of patch panel ports 104 and is connected to a centralized signal processor 106 via a monitoring ribbon cable 108(a-g).",
        "Patch cords 112(a-g) used to establish connectivity between two patch panel ports 104 may include a plurality of network conductors that support network data connections and additional out-of-band conductors that support out-of-band signal connections used by patch panel bank 100 to monitor the connectivity status of the patch cords. For example, an exemplary RJ-45 style cable terminator may include 8 data conductors typically associated with an RJ-45 cable terminator and an additional out-of-band conductor.",
        "Referring again now to FIG. 1, upon insertion of a 9-wire RJ-45 style connector, as described above, into an RJ-45 patch panel port 104, the out-of-band connector makes contact with an out-of-band connector conducting pad (not shown) that is integrated within, or behind, each RJ-45 patch panel port 104. Each out-of-band conducting pad may be connected, internally within the patch panel, to one of the multiple conductors within monitoring ribbon cable 108 that connects each patch panel 102 with centralized signal processor 106. The present invention can make use of a connector having nine or more conductors, or it can use a probe on any type of connector, with the probe making electrical contact with the patch panel motherboard. Such connectors may be used with embodiments of the present invention, including the embodiment of FIG. 2.",
        "In patch panel bank 100, to determine connectivity between individual patch panel ports 104 established by patch cords 112, centralized signal processor 106 polls each port 104 on each patch panel 102 via the respective monitoring ribbon cables 108. For example, centralized signal processor 106 may sequentially place an electrical signal, such as a DC voltage, upon a selected conductor within a selected monitoring ribbon cable 108 and detect whether the signal is received upon another monitoring ribbon cable 108 conductor associated with the same patch panel or another patch panel connected to centralized signal processor 106. If a signal is detected upon a monitoring ribbon cable 108 conductor in response to a signal being placed upon another conductor within the same or a different monitoring ribbon cable 108, centralized signal processor 106 may determine that the two patch panel ports associated with the respective ribbon cable conductors are connected. Centralized signal processor 106 may generate and transmit a message to a Network Management System (NMS) via a management network connection 110 to report the determined port level connectivity. If no signal is detected upon a monitoring ribbon cable 108 conductor in response to a signal being placed upon a conductor within the same or different monitoring ribbon cable 108 associated with a specific patch panel port, centralized signal processor 106 determines that the patch panel port upon which the signal is placed is not in use.",
        "Although a monitored patch panel bank 100, as described above with respect to FIG. 1, is capable of providing a network management system with patch panel connectivity information, such monitored banks of patch panels have significant drawbacks. The approach is not modularly scalable in that the centralized signal processor 106 is limited in the number of physical patch panels to which it can connect and, therefore, is limited in the number of patch panel connections that can be monitored. Although additional centralized signal processors may be obtained to support different banks of patch panels, patch cords connected between patch panels supported by different centralized signal processors cannot be monitored. Further, the monitored patch panel bank 100 based approach makes the centralized signal processor a single point of failure with respect to monitoring the bank of patch panels. Loss of a single centralized signal processor 106 (e.g., due to a loss of power, loss of a network connection, or due to an internal centralized signal processor failure) results in a loss of patch panel monitoring capability for the entire bank of patch panels. Further, the need to connect to a centralized signal processor panel places restraints upon the placement of patch panels and increases cable complexity, thus decreasing reliability and increasing maintenance costs. Still further, increases in the number of panels supported by a single centralized signal processor increases the polling requirements placed upon the centralized signal processor, thus increasing polling cycle time (i.e., the time required to poll all ports on all patch panels) and decreasing responsiveness of the system to changes in patch panel patch cord connectivity.",
        "In view of the above, a patch panel capable of monitoring and reporting patch panel port-level connectivity that is based upon a modularly scalable, distributed architecture is desirable. Such an approach would preferably reduce, if not eliminate, the need for a centralized signal processor by allowing each patch panel to determine port level connectivity independently. Further, such an approach would preferably reduce, if not eliminate, polling delays and polling-related overhead processing by supporting real-time monitoring of port connectivity at the port level. In addition, such an approach would provide real-time reporting of patch panel connectivity with reduced cabling complexity, increased reliability and decreased maintenance costs.",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of seven exemplary modular, intelligent patch panels 202(a-g). Each patch panel 202 is based upon a modularly scalable, distributed architecture. As shown in FIG. 2, each patch panel 202 may include a pair of network connection ports 220 that allow the respective patch panels to be interconnected in a daisy-chain configuration to a network connection 210 using daisy-chain network cables 208 (e.g., relatively short spans of 4-pair network cable terminated in conventional RJ-45 terminators). Network connection 210 may provide network connectivity to each patch panel in the daisy-chain and may thereby provide each patch panel in the daisy-chain with connectivity to a remote Network Management System (NMS). Further, each patch panel 202 may include a pair of power sharing ports 218 that allow the patch panels to be interconnected in a daisy-chain configuration to a single power supply 222 using daisy-chain power cables 216 (e.g., relatively short spans of DC or AC electrical power cabling with appropriate connectors).",
        "Each patch panel 202 is capable of monitoring and reporting patch panel port level connections formed by patch cords manually connected between ports on one or more patch panel devices without support from a centralized signal processor (e.g., as described with respect to FIG. 1 block 106). Therefore, the patch panel may reduce or eliminate the need for status-monitoring ribbon cables (as described with respect to FIG. 1). The ability to daisy-chain power to multiple patch panels from a single power supply 222 may reduce or eliminate the need for independent power supplies to each individual patch panel and further reduces the volume of power-related cables. The ability to daisy-chain network connectivity to multiple patch panels from a network connection 210 may reduce or eliminate the need for independent network cables for each individual patch panel and further reduces the volume of network-related cables.",
        "The patch panel architecture allows network patch panel capabilities to be scaled in any manner by the introduction of any number of patch panel devices. The patch panel architecture allows patch cord connectivity between any two patch panel ports to be determined based upon out-of-band communication between the respective connected ports over an out-of-band patch cord connection. The patch panel may reduce or eliminate the need for a common centralized signal processor to determine connectivity between patch panel ports. Further, elimination of the need for a centralized signal processor may remove a single point of failure with respect to the ability to monitor a set of patch panels and may remove or eliminate multiple other potential points of failure via simplified cabling. Further, unlike the polling approach described above with respect to FIG. 1, the patch panel architecture supports the monitoring and the reporting of changes in patch panel port-level connectivity on a real-time basis, regardless of the number of patch panels included in the network. Response time does not increase with the number of patch panels added to a network, as is the case with systems that rely upon a centralized signal processor to sequentially scan each port on each of the respective patch panels that the centralized signal processor supports. The patch panel architecture according to some embodiments of the present invention supports patch panel monitoring that may be modularly scaled to support any size network, provides real-time monitoring with reduced delay, and employs a simplified inter-patch-panel cabling scheme that increases reliability and reduces maintenance costs.",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram depicting an exchange of out-of-band messages between a patch panel 302(a) labeled \u201cpatch panel X\u201d and a patch panel 302(b) labeled \u201cpatch panel Z.\u201d As described in greater detail below, each patch panel port may repeatedly broadcast over the out-of-band channel a port message identifying the patch panel and port generating the message. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, patch panel port 304(a) associated with panel X may generate an outbound message \u201cpatch panel X/Port 21\u201d to indicate that patch panel port 304(a) is the twenty-first port on patch panel X. Further, as shown in FIG. 3, port 304(b) associated with patch panel Z may generate an outbound message \u201cpatch panel Z/Port 17\u201d to indicate that patch panel port 304(b) is the seventeenth port on patch panel Z.",
        "Each patch panel port may repeatedly broadcast an outbound message and listen for receipt of an outbound message generated from another patch panel port. Until a patch cord that supports the out-of-band communication channel is connected between two patch panel ports, neither port will receive an out-of-band message. However, upon connection of two patch panel ports with a patch cord that supports an out-of-band communication channel (e.g., a patch cord with a 9th wire) each patch panel port may receive the outbound message broadcast by the patch panel port with which it has established connectivity. The patch panel port controller associated with each of the respective ports may then generate, in real time, an update message to its respective patch panel controller. Upon receipt of an update message from a port controller, each respective patch panel controller may generate and transmit an update message over a network connection to a remote NMS that is configured to organize and present the received physical topology information in a manner useful to an end user.",

Upon receipt of an update message from a port controller module 504, panel processor module 510 may update status information stored within data storage module 508, generate an SNMP compliant update message that includes connection related information received from the port controller module, and transmit the generated SNMP compliant update message to a remote network-connected NMS via network interface module 506. A ninth wire connection 509 or other probe connection is connected to the patch panel out-of-band channel physical interface and the port controller module 504.

The port processor module 606 may proceed to transmit the message upon the out-of-band channel via a transmitter, which in one embodiment is operated by out-of-band channel physical interface 610. Further, the port processor module 606 may receive an inbound message from a remote port that includes a remote patch panel identifier and remote port identifier information, via a receiver which may be operated by out-of-band channel physical interface 610.",

        "The terms \u201cremote port\u201d and \u201clocal port\u201d are relative terms. For example, from the perspective of a patch panel port controller, the term \u201cremote port\u201d may be used to refer to any port other than the \u201clocal port\u201d supported by that patch panel port controller. Given that a patch panel supports multiple ports, a \u201cremote port\u201d may be a port on the same, or local, patch panel as a \u201clocal port\u201d or the \u201cremote port\u201d may be a port on another, or remote, patch panel. A remote port and a local port behave, and are, exactly the same except that each has a relative position with respect to the other. For example, each port, based upon the perspective of that port, transmits an out-of-band outbound port message that includes a local patch panel identifier and a local port identifier. Further, each port, based upon the perspective of that port, receives a remote patch panel identifier and a remote port identifier within a received message.",

        "FIG. 7 is a flow chart of an exemplary workflow associated with the startup of an exemplary patch panel device. As shown in FIG. 7, upon powering up, at step S702, of a patch panel device, the patch panel panel controller may send, at step S704, a configuration request to a remote NMS. Upon receipt, at step S706, by the NMS of the configuration request, the NMS may retrieve, from a configuration controlled storage repository, configuration parameters for the patch panel device from which the configuration request was received and send the retrieved configuration parameters to the patch panel panel controller. Upon receipt, at step S708, of the requested configuration parameters, the patch panel panel controller may store the received parameters and send, at step S710, all or a portion of the received configuration parameters to each of the respective patch panel port controllers associated with each of the respective patch panel ports to which all or portions of the respective configuration parameters apply. Upon receipt, at step S712, of configuration data from the panel controller, each port controller may store the configuration parameters and may initiate, at step 714, port connectivity monitoring in accordance with the received control parameters, as described above.",
        "FIG. 8 is a flow chart of an exemplary workflow associated with monitoring patch panel port-level connectivity based the monitoring of communications upon an out-of-band communication channel, as described above. As shown in FIG. 8, upon initiation of patch cord connectivity monitoring, a patch panel port controller may transmit, at step S802, an outbound message upon the out-of-band channel associated with the monitored port. Such an outbound message may contain patch panel/port information associated with the monitored patch panel port.",
        "Next, the port controller may check, at step S804, to determine whether an out-of-band message from another patch panel port controller is available for receipt. If the port controller determines, at step S806, that an out-of-band message is not available for receipt, the port controller checks, at step S808, the currently stored port status. If the port controller determines that the stored connection status indicates that the port is not connected, the process flow proceeds to S802 to again transmit an out-of-band channel outbound message containing patch panel/port information associated with the monitored patch panel port. If the port controller determines, at step S808, that the stored connection status indicates that the port status is \u201cconnected,\u201d the port controller may update, at step S810, a port-level data store to reflect the new port status as \u201cdisconnected\u201d and may generate and send to the patch panel controller a message notifying the panel controller of the disconnect. Upon receipt of the message from the port controller containing a new port status, the panel controller may store the port status information in a panel level information store and generate/transmit a status update to the NMS via the network. The process flow may then proceed to step S802.",
        "If the port controller determines, at step S806, that an out-of-band message is available for receipt, the port controller receives, at step S812, the out-of-band message. If the port controller determines, at step S814, that the port status is \u201cconnected\u201d and that the received patch panel/port information matches previously stored patch panel/port information, no update to the panel controller is generated and processing may proceed to step S802.",
        "However, if the port controller determines, at step S814, that the stored port status is \u201cdisconnected\u201d and/or that the received patch panel/port information does not match previously stored patch panel/port information, the port controller may conclude that a change in port connectivity status has occurred. Therefore, at step S816, the port controller may update the port level data store to reflect a port status of \u201cconnected\u201d and may send a message to the panel controller containing the new port status and the newly received patch panel/port connection information. The panel controller receives, at step S818, the update message and in response may update the panel-level information store to reflect the received connection status and port connectivity information and may generate and transmit an update message via the network to the NMS. The process flow may then proceed to step S802.",
        "FIG. 9 shows one embodiment of the present invention which is used for cross-connect systems wherein all patch cords are connected between patch panels in group 1 (group 1 ports) and patch panels in group 2 (group 2 ports). In this embodiment, there is a MAC chip associated with each port of each patch panel. Each system transmission on a 9th wire is from a group 1 port to a group 2 port. Each group 1 port continuously sends its MAC ID over its 9th wire. If such a signal is received at a group 2 port, the IDs of both the group 1 port and the group 2 port are sent to the NMS by the group 2 port. When receipt by the NMS is acknowledged, the group 2 port stops sending the message. If a group 2 port stops receiving the MAC ID signal from the group 1 port, it transmits its ID continuously to the NMS until receipt is acknowledged by the NMS. The NMS is therefore continuously updated. This documentation system does not require a data storage module in each patch panel. A central revision system which is a subsystem of the NMS also controls an LED associated with each port. The transmissions to each patch panel to control the LED's are on the same Ethernet system used for the documentation system.",

The revision system can guide the removal or the addition of a patch cord. Each patch panel port is provided with an LED.",

In the embodiment of FIG. 9, the patch cord 914 is a nine-wire patch cord. The revision system next causes MAC ID's of the first port 904 and the second port 912 to be sequentially and continuously sent to the revision system by port 912. A reviser unplugs the patch cord 914 from the second port 912, which is associated with the flashing LED 910. The revision system next causes only the MAC ID of the second port 912 to be continuously sent to the revision system until it receives the message. The revision system then turns off the LED 910 of the second port 912 and, after a time delay, also turns off the LED 908 of the first port 904.",
        "To guide the addition of a patch cord, the revision system lights both the first LED 908 and the second LED 910. When the patch cord connecting the first and second ports 904 and 912 is installed, both ID's are sent sequentially and continuously by port 912 to the revision system until the revision system receives the message and turns off both LED's.",
