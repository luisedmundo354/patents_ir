        "This application is a continuation-in-part of international application designating the U.S. Ser. No. PCT/US02/21346, filed 5 Jul. 2002.",
        "This invention relates to an ionomer and its use as an electrolyte or electrode component in a fuel cell, and particularly in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).",
        "Solid polymer electrolytes or films have been well known in the art for many years. These polymers are typically characterized by high ionic conductivity, herein defined as greater than 1\u00d710\u22126 S/cm. Such high conductivity values make them valuable where rapid transport of ionic species, for example, protons, is useful, for example in fuel cells. Additionally, it is desirable for such ionically conducting polymers to be made in the form of membranes or thin films. In so doing, the resistance to ionic transport, which is a function of the film thickness, can be reduced. These materials must also function in the temperature range of interest, which can vary from below room temperature up to a large fraction of the melting temperature of the polymer, depending on the application. Additionally, the polymer must be robust mechanically, so that it does not crack, either during installation in a fuel cell, or during use.",
        "The use of ionomers as solid polymer electrolytes in fuel cells is well known, having been developed in the 1960s for the US Gemini space program. Historically, the industry has moved from phenol sulfonic materials, which suffered from poor mechanical and chemical stability; to polystyrene sulfonic acid polymers, which have improved mechanical stability, but still suffer chemical degradation; to poly(trifluoro-styrene)sulfonic acid, which has improved chemical stability, but poor mechanical stability; to perfluorinated sulfonic acid materials (commercially available as NAFION\u00ae membranes), which has improved mechanical and chemical stability [e.g., see A. J. Appleby and F. R. Foulkes, Fuel Cell Handbook, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1989; Table 10-1, pg. 268].",
        "The perfluorinated sulfonic acid materials, for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat Nos. 3,282,875, 4,358,545 and 4,940,525, are still far from ideal ionomers. These materials must be hydrated to conduct protons at an acceptable rate. As a result, in dry conditions or at temperatures above 100 degrees C., they work poorly in hydrogen-oxygen or hydrogen-air fuel cells. Furthermore, these fluoropolymer ionomers are expensive to produce because of the inherently high cost of the fluorinated monomers required for their preparation. Finally, as more fully described below, they tend to have a high permeability to methanol, and therefore are inefficient electrolytes for use in direct methanol fuel cells.",
        "These limitations have led to the development of several classes of ionomers that are not substantially fluorinated, but rather are based upon aromatic or linear polymers. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,768 a polyelectrolyte membrane is prepared from a preswollen membrane containing an insoluable cross-linked aromatic polymer. Although these membranes have low ionic resistance, the controlled penetration of the functional groups during preparation can make preparation difficult. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,436, 6,025,085 and 6,099,988 the preparation and use of polybenzimidizole membranes as ionomers is disclosed. These polymers are described as particularly suitable for use at temperatures above 100 degrees C. U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,031 discloses a ionomer comprising a sulfonated polyethersulfone that is suitable for use in a fuel cell. Kono et. al. discloses in U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,254 a solid electrolyte having a reduced amount of non-cross-linked monomer that can be rapidly cured through exposure to active radiation and/or heat and has high conductivity. Finally, Wang et. al. have disclosed in WO 0225764 ionomers made by direct polymerization of sulfonated polysulfones or polyimide polymers.",
        "Other substantially non-fluorinated ionomers are those in the class of sulfonated Poly(aryl ether ketone)s. It is convenient to prepare sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s by post-sulfonation. However, post-sulfonation results in the placement of the sulfonic acid group ortho to the activated aromatic ether linkage, where the sulfonate groups are relatively easy to hydrolyze. Moreover, only one sulfonic acid per repeat unit can be achieved. To overcome this limitation, a new route was developed to prepare sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone)s with monomer containing sulfonate groups derived from sulfonating the dihalide monomer. Sulfonation of the dihalide monomer, 4,4\u2032-dihalobenzophenone and 4,4\u2032dihalodiphenylsulfone, results in sulfonic acid functionalization on both deactivated phenyl rings ortho to the halogen moiety, which offers them more chemical stability against desulfonation, and allows for two sulfonic acid groups per repeat unit of the resulting polymer. This approach displays other advantages, including being free from any degradation and cross-linking, and the ability to easily control the content of sulfonate groups by adjusting the ratios of the dihalide monomer to the sulfonated dihalide monomer.",
        "In order to prepare ion exchange membrane for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) with excellent combined physical chemical properties and of low cost, attempts have been made by utilizing sulfonated poly(aromatic ether sulfone) and sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone). These membranes can be made by two methods. One is direct sulfonation of polymers, as reported in Polym. V28, P1009 (1987) wherein direct sulfonation of poly(aromatic ether ketone) to prepare sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone) was reported. This method is straightforward, but decomposition and crosslinking also occurred. The degree of sulfonation is also difficult to control. In addition, the sulfonated group directly attached to bisphenol-A could cause sulfonated group be hydrolyzed and detached from the polymer structure after prolong service at high temperature. Another method is to prepare sulfonated monomers first, followed by polymerization afterwards. Macrom. Chem. Phy., (1997), P1421 (1998) reported this method. First, sulfonated difluoro-benzophenone was obtained by sulfonation of difluoro-benzophenone, then it was mixed with some difluoro-benzophenone and bisphenol-A, followed by a copolymerization into sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone). The polymer structure is characterized by the following structure:",
        "process does not induce decomposition or crosslinking side reactions and it could control degree of sulfonation. The sulfonic acid groups located on the aromatic ring structure derived from benzophenone are much more stable than the ones on bisphenol-A rings. However, because of the existence of methyl group in the polymer structure, its anti-oxidation property is reduced. Furthermore, as the content of sulfonated group increases, swelling in water becomes very severe.",
        "Recently, bisphenol A-based and phenolphthalein-based and 4,4\u2032-thiodiphenol-based sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s were prepared by another method. Generally, most homogeneous ionomers have the problem of large swelling degree at compositions where they have reasonable conductivity. So other components are blended with the polymer in order to obtain ionomer membranes with lower swelling.",
        "One issue with many of these polymers is that the ionic conductivity is not as high as desirable. A high ionic conductivity in an ionomer is desirable because the higher the ionic conductivity, the lower the cell resistance when the polymer is used as the electrolyte in a fuel cell. Because lower cell resistance leads to higher fuel cell efficiency, lower resistance (or high conductance) is better. One approach to reducing the resistance of these ionomers is to reduce its thickness, as the resistance is directly proportional to thickness. Unfortunately, these ionomers cannot be made too thin because as they become thinner, they become more susceptible to physical or chemical damage, either during cell assembly or cell operation. One approach to deal with this issue has been disclosed in RE 37,707, RE 37,756 and RE 37,701 where ultra-thin composite membranes comprising expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and an ion exchange material impregnated throughout the membrane are disclosed. Composite ionomer membranes are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,861.",
        "One further complication in the use of ionomers as solid polymer electrolytes in fuel cells is the need for the electrolyte to act as an impermeable barrier to the fuel. Should the fuel permeate through the electrolyte it reduces cell efficiency because the fuel that permeates through the electrolyte is either swept away into the outlet gas stream or chemically reacts on the oxidant side, giving rise to a mixed potential electrode. In either case, the fuel is not used for producing electricity. Furthermore, the fuel that permeates through the electrolyte may also poison the catalyst on the oxidizing side, further reducing the cell efficiency. This issue, called fuel crossover, is a particular problem when methanol is the fuel.",
        "Methanol crossover rates tend to be high in many solid polymer electrolytes because the methanol absorbs and permeates in the polymer in much the same way that water molecules do. Since many solid polymer electrolytes transport water easily, they also tend to transport methanol easily. One approach to reducing methanol crossover is to simply use thicker membranes because the methanol transport resistance (as defined below) increases with increasing thickness. This solution has limited utility, though, because as the thickness increases the ionic resistance of the membrane increases as well. Higher ionic resistance in the membrane is detrimental to fuel cell efficiency because it results in higher internal resistance and thus higher (iR) power losses. Therefore, the ideal membrane for direct methanol fuel cells would be one that has both very high methanol transport resistance and at the same time, has low ionic resistance. The combination of these two characteristics would allow the use of thinner membranes, leading to low iR power loss due to membrane resistance, while simultaneously minimizing the effect of methanol crossover.",
        "The use of various polymers has been suggested to circumvent this methanol crossover issue. In WO 96/13872 the use of polybenzimidazole is suggested for direct methanol fuel cells. In WO 98/22989, a polymer electrolyte membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSSA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is reported to have low methanol crossover. In WO 00/77874 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,294 sulfonated polyphosphazene-based polymers are proposed as suitable ionomers for direct methanol fuel cells. Finally, poly(arylene ether sulfone) has been reported to have low methanol permeability [Y. S. Kim, F. Wang, M. Hickner, T. A. Zawodinski, and J. E. McGrath, Abstract No. 182, The Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts, Vol. 2002-1, The Electrochemical Society, Pennington, N.J., 2002]. Despite these attempts, a need still exists for an ionomer with lower methanol crossover rates and acceptably high ionic conductivity.",
        "It is thus an object of this invention to satisfy the long-felt need for improved ionomers for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane and as an electrode component in fuel cells. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of forming a fuel cell using the inventive polymers. It is a further object of the invention to form a composite solid polymer electrolyte with improved properties comprising the inventive polymers and a support. It is yet another object of the invention to improve performance of a direct methanol fuel cell comprising the inventive polymers. Finally, it is also an object of the new invention to provide a fuel cell wherein the electrode comprises the inventive polymer.",

        "One important parameter used to characterize ionomers is the equivalent weight. Within this application, the equivalent weight (EW) is defined to be the weight of the polymer in acid form required to neutralize one equivalent of NaOH. Higher EW means that there are fewer active ionic species (e.g., protons) present. If it takes more of the polymer to neutralize one equivalent of hydroxyl ions there must be fewer active ionic species within the polymer. Because the ionic conductivity is generally proportional to the number of active ionic species in the polymer, one would therefore like to lower the EW in order to increase conductivity. The polymers disclosed herein can be prepared with a range of EWs between about 300 and greater than 4000, with preferable EW in the range of 400 to 1500. As is well known in the art, by varying the concentration of the reactants, different equivalent weight products can be formed. For example, in the exemplary embodiment where the sPPEK polymer is produced, Table 1 shows the concentrations of 4.4\u2032-dihalo(or dinitro)-3,3\u2032-disulfonate salt of benzophenone [Monomer 2 in Table 1] and dihalo(or dinitro)phenyl benzophenone [Monomer 1 in Table 1] one would use to produce various EW polymers using the procedures disclosed herein.

        "It has also been discovered by the inventors that the inventive polymers disclosed herein can be incorporated into various components of fuel cells to form highly desirable products. For example, the inventive polymers can be used as the solid polymer electrolytes in hydrogen-air or in a direct methanol fuel cell. Furthermore, they can be incorporated into a porous polymer substrate material to form thin, strong membranes as shown in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2, where substrate 20 and ionomer 21 form a composite membrane 22. Substrates 20 can include, but are not limited to porous polyolefins, including polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene. Polytetrafluoroethylene is a particularly desirable porous substrate because of its chemical inertness and high melting temperature. Various methods of forming porous polytetrafluoroethylene are known in the art. One particularly preferable porous polymer substrate is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,953,566, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Using the methods disclosed by Bahar et. al. in U.S. Pat. Nos.

This ink can then be applied directly onto a membrane or onto decal substrates that can transfer the catalyst layer onto the membrane via standard hot pressing techniques.",
        "Fuel cell electrodes containing the above ionomer can also be prepared using PTFE-bonded catalyzed gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architectures, in which the methanol transport resistant ionomer is used to impregnate (using brushing, casting, spraying, etc.) the PTFE-catalyst structure. Anodes and cathodes prepared using this ionomer are expected to improve the methanol crossover barrier characteristics of the MEA as well as the electrodic performance of the cell (when compared to NAFION\u00ae impregnated electrodes).",
        "Additionally, methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes can also be prepared with the ionomers. Such electrodes can increase the cell performance and voltage efficiency in a DMFC cell as the crossed-over methanol would not adversely affect the oxygen reduction activity of the air electrode. The high methanol permeation resistance of this polymer makes it suitable and advantageous for its selective incorporation as electrode ionomer for DMFC cathode thus yielding an air electrode with methanol tolerant/insensitive characteristics. When the ionomers used in this patent are present in high enough ionomer/metal ratios to effectively block/cover the Pt catalyst, then it is expected that the cathode cell will exhibit large methanol insensitivity due to the high methanol permeation resistance of this polymer.",
        "Methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes can be prepared by pre-treating the electrocatalyst prior to electrode/ink making with a solution of the above polymer. The pre-treatment could consist of effective mixing and contacting of the ionomer solution and the catalyst phases and posterior evaporation of the solvent, thus resulting in a Pt catalyst phase effectively covered with a \u201cskin\u201d of the methanol permeation resistant ionomer. This pre-treated catalyst can be used to make cathode electrodes of diverse architectures using methods known in the art, including inking, gas diffusion electrodes, etc.",
        "Another approach to prepare methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes would consist on preparing an ink with the above ionomer, solvent and catalyst but using high ionomer/metal ratio. The resulting dry-ink electrode would have the Pt phase effectively \u201cblocked\u201d by the methanol permeation resistant ionomer.",
        "Finally a methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes with PTFE-bonded catalyzed GDE architecture can be prepared by dipping the GDE into a solution of the above ionomer. The ionomer will then totally impregnate and saturate the structure thus totally and effectively covering the Pt phase.",

        "A membrane sample about 2 inches by about 3 inches in size was first equilibrated at room conditions of 21 degrees C., 55% RH for 24 hrs. It was then immersed into a plastic beaker containing room temperature deionized water. Two measurements were taken over a 2 hours time period: the first one after 30 minutes and the second one at 2 hours. To take the measurements the membrane sample was taken out of the water and patted dry by paper tissues. The thickness was then measured immediately using an MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display. The gauge was mounted vertically over a flat plate, and measurements were made at eight different locations on the sample, covering the corners and center of the sample. The spring-loaded probe of the gauge was lowered gently on the film for each measurement to minimize compression. The mean of the eight values was used as the sample thickness. The ionic resistance of the membrane 10 was then measured using a four-point probe conductivity cell shown in FIG. 5. The sensing probes 55 of conductivity cell 50 are approximately one inch long, and approximately one inch apart. A plexiglass spacer 51 provides insulation between the current probes 54 and sensing probes 55. The cell is held together with nylon screws 52 and electrical contact is made to the probes through holes 53. During the measurement, a 900 g weight (not shown) was loaded onto the cell to ensure good contact. It was found that the resistance value is independent of further pressure onto conductivity cell 50. The resistance was measured by connecting leads (not shown) through holes 53 using 10 mV AC amplitude at 1000 Hz frequency applied by a Solartron SI 1280B controlled by ZPlot software written by Scribner Associates. Measurements were taken in the potentiostatic mode. Under these conditions, the phase angle was found to be insignificant throughout the measurement.

The membrane sample 61 was mounted between two pre-cut 1-mil polyethylenenapthalene (PEN) gaskets 62. The gaskets were cut in order to leave an opened window of 3-cm\u00d73.5-cm corresponding to a testing area of 10.5 cm2.

A 2M methanol feed solution was introduced into the testing fixture in inlet channel 63 at a flow rate of 5 ml/min while DI water was introduced into the testing fixture in inlet channel 65 at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The testing fixture was tilted a few times to assure that no air bubbles were trapped into the flow channels and was then placed tilted, outlet end up, in a water bath set at 60 degrees C. Both the methanol feed solution and the water flush were fed through the testing fixture for a minimum of an hour to allow equilibration and to reach a steady state permeation rate of methanol through the tested samples. During this 1 hour of equilibration time, the methanol solution exited the testing fixture through outlet channel 64 while the water flush exited the testing fixture through outlet channel 66. Both methanol and water effluents were discarded during the equilibration time.",

        "To characterize the utility of the inventive polymer when used as a solid polymer electrolyte, the assembled fuel cell fixture of Example 4A was connected to a fuel cell testing plant for cell diagnostics. The fuel cell testing plant consisted of an electronic load, a gas control unit, methanol injection setup and ancillary equipment (condenser, gas line heat tracing, etc.) The electronic load was a Scribner & Assoc. (VA) 10 A model 890B-100 and was used for fuel cell mode H2/air and methanol/air polarization analysis. The electronic load box also contained standard temperature controllers for the cell and the reactant humidifiers. The load interfaced with a PC running Scribner & Assoc. fuel cell software (version 3.1a) for data acquisition and analysis.",
        "The basic gas unit was made by Globetech (TX) and after \u201cin house\u201d modifications consisted of 3 liter reactant humidifier bottles for H2 and air, both with independent temperature control. The station also had mass flow controllers and back-pressure regulators for the gaseous reactants. The gas feeds could also be delivered humidified or dry to the cell via a 3 way valve manifold. The cell is connected to this gas unit with its feeds heat traced and temperature controlled.",
        "The methanol injection was done via a secondary manifold to the anode cell feed. The apparatus consists of a methanol solution reservoir (1 liter 3-head Pyrex flask) in which a N2 blanket was continuously bubbled, a 2-syringe injection-withdrawn pump (Kd Scientific, model 210 C) with flow control, and a 100 cc accumulation volume (to avoid flow fluctuations) placed in the injection manifold right before the cell. The injection setup could be isolated from the cell via an array of on/off valves that allowed the switching from H2 to methanol solution as the anode fuel.",
        "Once the fuel cell fixture was hooked up to the test station, the cell temperature was then set to 60 degrees C., the anode and cathode bottles were set to 70 degrees C. and 65 degrees C., respectively. The back-pressure was kept at 0 psig on both sides, and the heat-traces on the gas lines were set to 75 and 70 degrees C. for anode and cathode respectively. The hydrogen fuel was then supplied to the anode at a flow rate of 100 ml/min and the air was supplied at the cathode at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. Once the cell temperature had reached the set value, the cell was allowed to condition for a minimum of 6 hours. During this conditioning time, the cell potential was potentiostatically cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V, and 0.8V in 0.2V potential step increments. As is generally practiced in the art, voltages are versus the hydrogen dynamic electrode, i.e., flowing hydrogen gas at the anode with no separate reference electrode used. The cell was maintained at each step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. At the end of the fuel cell potential cycling, the anode reactant and cathode reactant minimum flow rates were dropped to 20 ml/min and 40 ml/min, respectively, to allow for flow to track the load (i.e., stoichiometric control). The cell was then operated under constant stoichiometry using 1.2\u00d7 stoichiometry on the anode, and at 2.5\u00d7 stoichiometry on the cathode. Stoichiometric flow is defined as gas flow at any given current density such that the gas would be completely consumed in the fuel cell reaction. The fuel cell was again cycled at least twice between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to reach steady state under stoichiometric control mode. Finally, a polarization curve was obtained by recording the steady state current after 5 to 10 minutes following sequential voltages. The step increment was 0.1 V for the comparative examples, and 0.05V for the inventive example. The polarization curve was started from 0.6V and potential steps were first taken towards lower voltages; then the cell was taken back to 0.6V to equilibrate and the potential steps were taken towards open circuit voltage. The open circuit voltage (OCV) is defined as the maximum voltage obtained from the trace of OCV versus time after the load is removed from the cell. Additionally, at each potential the cell resistance was measured by using a standard current interrupt technique available through the Scribner Version 3.1a (Firmware Version 1.43) software used to control the system.",
        "Once the polarization curve was completed, the fuel cell was shutdown for the night and the cell, humidification bottles and heat trace temperatures were dropped down to room temperature. The fuel cell was re-started the next day according to the same start-up protocol described above. The cell potential was again cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to condition the fuel cell. If the cell performance was comparable to that of the first day, a second polarization curve was recorded to confirm the performance. If the cell performance was better on the second day than the first day, then the cell was cycled for a minimum of four more hours and a polarization curve was obtained at the end of this conditioning period. The polarization curves obtained on the second day were used for MEA comparison and are reported in FIG. 7.",
        "The fuel cell was then switched from hydrogen/air mode to methanol/air mode (direct methanol fuel cell or DMFC mode). The anode side of the fuel cell was first flushed with nitrogen and then a 1M-methanol solution was pumped at 1 ml/min to the anode side using a Kd Scientific injection-withdrawn pump. The cathode was switched to dry air and set at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The fuel cell was cycled between 0.3V, 0.1V and 0.6 V in 0.3 V potential steps to condition the MEA. The fuel cell was maintained at each potential step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. After cycling the cell in DMFC mode for a minimum of 3 hours, a DMFC polarization curve was recorded in a similar fashion as reported before.

In methanol-air (FIG. 7), the performance of the inventive solid polymer electrolyte is superior to both comparative examples at all potentials. At 0.3V, the current density of the MEA prepared with the inventive polymer is 80 mA/cm2 while the current density of the NAFION 112 and the NAFION 117 based MEAs are 50 mA/cm2 and 61 mA/cm2, respectively: a 60% and 31% performance improvement over NAFION\u00ae 112 and NAFION\u00ae 117 MEAs, respectively. Also, the measured open circuit potential of 0.704 V for the inventive solid polymer electrolyte of Example 3 is higher than either comparative example A, 0.683 V, or Comparative Example B, 0.645, indicative of improved performance.",

The fuel cell was again cycled at least twice between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to reach steady state under stoichiometry controlled mode. Finally, a polarization curve was obtained by recording the steady state current after 5 to 10 minutes following sequential voltages. The polarization curve was started from 0.6V and potential steps were first taken towards lower voltages; then the cell was taken back to 0.6V and the potential steps were taken towards open circuit voltage.

        "Membranes were prepared by spraying a thin coat of a diluted solution of the inventive polymer on GORE-SELECT\u2122 membranes to reduce hydrogen crossover of these membranes.",
        "Precisely, a 3.4% solids dimethyl sulfoxide solution using the inventive polymer was prepared. The solution was prepared by dissolving pellets of the inventive polymer (in the sodium form) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 160 g of DMSO was poured in a 3-neck flask. The solvent was agitated by a magnetic stirrer and the flask was kept under dry nitrogen, 26 g of the inventive polymer pellets was then added to the flask to prepare a 14% solids solution in DMSO. The content of the flask was heated to 90 degrees C. for about 4 hours then cooled down overnight and finally heated at 90 degrees C. for an additional 4 hours the next day. The resulting ionomer solution contained 14% solids.",
        "5.5 g of the so-prepared solution was then further diluted to 3.4% solids. 13.5 g of DMSO was added to the 5.5 g of solution and mixed with a mechanical stirrer for about 1 hour.",
        "A 35-micron thick GORE-SELECT\u2122 membrane (from W. L. Gore & Associates) was place in a wooden embroidery hoop for mechanical restraint. The 3.4% solution of the inventive polymer was then sprayed on one side of the membrane with a spray gun 3 passes were applied in order to obtain a continuous and uniform film of the inventive polymer electrolyte on the GORE-SELECT\u2122 membrane.",
        "The membrane, still on the wooded embroidery hoop, was placed in a vacuum oven at 100 degrees C. with a vacuum pressure of about 6 in of Hg. After 6 hours in the oven, the membrane was removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. The inventive polymer electrolyte layer was estimated to about 1.6 micron thick and was uniform.",
