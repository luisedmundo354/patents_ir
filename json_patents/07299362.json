        "The present invention relates to content protection and copy management used in broadcasting, content distribution, Video-On-Demand, especially to such applications where the protected content is delivered, and transferred between devices which can consume the content and save the content in a storage in a secure manner.",
        "Contents will be available easily to consumers as digital technology and media processing power become more and more advanced. Not like analogue media, digital media almost has unlimited number of copies with good quality. Thus as content owner, or content operator they will have much concern about the dangerous if content is not protected well.",
        "Digital TV (DTV) broadcasting has been widely deployed in the world. So far there is not much concern about the content protection and security. However as new generation DTV-STB (Set-Top-Box) that has local hard disk and digital interface like IEEE 1394, etc. is launched, content association, movie industries, and media owners are starting to worry about the content protection and copy management. Before having a complete and very secured DTV-STB, a secured content delivery and transferring mechanism, as well as a secured transmission channel, they would not allow to release contents to such applications. Therefore many parties in the world including standard bodies like MPEG, DVB, TVAnytime, content companies, CE (Consumer Electronics) manufacturers, as well as security technology providers, etc., are gathering together to work on a both interoperable and secure end-to-end solution to the content protection and copy management in such application scenario.",
        "Content distribution and video-on-demand is also becoming more and more demanding as multimedia data and contents can reach to anywhere and anytime. User is happy with the convenience and flexibility, and they can enjoy entertainment easily and efficiently.",
        "On the other hand, content owners are trying to meet the customer's needs but at the same time they also worry about the illegal usage of their property. There is a balance between two sides.",
        "In MPEG standardisation group, people are working towards to standardise an IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) system that involves compliant terminal. All the terminals can play back a protected content that is encrypted and protected by following the same IPMP standard, no matter what kinds of IPMP tools they use.",
        "DVB consortium has also issued Call for Proposal for CPCM (Content Protection and Copy Management), to mainly focus on content delivery from operator to receiver and content transferring from one DVB-CPCM device to another in a both secure and interoperable manner.",
        "The current DVB receiver as a DVB device cannot fulfil the both secure and interoperable requirement, especially for content transferring between DVB receiver and other storage devices like PVR, etc., which has not addressed before.",

CPCM Control Information and CPCM Stream are defined in to provide specification for both operator and manufacturer to follow to have world-wide inter-operability, it includes CPCM Tool List, Rights Holder, and Tool Container. In specifying a compliant CPCM Device, a Baseline DVB-CPCM is invented including CPCM Manager, Tools Box, Rights Management, Message Router, and CAS-CPCM converter, to fulfil most of the functions for content protection and copy management",

Then, all the devices having IP address \u201cseno.drl.mei.co.jp\u201d can be authorized to perform one of reproduction and copy of the contracted content. Note that a domain specifies a logical unit of a connection between the devices, which are not necessary in the form of a network.",
        "The basic structure of the invention is first explained.",
        "(1) On the Content Provider or Operator Side in a CPCM Environment:",
        "1. Content is encoded using existing coding technology like MPEG-2 or MPEG4, and encrypted using existing and defined encryption tools like DES or AES. Watermarks for copy control maybe embedded in the content before the encoding. The encryption key is encrypted again using pre-defined encryption tool, to result in an encrypted encryption key and the license key that is used to encrypt the encryption key.\n    2. At the same time, the ContentID is generated.\n    3. CPCM Tools List indicated by ToolID is also formed based on what tool is used to protecting the content.\n    4. CPCM Rights Holder contains usage rights and rules specified by content owner. These usage rights and rules can be made specific to each piece of content (by using of ContentID), or each program under one content (by using of programNumber in MPEG2 system), or even each elementary stream under one program (by using elementary_PID in MPEG2 system). The above-mentioned license key can be carried in CPCM Rights Holder, or it can be delivered to CPCM devices via some secure means, a return channel or smart card.\n    5. CPCM Control Graph is created if necessary according to the detail protection and usage rules applied to different control point;\n    6. CPCM Tool Container is formed by carrying necessary CPCM Tool in a protected format;\n    7. CPCM Stream is created to hold the above-mentioned encrypted encryption key and any other control information for protection, such as time stamps, tool configuration messages, etc.",
        "All the above CPCM information is carried in PSI in MPEG-2 system standard, and it is called CPCM Control Information.",
        "(2) On the Content Receiver Side in the Same CPCM Environment:",
        "A protected content is delivered to a compliant CPCM Device, and Baseline DVB-CPCM unit will function by activating its sub modules:\n\n    1. Rights Management module will retrieve CPCM Rights Holder information. Usage rules and states associated with the content are parsed. These include usage rights of each program, elementary stream, copy information on whether or not the content (or a program) can be transferred between CPCM devices in the same authorized domain. If the license key is carried in CPCM Rights Holder, it is also retrieved after the Rights Management module makes sure that this device has the right to access a particular content or program. If not, the license key is obtained elsewhere through a secure means, maybe a smart card.\n    2. CPCM Manager module will retrieve CPCM Tool List and call up the tool indicated by ToolID in the list if there is such tool in Tools Box of Baseline DVB-CPCM. If there is no such tool in the case of a new tool or upgraded tool, missing tool downloading or retrieving will be conducted in three ways: sending ToolRequest to another CPCM Device; retrieving tools from the content (if there is tools carried in Tool Container Descriptor); remotely retrieving missing tool from a URL site. The newly obtained tool will be used as proprietary CPCM tools (plug-ins).\n    3. In the case of playback only, the license key stored in buffer of Baseline DVB-CPCM will be called to decrypt the encrypted encryption key in the CPCM Stream. The reconstructed key will be used to decrypt the encrypted content one unit by one unit synchronously, to play back the protected content without content storing.\n    4. In the case of storing content on the top of playback, Usage rules and rights carried in the CPCM Rights Holder will be further retrieved and verified to see whether there is copy right for this program or content. In the case of broadcasting, program number like ProgramNumber is used to identify the usage right applied to which program, while in the case of content distribution, ContentID will be used to identify the usage right applied to which content.",
        "After usage rule verification performed, the protected content will be played back in the same way as indicated in the above-mentioned playback case. At the same time the encrypted content will be saved in the storage of a CPCM device, together with CPCM information (CPCM Tool List, CPCM Rights Holder, CPCM Control Graph, CPCM Tool Container, and CPCM Stream where the encryption key is not encrypted).",
        "(3) Protected Content Transferring Between Two Compliant CPCM Devices:",
        "It is assumed that the protected content stored in CPCM Device A, together with CPCM Control Information. CPCM Device B is owned by the same user and considered to be in the same authorized domain.",
        "In the case of content distribution, the same CPCM_DomainID corresponding to one registered user has been issued as a certificate and registered to all user's CPCM devices when he makes subscription via a return channel, smart card, or other means.",
        "This CPCM_DomainID as a certificate is securely transmitted, delivered, and registered into user's CPCM devices, or it is registered into user's CPCM devices via a plug-in smart card. This CPCM_DomainID registered in Baseline DVB-CPCM of user's CPCM devices is used as Hardware's identifier or authorized domain identifier.",
        "A password assigned by the service operator may be used in this registration process. All the bill for pay-per-view or content purchase will be charged to users based on their own CPCM_DomainID and the password. All his registered CPCM devices are considered to be in the authorized domain with the same certificate of CPCM_DomainID.",
        "Within the same domain, each of the CPCM Devices is also assigned a CPCM_DeviceID to identify itself and to be used as address for messages sending and receiving between two CPCM devices. Each CPCM device will also have a key generation module to generate a pair of public key and private key to use to encrypt and decrypt the encryption keys in CPCM Stream.",
        "When CPCM Device B wants to obtain a protected content/program which is stored in the CPCM Device A, it will send a ContentRequest message to the device A, together with:\n\n    a) the ContentID/ProgramNumber of the requested content/program;\n    b) CPCM_DomainID in the device B;\n    c) the public key\u2014PublicKey on-line generated by (or previously embedded in) Baseline DVB-CPCM of the device B;\n    d) the CPCM_DeviceID of the device B;",
        "The Baseline DVB-CPCM of device A receives the ContentRequest messages with the CPCM_DomainID and the PublicKey, and it will verify:\n\n    a) whether device B is in the authorized domain. It is done by either doing a mutual authentication with Device B using certificates through mutual authentication messages, or simply by checking the received CPCM_DomainID against with its, own CPCM_DomainID;\n    b) whether there is such content/program with the ContentID/ProgramNumber (programNumber is used in broadcasting case);\n    c) Whether there is such copy right for the requested content/program by calling the Rights Management Module to check the usage rules carried in CPCM Rights Holder.\n    d) If the above-mentioned three steps are passed through, the encryption key carried by CPCM Stream which is stored in the device A, is encrypted by the received PublicKey and re-form a CPCM Stream attached to the protected content;\n    e) Finally the requested content will be transferred from the device A to the device B together with the CPCM information where some CPCM information may be changed;\n    f) If Copy right is Copy Once in the CPCM Rights Holder, then Copy Once will be changed into Copy No More;\n    g) If the copy right information is carried in video embedded by watermarking, then a watermarking extracting tool will be called up from Tools Box to extract the copy right information. In this case if the copy right is Copy Once, then a watermarking embedding tool will be called up to embed Copy No More to the same video content;\n\n(4) CPCM Tool Transferring Between Two Compliant CPCM Devices:",
        "It is assumed that CPCM Tools are stored in the module of Tools Box of Baseline DVB-CPCM in the CPCM Device A.",
        "CPCM Device B receives a protected content and retrieves CPCM Tool List But when it is found that the tool required with ToolID is missing or cannot be found from the Tools Box of Baseline DVB-CPCM in the device B, the device B will send ToolRequest messages to the device A to request such tool, and the messages include:\n\n    a) the CPCM_DomainID of the device B;\n    b) the ToolID of the requested tool;\n    c) the CPCM_DeviceID of the device B;",
        "CPCM Rights Management module in the device A receives the ToolRequest messages with the CPCM_DomainID and the ToolID, and it will verify:\n\n    a) whether device B is in the authorized domain. It is done by either doing a mutual authentication with Device B using certificates through mutual authentication messages, or simply by checking the received CPCM_DomainID against with its own CPCM_DomainID;\n    b) whether there is such tool with the ToolID, by looking up the tool table list stored in the local memory such as RAM which is inside the Baseline DVB-CPCM of the device A;\n    c) whether it is allowed for the tool to be transferred to another device even in the authorized domain, according to the transferring status for the requested tool;\n    d) If the above-mentioned three steps are passed through, the requested tool will be transferred from the device A to the device B together with its transferring status;",
        "A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 shows the prior art for the current typical DTV system, and DVB-STB with a private CA system is shown as the receiver here as an example.",
        "In unit 1.0 Content Owner issues content to different operators with certain basic and common usage rules for the content;",
        "In unit 1.1 Operator A creates protected content using its tool and format although MPEG-2 standard is used here for audio, video and system encoding. The format of usage rules, the protection mechanism including protection tools used here, is based on a proprietary specification A. So a CA module in unit 1.2 based on such specification B has to be used to attach to the DVB-STB 1, in order to be able to receive and interpret in unit 1.3, and consume the protected content in unit 1.4.",
        "The same way is applied to Operator B and DVB-STB 2.",
        "In unit 1.5 Operator B creates protected content using its tool and format although MPEG-2 standard is used here for audio, video and system encoding. The format of usage rules, the protection mechanism including protection tools used here, is based on a proprietary specification B. So a CA module in unit 1.6 based on such specification B has to be used to attach to the DVB-STB 2, in order to be able to receive and interpret in unit 1.7, and consume the protected content in unit 1.8.",
        "The same way is applied to Operator C and DVB-STB 3.",
        "In unit 1.9 Operator B creates protected content using its tool and format although MPEG-2 standard is used here for audio, video and system encoding. The format of usage rules, the protection mechanism including protection tools used here, is based on a proprietary specification C. So a CA module in unit 1.10 based on such specification C has to be used to attach to the DVB-STB 3, in order to be able to receive and interpret in unit 1.11, and consume the protected content in unit 1.12.",
        "It is shown from the above mentioned situation, if DVB-STB 1 wants to receive and consume contents delivered by Operator B and C besides Operator A, user of DVB-STB 1 has to buy more than one CA systems which may cause much more than what user is not willing to pay.",
        "On the other hand it is also not possible for such DVB-STB to fulfil secure content storing and secure content transferring between different devices by carrying the same usage rules.",
        "Furthermore there is no any compatibility among all the existing CA systems, so that the cost for having the same DVB-STB be able to receive and consume contents from as many as operators would be very large to consumers. As new generation DVB-STB would have local storage embedded in the STB to not only receive but also store received content. Besides that, content transferring between such devices including Personal Video Recorder (PVR) would become demanding. So it is necessary to define a new DVB device to realise both interoperable and secure content delivery and transferring from end to end and also between such devices.",
        "End-to-End Solution",
        "Based on this invention, a future compliant DVB CPCM STB will contain a Baseline DVB-CPCM Module that is pre-implemented or embedded in a DVB STB, shown as in FIG. 2.",
        "An end to end solution based on DVB CPCM STB with the invented Baseline DVB-CPCM is illustrated in FIG. 2. The Baseline DVB-CPCM is specified, including its sub-function modules, CPCM Manager, Tools Box, Rights Management Module (Usage States & Rules Parser), CAS-CPCM Converter between a private CAS (ECM & EMM) and CPCM Usage States & Rules, as well as Message Router which transmits all necessary messages.",
        "FIG. 3, the structure of MPEG-2 content protected by CPCM system is shown.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3 a CPCM protected content will contain CPCM Control Information including CPCM Tool List, CPCM Right Holder and CPCM Tool Container, as well as CPCM Stream. CPCM Control Information is carried in PSI (Program Service Information) in MPEG-2 system, while CPCM Stream is carried as a specific elementary stream.",
        "There are two possible Use Cases for the above DVB CPCM STB.",
        "1) In the Case Content is Protected and Managed by the Standardized DVB CPCM System:",
        "Content will be encoded and encrypted with certain usage rules, and distributed/transmitted with other usage information that depends on user subscription, to DVB CPCM STB.",
        "Here since all elements, like encryption tool, and usage rules encoding, are based on the CPCM system, so Baseline DVB-CPCM, which is embedded in the STB will call up the decryption tool in the Tools Box, parse the usage rules by Rights Management Module, and then process the protected content.",
        "The encryption key is encrypted again and carried in a CPCM Stream. The key used to encrypt the encryption key, i.e., license key is either carried in Rights Holder, or made known to the DVB CPCM STB in some secure way, either via smart card, or via a return channel like modem line.",
        "Rights Management module in the invented Baseline DVB-CPCM of a complaint CPCM device will act for the following functions, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.",
        "In the FIG. 4 for the case of broadcasting, the protected content with its CPCM information is passed to Rights Management (RM) module in the unit 1, and CPCM Rights Holder will be retrieved in this module. Usage Rules and possibly the license key are carried in the CPCM Rights Holder.",
        "In the first step in the unit 2 as shown in FIG. 4, RM checks the content carried in CPCM Rights Holder against the CPCM_DomainID which user is entitled to receive and has registered into users.

        "In the next step, the RM will check user's request or preference between Play or Play & Copy in unit 5.\n\n    \n    \n        In the case of \u201cPlay only\u201d requested by user, the retrieved License Key in unit 4 will be passed to unit 8 for decrypting the encrypted encryption key. The following step is to de-scramble the protected content in unit 9 and playback the content in unit 10.\n        In the case of Play & Copy request by user, the RM will retrieve the Usage Rules in unit 6 to verify whether there is copy right to save the current content (or program in broadcasting case) in the storage in the complaint CPCM device.\n        \n            If the above result is negative, then the RM will generate an output message saying: Copy/Move is prohibited, as shown in unit 7.\n            If the above result is positive, then the retrieved License Key in unit 4 will be passed to unit 8 for decrypting the encrypted encryption key. The following step is to de-scramble the protected content in unit 9 and playback the content in unit 10.
