        "The invention relates to new photochromic monomers, new photochromic polymers, and methods of obtaining them to create new information technologies, photocontrolled electroluminescent and electroconductive devices including displays and photoswitched polymer light diodes.",
        "2. Description of the Background",
        "Flexible and relief displays and light emitting diodes that use organic electroluminescent and electroconductive polymers and polyazomethines or condensation nitrogen containing heterochain polymers have been developed.",
        "A drawback of such polymer materials is that their electroluminescence and electroconductivity are not controlled by light. However, new properties of these polymers expand their functions in the field of photonics.",
        "The present invention provides photochromic electroluminescent and electroconductive polymers, the properties of which become reversibly photocontrollable due to the introduction of photochromic fragments into their structure. Consequently, such polymers have expanded functional possibilities.",
        "Photochromic polymers of this type are suitable for use in the development of photochromic materials for various fields of photonics (\u201cApplied Photochromic Polymer Systems.\u201d McArdle C. B., Ed. Blackie, Glasgow, 1992; Barachevsky V. A. \u201cPhotochromic organic media: state-of-the-art and future.\u201d Proc. SPIE, vol. 2968, 77-86, 1997). Use of the proposed electroconductive and electroluminescent polymers with photochromic fragments opens the prospects for development of a different type of display with double photo- and electrocontrol.",
        "Thermally irreversible photochromic conversions, which are characteristic for compounds of the class of dihetarylethenes, are successfully used to create photochromic registering mediums providing for the development of a three-dimensional bitwise operative optical memory (M. Irie \u201cDihetarylethenes for Memories and Switches,\u201d Chem. Reviews, vol. 100, 1685-1716, 2000). The inclusion of photochromic fragments into a polymer chain makes it possible to improve developed photochromic registering media due to an increase of the concentration of photochromic molecules in a polymer medium and a sharp reduction of their diffusion displacement. The result of such an improvement is a substantial increase in the information capacity. The absence of mutual thermal conversion of the two forms of dihetarylethene molecules used as photochromic fragments of polymers expands the field of use of reversive photochromic radiation photoswitches (J. A. Delaire, K. Nakatani \u201cLinear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Photochromic Molecules and Materials,\u201d Chem. Reviews, vol., 100, 1817-1845, 2000).",
