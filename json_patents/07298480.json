    "description": [
        "The invention concerns a broadband ellipsometer/polarimeter system and a method of polarimetric measurement of Mueller matrices.",
        "Ellipsometry is a non-destructive characterization technique that measures the change in polarization state of light reflected (or transmitted) by a sample.",
        "The present ellipsometric/polarimetric system contains an excitation section emitting a light beam. Said light beam passes through a polarisation state generator (PSG) and is focused on the sample. After being transmitted, reflected or scattered by the sample, the beam goes through an analysis section containing a polarisation state analyser (PSA) and a detection means.",
        "Such PSG and PSA (which is also called PSD (polarisation state detector)) are described in the document US2004130717.",
        "In a PSG, the light polarization can be modulated by a variety of devices such as discrete components inserted and then removed from the light path {Bickel W. S. et al.; Am. J. Phys 53 (1984) 468}, rotating retardation plates {Goldstein D. H.; Appl. Opt. 31 (1992) 6676}, rotating compensators {Collins R. W. and Koh J.; J. Opt. Soc. A 16, (1999) 1997}, Pockels cells {Delplancke F.; Appl. Opt. 36 (1997) 5388 and Compain E. and Dr\u00e9villon B.; Rev. Sci. Instrum. 68 (1997) 2671} or photoacoustic modulators {Compain E. and Dr\u00e9villon B.; Rev. Sci. Instrum. 69, (1998) 1574}.",
        "For PSA, one can use the same devices and a single detector, or a \u201cparallel\u201d analysis of light polarization through polarization-sensitive beamsplitters and simultaneous measurement of the separated beams by several detectors {Azzam R. M. A., Opt. Acta 29 (1982) 685, Brudzewski K.; J. Modern Optics 38 (1991) 889, Khrishnan S.; J. Opt. Soc. Am A 9 (1992) 1615, Compain E. et al., Thin Solid Films 313 (1998)}.",
        "The optical set-up is completed with appropriate optics to collimate the beam into the PSG and into the PSA, and to focus the beam onto the sample surface and on the detector. The PSG generates a set of four independent states of polarization, which after being transformed by the sample, are projected over the PSA to be analyzed. The PSA produces a set of four independent optical configurations to analyze the polarization of the light emerging from the sample for each state that was previously created by the PSG. As a result, a complete measurement run yields a set of 16 independent values that eventually, allows the calculation of the sample Mueller matrix or ellipsometric angles.",
        "To date, several ellipsometers/polarimeters have been described, most of them working in the ultraviolet\u2014visible (UV-VIS) wavelength range (250 to 900 nm) and only a small number working in the mid infrared (IR) (4 to 20 microns) or in the far ultraviolet (FUV) (140 nm-250 nm). This fact can be roughly explained because typically optical elements perform better in the UV-VIS than in the IR of the FUV and also because even though the visible spectral range is relatively narrow, it appears to be sufficient for some applications. However, there is an increasing interest in expanding the measured spectra because FUV and IR have particular advantages. The IR gives unique information about the chemical bonding within a sample, which is inaccessible to the sole UV-VIS. Moreover, because of its longer wavelengths, the IR, is less sensitive than the UV-VIS to surface structures (roughness, inhomogeneity among others). It is also better suited to the analysis of thick films (>several microns) that usually make the interpretation of conventional measurements difficult. On the other hand, the shortness of the FUV wavelengths make it ideal to measure the thickness of very thin films (<a few nm), in addition, the enhanced sensitivity of FUV to small defects and structures in the surface of samples is used for surface state quality control. Finally, it is of general agreement that the wider the measured spectral range, the better is the reliability of the final results.",
        "The preceding arguments prove the necessity for an apparatus providing ellipsometric/polarimetric measurements in spectral ranges as wide as possible. Two particular interesting ranges are the IR range from 4 to 20 microns, and the FUV-NIR from 140 nm to 2 microns.",
        "Briefly, the disclosed apparatus uses polarizers and retarders to create and to analyze the polarization state of a radiation beam. This apparatus is operated by placing the retarders at a set of 16 different orientations with respect to the polarizers, which are kept still.",
        "In order to work in optimal conditions over all the measured spectral range, the polarizers and the retarders used in the instrument must be as much achromatic as possible. The operation mode of the disclosed ellipsometer/polarimeter system imposes an additional constraint to the design of the retarders. They must not deviate the beam even when they are rotated about an axis defined by the direction of the beam. Even if substantially achromatic polarizers can eventually be found commercially this is not always the case for substantially achromatic retarders.",
        "An article of Benett et al. {Appl. Opt., (1970)}, has been used as a reference to select the most adapted types and characteristics of the retarders to be used in the disclosed ellipsometer/polarimeter system. In said article, Bennett et al., compare the optical performances of low order, zero order and total internal reflection (TIR) based retarders. The conclusion is that, even though TIR retarders are more sensitive to the beam alignment and aperture than the low order and zero order plates, they seem to be the optimum choice to be integrated into wide range spectroscopic systems because of their enhanced achromatism.",
        "Concerning achromatic retarders, an article of Oxley {Phil. Mag., (1911)} has been considered because it gives some insight on the manufacture of two types of TIR based quarter wave retarders that do not deviate the beam when they are rotated. One of them is a V-shaped retarder made of two Fresnel rhombs, called bi-prism. The bi-prism geometry has become popular because of the easiness of construction and high achromaticity.",
        "A patent of Thomson et al. {U.S. Pat. No 5,706,212}, describes an infrared ellipsometer/polarimeter system using pseudo-achromatic retarders. Each one of said retarders consists of a bi-prism cut to a given angle in order to create a total retardation of \u00be\u03bb. In a preferred embodiment, the ellipsometer has two retarders located respectivelly before and after the sample. During current operation of the ellipsometer/polarimeter, each retarder is rotated to a minimum of nine 9 azimuthal angle settings leading to at least eighty one 81 different raw data acquisitions. These acquisitions are then decomposed in terms of a double discrete Fourier series. From the coefficients of the said Fourier series, it is possible to calculate the characteristic Mueller matrix of the sample and of the optical components of the ellipsometer/polarimeter.",
        "One aim of the present invention consists to provide an ellipsometer/polarimeter system allowing simpler data analysis with less parameters for the calculation of the Mueller matrix, and without a signal processing based on a series expansion, such as a Fourier series. As a result, the time needed for measurements and data treatment are then reduced.",
        "Another aim of the invention is to provide a ellipsometer/polarimeter system comprising substantially achromatic retarders with optimized retardation to guarantee a uniform quality of the measurements for all the wavelengths in the light beam, and an optimization of the system performance by minimizing the propagation of noise and errors in the calculation of the Mueller matrix.",
        "To this end, the invention concerns a broadband ellipsometer/polarimeter system for analysing a sample comprising:\n\n    \n    \n        an illumination source emitting a polychromatic light beam,\n        a polarisation state generator (PSG) including a fixed linear polarizer and a substantially achromatic retarder mounted on a rotating holder, said light beam passing through said PSG,\n        a sample holder, on which the sample can be mounted, the light beam being focused on the sample,\n        a polarisation state analyser (PSA) including a fixed linear polarizer and a substantially achromatic retarder mounted on a rotating holder, the beam going through said PSA, after being transmitted, reflected or scattered by the sample.\n        a primary detection system measuring the intensity of the light beam transmitted through said PSA at each wavelength,\n        optics to collimate the beam into the PSG and into the PSA and to focus the beam into the sample surface.",
        "According to the invention:\n\n    \n    \n        said linear polarizer and said substantially achromatic retarder in the PSA are identical to the linear polarizer and the substantially achromatic retarder of the PSG and inverted according to the sense of propagation of the light.

        "FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 represent a functional block diagram of the disclosed ellipsometer/polarimeter system mounted respectively in transmission configuration and in reflection configuration according to two particular embodiments of the invention.",
        "Said systems include an entrance arm 1, a sample holder system 3 to fix the studied sample 8, and an exit arm 2. The entry arm 1 includes an illumination source 5, a polarization state generator or PSG 6 and a holder for reference samples 7.",
        "The PSG 6 includes a linear polarizer 13 and a substantially achromatic retarder 21. The retarder of the PSG 21 is mounted on a rotating holder 14 that allows it to be placed at different orientations.",
        "The exit arm 2 includes a second holder for reference samples 9, a polarisation state analyser or, PSA 10, and a primary detection system 11 measuring the intensity of the light beam transmitted through said PSA (10) at each wavelength.",
        "The PSA 10 has the same elements that the PSG 6, a linear polarizer 20 and a substantially achromatic retarder 22, but located in reverse order (inverted according to the sense of propagation of the light).",
        "The retarder of the PSA 22 is mounted on a rotating holder 19 allowing it to be set at different orientations. The holders for the reference samples 7 and 9, introduce a set of specific samples 15, 16, 17 and 18 in the beam path during calibration, and remove them during measurement process. The optical path starts with the beam 12 emitted by the illumination source 5. Said light beam 12 passes through the PSG 6 and is focused on the sample 8 on the sample holder system 3.",
        "After reflection on the sample surface, the beam goes through the analysis section 2, containing the PSA 10, and is finally focused into the sensitive area of the primary detection system 11.",
        "The optical set-up is completed with the appropriate optics to collimate the beam into the PSG 6 and into the PSA 10, and to focus the beam into the sample 8 surface and the sensitive area of the primary detection system 11.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, the primary detection system 11 measures simultaneously the intensity of all the wavelengths of the light beam transmitted through the PSA 10.",
        "In another embodiment of the invention, the primary detection system 11 measures simultaneously and separately the intensity of each wavelength of the light beam transmitted through the PSA 10",
        "The primary detection system 11 is linked to a computer or a data acquisition and processing system 4. The computer 4, or an equivalent tool, allows to monitor the detection systems 11, 32 signals, to store raw data and to perform pertinent mathematical treatment of the raw data to obtain Mueller matrices, ellipsometric \u03a8 and \u0394 angles, as well as other derived data. The computer 4 also controls the position of the rotating holders 14, 19 and the holders for the reference samples 7, 9.",
        "The system can also include, as an option, a secondary detection system 32 made of a beam-splitter 23 and a secondary detector 24. The beam-splitter 23 is located between the illumination source 5 and the PSG 6 and it sends a small portion of the beam power towards the secondary detector 24. The signal measured by the secondary detector 24 can be used, among others, as a reference to normalize the signals measured by the primary detection system 11. Data normalization prevents errors due to power fluctuations of the beam 12 emitted by the source 5.",
        "The use of substantially achromatic optical elements (polarizers 13, 20 and retarders 21, 22) guarantees a uniform quality of the measurements through the studied spectral range.",
        "The advantage of rotating the retarders 21, 22 instead of the polarizers 13, 20 is to prevent the influence of the original polarization of the beam 12.",
        "The PSG 6 generates four polarization states by placing sequentially the retarder of the PSG 21 at four selected orientations respect to the transmission axis of the PSG polarizer 13.",
        "The rotation motion of the retarder 21 is not continuous; the rotating holder 14, runs in a stepper mode, thus making a key difference with respect to other reported rotating compensator ellipsometers/polarimeters.",
        "Indeed, the small number of states produced by the PSG 6, (four instead of nine), in comparison with a previously described apparatus of the document U.S. Pat. No. 5,706,212, makes its operation faster and simpler.",
        "Like in the PSG 6, the retarder of the PSA 22 is mounted in a rotating holder 19 that allows it to be oriented at four different angles with respect to the transmission axis of the polarizer of the PSA 20.",
        "The four selected orientation angles for the two retarders 21 and 22 are optimized in order to maintain the condition numbers of the modulation and the analysis matrices associated respectively with the PSG 6 and the PSA 10 over 0.2.",
        "Optionaly, the four selected orientation angles for the two retarders 21 and 22 are approximately identical.",
        "After reflection or transmission by the sample 8, each one of the polarization states that had been originally generated by the PSG 6, is successively analyzed four times by the PSA 10, giving as a result 16 independent intensity measurements (raw data) necessary for the determination of the Mueller matrix.",
        "The four polarization states generated in the PSG 6, as well of the optical configurations of the PSA 10, are not obvious or intuitive; they have been selected according to an objective criterion (condition numbers) that allows the minimization of the propagation of errors from the measurement to the computed Mueller matrix.",
        "In the following, the mathematical description of the PSG 6 used to define the criterion for instrument optimization is reviewed. Because the PSA 10 is identical to the PSG 6, the physical principles, the mathematical description and the technological parameters giving rise to the optimization of the PSG 6 are also applicable to the PSA 10. It is common to use a 4\u00d74 matrix, W, called modulation matrix, to represent the PSG 6 and an analysis matrix, A, to represent the PSA 10. The columns of the W matrix correspond to the four Stokes vectors generated by the PSG 6. Reciprocally, for each state generated by the PSG 6, the corresponding polarization state of the emerging light is projected over four optical configurations generated by the PSA 10. The four dimensional signal vector D, eventually delivered by the PSA 10, is related to each Stokes vector Sout generated by the PSG by a linear relation D=ASout.",
        "The result of a complete polarimetric measurement, consists of sixteen independent raw intensity measurements that can be expressed by a matrix B=AMW, where A and W are respectively the analysis and modulation matrices defined above, and M the Mueller matrix of the sample. If A and W are known, then M can be extracted from the raw data B as M=A\u22121BW\u22121. The determination of A and W is called calibration of the polarimeter.",
        "Obviously, the instrument must be designed in such a way that A and W are non singular. Moreover, in order to minimize the error propagation from the raw measurement B to the final result M, the analysis and modulation matrices A and W must be \u201cas close as possible\u201d to unitary matrices.",
        "The best criterion in this respect is to optimize their condition numbers c(A) and c(W), which are the ratios of the smallest over the largest of their singular values, see for example W. H. Press et al. {Numerical Recipes in PASCAL, p 53}, who actually define the condition number as the reciprocal of that defined here.",
        "In order to find the values of the azimuths and the retardation of the retarder 21 that optimize c(W), a convenient approach is to simulate the optical behaviour of PSG 6 treating the polarizer 13 and the retarder 21 as ideal. The ideal Mueller matrix for the polarizer 13 is:",

        "Sub-indexes 1 to 4 placed next to the parentheses refer to the components of each one of Stokes vectors generated by the PSG 6. Under the above representation, the condition number of the matrix W can be understood as a function of five parameters, the retardation \u03b4 and the four azimuth angles of the retarder 21. In an article, Tyo et al. {Appl. Opt., (2002)} has shown that for a PSG or a PSA made essentially with polarizers and retarders, the theoretical value of the condition number can vary between \u201c0\u201d and \u201c3\u22121/2\u201d. Accordingly, the values of the five parameters, retardation and azimuths, used to design the PSG 6, must be those that optimize the value of the condition number.",
        "Finding the value of the parameters that maximize the condition number is a numerical problem that can be solved by means of a standard optimization routine such as the Simplex or the Levenberg-Marquardt {Numerical Recipes in PASCAL, p. 326}. As a result, two optimal values for the retardation and two values for each one of the azymuts \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83 and \u03b84 can be found. Once the optimal values are determined, the sensitivity of the PSG 6 or the PSA 10 to fluctuations of retardation and orientation angles can be estimated using the condition number, again, as a criterion. In fact, even though the condition number can be theoretically very small, it is commonly accepted that a minimum value of 0.2 is needed to obtain measurements with acceptable quality. Accordingly, the tolerances of the retardation, and the four azimuths of the retarder around their respective optimum value, are specified in order to maintain the condition number over 0.2.",
        "The values for the retardation are:\n\n\u03b41=132\u00b0+n360\u00b0 and\n\n\u03b42=227\u00b0+n360\u00b0,\n\n    \n    \n        with \u201cn\u201d being any integer.",
        "FIG. 3 shows the values of the condition number calculated as function of the retardation for one set of optimal values of the azimuths.",

        "where \u03c6 is the angle of incidence for the internal reflection and \u201cn\u201d is the index of the material where the TIR takes place. The normal incidence of the beam at the interface between the rhombs 50, 50\u2032, prevents it to be deviated, even if the rhombs are not built of the same material. This is an advantage that allows the combination of different materials in order to enhance the achromaticity of the bi-prism. The entrance and exit faces of the bi-prism 51 are perpendicular to the propagation direction of the beam in order to make insertion losses independent of the polarization. From geometrical considerations, it is easy to show that the angle of incidence \u03c6 in the expression 5 corresponds to the angle \u03b1 mentioned previosly, that determines the shape of the bi-oprism. According to expression 5 and for a given value of the total retardation, high values of \u201cn\u201d allow small angles of incidence, thus leading to short and compact retarders.",
        "However, the use of high index materials to build the bi-prism 51 can create some optical drawbacks. First, the high contrast of index between the surrounding medium and the prism can induce important insertion losses if the entrance (exit) faces do not have an adequate antireflection coating. Secondly, in the absence of an antireflection coating, the transmission faces, which are parallel to each other, can generate multiple-internal reflected secondary beams inside the prism. Those multiple-reflected beams have performed multiple travels in the interior of the prisms, thus cumulating a phase-shift different from that of the principal beam. When the contrast of index is high, the relative intensity of the secondary beams cannot be neglected, and their superposition with the principal beam causes non-idealities, such as depolarization, in the behaviour of the retarder that can not be predicted by a simple addition of the retardations given by expression 5.",
        "Consequently, with uncoated high index materials, the performance, i.e. the condition number, of the PSG 6 can be considerably decreased. If there are no constraints on the size of the bi-prisms 51, one possible solution to those drawbacks is to build them with low index, \u201cn\u201d, materials such as BaF2 (1.51 @ 265 nm, 1.39 @ 10 micron) among others because insertion losses and intensity of multiple-reflected beams are minimized. Materials like BaF2 have also the advantage of being transparent over a wide spectral range from the ultraviolet to the infrared, so they are the ideal candidates to be used in the construction of bi-prisms. BaF2 is mentioned here for illustrative purposes only and should not be used to unduly limit the scope of the invention.",

Said second prism 24 has a right face RF2 and a left face LF2 oriented at an angle of \u03b1 with respect to the horizontal. The input beam IB reaches the second substantially achromatic retarder 23\u2032 through the left face LF1 of the first prism 25 at normal incidence.

Then, said beam reaches the second triangular prism 24, through the interface defined by the BF2 and TF1, and reaches its left face LF2 with an angle of incidence \u03b1, and undergoes a second total internal reflection IR2.

On the third prism 26, said beam reaches its left face LF3 with an angle of incidence \u03b1, and undergoes a fourth total internal reflection IR4.

        "Because the beam is perpendicular to the input face of the prism, from geometrical considerations it is possible to show that the incidence angle in the first 25 and third 26 prisms is equal to \u03b1. Again, some simple geometrical considerations allow to show that if the direction of the beam must be preserved by the full device, the incidence angle of the two internal reflections on the second prism 24 must be equal to \u03b1. This implies that LF2 (resp. RF2) must be parallel to RF1 (resp. LF3).",

        "Equations 11 and 12 form a system of linear equations where A and W are the unknowns. However, up to this point nothing is known about the theoretical expressions M1\u22121M2 and M2M1\u22121. The eigenvalue method provides an original way to solve this apparent difficulty with the use of a simple set of calibration samples. For example, let's take a polarizer oriented to zero degree as a reference sample. The measurement of raw data without the polarizer gives B0=AM0W, where M0 can correspond either to a mirror located in the sample-holder if the ellipsometer is set in reflection, or to the unit matrix if the polarimeter is set in transmission without a sample between the PSG and the PSA. To obtain W, the polarizer must be located between the PSG and the sample-holder, thus, giving a raw matrix BP=AM0PW, with P given by the expression 1. Multiplication of the inverse of B0 by BP gives: CP=B0\u22121BP=W\u22121PW. In theory, the eigenvalues of CP and P are the same. Knowing that P has only one non-zero eigenvalue \u03bb1=2\u03c4p, then it is possible to perform a direct measurement of \u03c4P which is the sole parameter needed to characterize completely the matrix P. Back to expression 11, assuming that M1 equals M0, and that M2 equals M0P, the expression can be rewritten as:\n\nPW\u2212W(am0w)\u22121(am0pw)=0\u2003\u2003(13)",
        "To obtain A, a similar operation must be done. Continuing with the example of the polarizer as a reference sample, it is now necessary to locate it between the sample-holder and the PSA. Again, two measurements have to be performed, one without the polarizer giving B0=AM0W, and another with the polarizer giving BP=APM0W. The product of BP by the inverse of B0 gives: CP=BPB0\u22121=A PA\u22121. Because the eigenvalues of CP and P are the same, it is possible to determine completely the matrix P. Now identifying M1 with M0 and M2 with PM0, it is possible to write the expression 12 in terms of P as follows:\n\nAP\u2212(apm0w)(am0w)\u22121A=0\u2003\u2003(14)",
        "Expressions 13 and 14 are now well defined equations. One of the possible ways to solve 13 and 14 consists of using an algebraic method. First, let's to create two linear mappings or applications, HW and HA, from the space of four-dimensional real matrices, {R4\u00d74} to itself {R4\u00d74}, having the following expressions:\n\nHW(X)=PX\u2212X(am0w)\u22121(am0pw)\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nHA(X)=XP\u2212(apm0w)(am0w)\u22121X\u2003\u2003(16)",
        "As any linear mapping, HW and HA have a defined kernel and they can be represented by a matrix. Briefly, the kernel of a mapping is defined as the set of elements mapped towards the null element. The dimension of the kernel corresponds to the number of linearly independent elements in the set. By virtue of expressions 11 and 12, the matrix W belongs to the kernel of HW and the matrix A to the kernel of HA. When singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed on the matrix associated to a given mapping, a diagonal matrix can be obtained with a number of null diagonal elements equal to the dimension of the kernel. Further, it is known that each null singular value has an associated singular vector that turns out to be proportional to one of the elements of the kernel. Accordingly, if the kernel of HW and that of HA are of dimension 1, each of the corresponding associated matrices will have a unique null singular value with an associated singular vector being proportional to the desired solution W and A respectively, and the calibration problem will be solved. However, in practice, two difficulties arise. Firstly, W and A are matrices and not vectors, and secondly, if a polarizer or a retarder is used alone as unique reference sample, the dimension of the kernel cannot be one. The first difficulty is only apparent because the difference between vectors and matrices is only formal. In fact, the 4\u00d74 matrices appearing in expressions 15 and 16 can be rewritten in the form of 16-dimensional vectors by taking the four columns of the matrix and writing them, one below the other, under the form a column that can be manipulated like a vector. Using 16-dimensional vectors, the mappings HW and HA can be represented by the 16\u00d716 associate matrices HW and HA respectively. On the other hand, the dimension of the kernel of HW and HA can be reduced to one if a set of reference samples are used instead of only a single sample. In the most general case, where a number \u201cn\u201d of samples have to be used, the following \u201cn\u201d mappings can be built for the PSG and the PSA respectively:\n\nHiW(X)=MiX\u2212X(am0w)\u22121(am0miw)\u2003\u2003(17)\n\nHiA(X)=XMi\u2212(amim0w)(am0w)\u22121X\u2003\u2003(18)",
        "Where Mi (i=1 . . . n) are the Mueller matrices of the n reference samples.

        "The type and the number of calibration samples is not unique. A reasonable choice consists of using the minimum number of elements. In that way, it has been demonstrated that a pair of polarizers combined with a retarder, or alternatively, two retarders together with a polarizer, can be conveniently used as calibration samples sets. The characteristics of the first set are:\n\n    \n    \n        A linear polarizer oriented at \u221220\u00b0 with respect to the incidence plane.\n        A linear polarizer oriented at +40\u00b0 with respect to the incidence plane.\n        A linear retarder providing retardation between 30 and 170\u00b0, oriented parallel to the incidence plane.",
