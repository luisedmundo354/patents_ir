        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a color filter that functions both in a reflective display mode and a transmissive display mode, a method of manufacturing such color filter, a method of depositing a liquid material to manufacture such color filter, a display device having such color filter, a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display device having such color filter, an electro-optic device having such color filter, an electronic instrument having such color filter, and to a method of manufacturing such electronic instrument.",
        "2. Background Information",
        "A liquid crystal display device is known to be equipped with a color filter that functions both as a reflective display by using external light and a transmissive display by using a backlight. When such conventional liquid crystal display device functions as a reflective display, colored light is obtained when the incoming light from outside passes through coloring layers that are provided for color-display purposes. Accordingly, the display is inevitably darkened because the incoming light is partially absorbed by the coloring layers. To prevent this problem, it has been known to provide in portions of the coloring layers colorless openings and reflecting films that correspond to the openings, such that part of the incoming light passes through the openings to be reflected at the reflecting films as colorless light without being absorbed by the coloring layers. By mixing the colorless light with the colored light, it is possible to obtain a brighter display than the case where all incoming light passes through the coloring layers and becomes colored. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. H11-183892 (FIG. 1) shows such structure.",
        "A liquid crystal display device is also known to be able to switch between the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode as needed, as seen in, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2001-33778 (FIGS. 1 and 2).",
        "However, in the known arrangements described above, in the reflective display mode, the light entering from outside is reflected after passing through the coloring layers and again passes through the coloring layers, thus passing through the coloring layers twice, such that the outputted colored light has enough color saturation. On the other hand, in the transmissive display mode, the light from the light source passes through the coloring layers only once, resulting in different degrees of color saturation in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode. More specifically, the colored light in the reflective display mode is perceived as being more saturated. In other words, the display device has a different color balances in the reflective display mode and in the transmissive display mode.",
        "Furthermore, since each coloring layer has a reflective portion and a transmissive portion and the transmissive portion is an opening within the reflective portion, a step portion at the boundary between the reflective portion and the transmissive portion is inevitably formed. When a color filter element is formed on such step portion using an inkjet device or other discharging device, the area near the step portion is sometimes not covered by the color filter material.",
        "In view of the above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that there exists a need for an improved a color filter, a method for manufacturing a color filter, a display device having such color filter, a method of discharging a liquid material to manufacture such color filter, an electro-optic device having such color filter, an electronic instrument having such color filter; a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display device, and a method of manufacturing an electronic instrument, that overcome the problems of the aforementioned known art. This invention addresses this need in the art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.",
        "Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a color filter that has good color balances in a reflective display mode and in a transmissive display mode. Such color filter is configured so that a liquid material can be appropriately coated thereon. Another object of the present invention is to provide a manufacturing method for a color filter, a discharging method, a display device, a method for manufacturing a liquid crystal display device, an electro-optic device, an electronic instrument, and a method for manufacturing an electronic instrument.",
        "In the discharging method of the present invention, a liquid material is discharged in a deposit portion having a reflective portion and a transmissive portion. The transmissive portion is concaved from the reflective portion. The discharging method includes discharging the liquid material in the transmissive portion; and discharging the liquid material in the reflective portion after discharging the liquid material in the transmissive portion.",
        "The color filter of another aspect of the present invention is provided with a light-transmissive substrate, a reflecting layer formed on the substrate and provided with openings, a boundary layer formed on the reflecting layer, and a plurality of coloring layers enclosed by the boundary layer. A light-transmissive transparent coat layer is provided between the reflecting layer and the boundary layer.",
        "The color filter of still another aspect of the present invention is provided with a light-transmissive substrate, a reflecting layer formed on the substrate and provided with openings, a boundary layer formed on the reflecting layer, a plurality of coloring layers enclosed by the boundary layer, and a first overcoat layer formed so as to cover the boundary layer and the coloring layers. The surface of the reflecting layer on which the boundary layer is formed has an irregular surface that scatters light, and a second overcoat layer is formed on the first overcoat layer.",
        "These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses a preferred embodiment of the present invention.",

        "Selected embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Furthermore, not all of the configurations described in these embodiments are necessarily indispensable as a means of embodying the inventions as defined in the claims. This liquid crystal display device is a low-energy, so-called semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device for performing a display function in an optimal display mode, which is selected based on the brightness of the surrounding from a reflective display mode in which external light is collected to display images with reflected light, and a transmissive display mode in which images are displayed with light from a backlight. The liquid crystal display device has a color filter provided with coloring layers for color display.",
        "FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In this cross-sectional view, the side of the liquid crystal 15 on which the light source (backlight) 20 is disposed is referred to as the back side, and the opposite side as the front side. The display is usually viewed from the front side. FIG. 2 is a diagram in which the positioning of boundary layers 5 and 21 with the colored layers 6 of the present invention is depicted from the front side. A grid is formed with light-transmissive colorless boundary layers 5 that extend in the direction of the Y-axis at a plurality of locations, and non light-transmissive colored boundary layers 21 that extend at a plurality of locations in the direction of the X-axis, which is orthogonal to the Y-axis. FIG. 1 is a diagram depicting a cross section (I-I\u2032) of the colorless boundary layers 5, and FIG. 3 is a diagram depicting a cross section (III-III\u2032) of the colored boundary layers 21.",
        "As depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 1 includes a light-transmissive back substrate 2 and a front substrate 11 which are disposed facing each other, and a color filter 40 for enabling color display. The color filter 40 includes a reflecting layer 3 that is formed on the front side of the back substrate 2 and has openings 4; a light-transmissive transparent coat layer 25 that is formed on the reflecting layer 3; colorless boundary layers 5 and colored boundary layers 21 that are formed in a grid so as to define the openings 4 above the transparent coat layer 25; a plurality of deposit portions 7 that are defined by the colorless boundary layers 5 and the colored boundary layers 21 to allow a prescribed colored liquid to be deposited by a discharging device described hereinafter; coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B that are layers of the colored liquid applied to the deposit portions 7; and an overcoat layer 8 for entirely covering the colorless boundary layer 5, the colored boundary layer 21, and the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B.",
        "The liquid crystal display device 1 further includes pixel electrodes 12 disposed opposite the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B; an orientation film 13 for covering the pixel electrodes 12; and counter electrodes 9 disposed opposite the pixel electrodes 12, and an orientation film 10 for covering the counter electrodes 9. The pixel electrodes 12 and the orientation film 13 are formed on the back side of the front substrate 11, while the counter electrodes 9 and the orientation film 10 are formed on the overcoat layer 8 described above. A seal 14 is formed along the external periphery of the front substrate 11 between the orientation film 10 and the orientation film 13, such that liquid crystal 15 is sealed in the space defined by the seal 14, the orientation film 10, and the orientation film 13. Also provided are a front-face polarizing plate 17 attached to the front side of the front substrate 11, a back-face polarizing plate 16 attached to the back side of the back substrate 2, an optical waveguide plate 19 provided via a buffer 18 so as to cover the entire back side of the back-face polarizing plate 16, and a light source 20 for supplying light to the optical waveguide plate 19.",
        "The coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B are arranged in an orderly fashion in a grid, with coloring layers 6 of the same color forming a row in the Y-axis direction. Coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B of different colors are lined up in sequence in the X-axis direction. The colorless boundary layers 5 are arranged at borders between coloring layers 6 of differing colors, while the colored boundary layers 21 are arranged at borders between coloring layers 6 of the same color. In other words, the coloring layers 6 are compartmentalized by the boundary layers 5 and 21. Therefore, it is possible to prevent such drawbacks as poor color contrast due to colors overlapping one another, and gaps being formed between the coloring layers 6. Thus, sharp display can be obtained. The colorless boundary layers 5, the counter electrodes 9, the pixel electrodes 12, the orientation films 10 and 13, the overcoat layer 8, and the transparent coat layer 25 are also light-transmissive.",
        "Reflective Display Mode",
        "The reflective display in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 1 thus configured will first be described with reference to FIG. 4. Among various lights that enter the front-face polarizing plate 17, only the external lights Q and S that enter the front-face polarizing plate 17 in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the front-face polarizing plate 17 are allowed to pass through, and the lights entering in other directions are absorbed by the front-face polarizing plate 17. The external lights Q and S that passed through the front-face polarizing plate 17 pass through the liquid crystal display device 1 through: the pixel electrodes 12\u2192the orientation film 13\u2192the liquid crystal 15\u2192the orientation film 10\u2192the counter electrodes 9\u2192the overcoat layer 8, in this order. Thereafter, the external light S in this arrangement passes through any one of the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B (the coloring layer 6B in the example of FIG. 1) and reaches the reflecting layer 3 via the transparent coat layer 25, is reflected by the reflecting layer 3 and again passes through the transparent coat layer 25 and the coloring layer 6, becomes a colored light that is colored by the colored layer 6 twice, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device 1 in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered. On the other hand, the external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer 5 and the transparent coat layer 25 and reaches the reflecting layer 3 after passing through the counter electrodes 9, is reflected by the reflecting layer 3 and again passes through the transparent coat layer 25 and the colorless boundary layer 5, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device 1 as colorless light, passing through in a reverse direction the pathway through which the external light Q entered.",
        "As the external light S passes through the coloring layer 6, the coloring layer 6 absorbs lights that are included in the external light S and have a wavelength other than that of the color of the coloring layer 6. Accordingly, the brightness of the external light S is reduced as the external light S passes through the coloring layer 6. The brightness of the external light S is reduced further due to the fact that the external light S passes through the coloring layer 6 twice. The brightness tends to be even further reduced if the thickness of the coloring layers 6 is increased in order to increase color saturation. However, because the colorless external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer 5 without passing through the coloring layers 6, the external light Q exits while preserving its original brightness. Consequently, in order to increase the brightness of the external light S, the external lights Q and S are caused to exit simultaneously from the front. Accordingly, the external lights Q and S in combination maintain the overall brightness of the display. The brightened mixture of the colored light and the colorless light is perceived as colored light by human eyes, since human eyes cannot distinguish colored light from colorless light.",
        "The colorless boundary layers 5 as described above are made of an acrylic resin or an epoxy resin that has good transparency, and are aligned in an orderly fashion at the boundaries of coloring layers 6 of different colors. Accordingly, the overall brightness of the coloring layers 6 is balanced and an easily readable display is obtained. The colored boundary layers 21 formed at the boundaries between colored layers 6 of the same color are black and yield good color contrast. Also, even when a colored liquid is deposited onto the colored boundary layers 21 during the formation of the colored layers 6 by a hereinafter described discharging device, there is no effect on the resulting display. Accordingly, it is possible to deposit the colored liquid in a continuous manner. Both of these boundary layers are usually formed by a dispenser, screen printing, or the like.",
        "The reflecting layer 3 formed on the back substrate 2 is made of a thin film of silver, aluminum, nickel, chrome, or another metal to reflect light. The overcoat layer 8 flattens the irregular surface that was formed during the formation of the colorless boundary layer 5, the colored boundary layer 21, and the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B. In this manner, the overcoat layer 8 facilitates the formation of the counter electrodes 9. The orientation films 10 and 13 cover and protect the counter electrodes 9 and pixel electrodes 12 respectively, and are designed to prevent organic ingredients and the like from exuding into and degrading the liquid crystal 15.",
        "In the liquid crystal 15, the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is varied according to the electric field applied between the counter electrodes 9 and the pixel electrodes 12, which sandwich the liquid crystal 15 from both sides. In this manner, the orientation of the transmitted light can be controlled. Each pair of the counter electrode 9 and the pixel electrode 12 is arranged at positions opposite each of the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B and its bordering colorless boundary layers 5, such that the transmission and blockage of light and the brightness of each color are controlled to depict the prescribed display. Where the counter electrodes overlap with the colorless boundary layers 5, each of adjacent counter electrodes 9 is arranged to cover half the width of each colorless boundary layer 5. Specifically, the transmission, blockage, and the like of the external light Q and S are controlled for each area in which the pair of the counter electrode 9 and pixel electrode 12 is disposed. The external light Q and S also pass through the liquid crystal 15 twice.",
        "Transmissive Display Mode",
        "A brief description of the transmissive display mode will next be given still referring to FIG. 1. In the transmissive display mode, transmission light P emitted from the light source 20 is used instead of the external lights Q and S which are used in the reflective display mode. The transmission light P is guided to the back-face polarizing plate 16 by the optical waveguide plate 19, such that only light in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the back-face polarizing plate 16 is allowed to pass through the back-face polarizing plate 16. The resultant light then passes through the back substrate 2 and enters the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B through the openings 4. The light P that enters the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B is colored in the color of the coloring layer 6 in which the light P entered (green in the example of FIG. 1), and is emitted from the front side passing through: the overcoat layer 8\u2192the counter electrodes 9\u2192the orientation film 10\u2192the liquid crystal 15\u2192the orientation film 13\u2192the pixel electrodes 12\u2192the front substrate 11\u2192the front-face polarizing plate 17, in this order. Usually, the transmission light P passes through the coloring layers 6 and the liquid crystal 15 once. Accordingly, if the external light S that enters the liquid crystal display device 1 from the front face and the transmission light P that enters from the light source 20 are of the same brightness, the transmission light P will be brighter when it exits from the front face. The present invention is designed so that the brightness of the display in the reflective display mode is increased by adding the bright external light Q to the external light S, such that the difference in brightness between the transmissive display mode and the transmissive display mode is extremely small.",
        "In contrast, when there is no transparent coat layer 25, the external light S passes through the coloring layers 6 and is colored twice, while the transmission light P passes through the coloring layer 6 of the same thickness and is colored only once. The thickness of the coloring layers 6 through which the light passes can be considered to be substantially equal to or less than the thickness of the reflecting layer 3, which is a thin metal film having a thickness of 0.2 \u03bcm. Since the external light S passes through the coloring layer 6 by a distance that is twice as long as the distance by which the transmissive light P passes, the color saturation of the external light S is proportionately higher than that of the transmissive light. Specifically, when the same color is displayed in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode, human eyes can perceive the difference in color saturation. Although the difference in color saturation may be difficult to perceive when the viewer singularly views the display either in the reflective display mode or in the transmissive display mode, the difference in color saturation is more evident when two displays, one in the transmissive display mode and one in the reflective display mode, are viewed together in a darkened environment.",
        "In the arrangement of the present embodiment, the transparent coat layer 25 reduces the distance by which the external light S passes through the coloring layer 6. Accordingly, the difference in the color saturation in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode, which is a result of the difference in the number of times the light passes through the coloring layers 6, is cancelled out. Therefore, the liquid crystal display device 1 of the present embodiment has little difference in the brightness of display in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode.",
        "More specifically, as depicted in FIGS. 1 and 3, the transparent coat layer 25 is provided between the reflecting layer 3 and the boundary layers 5 and 21, such that portions 6c of the coloring layers 6 above the reflecting layer 3, through which the external light S passes, are made half as thick as portions 6a of the coloring layers 6 through which the transmission light P passes. By this arrangement, the external light S passing twice through the portion 6a of the coloring layers 6 and the transmission light P passing once through the portion 6c of the coloring layers 6 travel the same distance through the coloring layers 6, and colored to the same degree of color saturation. The transparent coat layer 25 is composed of acrylic resin, epoxy resin, or the like having good transparency. The transparent layer 25 is formed on the reflecting layer 3 so as to entirely cover the reflecting layer 3, and is set so that all of the external light Q and S passing through the transparent coat layer 25 is reflected by the reflecting layer 3. Although the transparent coat layer 25 is formed between the reflecting layer 3 and the boundary layers 5 and 21 in the example shown in FIG. 1, the transparent layer 25 can be alternatively formed between the reflecting layer 3 and the back substrate 2.",
        "As described above, by forming the transparent coat layer 25 in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 1 as described above, the thickness of the coloring layers 6 in the area above the reflecting layer 3 can be reduced by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the transparent coat layer 25. Specifically, the thickness of the portions 6c of the coloring layers 6 above the reflecting layer 3 becomes thinner than the thickness of the other portions 6a of the coloring layers 6 by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the transparent coat layer 25. Consequently, by adjusting the thickness of this transparent coat layer 25, it is possible to freely adjust the balance between the color saturation in the reflective display mode, in which external light is reflected by the reflecting layer 3 and passes twice through the coloring layers 6, and the color saturation in the transmissive display mode, in which light passes through the coloring layers 6 only once. In the embodiment above, the distance that the external light S and the transmission light P pass through in the coloring layer 6 is made substantially equal, and therefore the color saturation of the colored light can be made substantially equal. By also forming a colorless boundary layer 5 whereby bright, colorless light is obtained, a display device can be provided having good visibility and substantially the same level of brightness in the a reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode.",
        "Also, by providing a light-transmissive boundary layer 5, bright, colorless light can be obtained that does not pass through the coloring layers 6. Accordingly, the brightness in the reflective display mode can be enhanced. The color contrast is also enhanced by the colored boundary layer 21, which is a non light-transmissive boundary layer. Furthermore, by using a discharging device to form the coloring layers 6 that are enclosed by the boundary layers 5 and 21, droplets 150 can be uniformly applied and a boundary layer with uniform coating thickness and coating surface area can be obtained.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4-5, a liquid crystal display 30 in accordance with a second embodiment will now be explained. In view of the similarity between the first and second embodiments, the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numerals as those of the first embodiment.",
        "The second embodiment of the present invention will next be described referring to FIGS. 2 and 4-5. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view depicting the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30 in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. As in the first embodiment, the side of the liquid crystal 15 on which the light source 20 is disposed is referred to as the back side, and the opposite side as the front side in this cross-sectional view. A grid is formed with light-transmissive colorless boundary layers 5 that extend in the direction of the Y-axis at a plurality of locations, and non light-transmissive colored boundary layers 21 that extend at a plurality of locations in the direction of the X-axis, as seen in the arrangement of the boundary layers of FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a diagram depicting a cross section (I-I\u2032) of the colorless boundary layer 5, and FIG. 5 is a diagram depicting a cross section (III-III\u2032) of the colored boundary layer 21. This embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that a resin scattering layer 32 is newly provided, the front face of the reflecting layer 3 is given an irregular rugged shape and made into a scattering and reflecting layer 31, and the thickness of the overcoat layer 8 is partially changed.",
        "As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30 includes a light-transmissive back substrate 2 and a front substrate 11 that are disposed facing each other, and a color filter 45 that enables color display. The color filter 45 includes a resin scattering layer 32 that is formed on the front side of the back substrate 2 and is provided with an irregular surface on the front side; a scattering and reflecting layer 31 that is formed on the resin scattering layer 32 and has an irregular surface on its front face side for scattering light and the openings 4; a transparent coat layer 25 formed on the scattering and reflecting layer 31; colorless boundary layers 5 and colored boundary layers 21 formed so as to enclose the openings 4 formed in the transparent coat layer 25; a plurality of deposit portions 7 which are defined by the colorless boundary layers 5 and the colored boundary layers 21 and to which a prescribed colored liquid is applied by a discharging device described hereinafter; coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B which are layers of the colored liquid applied to the deposit portions 7; and an overcoat layer 8\u2032 that is designed to completely cover the colorless boundary layers 5, the colored boundary layers 21, and the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B and is formed thicker in portions corresponding to the scattering and reflecting layer 31. The overcoat layer 8\u2032 includes a first overcoat layer 8a\u2032 for directly and completely covering the colorless boundary layers 5, the colored boundary layers 21, and the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B, and a second overcoat layer portion 8b\u2032 formed only on portions of the first overcoat layer portion 8a\u2032 that correspond to the scattering and reflecting layer 31.",
        "Pixel electrodes 12 disposed opposite the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B, and an orientation film 13 for covering the pixel electrodes 12 are formed on the back side of the front substrate 11. Counter electrodes 9\u2032 disposed in a concave shape opposite the pixel electrodes 12, and an orientation film 10\u2032 for covering the counter electrodes 9 are formed on the overcoat layer 8\u2032 described above. Seals 14 are formed along the external periphery of the front substrate 11 between the orientation films 10 and 13, such that liquid crystal 15 is sealed in the space formed by the seals, 14 and the orientation films 10 and 13. Also, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30 has a front-face polarizing plate 17 attached to the front side of the front substrate 11, a back-face polarizing plate 16 attached to the back side of the back substrate 2, an optical waveguide plate 19 provided on the back of the back-face polarizing plate 16 via a buffer 18 so as to cover the entire back side of the back-face polarizing plate 16, and a light source 20 for supplying light to the optical waveguide plate 19.",
        "The coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B are aligned in an orderly fashion in a grid. Coloring layers 6 of the same color form a row in the Y-axis direction, while coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B of different colors are lined up next to one another in the X-axis direction. The colorless boundary layers 5 are arranged at the borders between coloring layers 6 of different colors; while the colored boundary layers 21 are arranged at the borders of coloring layers 6 of the same color. The colorless boundary layers 5, the counter electrodes 9\u2032, the pixel electrodes 12, the orientation films 10\u2032 and 13, the overcoat layer 8\u2032, the resin scattering layer 32, and the transparent coat layer 25 are also light-transmissive.",
        "Reflective Display Mode",
        "The reflective display in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30 thus configured will first be described. Among various lights that enter the front-face polarizing plate 17, only the external lights Q and S that enter the front-face polarizing plate 17 in the transmission direction (transmission axis direction) of the front-face polarizing plate 17 are allowed to pass through, and the lights entering in other directions are absorbed by the front-face polarizing plate 17. The external lights Q and S that have passed through the front-face polarizing plate 17 pass through the liquid crystal display device 30 through: the pixel electrodes 12\u2192the orientation film 13\u2192the liquid crystal 15\u2192the orientation film 10\u2032\u2192the counter electrodes 9\u2192the overcoat layer 8\u2032 in this order. The external light S in this arrangement passes through any one of the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B (the coloring layer 6B in FIG. 4), reaches the scattering and reflecting layer 31 via the transparent coat layer 25, is reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer 31, again passes through the transparent coat layer 25 and the coloring layer 6, becomes a colored light that is colored in the color of the coloring layer 6, and exits from the front side of the liquid crystal display device 30 in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered. On the other hand, the external light Q passes through the colorless boundary layer 5 and the transparent coat layer 25, reaches the scattering and reflecting layer 31, is reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer 31, again passes through the transparent coat layer 25 and the colorless boundary layer 5, and exits from the front side as a colorless light in a reverse order through the pathway through which the external light S entered reverse pathway from which the external light S entered.",
        "In this arrangement, the external light Q and S are scattered in various directions by the irregular surface of the scattering and reflecting layer 31 when reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer 31. Reflection of a viewer's eyes, face, or the like from the front surface that occurs when there is no irregular surface is thereby prevented, and a clearer display is obtained. This scattering and reflecting layer 31 uses silver, aluminum, nickel, chrome, or another thin film to reflect light. Irregularities are also formed on the surface of the scattering and reflecting layer 31 by oxygen plasma treatment or the like to scatter light. Furthermore, almost none of the external light entering the openings 4 is reflected, and irregularities are provided to the front face of the resin scattering layer 32 in order to prevent slight reflections and to yield a clear display.",
        "The external light S, which is now a colored light, reduces its brightness when it passes through the coloring layers 6 and is colored with a prescribed color up to prescribed color saturation. The external light Q, which is a colorless light, passes through the colorless boundary layers 5 without passing through the coloring layers 6, and exits with no change in its original brightness. The external light Q and the external light S are caused to exit from the front face simultaneously, such that the overall brightness is maintained. The second overcoat layer portions 8b\u2032 of the overcoat layer 8\u2032 that correspond to the scattering and reflecting layer 31 is formed thick in order to maintain the brightness of the external light Q and S that are scattered and reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer 31. In the mean time, the thickness of portions of the liquid crystal 15 above the reflecting layer 31, through which the external light Q and S that are reflected by the, scattering and reflecting layer 31 are transmitted, is set smaller than other portions of the liquid crystal 15. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the degree if brightness that is lost due to passage through the liquid crystal 15, and the brightness of light emitted from the front can be enhanced. The colored boundary layers 21 formed from resin at the boundaries between coloring layers 6 of the same color are black and yield good color contrast.",
        "Transmissive Display Mode",
        "The transmissive display mode is the same as the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 1 already described in the foregoing. The length of the portion of the liquid crystal 15 where the external light Q and S are transmitted is shortened to minimize reduction in brightness in the liquid crystal display device 30 of the second embodiment. If it is assumed that the brightness of the mixture of the incoming external lights Q and S is the same as the brightness of the transmission light P that comes from the light source 20, there will be substantially no difference in brightness between the transmission light P emitted at the front face and the external light Q and S. Specifically, the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30 is a display device having a good display balance whereby the variance in brightness of the transmission light P and the external light Q and S is reduced significantly.",
        "Furthermore, due to the transparent coat layer 25 of the present embodiment, a display can be obtained having substantially no difference in color saturation between the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode. If there were no transparent coat layer 25, the thickness of each of the coloring layers 6 through which the light passes can be considered to be substantially the same because the reflecting layer 3 is a thin film of metal. Consequently, when light is emitted from the front face, the color saturation of the external light S, which passes through the coloring layers 6 twice, is greater than that of the transmission light P, which passes through the coloring layers 6 once.",
        "In the present embodiment, however, as depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, the transparent coat layer 25 is provided between the scattering and reflecting layer 31 and the boundary layers 5 and 21, and the coloring layers 6 through which the external light S passes are made about half as thick as the coloring layers 6 through which the transmission light P passes. By this arrangement, the external light S and the transmission light P travel the same distance through the coloring layers 6, and become colored to the same color saturation. The transparent coat layer 25 is made of acrylic resin, epoxy resin, or other highly light-transmissive material. The transparent coat layer 25 is formed on the scattering and reflecting layer 31 so as to entirely cover the scattering and reflecting layer 31, such that all of the external light Q and S passing through the transparent coat layer 25 are reflected by the scattering and reflecting layer 31. The transparent coat layer 25 is formed between the reflecting layer 3 and the boundary layers 5 and 21, but the same effects can be obtained by forming the coat layer between the scattering and reflecting layer 31 and the back substrate 2.",
        "As described above, by partially forming the second overcoat portions 8b\u2032 over the first overcoat portions 8a\u2032 such that the overcoat layer 8\u2032 has different thicknesses in the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 30, the thickness of the liquid crystal 15 in the area above the reflecting layer 31 is reduced by a factor equivalent to the thickness of the second overcoat layer 8b\u2032. In this manner, the distance traveled by the external light Q and S and the transmission light P through the liquid crystal 15 is adjusted, such that the color brightness of the mixture of the external light Q and S and that of the transmission light P are equal. Accordingly, a display also has good visibility whereby reflections of external objects are prevented by the irregularity of the surfaces of the resin scattering layer 32 and the scattering and reflecting layer 31.",
        "Also in this embodiment, light is scattered and reflected due to the irregular surface of the reflecting layer 31, it is possible to prevent a reflection of, for example, eyes, face, or the like of the viewer on the display.",
        "In the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display devices 1 and 30 described in the first and second embodiments, the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B as elements of the color display can be uniformly formed by depositing a colored liquid in a droplet form onto the deposit portions 7 using a droplet-discharging device. In this case, the overcoat layer 8 can also be formed with the droplet-discharging device.",
        "As depicted in FIG. 6, the droplet-discharging device 100 includes a head mechanism 102 having a head unit 110 for discharging the droplets; a work mechanism 103 for supporting a work 102 so that droplets can be discharged onto a discharge target of a work 120 from the head unit 110; a fluid feeding unit 104 for feeding liquid 133 to the head unit 110; and a controller 105 for performing overall control of these mechanisms and the feeding unit 104.",
        "The droplet-discharging device 100 is provided with a plurality of support legs 106 attached to the floor, and a table 107 attached to the tops of the support legs 106. At the top of the table 107, the work mechanism 103 is disposed so as to extend in the longitudinal direction (Y-axis direction) of the table 107, and the head mechanism 102 supported by both of two pillars fixedly coupled to the table 107 is disposed above the work mechanism 103 so as to extend in the direction orthogonal to the work mechanism 103 (in the X-axis direction). A fluid feeding unit 104 for feeding the liquid 133 is connected from the head unit 110 of the head mechanism 102 and is disposed on one end of the table 107. Furthermore, the controller 105 is accommodated on the underside of the table 107.",

        "The work mechanism 103 is positioned below the head mechanism 102, has substantially the same structure as the head mechanism 102. The work mechanism 103 is disposed in the Y-axis direction, and includes a mounting platform 121 on which the work 120 is mounted, a Y-axis guide 123 for guiding the movement of the mounting platform 121, a Y-axis bore screw 125 mounted under the Y-axis guide 123, a Y-axis motor 124 for rotating the Y-axis bore screw 125 forward and backward, and a mounting platform screwing unit 122 at the bottom of the mounting platform 121 for engaging with the Y-axis bore screw 125 and moving the mounting platform 121.",
        "Although not shown in the Figures, position detection devices for detecting the positions to which the head unit 110 and mounting platform 121 have moved are respectively provided to the head mechanism 102 and the work mechanism 103. Mechanisms for adjusting the direction of rotation (so-called \u0398-axis) are installed in the carriage 111 and the mounting platform 121 to adjust the direction of rotation around the center of the head unit 110 and to adjust the direction of rotation of the mounting platform 121.",
        "With these configurations, the head unit 110 and the work 120 can be moved back and forth in the X-axis and Y-axis directions. The movement of the head unit 110 will first be described. The X-axis bore screw 115 is rotated forward and backward by the forward and backward rotation of the X-axis motor 114, and the carriage 111 that is integrated with the carriage screwing unit 112 moves to any desired position by the carriage screwing unit 112 engaged with the X-axis bore screw 115 moving along the X-axis guide 113. Specifically, the head unit 110 mounted on the carriage 111 is moved freely in the X-axis direction with the aid of the drive of the X-axis motor 114. In the same manner, the work 120 mounted on the mounting platform 121 also moves freely in the Y-axis direction.",
        "Accordingly, the head unit 110 is moved up to the discharge position in the X-axis and stopped, and caused to discharge droplets while being synchronized with the Y-axis direction movement of the work 120, which is below the head unit 110. A desired pattern can be formed on the work 120 by controlling the work 120, which moves in the Y-axis direction, and the head unit 110, which moves in the X-axis direction relative to each other.",
        "The fluid feeding unit 104 for feeding the liquid 133 to the head unit 110 includes a tube 131a that forms a flow channel connected to the head unit 110; a pump 132 for pumping fluid to the tube 131a; a tube 131b (flow channel) for feeding the liquid 133 to the pump 132; and a tank 130 for storing the liquid 133 that is connected to the tube 131b and is disposed at one end on the table 107. Although it is preferable to mount the tank 130 on top of or below the table 107 to make it easy to refill or exchange the liquid 133, it is also possible to naturally supply the fluid 133 via gravity without the pump 132 by connecting the tank 130 and the head unit 110 via a flexible tube as long as the tank 130 is disposed above the head unit 110.",
        "As depicted in FIG. 7(a), the head unit 110 contains a plurality of discharge heads 116 each having the same structure. FIG. 7(a) is a diagram depicting the head unit 110 as viewed from the mounting platform 121. Two rows of six discharge heads 116 of the head unit 110 are arranged such that the longitudinal direction of each of the discharge heads 116 is at an angle with respect to the X-axis direction. Each of the discharge heads 116 for discharging the liquid 133 also has two nozzle rows 118 and 119 extending in the longitudinal direction of the discharge heads 116. Each of the nozzle rows has 180 nozzles 117 lined up in a row. Each of the intervals between the nozzles 117 along the direction of the nozzle rows 118 and 119 is approximately 140 \u03bcm. The nozzles 117 of the two nozzle rows 118 and 119 are arranged with a half-pitch offset (approximately 70 \u03bcm).",
        "As depicted in FIG. 7(b), each of the discharge heads 116 is provided with a diaphragm 143 and a nozzle plate 144. A fluid reservoir 145 that is continually filled with the liquid 133 fed from the tank 130 via a hole 147 is positioned between the diaphragm 143 and the nozzle plate 144. A plurality of barriers 141 is also positioned in the space between the diaphragm 143 and the nozzle plate 144.

The cavities 140 are provided opposite the nozzles 117, such that the number of cavities 140 is the same as the number of nozzles 117.

The CPU 170 processes various signals inputted via the input/output interface 171 on the basis of the data in the ROM and RAM, outputs a control signal to the drive unit 175 via the input/output interface 171, and selectively controls each component operatively connected to the controller 105.",

        "The method of manufacturing the color filter 40 of the first embodiment, which includes the back substrate 2, the reflecting layer 3, the transparent coat layer 25, the openings 4, the colorless boundary layer 5, the colored boundary layer 21, the deposit portions 7, the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B, and the overcoat layer 8 will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 11. First, as depicted in FIG. 11(a), an organic resist film 27 for forming the openings 4 is formed on the back substrate 2. Then, a thin metallic film of aluminum, chrome, or other metal is formed on the resist film 27 and the back substrate 2 by vapor deposition or the like to form the reflecting layer 3. The metallic thin film is bonded to the back substrate 2, but not to the resist film 27. The resist film 27 and the metallic thin film on the resist film 27 are removed by a solvent after the metallic thin film is formed, whereupon the reflecting layer 3 is formed as depicted in FIG. 11(b). The transparent coat layer 25 made of an acrylic or other light-transmissive resin, the colorless boundary layer 5 made of a similar type of light-transmissive resin, and the colored boundary layer 21 made of a black resin are applied to the reflecting layer 3 to form a grid as depicted in FIG. 2 by screen printing or the like. The deposit portions 7 in the areas enclosed by the back substrate 2, the reflecting layer 3, the colorless boundary layer 5, and the colored boundary layer 21 are also formed as depicted in FIG. 11(c).",
        "The method whereby the droplets 150 of colored liquid are discharged by the droplet-discharging device 100 onto the deposit portions 7 to form the coloring layers 6 will be described using an example in which red colored liquid is discharged to form the coloring layers 6R. First, the back substrate 2 on which the reflecting layer 3, transparent coat layer 25, colorless boundary layer 5, and colored boundary layer 21 are formed is mounted on the mounting platform 121 as the work 120. The mounting direction is such that the direction in which the colorless boundary layers 5 extend is the Y-axis, and the direction in which the colored boundary layers 21 extend is the X-axis, as depicted in FIG. 2. Droplets 150 of red colored liquid are discharged from the nozzle 117 as depicted in FIG. 8, and the droplets 150 are dropped in an order from one end of a row of deposit portions 7 of a red colored layer, working its way up in the Y-axis direction to the other end of the row of the deposit portions 7, with the discharge head 116 moving in a relative fashion in the Y-axis direction.",
        "The coloring layers 6 are formed by applying the droplets 150 of colored fluid to the openings 4 first, and then to the transparent coat layer 25. More detailed explanation of how the droplets 150 are deposited onto each of the deposit portions 7 will be given below with reference to FIGS. 21-23.",
        "Droplets 150 can also be simultaneously deposited at this time by another nozzle 117 onto another row of deposit portions 7 of the red coloring layers 6R. The red coloring layers 6R are completed by repeating this operation as necessary. The number of times this operation needs to be repeated is determined by the number of rows of deposit portions 7 that are to become the red coloring layers 6R.",
        "In this case, the boundaries of the red coloring layers 6R that are lined up in the Y-axis direction become the non-light-transmissive colored boundary layer 21 that extend in the X-axis direction. Accordingly, there is no effect on performance of the display device even if droplets 150 are inadvertently dropped on the colored boundary layer 21. Therefore, droplets 150 can be discharged continuously and efficiently in the Y-axis direction without having to avoid the colored boundary layer 21. On the other hand, the boundary between the row of green coloring layers 6G and the row of red coloring layers 6R is the colorless boundary layer 5, so droplets 150 must be prevented from landing thereon. However, since the colorless boundary layer 5 is parallel to the Y-axis, and the nozzles 117 move only in the Y-axis direction relative to the work 120, it is easy to prevent the droplets 150 from being accidentally deposited onto the colorless boundary layer 5. In a conventional structure, however, a colorless portion that performs the functions of the colorless boundary layer 5 is provided in an area inside each of the deposit portions 7. Accordingly, it is necessary to prevent the droplets 150 from being deposited to the colorless portion each time the droplets 150 are deposited to the deposit portion 7. Therefore, control of the discharge operation becomes complicated. The arrangement of the colorless boundary layers 5 of the present invention is effective in this regard. The description of method of forming the coloring layer 6R described above also applies to formation of the coloring layers 6G and 6B. After the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B are formed as described above, the overcoat layer 8 is provided so as to cover the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B, the colorless boundary layer 5, and the colored boundary layer 21 (FIG. 11(d)). In this manner, the color filter 40 is completed.",
        "The method for manufacturing the color filter 45 according to the second embodiment is basically the same as that of the color filter 40 of the first embodiment. Accordingly, only the main differences between the two methods will be described. A light-transmissive resin scattering layer 32 having an irregular front face is affixed over the entire front side of the back substrate 2, and a resist film 27 and a scattering and reflecting layer 31 are formed on the resin scattering layer 32. Since the scattering and reflecting layer 31 is a metallic thin film, the scattering and reflecting layer 31 is formed so as to conform to the surface irregularity of the resin scattering layer 32. More over, further irregularity is provided to the surface of the scattering and reflecting layer 31 by oxygen plasma treatment or the like to enhance its scattering effects. The resist film 27 is then removed and the transparent coat layer 25 is formed on the scattering and reflecting layer 31 by screen printing or the like. The subsequent process is the same as manufacturing the color filter 45 of the first embodiment.",
        "It is even more effective to use a manufacturing apparatus described below in order to efficiently form the coloring layers 6R, 6G, and 6B with this droplet-discharging device 100.

        "In manufacturing a prototype or the like, the same droplet-discharging device 100 may be used as the discharging devices 210R, 210G, 2101B, and 210C. Also, the head unit 110 in this case may be configured so as to discharge droplets of colored liquid by the discharge heads 116 for red (R), green (G), blue (B), and the overcoat. For example, the droplet-discharging device 100 can perform the same function as the discharging device 210R of the manufacturing apparatus 200 by using the discharge heads 116 to which red (R) colored liquid is fed to form the red colored layers 6R. The same function may be performed as the discharging device 210G of the manufacturing apparatus 200 by using the discharge heads 116 to which green (G) colored liquid is fed to form the green coloring layers 6G. The blue coloring layer 6B and the overcoat layer 8 may also be manufactured in the same manner. Furthermore, the formation of the transparent coat layer 25, colorless boundary layer 5, and colored boundary layer 21 of the color filters 40 and 45 with the aid of a dispenser or by screen printing, the formation of the orientation films 10 and 13 of the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display devices 1 and 30, and application of the liquid crystal 15 may all be performed with the droplet-discharging device 100, and these functions can be added to the manufacturing apparatus 200 described above.",
        "The method of manufacturing the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display devices 1 and 30, on which the color filters 40 and 45 of the first and second embodiments are respectively mounted as described in the foregoing, will be described using the semi light-transmissive reflecting liquid crystal display device 1 of FIG. 1 as an example.

A rectangular seal 14 that has a notch and is formed in the area of the liquid crystal 15 is formed by screen printing or the like on the orientation film 10 of the back substrate 2. The liquid crystal 15 that is maintained at a temperature suitable for discharge is discharged from the nozzles 117 of the discharge heads 116 to the inside of the seal 14 by using the droplet-discharging device 100. After the liquid crystal 15 is filled, the surface of the orientation film 13 of the front substrate 11 is bonded to the seal 14. The notch is then sealed after the liquid crystal leaking from the notch is removed. The amount of liquid crystal 15 to be deposited at this time is preferably 100% to 110% of the volume of the liquid crystal area so that gaps do not form in the liquid crystal area and extra leakage does not occur.",

The volume of color filter material 305R to be discharged from the nozzles 418 is thereby controlled for each of the nozzles 418 according to the signal from the controller 412. Furthermore, the volume of color filter material 305R to be discharged by each of the nozzles 418 can be varied between 0 pL to 42 pL (pico liters). It is therefore possible to configure the nozzles 418 such that only some of the nozzles 418 perform the discharge during application scanning operation, but not others.",

As a result, the positions of the heads 414 can be moved relative to the stage 406 with the first position control device 404 and the second position control device 408. More specifically, the plurality of heads 414, the plurality of nozzle rows 416, or the plurality of nozzles 418 is moved, and therefore the scanning is performed, in a relative fashion in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction while a prescribed distance is maintained in the Z-axis direction in relation to the deposit portions 350R positioned on the stage 406.

The method whereby the discharging device 400G discharges the color filter material 305R was described with reference to FIGS. 21, 22, and 23.

The black matrix 317 rather possesses lyophilic properties toward the liquid color filter materials 305R, 305G, and 305B. This is because a fluorinated polymer is blended into the banks 330, whereas the black matrix 317 does not contain a fluorinated polymer. Generally, a surface of a resin that contains fluorine demonstrates a higher liquid repellency against a dispersion medium contained in a liquid color filter material than a surface of a resin that does not contain fluorine therein. On the other hand, most resins that do not contain fluorine are lyophilic toward the above-mentioned liquid material.",
        "According to the present embodiment, the banks 330 have a relatively high liquid repellency. Therefore, droplets of color filter material that have just landed on the deposit portions 350R, 350G, and 350B flow out towards the black matrix 317, instead of flowing over the banks 330 and out of the deposit portions 350R, 350G, and 350B. Furthermore, since both a layer having the desired liquid repellency and a lyophilic layer are formed, there is no need to perform a surface modification process for making the black matrix 317 and the banks 330 liquid repellent or lyophilic. For instance, there is no need to perform a plasma treatment that uses tetrafluoromethane as a treatment gas or an oxygen plasma treatment, for example.",

The reflecting surface of the reflective portions 366 formed on the resin scattering layer 371 is therefore also formed with an irregular, rugged surface. The reflecting surface of the reflective portion 366 has an irregular shape, and thereby functions to reflect light in random directions.",
        "The transparent coat layer 365 provided positioned on the reflective portion 366. The transparent coat layer 365 is patterned in the same shape as the reflective portion 366. One object of providing the transparent coat layer 365 is to reduce the color purity of the reflected light.",

        "When the backlight (light source 316) is used, a light beam P from the backlight passes through the transmissive portion 368 after being transmitted through the polarizing plate 320A and the substrate 372. The light beam that passed through the transmissive portion 368 then enters one of the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB, such that a light beam of the corresponding wavelength exits from the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB. The light beam (colored light) from the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB is further transmitted through the liquid crystal layer 314 and the opposing substrate 312 and exits from the polarizing plate 320B.

Each type of colored light is again transmitted through the liquid crystal layer 314 and the opposing substrate 312, and is emitted from the polarizing plate 320B. The intensity of the light beam that originates as the external or other light beam and exits from the polarizing plate 320B is adjusted by adjusting the voltage applied between the electrodes 336 and the electrodes 342.",

        "Thus, the liquid crystal display device 500 is capable of displaying an image using both external light and light from a backlight. The liquid crystal display device 500 having this type of functionality is referred to as a semi light-transmissive reflective display device.",
        "The filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB in the color filter substrate 380 are formed on the opening surfaces 357A of the black matrix 357 by discharging a color filter material from an inkjet device or other discharging device.",

        "The method for manufacturing the liquid crystal display device 500 will next be described.",
        "First, the reflective portion 326 and the transmissive portion 328 are formed on a light-transmissive member. Specifically, a polyimide or other light-transmissive resin layer is formed by spin coating or other method so as to substantially cover the entire surface of a glass substrate or other light-transmissive substrate 372 as depicted in FIG. 27(a), such that the surface of the resin layer is given an irregular rugged shape by blasting or other method. As a result, a resin scattering layer 371 is obtained. The resin scattering layer 371 herein corresponds to the above-mentioned \u201clight-transmissive member.\u201d An aluminum (Al) film is then formed on the resin scattering layer 371 by sputtering or other method. As depicted in FIG. 27(b), the above-mentioned Al film is then patterned so that reflective portions 366 and a transmissive portion 368 are formed for each pixel area G. The Al film remaining on the resin scattering layer 371 after patterning is the reflective portions 366, and the portions from which the Al film is removed are the transmissive portions 368. The reflective portions 366 and the transmissive portion 368 are thereby formed on the light-transmissive member.",
        "The transparent coat layer 365 is then applied to cover the reflective portion 366 and the resin scattering layer 371, and is patterned in the same shape as the reflective portion 366, as depicted in FIG. 27(c). As a result, the light-transmissive coat layers 365 are obtained on the reflective portions 366.",
        "A layer of first material is then formed covering the reflective portions 366 and the transmissive portions 368. In this embodiment, as depicted in FIG. 27(d), a thermosetting acrylic resin in which a black pigment is dispersed (resin black) is applied, up to a thickness of about 3 \u03bcm, as the first material over the light-transmissive coat layers 365 as well as over the substrate 372 that is exposed between the light-transmissive coat layers 365 (in other words, between the reflective portion 366). As a result, a resin black layer 357\u2032 is obtained. The resin black layer 357\u2032 in this case is an example of the \u201cfirst material layer\u201d of the present invention.",
        "The second material layer is then formed by applying a resist on the first material layer. Specifically, a chemical amplification-type acrylic photosensitive resist in which a fluorinated polymer is blended is applied so as to cover the entire surface of the resin black layer 357\u2032 as depicted in FIG. 27(d). As a result, a resist layer 370\u2032 is obtained on the resin black layer 357\u2032. The resist layer 370\u2032 herein is an example of the \u201csecond material layer\u201d of the present invention.",
        "Patterning is then performed on the resist layer 370\u2032 and the resin black layer 357\u2032. Specifically, the resist layer 370\u2032 is irradiated with light h\u03bd via a photomask. The photomask has light-blocking portions in positions that correspond to pixel areas G. A plurality of portions of the resist layer 370\u2032 and the resin black layer 357\u2032 not irradiated with light h\u03bd, which are the portions corresponding to the plurality of pixel areas G, are then removed by etching using a prescribed etching fluid. A black matrix 357 and banks 370 that enclose the subsequently formed filter layer are thus obtained simultaneously on the substrate 372 as depicted in FIG. 27(e). In other words, the opening surfaces 357A opposite the reflective portion 366 and t the ransmissive portion 368 are obtained.",
        "As described previously, the areas defined or enclosed by the black matrix 357, the banks 370, the light-transmissive coat layers 365, and the transmissive portions 368 are the deposit portions 550R, 550G, and 550B. The banks 370 are also light-transmissive. As described previously, the black matrix 317 is also an example of the \u201cfirst layer\u201d of the present invention; and the banks 330 are an example of the \u201csecond layer\u201d of the present invention.",
        "Areas (in other words, the deposit portions 550R, 550G, and 550B) compartmentalized by the black matrix 357 and the banks 370 are thus provided in the substrate 380A by forming the black matrix 357 and the banks 370 positioned on the black matrix 357 on the substrate 372.",
        "The substrate 380A on which the deposit portions 550R, 550G, and 550B are formed is transported to the stage 406 of the discharging device 400R by the transport device 470 (FIG. 13). The discharging device 400R then discharges the color filter material 505R from the head 414 so that a layer of color filter material 505R is formed in all of the deposit portions 550R as depicted in FIG. 28(a). The method whereby the discharging device 400R discharges the color filter material 505R is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material 305R in the previous embodiment described with reference to FIGS. 21, 22, and 23. When a layer of color filter material 505R is formed in all of the deposit portions 550R of the substrate 380A, the transport device 470 positions the substrate 380A in the drying device 450R. The filter layer 505FR is obtained on the deposit portion 550R by completely drying the color filter material 505R on the deposit portions 550R.",
        "The transport device 470 then positions the substrate 380A on the stage 406 of the discharging device 400G. As depicted in FIG. 28(b), the discharging device 400G discharges the color filter material 505G from the head 414 so that a layer of color filter material 505G is formed in all of the deposit portions 550G. The method whereby the discharging device 400G discharges the color filter material 505G is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material 305R in the third embodiment described with reference to FIGS. 21, 22, and 23. When a layer of color filter material 505G is formed in all of the deposit portions 550G of the substrate 380A, the transport device 470 positions the substrate 380A in the drying device 450G. The filter layer 505FG is obtained on the deposit portion 550G by completely drying the color filter material 505G on the deposit portions 550G.",
        "The transport device 470 then positions the substrate 380A on the stage 406 of the discharging device 400B. As depicted in FIG. 28(c), the discharging device 400B discharges the color filter material 505B from the head 414 so that a layer of color filter material 505B is formed in all of the deposit portions 550B. The method whereby the discharging device 400B discharges the color filter material 505B is the same as the method of discharging the color filter material 305R in the previous embodiment described with reference to FIGS. 21, 22, and 23. When a layer of color filter material 505B is formed in all of the deposit portions 550B of the substrate 380A, the transport device 470 positions the substrate 380A in the drying device 450B. The filter layer 505FB is obtained on the deposit portions 550B by completely drying the color filter material 505B on the deposit portions 550B.",
        "The banks 370 in the present embodiment possess a liquid repellency against the liquid color filter materials 505R, 505G, and 505B. Furthermore, the liquid repellency of the black matrix 357 against the color filter materials 505R, 505G, and 505B is smaller than the liquid repellency of the banks 370 against the color filter materials 505R, 505G, and 505B. The black matrix 357 rather possesses lyophilic properties toward the liquid color filter materials 505R, 505G, and 505B. This is because a fluorinated polymer is blended into the banks 370, whereas the black matrix 357 does not contain a fluorinated polymer. Generally, the surface of a resin that contains fluorine demonstrates a higher liquid repellency against the above-mentioned liquid material than the surface of a resin that does not contain fluorine. On the other hand, most resins that do not contain fluorine are lyophilic toward the above-mentioned liquid material.",
        "According to the present embodiment, the banks 370 have a relatively high liquid repellency. Therefore, droplets of color filter material that have just landed on the deposit portions 550R, 550G, and 550B flow out towards the black matrix 357, instead of flowing over the banks 370 and out of the deposit portions 550R, 550G, and 550B. Furthermore, since a layer having the desired liquid repellency and a lyophilic layer are formed, there is no need to perform a surface modification process for making the black matrix 357 and the banks 370 liquid repellent or lyophilic. For instance, there is no need for a plasma treatment that uses tetrafluoromethane as a treatment gas or an oxygen plasma treatment, for example.",
        "Referring back to FIG. 13, the transport device 470 then positions the substrate 380A inside the oven 460. The oven 460 then reheats (post-bakes) the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB.",
        "The transport device 470 then positions the substrate 380A on the stage 406 of the discharging device 400C. The discharging device 400C discharges a liquid material so that the flattening layer 374 is formed covering the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB and the banks 370. After the flattening layer 374 is formed covering the filter layers 505FR, 505FG, and 505FB and the banks 370, the transport device 470 positions the substrate 380A inside the drying device 450C. The drying device 450C completely dries the flattening layer 374, and then the curing device 465 heats and completely cures the flattening layer 374.",
        "A plurality of electrodes 336 is then formed on the flattening layer 374, and an orientation film 338A is provided for covering the plurality of electrodes 336 and the flattening layer 374. In this manner, the substrate 380A becomes a color filter substrate 380 as depicted in FIG. 28(d).",
        "The color filter substrate 380 and the separately fabricated opposing substrate 312 are then bonded to each other such that the orientation film 338A and the orientation film 338B face each other across an intervening spacer. Liquid crystal material is then filled into the space between the orientation films 338A and 338B. Polarizing plates 320A and 320B are then provided, and then a light source 316 is provided. In this manner, a liquid crystal display device 500 is obtained.",

Furthermore, the shared substrate 64 of the color filter unit 51, which is attached to the EL substrate 55 at its periphery, is arranged on the EL counter electrode 62. An inert gas 63 is inserted between the shared substrate 64 and the EL counter electrode 62, thus forming the electro-optic device 600.",
        "The EL substrate 55, the shared substrate 64, and the front substrate 11\u2033 in the electro-optic device 600 thus configured are light-transmissive glass substrates, for example. The coloring layers 6R\u2033, 6G\u2033, and 6B\u2033 of the color filter unit 51 are arranged in a grid such as the one depicted in FIG. 2. The luminescent layer 61, the EL pixel electrodes 59, the positive-hole transport layer 60, the luminescent layer 61, and the EL counter electrode 62 of the organic EL unit 52 are each arranged opposite the coloring layers 6\u2033. The positive-hole transport layer 60 is positioned between the EL pixel electrodes 59 and the luminescent layer 61, and is designed to increase the efficiency of light emission by the luminescent layer 61. The EL pixel electrodes 59 and EL counter electrode 62 may, for example, be light-transmissive ITO electrodes. Each of the EL pixel electrodes 59 and the EL counter electrode 62 is electrically connected to the switching elements 56 to control the luminescence of the luminescent layer 61. The luminescent layer 61 emits white light. This white light is colored by either of the red, green, and the blue coloring layers 6\u2033 to be converted to colored light, and is emitted from the front substrate 11\u2033. Specifically, the organic EL unit 52 acts as a light source that corresponds to each of the coloring layers 6R\u2033, 6G\u2033, and 6B\u2033.",
        "The positive-hole transport layer 60 and the luminescent layer 61, which are essential components of the organic EL unit 52, can be efficiently formed by the droplet-discharging device 100. First, the EL substrate 55, on which the switching elements 56, the insulating film 57, the EL pixel electrodes 59, and the banks 58 are formed, is mounted on the mounting platform 121 as the work 120. The X-axis direction and Y-axis direction of the mounting direction are determined so as to correspond with those of the coloring layers 6R\u2033, 6G\u2033, and 6B\u2033 as depicted in FIG. 2. Droplets of material for forming the positive-hole transport layer 60 are discharged from the nozzles 117 while the discharge heads 116 move in a relative fashion in the X-axis direction. Accordingly, droplets are deposited in the concave portions that are defined by the banks 58 and the EL pixel electrodes 59 and are lined up in the X-axis direction. The positive-hole transport layer 60 is completed by repeating this relative movement several times as necessary. The number of times this depositing operation must be performed is determined according to the arrangement of the nozzles 117 and the number of rows of the concave portions in the Y-axis direction. After the droplets of the positive-hole transport layer-forming material are dried, droplets of an EL luminescent material are discharged onto the positive-hole transport layer 60, and a luminescent layer 61 is formed in the same manner as the manner by which the positive-hole transport layer 60 was formed. After the process involving the droplet-discharging device 100 is completed, the luminescent layer 61 is dried, the EL counter electrode 62 is formed, and both components are bonded together so as to provide a match between the coloring layers 6\u2033 of the color filter unit 15 and the luminescent layer 61 of the organic EL unit 52. Lastly, an inert gas 63 is filled into the space between the EL counter electrode 62 and the shared substrate 64.",

Only parts of the luminescent layer 61 that correspond to coloring layers 6\u2033 of the necessary color emit light. Therefore, it is possible to obtain an extremely low-power display device. Due to the colorless boundary layer 5 of the color filter unit 51, colorless bright light exits from the front substrate 11\u2033, and the overall display is brightened and made easier to see. Alternatively, the organic EL unit 52 may also include an electronic emission element FED (Field Emission Display) and a SED (Surface-Conduction Electron-Emitter Display).",

Specific examples of such electronic instruments include mobile telephones, wristwatches, electronic dictionaries, mobile gaming devices, calculators, miniature televisions, personal computers, navigation devices, POS terminals, and the like.",
        "With the color filter of the present invention, a difference in color saturation of colored light in the reflective display mode and the transmissive display mode can be eliminated by providing a light-transmissive coat layer between the reflecting layer and the boundary layer and changing the thickness of the coloring layer area according to the number of times the light passes through the coloring layers. Furthermore, a structure can be provided in which a liquid material can be appropriately coated on a stepped portion at the boundary between the reflective portion and the transmissive portion.",
