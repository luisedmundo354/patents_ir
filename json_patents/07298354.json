        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates in general to a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a driving method therefor, and more particularly to a LCD with improved motion image quality and a driving method therefor.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "FIG. 1 is a partially schematic illustration showing a conventional amorphous silicon thin film transistor LCD. Referring to FIG. 1, the LCD has a plurality of pixels P arranged in an array, a plurality of scan lines S and a plurality of data lines D orthogonal to the scan lines. Each pixel P has a thin film transistor (TFT) M, a liquid crystal capacitor Clc and a storage capacitor Cst. The liquid crystal capacitor Clc is an equivalent component of a common electrode (not shown) on a top substrate, a pixel electrode (not shown) on a bottom substrate and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) encapsulated between the top substrate and the bottom substrate. The thin film transistor M has a gate coupled to a corresponding scan line, a drain coupled to a corresponding data line, and a source coupled to a corresponding pixel electrode.",
        "The operation state of the LCD will be described by taking the scan lines S(I) and S(I+1), data lines D(J) and D(J+1), and pixels P(I, J) to P(I+1, J+1) as an example. The conventional LCD belongs to a hold type image display mode. When the scan lines S(I) and S(I+1) are sequentially turned on, the voltages corresponding to the pixel data of the pixels P(I, J) to P(I+1, J+1) are respectively inputted to the pixels P(I, J) to P(I+1, J+1) from the data lines D(J) and D(J+1), and these voltages are respectively held by the storage capacitor Cst of each pixel such that the voltage difference between two ends of each liquid crystal capacitor Clc is almost kept at the original voltage for a frame time FT. Therefore, the pixels P(I, J) to P(I+1, J+1) emit light for a frame time FT in order to display the desired frame. The relationship curve between the luminance intensity of a certain pixel and the time while the conventional LCD is displaying an image is shown in FIG. 2.",
        "However, because the conventional LCD belongs to the hold type image display mode, the image dragging phenomenon tends to be caused and the motion image quality is deteriorated when the LCD is displaying the motion images (motion pictures) rapidly. Consequently, it is an important subject in this field to avoid the image dragging phenomenon of the LCD and enhance the motion image quality.",
        "It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a LCD with improved motion image quality and a driving method therefor capable of improving the image dragging phenomenon of the LCD and enhancing the motion image quality.",
        "The invention achieves the above-identified object by providing a liquid crystal display (LCD) with improved motion image quality. The LCD displays a frame during a frame time and comprises a pixel, a video scan line, a video data line, a particular color signal scan line and a particular color signal data line. The pixel has a first switch and a second switch. The video scan line is for controlling the first switch. The video data line is coupled to the first switch. At a first time point, the first switch is turned on, and a video data signal is transmitted to the pixel through the video data line such that the pixel has first luminance intensity. The particular color signal scan line is for controlling the second switch. The particular color signal data line is coupled to the second switch. At a second time point, the second switch is turned on, and a particular color data signal is transmitted to the pixel through the particular color signal data line such that the pixel has second luminance intensity smaller than the first luminance intensity. A time interval between the second time point and the first time point is smaller than the frame time.",

The LCD displays a frame during a frame time and comprises M*N pixels, M video scan lines, N video data lines, M particular color signal scan lines, N particular color signal data lines, a video scan driver, a video data driver and a particular color data driver.",
        "The M*N pixels are arranged in M rows and N columns, and one of the M*N pixels is defined as a pixel (I, J), wherein I is a positive integer smaller than or equal to M, J is a positive integer smaller than or equal to N, and the pixel (I, J) includes a first switch (I, J) and a second switch (I, J). One of the M video scan lines is defined as a video scan line (I), which is for controlling the first switch (I, J). One of the N video data lines is a video data line (J), which is coupled to the first switch (I, J). At a first time point, the first switch (I, J) is turned on and a video data signal (I, J) is transmitted to the pixel (I, J) through the video data line (J) such that the pixel (I, J) has first luminance intensity (I, J). The M particular color signal scan lines respectively receive M particular color scan signals. One of the M particular color signal scan lines is defined as a particular color signal scan line (I), and one of the M particular color scan signals is defined as a particular color scan signal (I). The second switch (I, J) is turned on when the particular color scan signal (I) is enabled. One of the N particular color signal data lines is defined as a particular color signal data line (J), which is coupled to the second switch (I, J). At a second time point, the second switch (I, J) is turned on and a particular color data signal (I, J) is transmitted to the pixel (I, J) through the particular color signal data line (J) such that the pixel (I, J) has a second luminance intensity (I, J), which is smaller than the first luminance intensity (I, J). A time interval between the second time point and the first time point is smaller than the frame time. The video scan driver drives the M video scan lines. The video data driver drives the N video data lines. The particular color data driver drives the N particular color signal data lines.",
        "In addition, the LCD of the invention further comprises a particular color signal scan driver for outputting the M particular color scan signals to drive the M particular color signal scan lines. Alternatively, in the LCD of the invention, another one of the M particular color signal scan lines is defined as a particular color signal scan line (K), wherein K is a positive integer smaller than or equal to M but not equal to I, and the particular color signal scan line (I) is electrically connected to the particular color signal scan line (K).",

        "FIG. 3 shows the relationship between the luminance intensity of a certain pixel and the time when a CRT monitor is displaying an image. As shown in FIG. 3, because the conventional CRT monitor belongs to the impulse type image display mode, electron beams impact upon the fluorescent layer within a frame time FT of one frame such that a certain pixel of the CRT monitor outputs strong light in a very short period of time. Thereafter, the pixel of the CRT monitor quickly returns to the dark state such that the conventional CRT monitor has no image dragging phenomenon. So, the invention has an additional switch in the pixel to turn the pixel into the dark state at the proper time point so as to simulate the impulse type image display mode of the CRT monitor and thus to suppress the image dragging phenomenon of the LCD.",

The pixel P(1,2) further includes a common electrode (not shown) on a top substrate, a pixel electrode (not shown) on a bottom substrate, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) encapsulated between the top substrate and the bottom substrate, wherein all of the electrodes are equivalent to a liquid crystal capacitor Clc(1,2).",
        "The first thin film transistor M1(1,2) has a gate coupled to the video scan line 402(1), a drain coupled to the video data line 404(2), and a source coupled to the liquid crystal capacitor Clc(1,2) and the storage capacitor Cst(1,2). The second thin film transistor M2(1,2) has a gate coupled to the black signal scan line 406(1), a drain coupled to the black signal data line 408(2), and a source coupled to the liquid crystal capacitor Clc(1,2) and the storage capacitor Cst(1,2).",
        "FIG. 6 is a driving waveform diagram showing the display of FIG. 4 according to the first embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 4, the column inversion driving method will be used in the display 400 as an example. At a first time point t1, the video scan signal S(1) is enabled such that the first thin film transistor M1(1,2) is turned on. At this time, the video data signal D(2) is transmitted to the pixel P(1,2) through the video data line 404(2) such that the voltage level of the pixel electrode PE(1,2) of the pixel P(1,2) is the video voltage Vvideo. At this time, the luminance intensity Int(1,2) of the pixel P(1,2) is first luminance intensity I1(1,2). At a second time point t2, the black scan signal BS(1) is enabled such that the second thin film transistor M2(1,2) is turned on. At this time, the black data signal BD(2) is transmitted to the pixel P(1,2) through the black signal data line 408(2) such that the voltage level of the pixel electrode PE(1,2) of the pixel P(1,2) is the black voltage Vblack. At this time, the luminance intensity Int(1,2) of the pixel P(1,2) is a second luminance intensity I2(1,2), which is smaller than the first luminance intensity I1(1,2). A time interval T between the second time point t2 and the first time point t1 is smaller than a frame time FT.",
        "If the frames displayed from the first time point t1 to the third time point t3 belong to the positive polarity drive, the video data signal D(2) received by the pixel P(1,2) is the positive polarity video voltage Vvideo(+), and the black data signal BD(2) received by the pixel P(1,2) is the positive polarity black voltage Vblack(+). If the next frame to be displayed after the third time point t3 belongs to the negative polarity drive, the video data signal D(2) received by the pixel P(1,2) is the negative polarity video voltage Vvideo(\u2212) when the next frame is displayed, and the pixel P(1,2) receives the black data signal BD(2) of the negative polarity black voltage Vblack(\u2212) at a fourth time point t4 when the black data signal BD(2) is enabled. The levels and waveforms of the black data signals BD(1) to BD(N) are adjusted according to the type and driving method of the display 400 such that the corresponding pixel is black. The positive polarity voltage is higher than the common voltage Vcom of the common electrode, and the negative polarity voltage is smaller than the common voltage Vcom.",
        "The time interval T between the second time point t2 and the first time point t1 may be adjusted according to the property of the display 400 such that the image dragging phenomenon may be sufficiently improved when the display 400 is displaying the motion images. In this embodiment, for example, the time interval T is substantially equal to one half of the frame time FT.",
        "Although the embodiment is illustrated by making the pixel P(1,2) black after the second time point t2, it is considered within the scope of the invention as long as the pixel P(1,2) of the LCD of other particular colors is in the dark state or substantially dark state after the second time point t2. This embodiment is to light the pixel P for a time interval T and then to turn the pixel into the dark state, such that the image display mode of the display 400 is similar to the impulse type image display mode. Consequently, the image dragging phenomenon of the display 400 can be improved.",
        "What is different from the first embodiment is that black signal scan lines corresponding to a certain rows of pixels are electrically connected to the video scan lines corresponding to other rows of pixels in the display of the second embodiment, wherein the video scan signals for the other rows of pixels serves as the black scan signals for the certain rows of pixels. This embodiment has the advantage of eliminating the black signal scan driver.",
        "FIG. 7 is an architecture diagram showing a display 700, such as a LCD, with improved motion image quality according to a second embodiment of the invention. The LCD 700, in which M equals 12, N equals 6, and the time interval T between the first time point t1 and the second time point t2 equals one half of the frame time FT, is illustrated in FIG. 7. In FIG. 7, the same symbols denote the same components as those of FIG. 4. Illustration will be make by taking the black signal scan line 406(I) corresponding to the I-th row of pixels as an example. Because the time interval T equals one half of the frame time FT, the black signal scan line 406(I) is electrically connected to the video scan line 402(I+M/2), such that the video scan signal S(I+M/2) transmitted through the video scan line 402(I+M/2) is also transmitted to the black signal scan line 406(1) as the black scan signal BS(I). In addition, the black signal scan line 406(I+M/2) is electrically connected to the video scan line 402(I), such that the video scan signal S(I) transmitted through the video scan line 402(I) is also transmitted to the black signal scan line 406(I+M/2) as the black scan signal BS(I+M/2).",
        "For example, when M equals 12, the black signal scan line 406(1) is electrically connected to the video scan line 402(7), such that the video scan signal S(7) transmitted through the video scan line 402(7) is also transmitted to the black signal scan line 406(1) as the black scan signal BS(1). In addition, the black signal scan line 406(7) is electrically connected to the video scan line 402(1), such that the video scan signal S(1) transmitted through the video scan line 402(1) is also transmitted to the black signal scan line 406(7) as the black scan signal BS(7). The connections between other black signal scan lines and other video scan lines are also similar to that as mentioned above, and detailed descriptions thereof will be omitted.",
        "If the time interval T between the first time point t1 and the second time point t2 is adjusted to be another value, the connections between the black signal scan lines and other video scan lines have to be correspondingly adjusted. For example, if the time interval T equals one third of the frame time FT, the black signal scan line 406(I) is electrically connected to the video scan line 402(I+M/3) in order to achieve the object of reducing the number of black signal scan drivers in this embodiment.",
        "The LCD with improved motion image quality and the driving method therefor according to the above-mentioned embodiments of the invention can improve the image dragging phenomenon of the LCD and enhance the motion image quality.",
        "While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures."
