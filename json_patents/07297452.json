        "This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0112255 filed on Dec. 24, 2004, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "(a) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to a photosensitive resin composition, a thin film panel including a layer made with the photosensitive resin composition, and method of manufacturing the thin film panel. In particular, the invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition for insulation of a display panel.",
        "(b) Description of Related Art",
        "An active type display device such as an active matrix (AM) liquid crystal display (LCD) and an active matrix organic light emitting diode (OLED) display includes a plurality of pixels arranged in a matrix. The pixels in the matrix include switching elements, and the pixel boundaries are usually formed by a plurality of signal lines such as gate lines and data lines for transmitting signals to the switching elements. The switching elements of the pixels selectively transmit data signals from the data lines to the pixels in response to gate signals from the gate lines for displaying images. The pixels of the LCD adjust the transmittance of incident light according to the data signals, while those of the OLED display adjust the luminance of light emission according to the data signals.",
        "The LCD and the OLED displays include a panel provided with the TFTs, the field-generating electrodes, the signal lines, etc. The panel has a layered structure that includes several conductive layers and insulating layers. The gate lines, the data lines, and the field-generating electrodes are formed of different conductive layers and separated by insulating layers.",
        "The insulating layers are made of inorganic or organic insulators. Organic insulators have a transmittance higher than the inorganic insulators, and therefore often result in increased luminance (and an increased reference viewing angle for an LCD). Several of these organic insulators have a photosensitivity level that allows them to be patterned only by lithography without etching, thereby simplifying the display manufacturing process.",
        "However, conventional photosensitive organic insulating layers often have spots or stains. In particular, as the display devices increase in size, slit coating or spin-and-slit coating is preferred to spin coating as a method of forming the organic insulating layers, and the slit coating and the spin-and-slit coating of the organic insulating layers frequently generate stains. The stains may be horizontal stains along a direction of a slit type nozzle of a coating device, vertical stains along a length direction of the slit type nozzle, and irregular spots over an entire surface of a substrate. In addition, portions of the organic layer near the edges of a substrate are sometimes thicker than other portions of the organic layer. These portions with extra thickness may not completely dissolve during the development such that they remain to form stains, degrading the image quality of the display device.",
        "A method and device for forming organic insulating layers with fewer stains is desired.",
        "In one aspect, the invention is a photosensitive resin composition that includes an alkali-soluble resin, a quinone diazide, a surfactant, and a solvent. The surfactant includes:",
        "an organic fluorine compound having the structure",

        "In another aspect, the invention is a thin film panel including: a substrate; a thin film pattern formed on the substrate; and an insulating layer formed on the thin film pattern and made from a photosensitive resin composition including an alkali-soluble resin, a quinone diazide, a surfactant, and a solvent.

        "In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of manufacturing a thin film panel. The method includes: forming a thin film pattern on a substrate; coating a photosensitive resin composition including an alkali-soluble resin, a quinone diazide, a surfactant, and a solvent; performing a light exposure on the photosensitive resin composition; and developing the photosensitive resin composition.

Of these coating methods, the slit-and-spin coating is preferred. After the coating, the photosensitive resin composition may be prebaked to remove volatile ingredients such as solvents, thereby forming the photosensitive resin film containing substantially no volatile ingredient. The photosensitive resin film may have a thickness of about 1.0 microns to about 8.0 microns.",

The illumination of UV on unit area in the second light exposure may be higher than that in the first light exposure. The second light exposure is conducted in order to lighten transparency of the film pattern.",

        "Finally, a plurality of pixel electrodes 190 and a plurality of contact assistants 81 and 82 are formed on the upper passivation film 180q and on the exposed portions of the drain electrodes 175, the end portions 129 of the gate lines 121, and the end portions 179 of the data lines 171 by sputtering, lithography, and etching an IZO or ITO layer as shown FIGS. 7 and 8.",
        "The above-described photosensitive resin composition may be employed to other insulating layers such as the gate insulating layer 140 and the lower passivation film 180p.",
        "Many of the above-described features of the TFT array panel and the manufacturing method thereof shown in FIGS. 1\u20136B may be appropriate to the TFT array panel and the manufacturing method thereof shown in FIGS. 7A\u201310B.",
        "The above-described photosensitive resin composition may be also employed to insulating layers or slope members on the other panel facing a TFT panel. In addition, the above-described photosensitive resin composition may be employed to other display devices such as organic light emitting diode (OLED) display.",
        "While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."
