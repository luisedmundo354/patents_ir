        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to the field of packaging and shipping containers, and more particularly relates to the field of packaging and shipping containers used for toy merchandise.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Packaging and shipping containers are widely used in the toy industry. Conventional packaging and shipping containers for toys typically consist of preformed boxes made of plastic or cardboard materials.",
        "There are numerous problems associated with shipping toy merchandise that are fragile. The most obvious problem is that during shipment the product tends to move within the packaging container which often causes damage to the product. Another significant problem is the damage to the external container which also often results damage to the product inside of the container.",
        "The above problems have traditionally been addressed by surrounding the product being shipped with fabric, foam pellets or formed polystyrene. In addition, heavy damage resistant packaging, such as wood or thick cardboard has also been employed.",
        "However, for most toy merchandise, simple and light weight packaging structures are still mostly desired. In addition, toy merchandise are often displayed in shop shelves or by private collectors where a display platform is often desirable.",
        "Therefore, there exists a need to provide an insert of simple and lightweight construction that can be used in regular cardboard containers for packaging and shipping toy merchandise, which insert can also be used for easy handling and displaying of the toy merchandise once they are removed from the containers.",
        "The present invention discloses a multi-purpose insert for toy containers.",
        "In a preferred embodiments of the present invention, the multi-purpose insert is designed to be used in conjunction with a conventional toy container or box for packaging, shipping and displaying a toy item.

The main section of the base piece has a raised platform surrounded by beveled sidewalls. The two end sections of the base piece each also has a raised center portion surrounded by beveled sidewalls.",
        "The main section and two end sections of the base piece are hingeably connected, where the two end sections can be folded up in a right angle position relative to the main section with the toy item placed on the main section of the base piece. The insert also includes a transparent cover piece which is placed over the toy item, and a holder piece for keeping the two end sections of the base piece at the upright position for retaining the toy item for packaging and shipping purposes.",
        "When removed from the toy container, the present invention insert can also be opened with the holding and cover pieces removed and the two end sections of the base piece folded down in flat alignment with the main section of the base piece for displaying the toy item on the raised platform of the main section of the base piece.",
        "The present invention multi-purpose insert also includes a locking mechanism which secures the toy item in position on the platform of the base piece while it is being packaged, shipped or displayed.",
        "The present invention multi-purpose toy container insert has a simple, easy and durable construction and can be made of plastic, cardboard or other suitable materials.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved device for packaging toy merchandise.",
        "It is also an object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved device for shipping toy merchandise.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved device for displaying toy merchandise.",
        "It is also another object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved packaging, shipping and shipping combination device for toy merchandise.",
        "It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved packaging insert that can be used in conjunction with conventional toy boxes or containers.",
        "It is still another object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved shipping insert that can be user in conjunction with conventional toy boxes or containers.",
        "It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved insert for conventional toy boxes or containers that can be used for displaying toy merchandise after a toy merchandise is removed from its container or box.",
        "It is also an additional object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved insert for conventional toy boxes or containers that can serve multiple purposes of packaging, shipping and displaying toy merchandise.",
        "It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved multi-purpose insert for conventional toy boxes or containers that has a lightweight construction.",
        "It is also a further object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved multi-purpose insert for conventional toy boxes or containers that has a simple and easy construction.",
        "It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a novel, unique and improved multi-purpose insert for conventional toy boxes or containers that is made of durable, lightweight and fire-retardant materials.",
        "These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from a review of the accompanying drawings and the detailed description of the drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 is a prospective view of one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention multi-purpose insert for a toy merchandise to be used in conjunction with a conventional toy container or box;",
        "FIG. 2 is an exploded prospective view showing the component parts of the preferred embodiment of the present invention multi-purpose insert shown in FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 3 is a prospective view showing the present invention multi-purpose insert used for displaying a toy merchandise; and",
        "FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing the locking mechanism of the preferred embodiment of the present invention multi-purpose insert for toy containers.",

        "FIG. 1 shows a toy item 2 (in this example a fire truck) packaged inside the insert 10 in a generally rectangular shaped configuration for insertion into a similarly shaped cardboard container or box (not shown) for packaging and shipping purposes, FIG. 2 shows the insert 10 opened up and unpacked to show the component parts of the insert 10, and FIG. 3 shows the insert 10 used as a base for displaying and exhibition purposes.",
        "The preferred embodiment of the present invention insert 10 includes a base piece 12, a cover piece 14 and a holding piece 16. The base piece 12 has a main section 22, and two end sections 24 and 26 hingeably connected to the opposite ends of the main section 22, respectively.",
        "The main section 22 of the base piece 12 has a raised platform 32 surrounded by beveled sidewalls 34. On the platform 32 there are multiple pegs 36 strategically located for securing the position of the toy item 2 on the platform 32, and one or more key holes 38 which use will be described below.",
        "The two end sections 24 and 26 of the base piece 12 each also has a raised center portion 42 which, when the main section 22 and the end sections 24 and 26 are all laid flat (as shown in FIG. 3), has the same height as the platform 32 of the main section 22 of the base piece 12, and which is surrounded by beveled sidewalls 44.",
        "The beveled sidewalls 34 at the opposite ends of the main section 22 and the adjacent beveled sidewalls 44 of the end sections 24 and 26, respectively, of the base piece 12, are hingeably connected such that the two end sections 24 and 26 can be folded up in a right angle relative to the main section 22 for retaining and protecting the front and rear ends of the toy item 2 for packaging and shipping purposes, or alternatively be folded down in flat alignment with the main section 22 of the base piece 12 to serve as a raised display base for the purpose of exhibiting the toy item 2 (as shown in FIG. 3).",
        "One or both of the end sections 24 and 26 may be provided with an opening 48 which can serve the purpose of accommodating extended portions of the toy item 2 (such as the hood or front bumper of the fire truck shown in this example) and can also serve the purpose of allowing the features of the toy item 2 be viewed while contained in the container which optionally may have a transparent window at corresponding position.",
        "The present invention insert 12 also includes a locking mechanism for locking the toy piece 2 in position while it is being packaged or shipped inside a container or box, or displayed on the base piece 12. The locking mechanism includes one or more keys 18 and a matching number of key holders 20.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, each locking key 18 has a knob 52, a stem 54 and a key pin 56. Each key holders 20 has a plate 62 with a key knob slot 64 and a pair of positioning pegs 66. The size of the plate 62 and the locations of the key knob slot 64 and the pegs 66 of the key holder 20 are made to match the locations of the pegs 36 and key holes 38 of the main section 22 of the base piece 12. The size of the key knob slot 64 also matches the key knob 52 of the locking key 18.",
        "As the key pin 56 and stem 54 of the locking key 18 is inserted through the key knob slot 64 of the key holder 20 and the pegs 66 of the key holder 20 are inserted into the small holes underneath the corresponding pegs 38 of the main section 22 of the base piece 12, the key pin 52 and stem 54 of the locking key 18 is further inserted through the key hole 38 of the main section 22 of the base piece 12 and finally inserted into a bottom lock of the toy item 2.",
        "The key 18 is designed such that by turning the key knob 52 of the locking key 18 to a direction aligned with the key knob slot 64 of the key holder 20, the key pin 56 is locked with the bottom lock of the toy item 2, so that the key knob 52 of the locking key 18 can be inserted in the key knob slot 64 of the key holder 20 which prevents further turning of the key 18 so that the toy item 2 remains locked by the key 18 while being packaged, shipped or displayed.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the cover piece 14 f the present invention insert 10 is placed over the toy item 2 when the toy item 2 is packaged. The cover piece 14 has two opposite sidewalls 72 and two opposite end walls 74 all integrally formed and connected together with a top cover 76. The whole cover piece may be made of transparent plastic material.",
        "The holder piece 16 has an elongated body 82 with two opposite end hooks 84. As the cover piece 14 is placed over the toy item 2 and the two end sections 24 and 26 of the base piece 12 folded up, the holder piece 16 is placed above the cover piece 14 with the two end hooks 84 of the holder piece inserted into and engaged with respectively the slot openings 46 at the beveled sidewalls 44 at the respective distal far end of the end section 24 and 26 of the base piece 12 to thereby prevent the two end sections 24 and 26 from unfolding such that they are kept at an upright angle relative to the main section 22 of the base piece 12 to retain the toy item 2 as shown in FIG. 1 for packaging and shipping purposes.",
        "The present invention insert 12 serves many important purposes for packaging, shipping and displaying the toy item 2. As shown in FIG. 1, when the insert 12 is configured to retain the toy item 2, it provides impact protection on all sides of the toy item 2. It also provides a locking mechanism to secure the toy item 2 in position so it cannot move around inside a packaging container or box while being handled or shipped. On the other hand, when the insert 12 is opened as shown in FIG. 3, it serves as a raised exhibition platform for displaying the toy item 2.",
        "It is appreciated that while an insert that is suitable to be used in conjunction with a generally rectangular shaped packaging container or box is described hereinabove, the present invention multi-purpose insert may be configured to suit packaging containers or boxes of other configurations, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.",
        "The method used in preparing the package comprises the steps of aligning the openings in the product and in the packaging so that the keys can be inserted through the aligned openings and the key can then be turned by the handle so as to fix the product to the packaging. The packaging can be used to substantially cover the entire product or only a portion of the product.",
        "In the preferred embodiment at least one slot formed in the product is oriented parallel to the axis of the product and at least one second slot is at a different orientation, preferably 90 degrees to the first slot.",
        "While the present invention has been described in detail with regards to the preferred embodiments, it is appreciated that other variations of the present invention may be devised which do not depart from the inventive concept of the present invention."
