        "The present disclosure relates generally to a downhole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) apparatus, data processing, and interpretation methods for evaluating a characteristic of a region, and particularly for detecting and quantifying a gas-bearing earth formation in a subterranean region.",
        "NMR well logging is a technique used to investigate subterranean regions that may contain water, oil and/or gas reserves. The nuclei of chemical elements have a characteristic angular momentum (spin) and a magnetic moment, and by detecting and analyzing the reaction of the nuclei to applied magnetic fields, the characteristics of specific nuclei may be deduced. In the presence of an externally applied static magnetic field (B0), the nuclei spins become magnetized and align themselves parallel to the B0 field. By applying a radio frequency (RF) pulse train of a specific frequency to the magnetized nuclei, a pulsed RF magnetic field (B1) is generated that tips, or flips, the spins away from the direction of the B0 field. If the RF frequency (\u03c9) substantially matches the condition for NMR (\u03c9=\u03b3B0), where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, then the first pulse (herein referred to as A pulse) reorients the magnetization to start precession and subsequent pulses (herein referred to as B pulses) generate spin-echo signals. A RF pulse sequence known as the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) sequence is typically used for well logging.",
        "At the end of an A pulse, the spins are oriented transverse to the B0 field and precess around the direction of the B0 field at the Larmor frequency (\u03c90=\u03b3B0), and the transverse magnetization dephases with a transverse relaxation time constant (T2), also known as the spin-spin relaxation time. Repeated tipping and relaxation of the spins results in the NMR spin-echo signal, which may then be detected and analyzed for oil and/or gas field exploration.",
        "Existing methods use dual wait-time logs and the T1 contrast between gas and other formation fluids for gas detection and for gas saturation estimation. One such method is based on the assumption that water signals are fully polarized at both short and long wait time, TW, but gas signal is only partially polarized. So the difference between the two is contributed from gas only. However, if three phases coexist in the NMR detected sensitive volume, especially if slow relaxing water signal and light oil or oil-based mud filtrates are present in the formation, detection may be difficult or limited. Other methods for acquiring and processing multiple wait time data for T1 estimation employ improved log quality data using a summation of echoes approach, which is more useful if all of the partially polarized signal is gas. However, the certainty of the signal is reduced for discerning gas using this technique for wells drilled with OBM (oil based mud), and the subsequent invasion of the OBMF (oil based mud filtrate) into the sensitive volume, or for formations containing large-pore water or light oil. Thus skilled human interpretation is required in order to use existing art techniques. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a robust NMR detection and analysis method that overcomes these drawbacks.",

A two-dimensional inversion method is used to obtain images of the ratio of T1/T2app vs. T2app from NMR logs acquired using multiple wait times (TW), which is represented by a signal intensity map. Embodiments disclosed herein, however, are not limited to the use of multiple wait times. The technique is particularly useful and robust for detecting and quantifying light hydrocarbons such as gas and retrograde condensates. In another embodiment, it can also be used to detect the existence of large vugs in carbonate formations.",
        "An embodiment of the invention is particularly useful in situations where a large diffusion contrast, and consequently a large T1/T2app contrast, exists. As such, embodiments of the invention are useful for discerning gas from liquids, such as oil and water. Instead of the existing methodologies of inverting one-dimensional T1 and T2 relaxation times separately, or inverting two-dimensional T1 and T2 relaxation times jointly, in an exemplary embodiment, it will be appreciated that a direct inversion of T1/T2app vs. T2app offers significant advantages.",
        "First, the high T1/T2app contrasts between gas and liquid provides a distinctive signature on a T1/T2app vs. T2app image (map) that facilitates robust data interpretation. Second, by selecting the frequencies (and, thus, the magnetic field gradients) and/or inter-echo time (TE), the gas T2app is constrained to a narrow range, for example, from about 40 milliseconds (msec) to about 150 msec. Thus, the gas signal location on the T1/T2app vs. T2app image is always narrowly defined, which substantially simplifies data interpretation. Third, physical constraints, such as T1/T2app may be more readily applied to reduce some noise-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, it is often difficult to construct the T1/T2app ratio from T1 and T2 based on predetermined times (that is, bins) as the inversion artifacts and noise effects make bin-by-bin computations nearly impossible. Thus, bin-to-bin ratios work at most only for gas wells where a significant amount of gas signal is apparent. Advantageously, the techniques disclosed herein work even when gas-saturation levels are relatively small. In addition, exemplary embodiments employing the inversion processing method disclosed herein work well even when the echo data are relatively noisy (in a salt-saturated mud well for example). Further embodiments of the invention enable the T1 spectra to be reconstructed from the recovered T1/T2app and the corresponding T2app spectra.",

Conversion between the two models may be seen by comparing the three equivalent fluid property ranges 170, 175, 180 that are marked with similar shading patterns. In the exemplary embodiment depicted by FIGS. 2 and 3, a gas containing water-wet porous formation may be depicted where the water part is represented by T1(w)=30 msec, T2diff(w)=300 msec, and the gas part is represented by T1(g)=3000 msec, T2diff(g)=200 msec. Applying the terminology relationships presented earlier, the T2app values for the water and gas parts may be calculated as T2app(w)=(300*30)/(300+30)=27.3 msec and T2app(g)=(200*3000)/(200+3000)=187.5 msec. Applying the definition for R=T1/T2app, yields R(w)=1.1 and R(g)=16.

Since Dgas>>max(Doil,Dwater), the ratio R=T1/T2app is close to 1 for a liquid-phase signal, but is much greater than 1 for a gas-phase signal. As a result of this distinctive feature between gas and liquids, embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for gas identification.",

In contrast, the traditional one-dimensional (1D) inversion processing method calculates the apparent T2 only. Like the requirement of setting T2inti bins and diffusivity Dj bins in the 1D method, embodiments of the herein disclosed 2D method require a predetermination of both the T2appi bins and the ratio (R=T1/T2app)j bins, respectively, which is represented by the indices of Equation-3.",
        "By treating the T1/T2app and T2app parameters independently, these unknowns become generic parameters (bins), instead of linking them to individual fluid types. Consequently, fluid-typing interpretation of the instant invention is carried out in the parameter domain rather than at the inversion stage. As such, embodiments of the invention are different from forward-modeling based inversion techniques, such as SIMET (simultaneous inversion of multiple echo trains) for example.",

        "From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that Equation-8 is representative of the observed NMR echo data Mi, which constitutes the left side of Equation-7, and mj represents the unknown intensities of g(T2app, R)j, which is on the right side of Equation-7. Accordingly, and to solve for mj, one must multiply both sides of Equation-7 by the inverse of the two-dimensional matrix Aij from Equation-11. The solution of which results in the j-th value of signal intensity map mij for each i-th T2app.",
        "Due to the existence of noise in NMR logging data and the ill-conditioned nature of matrix A, the solution to Equation-7 can be challenging. To assist in a suitable solution for matrix m, which reduces random noise effects and provides a smoother curve fit of model to data, a regularized non-negative least square formulation is applied to the inversion model according to the following equation\n\n\u2225Am\u2212d\u222522+\u03b1\u2225Wmm\u222522=min subject to m\u22670.\u2003\u2003(12)",
        "In Equation-12, the notation \u201c\u2225 \u2225\u201d stands for the Euclidean norm of its vector argument (or the maximum singular value of the matrix argument). The first term \u2225Am\u2212d\u2225 of Equation-12 comes from Equation-7, and represents the least square portion that serves to minimize the misfit by fitting the model matrix m to the data matrix d. The second term \u03b1\u2225Wmm\u2225 of Equation-12 is a regularization term that serves to penalize the solution by fitting the model matrix m to the data matrix d to a minimum \u201cmin\u201d level that is higher than the model and data alone, thereby making the solution more stable and smoother.",
        "The regularization parameter \u03b1 is estimated from the results of a relatively inexpensive preliminary non-constrained inversion, such that it balances the contributions of the misfit (first) and stabilizer (second) terms. It produces similar \u03b1 estimates to the well known L-curve or S-curve methods at a lesser cost. Matrix Wm embodies additional information about the desired solution, which is discussed in more detail below. The method of regularization and Least Squares minimization is not limited to a particular algorithm, and employs known techniques.",
        "To single out a useful and stable solution, the stabilizer term in Equation-12 is defined such that Wm is nonsingular. In an exemplary embodiment, it is either the identity matrix or an nth derivative operator, which forces the solution to be small and/or smooth. However, in NMR logging applications it is often desirable to strive for solutions with a high spectral resolution from noisy data. Such sharp features may be achieved by using focusing stabilizers, where the basic idea is described as follows. After obtaining an initial solution, typically by a smooth stabilizer, very small elements ms<\u03b5\u00b7max(m) are excluded. Then, a second minimization process is run with Wm(k,k)=max(m)/mk. A small mk results in a large weight in the stabilizer of the second step, forcing that particular element to be even smaller. The procedure is repeated until no further elements are excluded, that is, only those elements with significant contribution remain. In applying this process, care should be exercised to avoid over-focusing, where only one or a few elements remain. This may be accomplished by defining different termination criteria, or by applying additional side constraints, which will now be described.",
        "Embodiments described herein employing the 2D inversion method having T2app as one of the dimensions has a distinctive advantage over those methods involving T2int because of the straightforward connection to the standard 1D T2app spectra. Also by selectively controlling the data acquisition parameters (such as frequency and TE for example), the T2app for gas is predictably controlled in the middle of the commonly occurring T2app range. Water in this T2app range generally has only a small diffusion effect. Theoretically, the summation of the g(T2app, R) along R matches the T2app spectra derived from a single fully polarized echo train. Therefore, a constraint may be constructed that requires the sum of the corresponding 2D parameters to be the same as the readily available T2app distribution. That is, the sum of the two-dimensional intensity map 225 is constrained in the vertical direction with respect to the T2app axis so that it is the same as a corresponding standard one-dimensional T2app distribution. This constraint not only serves as a useful side constraint in the focusing inversion, but it also makes the 1D and 2D inversion method results consistent. This side constraint methodology is referred to as a 1D constraint.",
        "An exemplary result from an embodiment of the 2D inversion method is a set of 2D images similar to those depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B, which may be presented in color, shades of gray, high and low density speckling, varied cross-hatching, or any other visually defining scheme. In the exemplary embodiments depicted by FIGS. 4A and 4B, the signal intensities from the solution of g(T2app, R), alternatively referred to as the solution map 225, are each plotted and illustrated with respect to a color-coded image intensity scale, with red representing a high signal intensity and blue representing a low signal intensity. Here, FIG. 4A illustrates a gas signal 195, while FIG. 4B illustrates an oil signal 200. Because gas has a higher R value than either oil or water, the gas signal, if any, appears at the top middle of the 2D plot (see FIG. 4A). If the interval of interest has a liquid signal only, the bright spot (high signal intensity) is close to the bottom of the 2D plot (see FIG. 4B). The horizontal location (along the T2app axis) of the gas signal on the 2D image depends on gas properties (dry or wet for example), environment (temperature and pressure for example), and the gas constituents (methane or ethane for example), as well as experimental conditions (frequency and TE for example). For data acquired with the known standard PoroPerm+Gas sequence acquisition, the gas signal is usually shown in the T2app range between 64 msec to 256 msec. A water signal location depends on pore structures, and an oil signal location depends on viscosity.",
        "In addition to the R plot, a reconstructed T1 log may be plotted along with T2app log. The following Table-1 provides guidance on how to identify a gas signal from a comparison between the T1 and T2app logs.",

        "FIG. 5 illustrates a likely observance on a T1 and T2app log comparison for a gas zone, where the presence of a gas signal 205 requires a comparison of the two logs. As with FIGS. 4A and 4B, the illustration of FIG. 5 may be presented in color, shades of gray, or any other visually defining scheme.",
        "In addition to the qualitative observation of the one-dimensional T1 and T2app logs, the clear separation of the gas and liquid phases in the two-dimensional representation and/or in the T1 and T2app logs, may be used to quantify gas and liquid filling pore volumes and the corresponding saturations.",
        "The apparent volume of gas may be obtained by summing up intensities in the domain defined as R\u2267Rc, where Rc is defined as a cutoff threshold value of R. The cutoff value Rc is defined such that high-intensity signals having a value of R equal to or greater than Rc are categorized as light hydrocarbon signals and high-intensity signals having a value of R less than Rc are categorized as liquid phase signals. The apparent volume of gas (VT) in the region 165 is determined by summing up the light hydrocarbon signal intensities in the map 225 domain defined by R equal to or greater than Rc. The actual gas volume (Vg) is obtained by applying a hydrogen index correction (HIg) to the apparent gas volume (VT), thereby defining an HI corrected pore volume, according to the following equation:\n\nHIg=Vg/VT.\u2003\u2003(13)",
        "The liquid pore volume in the region 165 is determined by summing of intensities in the map 225 defined by R<Rc, where a hydrogen index correction may be applied if necessary. The total porosity in the region 165 is obtained by summing the actual gas (HI corrected) pore volume with the liquid pore volume. The gas saturation, being a function of the HI corrected pore volume and the total porosity, is determined by taking the ratio of the actual gas volume over the total pore volume.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates the application of the cutoff threshold value Rc 210 to the 2D signal intensity image map 225 of g(T2app, R). The boundaries of the parameter domain and the value of Rc are calculated by taking into consideration borehole temperature, borehole pressure, gas compositions in the area, acquisition parameters G and TE, and measurement noise. The T2app bounds are determined by TE and the field gradient value G used for acquiring the echo trains, and the fluid property that may be affected by temperature and pressure. For example, a typical T2app for MR ExplorerSM (MR ExplorerSM is a magnetic resonance openhole wireline logging tool available from Baker Hughes Incorporated) has a data range between 0.5 and 2048 msec. The discretization density used for volume modeling is typically chosen to be the square-root of 2, but is not limited to this number.",
        "In the calculation of the upper bound in R, it is desirable to constrain the number of unknowns in the R direction so that they do not significantly exceed the number of different wait times (TW). However, it is desirable for the upper bound in R to significantly exceed the highest expected fluid R value so that the gas signal is appreciably separated from the fluid signals. Since T1\u2267T2app, the minimum value of R is always 1.",
        "As an example, in a typical PoroPerm+Gas acquisition with 6 different wait times (TW), it is desirable for the number of different R values not to be greater than 9. Using the same bin increments as for T2app, a value of Rmax=16 is obtained, which leaves enough room to separate the gas signal from most liquid phase signals, which have an R value that is almost always below 4 to 6, in the case of TE\u22660.6 msec. In an embodiment, an Rc of 10 is selected, such that signal intensities having a value of R\u226710 is representative of a gas-phase substance, and signal intensities having a value of R<10 is representative of a liquid-phase substance, which is illustrated in FIG. 6.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, the one-dimensional T1 and T2app distributions 215, 220 may be obtained from the 2D intensity plot 225 by summing up the 2-dimensional intensity plot along the directions of the arrows 230, 235 pointing towards the 1-dimensional plots 215, 220. For example, the one-dimensional T2app distribution 220 may be determined by summing up the two-dimensional intensity map 225 in a vertical manner (arrow 235) with respect to the T2app axis, and the one-dimensional T1 distribution 215 may be determined by summing up the two-dimensional intensity map 225 from the T2app axis in a diagonal manner (arrow 230) toward the R axis. In FIG. 7, high-intensity signals are depicted by shaded ovals 240, 245 and 250. The one-dimensional representations may be used to obtain standard NMR deliverables, such as MCBW (MR clay bound water), MBVI (MR bulk volume irreducible), MBVM (MREX bulk volume movable), MPHS (MR total porosity), MPHE (MR effective porosity), and MPRM (MR permeability), for example. Also, the T2app and T1 distributions may be reconstructed into logs in response to the distributions having been determined on a depth by depth basis.",
        "In an embodiment and from the reconstructed one-dimensional T2app and T1 distributions, the presence of a gas-bearing zone in region 165 may be determined in response to a high-intensity signal having a T2app relaxation time less than about 512 msec, and a T1 relaxation time equal to or greater than about 512 msec and equal to or less than about 8192 msec.",
        "The T1 processing is insensitive to the very fast relaxing fluid components such as CBW and some BVI because a limited number of short TWs is applied. However, T2app always yields more accurate CBW and BVI information. Thus, it is recommended to use the T2app based rather than the T1 based CBW and BVI.",
        "In accordance with the foregoing discussion, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention include a NMR well logging tool 100 capable of generating a magnetic field gradient G, a pulse echo time spacing TE, and a pulse wait time TW suitable for subterranean well logging, and capable of practicing the method 300 depicted in the flow diagram of FIG. 8.",
        "With reference to FIG. 8 and in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, NMR echo data (also herein referred to as NMR logging data in relation to a log) is acquired 305, an R distribution is defined 310 according to Equation-4, and a signal intensity map 225 is generated 320 by processing 315 the T2app and R distributions as separate bins along with the NMR echo data in accordance with Equations-3 and 7, where the inverse of the two-dimensional matrix A from Equation-11 is applied to solve for matrix m. The resultant signal intensity map 225 (depicted in illustrative form by FIGS. 3, 6 and 7, and in numerical solution form by FIGS. 4A and 4B) is generally representative of a parameter of interest relating to the region 165, and in an embodiment is specifically representative of the presence of light hydrocarbon within the region 165, as depicted by FIG. 4A. According to the teaching disclosed herein regarding the R vs. T2app characteristics of gas-phase and liquid-phase substances in region 165, it is possible to identify 325 the presence of light hydrocarbon from the location of a high-intensity signal on the map 225. In an exemplary embodiment, and with Reference to FIG. 4A, a gas signal, signifying a gas-bearing zone within region 165, occurs on map 225 within a first range of T2app values equal to or greater than about 16 msec and equal to or less than about 256 msec, and a first range of R values equal to or greater than about 10. In another exemplary embodiment, the light hydrocarbon signal represented on the map 225 has a value of T2app equal to or greater than about 64 msec. In a further exemplary embodiment, and with reference to FIG. 4B, a liquid-phase signal, signifying a liquid-phase substance within region 165, occurs on map 225 at an R value equal to about 1 for any value of T2app. From different map signatures, a gas-bearing zone may be identified as containing retrograde condensates or dry gases.",
        "An exemplary embodiment of the invention also includes a 2D display of a NMR image of R vs. T2app in log form, which will now be discussed with reference to FIG. 9. As used herein, the term log form refers to a series of several displays of NMR data relative to the depth of the logging tool, with each display being referred to as a track. In FIG. 9, tracks 1-6 of a NMR log are illustrated, with tracks 1-5 displaying typical readouts known in the well logging industry, and track 6 displaying a series of maps 225 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Here, the individual images (maps) of R vs. T2app (herein also referred to as frames) are separated by a white line, with each image representing the data corresponding to the middle of the actual depth interval defined by the distance between the two white lines. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to displaying only the middle data, and may also include the display of other analytical results performed on the data from the depth interval, such as an averaged value for example. By providing a 2D NMR map of R vs. T2app in log form, one can readily identify the presence of a light hydrocarbon signal in the region 165, as depicted by the boxed portion 255 in frame-7 of the series of maps 225 on track 6 of FIG. 9.",
        "As discussed previously, an embodiment of apparatus 100 may include processing circuit 120 and storage medium 125, where storage medium 125 is readable by processing circuit 120 and stores instructions for execution by processing circuit 120 for performing the method 300 according to the previously discussed embodiments. However, it will be appreciated that the processing of the data logged by apparatus 100 may or may not occur locally. For example, an embodiment of the invention may include a local storage medium 125 at apparatus 100, but a remote processing circuit 120 at surface equipment 150. Another embodiment of the invention may include a remote storage medium 125 and a remote processing circuit 120 at surface equipment 150, with a communication link via a hardwire (not shown) running alongside cable 135 for example, or via a wireless communication scheme.
