No. 7,153,422, and a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/767,513, filed Jan. 29, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,156,991. The '408 application is a continuation-in-part of the '513 application.",
        "The invention relates to fluid supply systems, and more particularly to a pressure gradient dosing system for a fluid supply system.",
        "The following section is taken from the above noted parent applications.",
        "The parent inventions are directed to a liquid filtration system and to a method of treating the liquid in the enclosed system.",
        "Filter assemblies are commonly used to protect combustion engines by filtering out contaminants and thereby preventing damage to the engine and other downstream components such as valves, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and related other components. To maintain engine performance and reliability, the filter assemblies must be replaced, often as frequently as every 2,000 to 4,000 vehicle miles.",
        "It can be equally important to add agents to the fuel to reduce damage to the engine and related downstream components and/or to enhance the performance of the engine. For example, since the early 1990's diesel fuel producers have significantly reduced the sulfur content in diesel fuel to reduce the environmental harm that was attributed to the burning of high sulfur content fuels. However, the naturally occurring sulfur in the diesel fuel also acted as a lubricant. The resulting low sulfur content diesel fuel caused increased wear on the diesel engine and, in particular, to the fuel pump and injectors, which in turn caused significant harm to the overall operation, performance, and efficiency of the engine and even to the environment. Consequently, various additives were developed to increase not only the lubricity but also to enhance fuel stability, fuel combustion, and engine performance.",
        "It is difficult to maintain a constant or desired level of the additive in the fuel. Typically an operator adds a bottled additive or additive concentrate to the vehicle fuel tank with each fuel fill-up. While many bottled fuel additives are commercially available, often operators do not consistently add the additive with each fill-up\u2014the additive might not be readily available or the operator may forget to include the additive. Combining the additive with fuel in the fuel tank may not reliably provide a homogenous fuel/additive mixture.",
        "Fuel tanks do not include reliable methods for mixing fuel. Generally operators rely upon the turbulence created during a fill-up and by vehicle motion to mix the additive and fuel. Furthermore, the additive concentration in the fuel may vary, depending upon the amount of fuel in the fuel tank\u2014assuming a set amount of additive is added with each fill-up.",
        "Various alternative methods have been developed to add the additives to fuel. One method includes providing a fuel additive in a filter assembly such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,554 issued to Martin et al., which adds the additive to the fuel under diffusion-controlled conditions.",
        "Another method is disclosed by Davis in U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,942, which includes a filter assembly with a solid fuel additive that dissolves in the fuel as the additive contacts the fuel in the filter assembly.",
        "The parent inventions provide a novel method of treating fuel by capitalizing on the existence of or developing a fluid pressure gradient within the filter assembly. The pressure gradient can then be harnessed to continuously add the fuel additive to the fuel flowing through the filter assembly. Consequently, the parent inventions provide novel advancements and additionally provides a wide variety of benefits and advantages in the relevant subject matter.",
        "While the above discussion has been directed toward filter assemblies, the parent inventions provide a novel filter assembly and method of treating the fluid flowing through that filter, regardless of whether that liquid is a fuel. The principles embodied in the parent inventions apply to filters in general and can be used in filter assemblies, hydraulic filters, lubricant filters, and/or coolant filters.",
        "The parent applications relate to a novel filter assembly, the manufacture and use thereof. Various aspects of the parent applications are novel, nonobvious, and provide various advantages. While the actual nature of the parent applications covered therein can only be determined with reference to the claims appended thereto, certain forms and features, which are characteristic of the preferred embodiments disclosed therein, are described briefly as follows.",
        "In one form, the parent inventions provide a filter that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber and including an inlet, an outlet, and a fluid pathway for a liquid flowing through the interior chamber. Liquid flowing through the fluid pathway generates a pressure gradient within the interior chamber such that in a first region of the interior chamber, the flowing liquid exhibits a first (higher) fluid dynamic pressure and in a second region the flowing liquid exhibits a second (lower) fluid dynamic pressure. The filter also includes a filter element disposed in the interior chamber in the fluid pathway between the inlet and the outlet and a container disposed within the interior chamber. The container has an exterior wall that defines an interior region. The container also includes a first opening with a first capillary tube extending from the exterior wall and a second opening through the exterior wall and spaced apart from the first opening. The first opening and said second opening each provide fluid communication between the interior chamber and the interior region. A liquid additive can be deposited in the interior region. The liquid additive can be selected to provide a benefit to at least one of a fuel, oil, lubricant, and coolant.",
        "In another form the parent inventions provide a filter that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber and including an inlet and an outlet into the interior chamber; and a filter element disposed in the interior chamber between the inlet and the outlet, where the filter element partitions the interior chamber into two regions\u2014an entering region proximate to the inlet and an exiting region proximate to the outlet. The filter also includes a container disposed within the interior chamber and defining an interior region. The container has a first capillary tube extending into the entering region and a second capillary tube providing fluid communication between the interior region and the interior chamber. A liquid additive, which has been selected to provide a benefit to the liquid flowing through the filter, can be deposited in the interior region of the container.",
        "The parent inventions also provide a method of supplying an additive to the liquid flowing through a filter assembly. The method comprises generating a dynamic fluid pressure gradient within the filter housing; providing an additive in a container within the filter housing; positioning an inlet port for the container proximate to an area of a first dynamic fluid pressure within the filter housing; and positioning an outlet port for the container proximate to an area of a second dynamic fluid pressure less than the first dynamic fluid pressure thereby inducing the liquid additive to flow out of the container.",
        "In other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber; a filter element disposed within the housing and that partitions the interior chamber into an inlet region and a filtered region. The container is positioned within the housing and defines a reservoir. The container includes a first opening that allows the fluid from the inlet region into the reservoir and a second opening allowing the additive or a mixture of the additive and the fluid to flow out of the reservoir toward the outlet to the assembly.",
        "In other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly for filtering a fluid. The filter comprises a housing defining an interior chamber, the housing including a nut plate having an inlet and an outlet for the fluid. The filter also includes a filter element that is permeable to the fluid and which is disposed within the housing; and a container that is also positioned within the housing. The container defines a reservoir configured for receipt of a liquid additive. The container also includes a first opening allowing fluid entering from the inlet to flow into the reservoir and a second opening allowing a liquid additive deposited within the reservoir to flow toward the outlet. The first opening and the second opening are configured to allow fluid to flow through the container at a fluid face velocity (and hence corresponding pressure drop) therethrough) of about less than 50% of the fluid face velocity of the primary flow through the filter element.",
        "In still other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly for filtering a fluid. The filter comprising: a housing defining an interior chamber, the housing including a nut plate having an inlet and an outlet for the fluid; a filter element permeable to the fluid and disposed within the housing; and a container positioned within the housing. The container defines a reservoir configured for receipt of a liquid additive and can further include a first opening allowing fluid entering from the inlet to flow into the reservoir and a second opening allowing a liquid additive deposited within the reservoir to flow to the outlet. The second opening is constricted relative to the first opening to attenuate the fluid flow into the container.",
        "A pressure gradient dosing system is provided for a fuel supply system.",
        "In one implementation, the invention arose during development efforts directed toward a need in light duty fleets, such as beverage delivery and refuse collection trucks, that are retrofitting aftertreatment devices on vehicles. Some fleets are using a fuel born catalyst to help particulate trap regeneration due to the duty cycles. The preventative maintenance cycles of the fleets may be 12,000 miles or six months, whichever comes first. Pressure gradient slow release filters have a liquid capacity to perhaps treat fuel for 5,000 miles (approximately 600 to 800 gallons of fuel), and hence filter capacity is a limiting factor in drain intervals. A dosing canister capable of holding enough additive to reach 12,000 miles (approximately 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of fuel) would be an advantage. Some fleets are having to go to diesel particulate filters for catalytic aftertreatment for reduction of emissions. Such fleets are typically installing mechanical dosing systems to provide a method of using a liquid fuel born catalyst. In order to achieve a 1,500 hour preventative maintenance cycle, an improved and lower cost option is needed. Current pressure gradient filters are limited for use in low mileage, low hour operating applications, such as beverage delivery trucks, refuse collection trucks, etc., and cannot effectively be used on heavy duty on-highway fleet applications. It is desired to provide a dosing system to treat vehicles that operate on 25,000 to 30,000 mile drain intervals and burn 3,800 to 4,600 gallons of diesel fuel. 2007 engines will likely be using diesel particulate filters with active regeneration, but still may need a way to passively regenerate the diesel particulate filter using a fuel born catalyst. A line of fuel additives that can be packaged in a dosing canister or housing for remote mounting on a heavy duty on-highway truck engine is desirable. A fleet could apply a winter conditioner using a dosing canister on a vehicle when winter is approaching and effectively provide winter gel protection. Furthermore, lubricity currently has a limitation of approximately 500 hours of operation, and a remote mounted dosing canister could double the preventative maintenance cycle.",
        "The present invention also arose during continuing development efforts related to the above noted parent '408 and '513 applications, though is not limited thereto, and may be used as a pressure gradient dosing system for various fluid supply systems. The present invention may be used with or without the filter element of the noted parent applications.",

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the parent applications is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the described filters, cartridges, and processes, and any further applications of the principles of the parent applications as described herein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the parent applications relate.",
        "FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a filter assembly 10 provided in accordance with the parent applications. FIG. 2 is an exploded, cross-sectional view of the same filter assembly 10. Filter assembly 10 includes a housing or outer casing 12 defining an interior chamber 14. A nut plate 16 is secured across an open end 13 of casing 12. Nut plate 16 provides at least one inlet 18, preferably a plurality of inlets, and at least one outlet 20. In the illustrated embodiment, nut plate 16 includes a plurality of inlets 18 encircling a centrally-located outlet 20. Both inlet(s) 18 and outlet 20 provide fluid communication with interior chamber 14 to allow a liquid such as, and organic based fuel, lubricant, or oil fluid; or an aqueous based coolant, to flow into and out of interior chamber 14. Additionally, a filter element 22 and a vessel or container 24 and, optionally, biasing element 26, are provided in interior chamber 14.",
        "Filter element 22 is positioned in a fluid pathway between the liquid entering through inlet 18 and exiting through outlet 20. Additionally, filter element 22 can partition interior chamber 14 into a liquid entering region 28 and a liquid exiting region 30. Filter element 22 is provided in the form of any known and commercially available filter material. Examples of a material that can be used as a filter element include paper (cellulose), cloth, polyester, wire mesh, plastic mesh, gradient density melt-blown polymeric materials, and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, filter element 22 is provided as a cylindrical sleeve formed of a pleated sheet of filter material. The cylindrical sleeve defines a centrally-located axis 23. On either end of the cylindrical sleeve, filter element 22 is supported within interior chamber 14 with a first and second filter endcaps 31 and 33 to provide a fluid-tight seal. Consequently, a liquid flowing through filter assembly 10 must pass through filter 22 to flow from entering region 28 to exiting region 30.",
        "Filter assembly 10 can also includes a water in fuel sensor and/or drain valve 35 in outer casing 12. It will be understood that for some applications the filter assembly need not include a drain valve. However, when present, drain valve 35 can be used to drain out any water that has separated from a non-aqueous liquid such as the organic based fuels, oils, and lubricants. The separated water can collect in the bottom of the interior chamber 14. The water droplets can flow down between the inside wall of casing 12 and the exterior wall of container 24, which can have vertically extending spacers 37 to separate and centrally position container 24 in the interior chamber 14.",
        "Referring additionally to FIG. 3, which is a partial view in full section of the lower portion of filter assembly 10, container 24 is positioned inside interior chamber 14. A liquid additive 25 can be deposited in the interior chamber 14. In the illustrated embodiment, container 24 is disposed between the closed end 27 of outer casing 12 and the lower endcap 32 of filter element 22. Biasing element 26, which is illustrated as a circular spring, biases container 24 against the lower endcaps 32 of filter element 22, and, consequently, forces endcap 3 of filter element 22 against nut plate 16 or a seal disposed therebetween.",
        "Container 24 includes an exterior wall 34. In the illustrated embodiment, exterior wall 34 includes a plurality of spacers 37 each configured as a small, axially-oriented rib. The spacers 37 provide a gap between the exterior wall 34 of container 24 and the interior wall of casing 12 so that separated water can fall down between the wall 34 where a drain valve 35 can be used to remove the accumulated water. Exterior wall 34 defines an interior region 40. In this embodiment, container 24 defines a cylindrical reservoir or depot concentric about axis 23. Container 24 can be provided as a two-piece (or more) structure(s), which pieces are interconnected via a connection. The connection can be a threaded connection sealed with adhesive, snap-fit, ultra-sonic welded, or spin-welded, as desired. In a preferred embodiment, container 24 will be provided as a two-piece structure with a spin-weld connection joining the two structures.",
        "Entrance port 42 provides an opening through exterior wall 34. Similarly, exit port 44 also provides an opening through wall 34. Both entrance port 42 and exit port 44 provide a pathway for liquid in interior chamber 14 to enter and exit, respectively, interior region 40 of container 24. Preferably both entrance port 42 and exit port 44 are located in a top wall portion 41 of container 24.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, entrance port 42 is provided as a small diameter tube or capillary tube 48. In a particularly preferred embodiment, capillary tube 48 has a desired length to extend into interior chamber 14 and adjacent to filter element 22. In this embodiment, capillary tube 48 provides a fluid conduit for liquid in entering region 28 to flow into interior region 40. Preferably the length and/or diameter of capillary tube 48 is selected to take advantage of the fluid pressure generated by the liquid flowing through filter assembly 10 and to induce a portion of the liquid to enter interior region 40 at a desired flowrate.",
        "In one embodiment, capillary tube 48 extends from container 24 towards inlet 18 between casing 12 and filter element 22. In one preferred embodiment, capillary tube 48 extends the length of filter element 22. In other embodiments, the length of capillary tube 48 that extends beyond the exterior of container 24 is selected to be less than or equal to about three-fourths of the length of the filter element; or the length of capillary tube 48 is selected to be less than or equal to about one-half of the length of the filter element; still yet in another embodiment the length of capillary tube 48 is selected to be less than or equal to about one-fourth of the length of the filter element. The capillary tube end 49 can be provided in a variety of configurations including a round, oval, flattened configuration, or it can be configured to conform to the space between the exterior of the filter element and the interior of the housing.",
        "Opposite end of capillary tube 48 can also extend into interior region 40. In the illustrated embodiment, capillary tube 48 extends adjacent to the lower wall portion or bottom of container 24. Tube 48 can extend a desired distance inside container 24 from the top wall portion 41 to the bottom wall portion 51. In one embodiment, this distance is greater than about one half the distance between wall portions 41 and 51, in other embodiments this distance is greater than about three fourths that distance. This prevents the incoming liquid from flowing directly across the top of container 24 toward exit port 44. It is preferable that the incoming liquid mix sufficiently with the additive contained within container 24. One method of promoting adequate mixing of the liquid and additive is to increase the period of time that the liquid remains in container 24 and/or increase the distance that the incoming liquid must flow in the interior region before exiting out exit port 44. It will be understood that in alternative embodiments capillary tube 48 need not extend to the bottom of container 24.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, the difference in liquid density and the additive density can be utilized to achieve a more uniform release rate over time. (See below, FIG. 14.) Generally, the liquid additive is denser than the liquid flowing through the filter assembly (regardless whether the liquid is organic or aqueous based). Consequently, the filtered liquid tends to \u201cfloat\u201d on the additive phase. Truncating the inlet tube near the top of the additive vessel, and extending the outlet capillary near the bottom of the vessel takes advantage of this property. During operation, the liquid enters the inlet vessel, floats, and remains (largely, with exception of the slow diffusion between phases) at the top of the vessel or layered on the liquid additive. As more of the liquid enters through the inlet vessel, the entering liquid displaces pure additive and pushing it out the outlet tube in nearly full-concentration yielding a very steady injection of active ingredient into the system.",
        "Exit port 44 is provided in an upper wall portion of exterior wall 34 and is spaced apart from entrance port 42. Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, exit port 44 is centrally positioned in exterior wall 34 to extend centrally into interior region 40. However, it will be understood that exit port 44 can be positioned as desired in exterior wall 34 to extend into and/or through any portion of container 24. As illustrated in FIG. 1, exit port 44 can be defined by a capillary tube 54 extending into interior region 40. Capillary tube 54 provides a conduit between interior region 40 and interior chamber 14.",
        "In one embodiment, capillary tube 54 provides fluid communication between the liquid and an additive initially located in interior region 40 and entering region 28. From entering region 28, liquid can then flow through filter element 22 and into exiting region 30. From there, the liquid can then flow through outlet 20 and back into the system\u2014either a recirculating fuel, coolant, oil, or lubricant system or a single-pass fuel system.",
        "In an alternative embodiment (see FIG. 14), capillary tube 54 provides an exit for the liquid and additive in interior region 40 to flow to exiting region 30. In this embodiment, capillary tube 54 provides direct fluid communication for a liquid and/or an additive mixture in interior region 40 and exiting region 30 and, ultimately, to outlet 20. Consequently, in this embodiment, the liquid and additive in interior region 40 can bypass filter element 22. This embodiment would offer a high gradient pressure, since the restriction of the filter element is now added to the dynamic pressure gradient (Pdyn). This embodiment can provide particular advantages, for example, for injecting a very viscous additive into the system. If desired, a small filter medium, such as a sintered porous plug, wire-mesh screen, or the like, can be included on the outlet tube to prevent any large particles that have bypassed the filter from causing damage to downstream components. The filter medium can be located on either end of the outlet tube.",
        "Optionally, entrance port 42 and/or exit port 44 can be sealed with a soluble seal 43 and 45, respectively. This allows filter assembly 10 to be storage stable, and in particular, this can inhibit loss of activity and/or volume of the additive in container 24. In use, a liquid flowing through filter assembly 10 dissolves the seal material, allowing the liquid to enter into interior region 40 and mix with the additive therein. Alternatively, the soluble seal can be composed of a low melting material that melts when exposed to the normal operating temperatures of the fuel flowing through the filter.",
        "In one embodiment when the liquid is an organic base fluid such as fuel, oil or a lubricant, the soluble seal is composed of a material such as a wax that is soluble in organic solvents.",

        "In use, the liquid to be filtered flows in through one or more of inlets 18 in nut plate 16, and from there into interior chamber 14. In the illustrated embodiment, a liquid flows into entering region 28 in the direction indicated by inflow arrows 60. It has been observed that the liquid flowing through a filter such as filter assembly 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3 exhibits a dynamic fluid pressure gradient within the interior chamber.",
        "FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating the dynamic fluid pressure predicted by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model at varying axial positions within a filter [all points taken at radial position midway in gap between filter shell ID (12) filter element pleat OD (22)]. The graph indicates that the fluid dynamic pressure is greatest near the top of the filter element endcap 31 where the axial velocity is highest. The dynamic pressure below the top endcap begins to diminish since the axial velocity decreases as fluid is carried inward through the filter. The y-axis on the graph is the CFD-predicted dynamic fluid pressure, in Kpa. The x-axis corresponds to the axial position in the filter measured with respect to the filter element at which the dynamic fluid pressure was reported via CFD. In the graph illustrated in FIG. 4, the bottom endcap of the filter element is at 0.1 m and the top is at \u02dc0.225 m. The absolute value of the dynamic fluid pressure within the filter can vary depending upon a variety of factors that affect flow velocity in the gap between filter and housing, including: the overall length of the filter housing and/or filter element, the size of gap (annulus area) between the filter element and housing shell, the overall length of the filter housing and/or filter element, the configuration of the filter element (number of pleats, outer diameter of pleats, inner diameter of pleats, media thickness), the flowrate or volume of flowing through the filter casing and/or filter element, and the density of the flowing liquid. The dynamic pressure, Pdyn, can be calculated according to Equation 1:\n\nPdyn=1/2\u00d7density\u00d7velocity2\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere density is the liquid density and velocity is the velocity of the liquid flowing through the filter.",
        "The parent applications take advantage of this observation by positioning entrance port 42 where Pdyn is at a relatively high pressure and locating exit port 44 in an area within the interior chamber that exhibits lower fluid pressure. Since the entrance port is aligned perpendicular with the direction of flow-(like a pitot tube), a stagnation zone forms in front of the tube causing the dynamic pressure to be converted to a static pressure which is harnessed to drive flow slowly into the tube and through the vessel.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, entrance port 42 is defined by the open terminal end of capillary tube 48. Capillary tube 48 extends from interior region 40 through wall 34 and up between filter element 22 and the interior wall of outer casing 12. Placing the entrance port 42 at the terminus of capillary tube 48 in an area of relatively high fluid pressure induces the liquid flowing through the liquid filter to enter interior region 40. In interior region 40, the liquid can mix with the liquid additive. Thereafter, the liquid and additive mixture can exit through exit port 44.",
        "In one embodiment, exit port 44, as noted above, allows the liquid and additive mixture to re-enter the entering region 28 albeit in an area where the dynamic fluid pressure is less than the pressure in the area adjacent entrance 42 to capillary tube 48. In this embodiment, the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region 40 flows through the filter element 22 before exiting the filter assembly through outlet 20.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, exit port 44 provides direct fluid communication between interior region 40 and exiting region 30. This allows the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region 40 to exit into exiting region 30 and from there be mixed with the bulk liquid in exiting region 30 into the fuel conduit (not shown) without passing through filter element 22. In this embodiment, as noted above, a separate filter element can be included with exit port 44, if desired.",
        "Providing entrance port 42 in an area of relatively high fluid pressure and positioning exit port 44 in an area of lower fluid pressure provides substantial benefits for adding additives to flowing liquid. The release rate of a liquid additive in container 24 can be tailored as described. In one preferred embodiment, the desired release rate remains relatively constant over a long time period. This effect can be modified by varying the initial viscosity of the liquid additive in container 24. For example, if the initial viscosity of the liquid additive is substantially higher than that of the liquid flowing through filter assembly 10, then as the liquid begins to mix with and dilute the additive in the interior of container 24, the initial viscosity of the liquid and additive mixture slowly begins to decrease. The high viscosity inhibits rapid initial release of additive from container 24 due to the controlling restriction provided by the outlet capillary tube. The inlet capillary tube may also have a restriction, but since the liquid viscosity is much lower than that of the additive and the inlet tube is filled only with the liquid, the outlet capillary restriction largely controls/sets the flowrate that results from the fixed gradient pressure. However, over time, the relative amount of liquid in the liquid and additive mixture in container 24 increases. As the relative amount of the liquid component in the liquid and additive mixture increases, the viscosity of the resulting liquid and additive mixture decreases. The resulting decrease in viscosity causes the outlet capillary tube restriction to decrease which leads to corresponding increase in flowrate (of diluted fuel/additive mix), hence giving a more stable release of actual active ingredient (additive). At a given pressure gradient, the flowrate through the additive vessel having two capillary tubes in series (an inlet and an outlet) with differing viscosity in each tube (and neglecting any contribution of viscous drag offered by the vessel) can be modeled according to the following Equation 2:",

According to Equation 2, the desired flowrate can be easily adjusted by varying the tube geometries\u2014especially the tube diameters, D1 and D2, since flow varies inversely with the tube diameters to the fourth power. In use, the additive viscosity \u03bc2 will slowly decrease and the flowrate will increase. This effect will be more pronounced if the outlet tube provides the largest restriction to flow, for example, if D1 were small. It has been determined that it is typical to achieve a \u02dcthree-fold increase in flow over the life of the filter/additive vessel when working with a ten-fold additive/fuel viscosity ratio. This three-fold increase in flow helps to counteract the decreasing active ingredient release rate due to the exponentially decaying concentration of active ingredient in the vessel.",
        "FIGS. 5 and 6 are graphs which illustrate this effect for two cases where all other factors are equal, including additive vessel volume and total additive released in a 300-hour period. Only the inlet tube diameter is adjusted to achieve the correct total additive release. The first graph in FIG. 5 shows how the flowrate is constant for the case of a vessel that lacks an outlet capillary (since inlet pressure is constant and viscosity in the inlet tube is constant). When a capillary tube is added to outlet of the container, the initial flowrate is reduced\u2014but the final flowrate has increased almost three-fold due to declining viscosity.",
        "The graph illustrated in FIG. 6 shows the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d or additive injection rate for these same two cases. When the container does not include a capillary tube outlet, an exponential decay (about 80% decrease in this case) in the release rate of the additive is anticipated. When the container contains a capillary tube outlet, the injection rate curve is significantly flattened (\u02dc50% decrease in the release rate of the additive) due to the rising flowrate offsetting the decreasing additive concentration of the diluted vessel mixture. For both cases, the total amount of additive released in the 300-hour time period is about equal. However, the case where the container includes a capillary outlet tube provides a more constant release rate over time. This can translate into better protection for the fuel system.",
        "In addition, the rate that liquid enters into container 24 can be varied. Increasing the pressure differential between entrance port 42 of exit port 44 will induce a more rapid in-flow and escape of the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region 40 of container 24. Extending end 49 of capillary tube 48 closer to inlet 18 can increase the dynamic pressure. Similarly, terminating end 55 of capillary tube 54 in an area at lower pressure such as the area proximate to exiting region 30 can decrease the dynamic fluid pressure at exit port 44.",
        "In another embodiment, varying the configuration and/or size of capillary tube 48 and/or capillary tube 54 can vary the pressure difference between the fluid entering and exiting container 24. For example, the diameter of one or both of capillary tubes 48 and 54 can be varied.",
        "Conversely, placing entrance port 42 and exit port 44 such that the relative pressure differential between the two is small provides for a low flow rate through container 24.",

        "In this embodiment, the endcap shroud 161 cooperates with filter shell 164 to constrict the flow and hence increase the velocity in close proximity to entrance of capillary tube 158. This in turn increases the dynamic fluid pressure at end 162. Consequently, the pressure difference between the entrance and exit from container 152 is greater than would be observed if the fuel were not constricted between filter endcap shroud and shell.",
        "FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view of yet another embodiment of a filter assembly 180 in accordance with the parent applications. Filter assembly 180 includes some of the same or similar components as discussed for filter assembly 10; therefore, the same reference numbers will be used for the same components. Filter assembly 180 includes an outer casing or housing 182 that defines an interior chamber 184. A filter element 22 and a vessel or container 186 are positioned in the interior chamber. Filter element 22 can partition the interior chamber 184 into a fluid entering region 188 and a fluid exiting region 190. Additionally, filter assembly 180 can include a separable lower bowl 192 for water collection with a drain valve 193 to expel the collected water.",
        "Container 186 includes an exterior wall 194 that defines an interior region 196. An additive 198 such as has been described above is disposed in interior region 196. A first, inlet 200 allows fluid to flow into interior region 196. An outlet 202 allows the additive and/or a mixture of the fluid and additive to flow out of interior region 196. In the illustrated embodiment, it can be observed that inlet 200 allows fluid from the fluid entering region 188 to flow into interior region 196 while the outlet 202 allows the additive and/or fluid additive mixture to flow out of the interior region and into the fluid exiting region 190. Container 186 can be charged with the liquid additive through a closable or sealable opening 191 prior to final assembly.",
        "Inlet 200 is surrounded by a short, cylindrical boss covered by a filter element or filter media 204. In this particular embodiment, inlet 200 need not be a capillary tube and need not extend into the interior region 196. Rather inlet 200 is configured as a short, cylindrical opening having a diameter of approximately between 1 mm and about 10 mm. Filter media 204 can be formed of the same material as used for the filter element 22 or a different material as desired. The filter media 204 can be supported by cross ribs extending across the opening. The filter media 204 can be formed of a material or configured and/or sized to minimize the pressure drop across the inlet 200. In one embodiment, the fluid face velocity (and hence pressure drop, since restriction to flow across porous media is proportional to the velocity of flow) through inlet 200 is about 50% of that through filter element 22; more preferably, less than about 25%; and still more preferably less than about 10% lower than that observed to flow through filter element 22.",
        "As used herein the term fluid face velocity is defined as the \u201capproach velocity\u201d of a liquid flowing normal to the surface of the filter material according to Equation 3:\n\nFV=volumetric flowrate/area [m/s]\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere FV is the fluid face velocity and volumetric flowrate is the volumetric flowrate of the fluid approaching the filter material.",
        "Additionally, if desired, filter element 204 can be covered or sealed with a fluid soluble seal 206. Seal 206 can be provided to inhibit accidental leakage of the additive 198 during storage and shipping and/or prevent contact of the additive to air prior to use.",
        "Outlet 202 in this illustration includes a capillary tube 210. Capillary tube 210 can operate to control the rate of release of the additive (or a mixture of fluid and additive) out of container 186. Capillary tube 210 extends from the interior region 196 through outlet 202. An exterior portion 212 of capillary tube 210 is surrounded by a support structure 214. In the illustrated embodiment, support structure 214 is provided as a conical boss 216 which provides support and minimizes the risk of damage to the exterior portion 212 of capillary tube 210. To further support and reduce the risk of plugging during assembly, the terminal end of capillary tube 210 be recessed in conical boss 216. In one embodiment, support structure 214 includes a plurality of radially extending ribs 217, which can extend beyond the terminal end of capillary tube 210. While boss 216 is illustrated as a conical or a frustum conical configuration other configurations are contemplated. Boss 216 bears against a seal 218 about an inner portion of end cap 220, which supports filter element 22. Engagement between boss 216 and seal 218 provides a fluid-tight seal to prevent fluid flowing though the assembly from bypassing both filter element 22 and container 186. In the illustrated embodiment, capillary 210 and boss 216 are centrally located in the top wall portion of container 186.",
        "Capillary tube 210 extends into interior region 196. In preferred embodiments, capillary tube 210 extends to a position in close proximity to the bottom wall portion 222 of container 186. The length of capillary tube 210 can be varied as desired to control or limit the additive release rate. The capillary tube 210 defines a flow path for the additive and/or additive/fluid mixture in container 186. In one embodiment, capillary tube defines a flow path that has a length greater than the depth of container 186, measured from the upper wall portion to the lower wall portion.",
        "The present embodiment of a filter assembly 180 provides distinct advantages. The illustrated embodiment provides particular advantages for additives, which are denser than the fluid flowing through the assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, the inlet 200 is provided as a cylindrical opening. This reduces the variation in the additive release rate of flow since the majority of the pressure gradient developed between the inlet 200 and the outlet 202 is across the capillary tube 210. Thus, the capillary tube configuration can be tailored to control the release rate of the additive. This can include varying the length and/or diameter of capillary tube 210 to fine tune the release rate of the additive into the fluid. Increasing the diameter of capillary tube 210 increases the rate of release by a factor proportional to the (capillary internal diameter) 4. Increasing the length of capillary tube 232 decreases the rate of release by a factor inversely proportional to the capillary length.",
        "Additionally typically during use the filter media retains particles from the fluid. Eventually near the end of the filter assembly's useful life span, the filter media may become sufficiently clogged with the particles that the pressure differential between the entering region 188 and the exiting region 190 significantly increases. This greater pressure differential forces any remaining liquid additive out of container 186 into the fluid where it can provide a benefit to the fluid rather than being disposed of when the filter assembly is replaced.",
        "Referring additionally to FIG. 18 which illustrates a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of a container 230. In container 230, capillary tube 232 is illustrated as extending all the way to the bottom wall portion 222 terminating in a spiral winding 234. This, in effect, lengthens capillary tube 232 to accommodate a greater pressure differential while still maintaining the desired flowrate of the additive out of the interior region 196. It should be understood that the spiral winding 234 can extend or spiral in any direction. However, it is preferred that the end of capillary 232 be positioned proximate to the bottom wall portion 222. As noted above, typically the liquid additive is denser than the fluid flowing through the assembly. Consequently, positioning the end of the capillary tube near the bottom wall of container 230 ensures that all of the additive is released into the fluid.",
        "FIG. 19 illustrates a perspective view of a container 186 for use in filter assembly 180. In this embodiment, container 186 includes a reservoir 240 formed in the upper wall portion 242. A pre-charge additive can be deposited in reservoir 240 to be directly added to the fluid in filter assembly 180. This provides an additional \u201cadditive boost\u201d upon initial employment of the filter assembly 180. As discussed above, the additive pre-charge deposited in reservoir 240 can, if desired, also be coated with a fluid soluble seal or seal material such as a wax for organic fluids or a water-soluble polymer for aqueous based fluid.",
        "FIG. 20 is a partial view, in cross-section of an alternative embodiment of a filter assembly 250. In this embodiment, a container 252 is illustrated which includes a capillary tube 254 extending through a cylindrical boss 256. An O-ring seal 258 on top of boss 256 seals against the lower end cap 220 to ensure a fluid-tight seal and prevent any fluid from bypassing both filter element 22 and container 252.",
        "FIG. 21 is an exploded, perspective view of the lower portion of container 186 and lower bowl 192. It can be seen from this embodiment that container 186 includes a plurality of concentric ribs 264 positioned about the exterior wall 194. This allows a space or gap between the exterior wall 194 of container 186 and housing 182 to allow any water to drain down into the lower bowl 192. The water can then drain through channels 266 into bowl 192. Bowl 192 can include a threaded stud 268, which can be threadedly engaged with a threaded recess 270 in the lower portion of container 186. In preferred embodiments, lower bowl 192 can be provided with a drain relief valve 193. Additionally, lower bowl 192 can be provided with an electronic sensor to sense moisture contained therein or can be made of a clear material through which the water can be visually observed.",
        "Filter assembly 180 provides additional advantages in that it can be used with vacuum side filter applications. In vacuum side applications little fluid is present in the entrance region 188 between filter element 22 and shell wall 182\u2014the fluid at that location is mainly vapor. In a vacuum application, the liquid is generally confined to a zone approximately beneath endcap 220 and in the fluid exiting region 190. Because the opening 200 is below the endcap 220, the liquid is present to flow into container 186 through the inlet 200.",
        "The parent applications provide distinct advantages to current delivery systems. The use of a liquid additive in the container allows the maximum amount of an additive to be included within a filter assembly because the liquid additive can completely fill the internal volume of the container where as solid additives do not. Furthermore, by harnessing the pressure gradient generated within a filter assembly in use, the rate of addition of the additive is much more independent of vibration variation that may occur during use. However, the rate of release of the additive as noted above can be adjustable by varying the length and/or diameters of the capillary tubes leading into and out of the container holding the fuel additive.",
        "The parent applications also provide a method of adding beneficial additives to the liquid only with the liquid flowing through the filter. When the liquid is not flowing through the filter, diffusion of any additive out of the container has been measured to be negligible because of the extremely low molecular diffusion rate. The molecular diffusion rate is described by the binary diffusion coefficient, which in the above-described embodiments with the liquid/additive is on the order of 2e-6 cm2/s between the additive and the liquid phases, and the dynamic fluid pressure gradient is zero when there is no flow so convective transfer is also eliminated.",
        "The parent applications also contemplate modifications as would occur to those skilled in the art. It is also contemplated that the devices and processes embodied in the parent applications can be altered, rearranged, substituted, combined, or added to other processes as would occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the parent applications.
