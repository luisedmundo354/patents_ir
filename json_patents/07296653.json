        "This application claims priority from provisional application Ser. No. 60/535,992, filed Jan. 12, 2004.",
        "This invention relates generally to the field of loud speaker equipment, and/or speaker and amplifier assemblies, and more particularly to enhancement of sound produced by such equipment or assemblies. The invention provides for reflection and control of the travel path or paths of such produced sound, whereby control of ultimate sound effect is realized. Collapsible apparatus for achievement of such sound control is provided, facilitating portability.",

        "Another object is to provide a stand that includes two generally upright panel sections, with upper edges configured to support the speaker unit, said stand panel sections spaced apart to define a reflected sound transmission path therebetween. Those sections typically have support legs, and through openings to transmit sound sidewardly between at least two of said transmission paths.",
        "A further object is to provide the reflecting panel or panels to include a first reflecting panel to reflect sound waves directly directed at the first panel, and a second reflecting panel to reflect sound waves reflected from the first panel.",
        "Additional objects include provision of a central brace to assist in assembly stability; and side panels carried to reflect or direct sound transmission at sides of a transmission channel, but also allowing upward sound travel, about the speaker unit.",

        "FIGS. 1-24 show the panels B, C and E, and the brace D, in relation to the speaker, or speaker and amplifier unit A that produces sound waves to be reflected, and to travel as seen in FIG. 4. The construction allows easy folding of components, and stacking, for transport. See also controls 11a for 11.",
        "FIGS. 1-4 show sound controlling apparatus 10 adapted for combination with a speaker unit 11 that forms a box-like enclosure. Sound emitted rearwardly from a loudspeaker 12 within the unit 11 (see arrows 19 in FIG. 4) is to be reflected from an upper panel 13 (see arrows 19 in FIG. 4) and downwardly forwardly toward a lower panel 14, from which sound is again reflected forwardly from the apparatus 10. Panel 13 is inclined upwardly and forwardly from a horizontal hinged connection 15 to panel 14. Panel 14 is inclined downwardly and forwardly from connection 15, to extend beneath speaker unit 11, whereby a sound travel channel is formed rearwardly of and below the unit 11. Panels 13 and 14 are together designated by the letter (C). FIGS. 8-10 show the edge hinged construction of the sound reflecting panels 13 and 14 enabling their collapse for transport.",
        "A stand 20 is provided to support the speaker unit 11 in inclined position, as shown. The stand includes two like generally upright panel sections 21, also designated at B, having upper edges 23 and 24 that seat the bottom and rear walls of the unit 11, in cradled condition. Short edge 23 is inclined upwardly and forwardly, and long edge 24 is inclined upwardly and rearwardly, the two edges intersecting at 25 to form a 90 degree intersection. Panel sections 21 have forward and rearward legs 26 and 27 that project downwardly to seat the assembly. Legs 27 of the convergent sections 21 project downwardly through an opening 28 in panel 14, and located near hinged connection 15. See FIGS. 8 and 11-14. Legs 26 project downwardly through slots 29 in panel 14. A notch 30 in each section 21 receives a lip 31 of panel 14. See also FIG. 15. Side through openings 32 in the sections 21 pass sound laterally from the sound flow channel beneath the unit 11, for mixing.",
        "A brace 40 for the stand is employed as seen in FIG. 1, between panel sections 21 and protruding rearwardly at 40a, via a slot 41 in panel 13. The brace has two L-shaped lower projections 42 to fit in openings 43 in the lower panel 14, and seen in FIG. 8. Panel 14 also has two angled slots 29 that receive lower edge portions sections 21. See FIGS. 8 and 11. (D) also designates the brace.",
        "Two side panels 50 are also provided to sidewardly enclose the sound channels, at opposite sides of the support panels sections 21. They are also designated at (E) and are seen to extend upwardly from outer edges of the lower panel 14. Each side panel includes triangular portions 52 and 53 having hinged interconnection at 54, so as to reflect and direct sound forwardly and upwardly at opposite sides of the reversing sound channel. Tabs 83 connect 50 to 13 and 14. See FIGS. 23 and 24. Portions 52 and 53 also extend (incline) toward panel sections 21, but are spaced from the latter to form upward openings, above the rearwardly extending sound channel designated by the arrows in FIG. 4. Accordingly, sound emitted from 10 toward panel 13 is reflected by 13, 14, 52 and 53 to travel forwardly and upwardly about the sides of 10, to combine with sound emitted at 59 from the front side 60 of the speaker unit, producing an amplified and full bodied effect, greater than that produced by 10 in the absence of 11. Brace 40 also has a sound passing through opening 70. See FIG. 17.",
        "The apparatus is easily disassembled and collapsed, for transport."
