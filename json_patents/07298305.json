        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates in general to the field of information processing, and more specifically to a signal processing system and method for reducing comparators in delta sigma modulator, analog-to-digital comparators using quantizer output prediction.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Many signal processing systems include delta sigma modulators to quantize an input signal into one or more bits. Delta sigma modulators trade-off increased noise in the form of quantization error in exchange for high sample rates and noise shaping. \u201cDelta-sigma modulators\u201d are also commonly referred to using other interchangeable terms such as \u201csigma-delta modulators\u201d, \u201cdelta-sigma converters\u201d, \u201csigma delta converters\u201d, and \u201cnoise shapers\u201d.",
        "FIG. 1 depicts an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) delta sigma modulator 100 that receives an analog input signal x(t) and converts the input signal x(t) into a series of low resolution, digital output pulses q(n), where t represents a continuous time variable and n denotes a discrete time variable. The average amplitude over time of the series of low resolution pulses is q(n). In general, the delta sigma modulator 100 quantizes a difference between the current input signal x(t) and an analog version of the previous quantizer output signal, i.e. q(t\u22121). In the feedback loop of delta sigma modulator 100, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 108 converts each delayed (z\u22121) output signal q(n\u22121) into an analog signal q(t\u22121). The feedback loop of delta sigma modulator 100 also includes dynamic element matching 106 to correct nonlinearities in the DAC 108 signal q(n\u22121).",
        "The noise shaping loop filter 102 processes a difference between input signal x(t) and the delayed output signal q(t\u22121) to generate a loop filter output signal/quantizer input signal VLF. During each output cycle of delta sigma modulator operation, quantizer 104 quantizes signal VLF to generate output signal q(n), generally in the form of digital data. When loop filter 102 is a continuous time filter, the quantizer 104 represents a relatively low-accuracy ADC converter operating at an oversampling rate, such as a rate of 64:1. Quantizer 104 can provide multi-bit or one-bit output quantization levels. The quantization level step size, \u0394, represents the difference between each quantization level. One-bit quantizers have only two quantization levels specified as {\u2212\u03b1/2, \u03b1/2} or {\u22121,1}. Shreier and Temes, Understanding Delta-Sigma Signal Converters, IEEE Press, 2005 (referred to herein as \u201cShreier & Temes\u201d) describes conventional delta-sigma modulators in more detail.",
        "Multi-bit ADC delta sigma modulators exhibit some well-known advantages over single bit ADC delta sigma modulators such as reduced quantization noise. However, quantizer design continues to represent one of the significant challenges confronting delta sigma modulator designers.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts a flash-type quantizer 200, which represents one embodiment of quantizer 104. Quantizer 200 includes r comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121, each having a first input connected to the output of loop filter 102 to receive quantizer input signal VLF. \u201cr\u201d is a positive integer representing the number of comparators in delta sigma modulator 100. Each of the comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121 includes a second input to receive respective reference voltages V0 through Vr\u22121. The reference voltages serve as reference signals to quantize the quantizer input signal VLF. A resistor string reference ladder of r\u22121 resistors 204.1-204.r\u22121 of value R generates uniform voltage drops across at least reference resistors 204.1-204.r\u22121 to generate respective reference voltages V0 through Vr\u22121. The end resistors 204.0 and 204.r have values that can be used to scale the quantization levels (also referred to as a \u201cquantizer step\u201d). For example, the largest quantizer threshold may be 1.2 V, but the available reference may be 2.5 V, so resistors 204.0 and 204.r are set to achieve the desired scale. A reference voltage of +Vref to \u2212Vref is applied across the reference resistors 204.0-204.r. +/\u2212Vref is, for example, +/\u22121.5 Volts (V).",
        "Each of comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121 compares the quantizer input signal VLF with respective reference voltages V0 through Vr\u22121. The ith comparator 202.i generates a logical zero (e.g. 0 V) when the ith reference voltage Vi is less than or equal to the loop filter output/quantizer input signal VLF and a logical one (e.g. +2.5 V) when Vi>VLF. Once during each cycle of quantizer 104 operation, digital encoder 206 encodes the output signals of comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121 into a digital (discrete) output signal q(n).",
        "Increasing the number of comparators in quantizer 104, i.e. increasing the value of r, yields a higher quality output signal q(n) (e.g. less quantization noise) and higher signal bandwidth capabilities. Each time r doubles, delta sigma modulator 100 typically achieves a 6 dB quantization noise improvement. However, disadvantages also accompany increasing the number of comparators in quantizer 104. For example, increasing the number of comparators requires more physical area to implement and more power to operate. Additionally, increasing the number of comparators decreases voltage spacing between adjacent reference voltages Vi and Vi+1 and increases the relative effects of non-idealities, such as comparator offset voltages.",
        "Comparator offset voltages represent the minimum direct current (DC) input voltage that would have to be applied to input terminals of the comparator to cause the comparator to transition state. Thus, comparator offset voltages can cause error in the comparator outputs, especially when the difference between the reference input signals of adjacent comparators is small. Accordingly, as the relative effects of quantizer non-idealities increase, the nonidealities cause increasing delta sigma modulator error. The non-linearity can cause harmonic distortion, especially at high signal frequencies, increased noise, and modulation of noise with the direct current (DC) input level, all of which are undesirable.",
        "An example with the number of comparators equal to r=16 illustrates effects of comparator nonidealities. Assuming seventeen (17) quantization levels, normalized to \u22128, \u22127, \u22126, . . . , \u22121, 0, +1, +2, . . . , +8, the input reference voltages V0 through V15 to respective comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121 are normalized values of \u22127.5, \u22126.5, \u22125.5, . . . , \u22120.5, +0.5, . . . , +5.5, +6.5, +7.5. Each actual reference voltage Vi scales with the analog system reference voltage Vref. For example, if level \u22128 corresponds to \u22121.5 V and level +8 corresponds to +1.5 V, then the respective comparator input voltage references V0 through V15 for comparators 202.0-202.r\u22121 are \u22127.5/8*1.5, \u22126.5/8*1.5, . . . , +6.5/8*1.5, and +7.5/8*1.5V. Thus, as the number of comparators increases the voltage reference spacing decreases. It follows that as the number of comparators increases, eventually non-linearities of the flash-type quantizer 200 counteract any advantage obtained by increasing the number of comparators. Additionally, in an integrated circuit, chip area is valuable. Increasing the number of comparators requires more chip area and, thus, can become a dominant disadvantage.",
        "FIG. 3 depicts a tracking ADC quantizer 300, which represents another embodiment of quantizer 104. The tracking ADC quantizer 300 is described in detail in Dorrer et al., A 3-mW 74-dB SNR 2-MHz Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma ADC With a Tracking ADC Quantizer in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 40, No. 12, December 2005. The quantizer 300 reduces the number of comparators to three comparators 302.0, 302.1, and 302.2, a counter 304, an R-string reference ladder 306, and a switching matrix 308 to connect the reference voltages V0, V1, and V2 to the inputs of comparators 302.0, 302.1, and 302.2. When the loop filter 102 output voltage VLF has a value of 1 least significant bit (LSB) or less, only the middle comparator 302.1 will change state, and the state of counter 304 remains unchanged. For VLF signal changes larger than 1 LSB, adjacent comparators 302.2 or 302.0 will change state depending upon whether the change is greater than or less than the previous state. The logic 310 detects this state change and increases the output of counter 304 or decreases the output of counter 304 depending upon whether comparator 302.2 or 302.0 changed state. By changing the state of counter 304, the reference voltages V0, V1, and V2 to respective comparators 302.0, 302.1, and 302.2 are tracked to the new output value of counter 304. In each cycle of operation of delta sigma modulator 300, the output signal q(n) of quantizer 300 is generated by using the result of counter 304 and the output signal of comparators 302.0, 302.1, and 302.2.",

For example, \u201cq(n\u22121)\u201d represents the quantizer output signal immediately preceding quantizer output signal q(n), \u201cq(n\u22122)\u201d represents the quantizer output signal immediately preceding q(n\u22121), and so on. Filters [1] and [2] are exemplary FIR filters, and filters [3] and [4] are exemplary IIR filters. Minimizing the time to obtain the low pass filter output LPF is advantageous since in a real time signal processing environment, the delta sigma modulator 400 has only a limited amount of time to determine a quantization output signal q(n). Filter [4] can determine the low pass filter LPF output in only two delta sigma modulator output cycles and, thus, is useful for pipelined delta sigma modulator embodiments.",
        "Many other simple and optimized filters can be used with coefficients that allow the filters to closely match the NTF of loop filter 404 and ensure a maximum quantizer level deviation d that reduces the number of comparators in reduced comparator quantizer 402 to a number that is less than the number of quantization levels. The coefficient choices may be varied. For example, for the IIR filters, \u215b and \u215e may be changed to respectively 1/16 and 15/16, \u00bc or \u00be, and so on to obtain the best observed performance. Utilizing the immediately prior quantizer output signal q(n\u00f71) is the simplest predictor to implement. However, using subsequent quantizer output signals to determine predicted quantizer output signal qest, as set forth in filters [1]-[4], reduce the range of quantizer input signal Vin(t) possibilities and, thus, the number of comparators used by reduced comparator quantizer 402.",
        "After generation of each quantizer output signal q(n), quantizer output predictor 410 generates a digital predicted quantizer output signal qest(n). In at least one embodiment, the predicted quantizer output signal qest=floor(LPF+0.5) for an even number of comparators in reduced comparator quantizer 402, and qest=floor(LPF) for an odd number of comparators in reduced comparator quantizer 402, where LPF is the low pass filter output of the quantizer output predictor 410. The \u201cfloor\u201d function truncates the operand down to the nearest integer. For example, floor(7.9)=7, floor(7.4)=7, and so on. The function \u201cfloor(x+0.5)\u201d is a rounding function. For an even number of comparators, the reduced comparator quantizer 402 has an odd number of possible preliminary quantizer outputs c(n). The rounding function allows the comparators of reduced comparator quantizer 402 to center around the predicted quantizer input signal Vins(t).",
        "The predicted quantizer output signal qest(n) is fed back to DAC 412 to generate an analog predicted quantizer output signal qest(t). Computation module 414, such as an analog summer, determines the quantizer input signal Vin(t) from the loop filter output signal VLF(t) minus the predicted quantizer output signal qest(t), i.e. Vin(t)=VLF(t)\u2212qest(t). In at least one embodiment, the reduced comparator quantizer 402 quantizes quantizer input signal Vin(t) to generate a preliminary quantizer output signal c(n). The preliminary quantizer output signal c(n) is corrected by the predicted quantizer output signal qest(n), whose analog version qest(t) was subtracted from loop filter output signal VLF(t) to generate quantizer input signal Vin(t). Delta sigma modulator 400 includes a digital summing module 416 to generate the final quantizer output signal q(n) by adding the preliminary quantizer output signal c(n) to the predicted quantizer output signal qest(n).",

In at least one embodiment, quantization of a full range of input signals x(t) are simulated in operation 502.

        "In a further example, for M=1 comparators, the possible next quantizer output signals are members of the set {qest, qest+1}. Accordingly, select signal Sq0 is set to select reference signal Vr0, and V0 in a normalized quantization level is equal to qest+0.5.",
        "Quantization levels outside the maximum number of quantization levels N available in a delta sigma modulator need not be considered. Thus, predicted estimates qest+/\u2212[X] should not exceed the available quantization levels. For example, for a 17 level system, normalized quantization levels below \u22128 and above +8 need not be considered.",
        "The digital encoder 604 determines the preliminary quantizer output signal c(n) from the comparator output values Vc0 through VcM\u22121 and determines the quantizer output signal q(n) in the same manner as described above with reference to quantizer 500.",
        "FIG. 7 depicts quantizer 700, which represents one embodiment of reduced comparator quantizer 402. Quantizer 700 includes comparator offset noise conversion as, for example, described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/388,436, filed concurrently with this application, entitled \u201cDelta Sigma Modulators with Comparator Offset Noise Conversion\u201d, inventor John L. Melanson, assignee Cirrus Logic, Inc., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "During subsequent periods of time, comparator offset converter 702 alters \u201creference signal-to-comparator input terminal\u201d associations to reroute respective reference signals Vr0, Vr1, . . . , VrM\u22121 from one arrangement of comparator input terminals of at least two (2) of the comparators 502 to a different arrangement of comparator input terminals. In at least one embodiment, the comparator offset converter 702 randomly changes the arrangement of comparator input terminals from one time period to the next time period. In other words, the comparator offset converter 702 randomly alters the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations during subsequent time periods. The comparator offset converter 702 can maintain a 1:1 reference signal-to-comparator input terminal relationship, i.e., one input terminal of each comparator receives one reference signal.",
        "By maintaining the 1:1 ratio of reference signal-to-comparator input terminal and randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations, the comparator offset converter 702 effectively converts the comparator offset voltage nonlinearities into energies and frequencies that can be constructively processed and, in at least one embodiment, improve signal-to-noise ratios. In at least one embodiment, the comparator offset voltages are converted into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise. The multi-spectral noise can be part of system dithering or can be filtered out using, for example, a differential filter. Multi-spectral noise refers to noise whose energy is distributed among multiple frequencies with approximately equal energy levels. \u201cWhite noise\u201d is, in general, noise whose energy is approximately constant for each frequency within a given frequency range, such as 0 to \u00bd a delta sigma modulator sample rate.",
        "In at least one embodiment, the comparator voltage offset reducer 702 alters the routing of reference signals to input terminals of the comparators 502.0 through 502.M\u22121 during subsequent periods of time. The comparator offset converter 702 includes one or more multiplexers to change which of the respective reference signals Vr0, Vr1, . . . , VrM\u22121 that each of the one or more comparators 502.0 through 502.M\u22121 receives during subsequent periods of time.",
        "In at least one embodiment, the comparator voltage offset reducer 702 includes a chopping circuit. The chopping circuit includes multiplexers coupled to the input terminals of the comparators to effectively toggle the inputs of the comparators. The chopping circuit receives a random chopping control signal to cause the chopping circuit to randomly toggle the comparator input terminals. Toggling the comparator input terminals effectively converts the comparator offset voltage into additive multi-spectral noise, such as additive white noise. The chopping control signal can be exclusively OR'ed with each of the respective comparator outputs to restore proper polarity.",
        "In another embodiment, randomizing the reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations and chopping circuits can be respectively utilized with a subset of the comparators 502.0 through 502.M\u22121 in an embodiment of reduced comparator quantizer 402. For example, in one embodiment, only reference signals to adjacent pairs of comparators are randomly altered and/or only a limited number of comparator input terminals are randomly chopped. This limited scope of randomization and chopping has lower complexity implementation but achieves only limited offset related performance improvements.",
        "In another embodiment, the chopping circuit and comparator offset converter are combined to obtain an even better whitening of the additive comparator offset.",
        "The reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations are communicated to digital encoder 508 so that digital encoder 508 can properly generate preliminary quantizer output signal q(n).",
        "FIG. 8 depicts consolidated embodiment 800, which represents one embodiment of consolidated embodiment 600. The consolidated embodiment 800 also includes comparator voltage offset reducer 702. Comparator voltage offset reducer 702 functions in the same manner with respect to consolidated embodiment 800 as described above with respect to quantizer 600. The reference signal-to-comparator input terminal associations are communicated to digital encoder 604 so that digital encoder 604 can properly generate quantizer output signal q(n).",
        "FIG. 9 depicts a signal processing system 900 that includes reduced comparator delta sigma modulator 400. The signal processing system 900 is particularly useful for high-end audio applications. Signal processing system 900 processes an input signal x(t) generated by an input signal source 902. The input signal x(t) may be an audio signal, a video signal, an audio plus video signal, and/or other signal type. The input signal x(t) is, for example, an analog signal generated by a microphone. Generally, input signal x(t) undergoes some preprocessing 904 prior to being modulated by delta sigma modulator 400. Example preprocessing includes low pass filtering to attenuate out-of-band signals. Signal processing system 900 also generally includes post-processing 906, such as low-pass filtering the output signals q(n). Additional post-processing can include recording of the averaged, digital output onto a recording medium or providing the averaged, digital output to a device that utilizes digital signals such as a digital audio recorder and/or player.",
