        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a dielectric ceramic composition, for example, used as a dielectric layer of a multilayer ceramic capacitor; and an electronic device, such as a multilayer ceramic capacitor using the dielectric ceramic composition as a dielectric layer.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In the related art, it has been considered to be effective to secure a high permittivity and a preferable temperature characteristic that a dielectric layer of a multilayer ceramic capacitor as an example of electronic devices is formed by dielectric particles (crystal grains) having a core-shell structure, wherein a shell as a region of barium titanate as a main component dispersed with a subcomponent exists on a surface of a core substantially made by barium titanate not dispersed with any subcomponent. A variety of proposals have been made on a technique of giving the core-shell structure to crystal grains.",
        "For example, the patent article 1 (the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-308321) discloses a technique of adding Mg as a subcomponent to barium titanate as a main component and adjusting a firing temperature and firing time, etc. to control a depth of Mg dispersing from crystal grain surfaces to its inside (that is, a shell thickness).",
        "However, in the technique in the patent article 1, particle diameters of the dielectric particles composing a dielectric layer were approximately uniform and the shell thicknesses in the dielectric particles were also uniform, so that the temperature characteristic of the capacitance was preferable but the permittivity was liable to be small.",
        "Thus, to overcome the disadvantage, the patent article 2 (the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-111951) discloses a technique of making the shell thickness different in accordance with a particle diameter of the dielectric particles. Also, the patent article 2 describes that not all of the dielectric particles have to be covered with the shell and a dielectric particle with its core partially exposed to be open may be included.",
        "The patent article 3 (the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-313225) also discloses the technique of including dielectric particles with partially open cores. According to the patent article 3, by including the dielectric particles having partially open cores, a volume of the entire shell can be reduced and a permittivity of the entire ceramic sintered body can become high comparing with that in dielectric particles with cores covered entirely with the shell. As a result, a thickness of the dielectric layer can be as thick as possible without reducing the capacitance, so that it gives effects of responding to two opposing demands at a time: a demand for obtaining a thin layer with a large capacity and a demand for attaining reliability and a long lifetime.",
        "When including the dielectric particles with partially exposed cores as disclosed in the patent articles 2 and 3, however, the TC bias characteristic deteriorates in some cases. The reason is not always clear, but it is considered because a voltage is applied to the core as a ferroelectric. When the TC bias characteristic deteriorates, there arises a disadvantage that the capacitance declines in an actual use and the product value is remarkably reduced.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric ceramic composition, wherein a high permittivity and a preferable temperature characteristic are obtained and the TC bias characteristic is improved, used, for example, as a dielectric layer of a multilayer ceramic capacitor; and an electronic device, such as a multilayer ceramic capacitor using the dielectric ceramic composition as the dielectric layer.",

        "An embodiment of the present invention was explained above, but the present invention is not limited to the embodiment and may be variously embodied within the scope of the present invention.",
        "For example, in the above embodiment, a multilayer ceramic capacitor was explained as an example of an electronic device according to the present invention, but the electronic device according to the present invention is not limited to a multilayer ceramic capacitor and may be any as far as it includes a dielectric layer composed of a dielectric ceramic composition having the above composition.",
        "Below, the present invention will be explained based on further detailed examples, but the present invention is not limited to the examples.",
        "First, a barium titanate material and subcomponent materials were prepared. As the barium titanate material, BaTiO3 (hereinafter, also referred to as BT) having an average particle diameter of 0.25 \u03bcm was used. As the subcomponent materials, MgO, MnO, V2O5, (Ba0.6 Ca0.4)SiO3 (hereinafter, also referred to as BCG), Y2O3, Yb2O3 and CaZrO3 having an average particle diameter of 0.01 to 0.1 \u03bcm were used. The BCG was produced by performing wet mixing on BaCO3, CaCO3 and SiO2 by a ball mill for 16 hours, drying, then, firing at 1150\u00b0 C. in the air and, furthermore, performing wet grinding by a ball mill for 100 hours. CaZrO3 was produced by performing wet mixing on CaCO3 and ZrO3 by a ball mill for 16 hours, drying, then, firing at 1150\u00b0 C. in the air and, furthermore, performing wet grinding by a ball mill for 24 hours.",
        "Next, these materials were weighed, so that the composition after firing becomes 0.9 mole of MgO, 0.37 mole of MnO, 0.1 mole of V2O5, 4.5 moles of BCG, 3 moles of Y2O3, 1.75 moles of Yb2O3 and 1.5 moles of CaZrO3 with respect to 100 moles of BT as a main component. These weighed amounts are the final adding quantities of the subcomponents.",
        "Next, the subcomponents in amounts of 30% of the final adding quantities (0.27 mole of MgO, 0.111 mole of MnO, 0.03 mole of V2O5, 1.35 moles of BCG, 0.9 mole of Y2O3 and 0.525 mole of Yb2O3 and 0.45 mole of CaZrO3) were added to 100 moles of BT, and wet mixing by a ball mill was performed for 16 hours by using water as the solvent, so that a first pre-fired powder was prepared.",
        "Next, first preliminary firing was performed on the obtained first pre-fired powder at 700\u00b0 C. in the air for three hours, so that first preliminarily fired powder was obtained. When observing the first preliminarily fired powder with an electron microscope, a thin shell (a thickness of 0.003 \u03bcm) was observed on surfaces of barium titanate material particles.",
        "Next, the rest of the final adding quantities of the subcomponent materials (0.63 mole of MgO, 0.259 mole of MnO, 0.07 mole of V2O5 and 3.15 moles of BCG, 2.1 moles of Y2O3, 1.225 moles of Yb2O3 and 1.05 moles of CaZrO3) were added to the first preliminarily fired powder, and wet mixing was performed for 16 hours by using water as the solvent, so that a second pre-fired powder was prepared.",
        "Next, the obtained second pre-fired powder was subjected to preliminary second firing at the temperature shown in Table 1 for 3 hours in the air to obtain a second preliminarily fired powder. When observing the second preliminarily fired powder with a microscope, it was confirmed that a thickness of a shell formed on surfaces of the barium titanate material powders was uneven.",
        "Next, the second preliminarily fired powder was pulverized with an alumina roll and a dielectric material having the final composition was obtained. The dielectric material included 0.9 mole of MgO, 0.37 mole of MnO, 0.1 mole of V2O5, 4.5 moles of BCG, 3 moles of Y2O3, 1.75 moles of Yb2O3 and 1.5 moles of CaZrO3 with respect to 100 moles of BT.",
        "Next, the obtained dielectric material was added with a polyvinyl butyral resin and an ethanol based organic solvent, mixed again with a ball mill to be a paste, so that a dielectric layer paste was obtained.",
        "Next, 44.6 parts by weight of Ni particles, 52 parts by weight of terpineol, 3 parts by weight of ethyl cellulose and 0.4 part by weight of benzotriazole were kneaded by a triple roll to be a slurry, so that an internal electrode paste was obtained.",
        "By using the obtained dielectric layer paste, a green sheet was formed on a PET film by a doctor blade method. The internal electrode paste was printed thereon by a screen printing method. Then, the green sheet to be a cover is removed from the PET film, a plurality of green sheets were stacked to be a thickness of 300 \u03bcm or so, sheets printed with the internal electrode paste were removed from the PET film and stacked by the desired number (5 in this case), furthermore, a green sheet to be a cover was stacked again and bonded with a pressure, so that a green chip was obtained. Note that a thickness of the dielectric layer in a green state was 3.5 \u03bcm at this time.",
        "Next, the green chip was cut to be a predetermined size and subjected to binder removal processing, firing and annealing on the conditions below so as to obtain a chip sintered body. The binder processing condition was a temperature raising rate of 60\u00b0 C./hour, holding temperature of 260\u00b0 C., temperature holding time of 8 hours and atmosphere of in the air. The firing condition was a temperature raising rate of 200\u00b0 C./hour, holding temperature of 1240\u00b0 C., temperature holding time of 2 hours, temperature cooling rate of 200\u00b0 C./hour and atmosphere of a wet mixed gas of N2 and H2.

Note that a wetter, wherein a water temperature was 20\u00b0 C., was used to wet the atmosphere gas at firing and annealing.",
        "A size of the obtained sintered body was 3.2 mm in the length\u00d71.6 mm in the width\u00d70.6 mm in the height, and the number of dielectric layers between internal electrode layers was 5.",
        "After processing the obtained sintered body to give a thickness of 10 \u03bcm, the sample was made still thinner by ion milling. Then, a scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used for observation and it was confirmed that the sample was composed of crystal grains 2a and grain boundary phases 2b.",
        "After polishing and etching the obtained sintered body, the polished surface was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an average grain diameter of the crystal grains was measured based on the code method by assuming that the crystal grain 2a has a spherical shape. An average value of 250 measuring points was used as the average crystal grain diameter. The result was 0.32 \u03bcm.",
        "FIG. 3 to FIG. 5 show pictures of the fine structure of the crystal grains having the above explained average grain diameter of 0.32 \u03bcm observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and FIG. 6 to FIG. 8 show schematic views thereof.",
        "In FIGS. 3 and 6 and FIGS. 5 and 8, the dielectric particles (crystal grains) are confirmed to have the core-shell structure that a shell (a subcomponent dispersion layer), wherein subcomponents are dispersed in barium titanate, is provided around a core substantially composed of barium titanate as the main component in both cases, however, the shell thickness is uneven in FIGS. 3 and 6 whereas the shell thickness is uniform in FIGS. 5 and 8. On the other hand, in FIGS. 4 and 7, it is confirmed that a part of the shells is missing and the cores are partially open.",
        "Then, the maximum thickness t1 and the minimum thickness t2 of the shells 24a are calculated and the difference (t1\u2212t2) was obtained, then, a ratio thereof to a radius R (half the average particle diameter) of the dielectric particles having the above average particle diameter was calculated (indicated as \u201cdifference in dispersed region\u201d in Table). The result is shown in Table 1.",
        "Note that, in the present embodiment, the difference of the maximum thickness t1 and the minimum thickness t2 (t1\u2212t2) of the shells 24a was calculated as below. As shown in FIG. 9, a crystal grain having the average grain diameter was subjected to a line analysis with a TEM on a straight line passing the length of the grain through the approximate center thereof, then, another line analysis was made on the same grain by shifting the line by 45 degrees, a difference in the dispersed region was obtained, and the maximum value of the difference was considered as a difference in the dispersed region of the grain diameter. The analysis was made on n=10 grains and the average value was calculated (refer to FIG. 9).",
        "After polishing an end surface. of the obtained chip sintered body by sand blast, In\u2014Ga was applied as external electrodes and the multilayer ceramic capacitor shown in FIG. 1 was obtained.",
        "Evaluation was made on a relative permittivity \u03b5, temperature characteristic (TC) of the capacitance, TC bias and reliability of thus obtained capacitor samples, respectively. The results are shown in Table 1.",
        "The relative permittivity \u03b5 (no unit) was calculated from a capacitance of the obtained capacitor sample measured at a reference temperature of 25\u00b0 C. with a digital LCR meter (4274A made by YHP) under a condition of a frequency of 1 kHz and an input signal level (measurement voltage) of 1.0 Vrms. Those exhibited 1300 or higher were determined good in the evaluation criteria.",
        "The capacity-temperature characteristic (Tc) was obtained by measuring a capacitance of the obtained samples in a temperature range of \u221255 to 150\u00b0 C. A digital LCR meter (4274A made by YHP) was used for measuring the capacitance, and the measurement was made under a condition of a frequency of 1 kHz and an input signal level of 1 Vrms. Then, a capacitance change rate (\u0394C/C, the unit is %) was calculated under a temperature environment at 150\u00b0 C., at which the capacity-temperature characteristic becomes worst in the temperature range, and whether the X8R characteristics (\u221255 to 150\u00b0 C. and \u0394C/C=within \u00b115%) were satisfied or not were examined. Those with \u221215% or higher were determined preferable.",
        "The TC bias was measured on the obtained samples by a digital LCR meter (4274A made by YHP) at 1 kHz, 1 Vrms and a bias voltage (direct current voltage) of 7.0 V/\u03bcm by changing the temperature from \u221255\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. and evaluated by calculating a change rate of the capacitance from the measurement value at the time of not applying a bias voltage at 25\u00b0 C. Note that an LCR meter was used for measuring the capacitance, and the measurement was made under a condition of a frequency of 1 kHz and an input signal level of 1 Vrms. The evaluation criterion was that \u221240% or higher was determined preferable.",
