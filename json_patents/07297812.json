        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a process for preparing unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters.",
        "2. Discussion of the Background",
        "The unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters find use in the preparation of various polymer blends which comprise polymers which are generally regarded as immiscible with one another, for example polyesters and polyolefins (EP 0 496 116 A1, EP 0 499 717 A1). EP 0 519 642 describes the use of a copolymer of unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters in a polymeric blend consisting of polyphenylene ether and polyester. These copolymers based on unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters enable compatibility between these two polymer types.",
        "The unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters are prepared according to previously described processes by first cyclizing glycerol with an orthoester (see reaction 1) and reacting the resulting hydroxy orthoester with acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride in the presence of a base to give the target compound (see reaction 2). 4-Acryloyloxymethyl-2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane ((2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl acrylate, MMDA) can, for example, be prepared in this way when the substituent R of the acid chloride is a hydrogen atom.",
        "",
        "EP 0 471 222, EP 0 475 039 and EP 0 475 040 describe, for example, the reaction of glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) with methyl orthoacetate in methylene chloride in the presence of p toluenesulfonic acid according to reaction 1.",
        "The reaction of the cyclized orthoester with acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride in methylene chloride and in the presence of triethylamine according to reaction 2 is described, inter alia, by EP 0 496 116, EP 0 499 717, EP 0 519 642 and EP 0 731 141.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters, which features a good space-time yield and the use of inexpensive, commercially available raw materials.",
        "This and other objects have been achieved by the present invention the first embodiment of which includes a process for preparing an unsaturated, cyclic orthoester, comprising:",

        "in a second process stage, adding an orthoester to the reaction mixture, thereby obtaining said unsaturated, cyclic orthoester.",
        "It has been found that, surprisingly, the reaction of unsaturated carboxylic acids, for example acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, with glycidol and subsequent addition of an orthoester can afford the desired unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters, without the isolation and workup of the intermediate. The process according to the present invention has the advantage over known processes that the carboxylic acid used as a reactant, for example acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, is less expensive than the corresponding acid chloride, for example acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride. A further advantage of this process according to this invention is that the two process stages can be carried out in one and the same reactor without workup of the intermediates. Previously described processes are generally carried out in methylene chloride, reaction 1 being carried out in high dilution. In contrast, the process according to the present invention can be carried out without the presence of a solvent; in particular, the process according to the present invention can be carried out without the presence of halogenated compounds, for example methylene chloride.",

        "47 g of acrylic acid and 3.04 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid were initially charged in a round-bottom flask together with 0.2 g of hydroquinone and heated to 104\u00b0 C. 40 g of glycidol were added dropwise to this reactant mixture and the resulting solution was stirred at 100\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. 84 g of trimethyl orthoacetate were added dropwise to this reaction mixture, which was subsequently stirred at 25\u00b0 C. for one hour. The reaction mixture was then freed of the low boilers present by means of a distillation. Subsequently, a vacuum distillation was carried out at 4 mbar and 95\u00b0 C. 4-Acryloyloxymethyl-2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane was obtained in a yield of 56%.",
        "47 g of acrylic acid and 1.62 g of triethylamine were initially charged in a round-bottom flask together with 0.2 g of hydroquinone and heated to 70\u00b0 C. 40 g of glycidol were added dropwise to this reactant mixture and the resulting solution was stirred at 70\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 25\u00b0 C. 3 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid were added to this reaction mixture, then 84 g of trimethyl orthoacetate were added dropwise and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 25\u00b0 C. for one hour. The reaction mixture was then freed of the low boilers present by means of a distillation. Subsequently, a vacuum distillation was carried out at 4 mbar and 95\u00b0 C. 4-Acryloyloxymethyl-2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane was obtained in a yield of 45%.",
        "Glycidol and acrylic acid which comprises 6.4% by weight of triethylamine hydrochloride and 0.6% by weight of hydroquinone were metered together into a loop reactor heated to 125\u00b0 C. The metering rate for glycidol was 40 g/h; that for the acrylic acid/hydroquinone/catalyst solution was 41 g/h. The residence time was approx. 15 min. The effluent of the loop reactor within one hour was collected, cooled and admixed with 69 g of trimethyl orthoacetate. The mixture was stirred at 25\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. A crude product of the 4-acryloyloxymethyl-2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane was obtained in a yield of 63% by GC analysis.",
