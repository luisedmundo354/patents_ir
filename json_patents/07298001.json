        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Capacitor structures are able to store charges, and can be applied to many sorts of integrated circuits, such as RFIC and MMIC. A capacitor structure consists of two parallel electrical plates with an insulation layer between thereof. Please refer to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structure according to the prior art.

        "An inter-digitated capacitor structure has been gradually replacing the conventional MIM capacitor structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,359 discloses an inter-digitated capacitor structure. Please refer to FIGS. 2-3. FIG. 2 is a schematic external diagram of a prior art inter-digitated capacitor structure 30.

As FIGS. 2-3 show, the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 30 is composed of a first electrode structure and a second electrode structure. The first electrode structure comprises a plurality of first metal patterns 32 stacked vertically with respect to each other. The second electrode structure comprises a plurality of second metal patterns 34 stacked vertically with respect to each other. In addition, each first metal pattern 32 comprises a first peripheral part 321 and a plurality of first finger parts 322 connected to the first peripheral part 321. Each second metal pattern 34 comprises a second peripheral part 341 and a plurality of second finger parts 342 connected to the second peripheral part 341. Furthermore, a capacitor dielectric layer 38 (not shown in FIG. 2) is disposed between each first metal pattern 32 and each second metal pattern 34. The prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 30 further comprises a plurality of first connective plugs 40 disposed among the capacitor dielectric layers 38 between the first peripheral parts 321 of each first metal pattern 32, so every first metal pattern 32 electrically connects with each other. Additionally, there are a plurality of second connective plugs 42 disposed among the capacitor dielectric layer 38 between the second peripheral parts 341 of each second metal pattern 34, so every second metal pattern 34 electrically connects with each other.",
        "As FIG. 2 shows, the first metal patterns 32 connected with each other by the first connective plugs 40 make up a first electrode structure. The second metal patterns 34 connected with each other by the second connective plugs 42 make up a second electrode structure. Furthermore, the first metal patterns 32, the second metal patterns 34, and the capacitor dielectric layer between the first metal patterns 32 and the second metal patterns 34 form the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 30. As FIG. 3 shows, the first finger parts 322 of the first metal patterns 32 are connected to a positive voltage, and the second finger parts 342 of the second metal patterns 34 are connected to a negative voltage.",
        "The prior inter-digitated capacitor structure has another embodiment. Please refer to FIGS. 4-5. FIG. 4 is a schematic external diagram of a prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 50. FIG. 5 is a schematic sectional diagram of the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 50, taken across sections V-V of FIG. 4. As FIGS. 4-5 show, the prior inter-digitated capacitor structure 50 consists of a first electrode structure and a second electrode structure. The first electrode structure comprises a plurality of first metal patterns 52 stacked vertically with respect to each other. The second electrode structure comprises a plurality of second metal patterns 54 stacked vertically with respect to each other.

        "As FIGS. 4-5 show, the difference between the inter-digitated capacitor structure of FIGS. 2-3 and the inter-digitated capacitor structure of FIGS. 4-5 is that the first electrode structure of the inter-digitated capacitor structure 50 is mismatched with the second electrode structure. Therefore, a first finger part 522 combined with four second finger parts 542 that are respectively adjacent to the first finger part 522 will form a capacitor.",
        "Compared with the MIM capacitor structure, the inter-digitated capacitor structure has better capacitance while it maintains the same size. The capacitance, however, is not the only consideration of the capacitor structure. Because the finger parts of the inter-digitated capacitor structure have longer lengths, and the finger parts are only connected electrically on one side, the resistance is correspondingly high, and the matching of the inter-digitated capacitor structure needs to be improved.",

The conductive grids of an even conductive layer and the conductive island of an odd conductive layer are also connected electrically by the plugs. As FIG. 10 shows, when the odd conductive layer and even conductive layer individually connect with different voltages, the three-dimensional capacitor structure 90 is utilized as a capacitor. The total capacitance is the sum of the horizontal capacitance in the horizontal direction and the vertical capacitance in the vertical direction. The horizontal capacitance is the capacitance between the same level conductive grid and the conductive island (equal to the capacitance between the first conductive grid 721 and the first conductive island 723, and between the second conductive grid 761 and the second conductive island 763, as shown in FIGS. 6-8) added to the capacitance between the same level plugs (e.g. the plug 741 in FIG. 7). The vertical capacitance is a result of the capacitance between a different level conductive grid and an adjacent conductive grid (e.g. the capacitance between the first conductive ring 724 and the second conductive grid 761, and the capacitance between the second conductive ring 764 and the first conductive grid 721).",
