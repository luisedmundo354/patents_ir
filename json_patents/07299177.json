When a customer communicates with a particular entity, such as a customer service center, the system makes a recording of the real-time call including both the customer's and agent's voices. The system segments the recording to extract at least a portion of the customer's voice to create a customer voice print, and it formats the segmented voice print for network transmission to a server. The server compares the customer's voice print with multiple known voice prints to determine any matches, meaning that the customer's voice print and one of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. The identification of any matches can be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer.",

        "The present invention generally relates to limiting fraud, and more particularly, relates to an apparatus and method for performing a one-to-many comparison of voice prints to determine if a particular caller voice print matches any one of many known voice prints in order to perform an action related to a financial transaction account.",
        "Preventing attempted fraud in telephonic or other transactions involving oral communications is typically important to many entities, particularly when the fraud involves financial transactions. For example, when a person loses a credit card and calls the credit card company to obtain a replacement, the credit card company often wants to ensure that the person calling is the true cardholder. If a person attempts to fraudulently obtain a replacement card of a different cardholder, then the person may use the replacement credit card to make fraudulent charges. The credit card company can often incur significant losses due to these fraudulent charges. Therefore, the credit card company typically desires to reduce or eliminate fraud.",
        "In that regard, credit card companies often implement certain procedures and install technologies in an attempt to verify the identity of customers who call them. One such technology is the use of an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) service, which attempts to identify the telephone number of an incoming call. A credit card company can maintain a database of area codes from which it has historically received a high number of fraudulent callers. If the telephone number of the person calling is within one of those high fraud area codes, the credit card company can flag the call for additional procedures or investigation to verify the true identity of the caller.",
        "However, the ANI service has certain limitations. For example, the ANI service does not easily permit one to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the caller. Also, it is possible that multiple persons can be associated with the same telephone number, which can make it difficult to identify which of those persons is the caller. Ultimately, the ANI service only provides a general indication of whether the caller is from an area known to be associated with a high number of fraudulent transactions. However, if the caller is not calling from one of those high fraud area codes, the ANI service provides no indication to provide additional screening, although the caller may actually be attempting to actually engage in fraud.",
        "Aside from credit card companies, many other entities receive calls from customers and desire a way to verify the true identity of the callers. This verification can be useful, for example, in determining whether to execute a particular transaction requested by a caller. Accordingly, a need exists for a more reliable way to minimize fraud in telephonic transactions or other transactions involving oral communications, or to screen callers for other purposes during those transactions.",
        "A method and apparatus consistent with the present invention provides for facilitating the analysis of a caller's voice to determine a potential match with known callers'voices. In the method and apparatus, an agent receives a communication from a caller, and an electronic representation is recorded of both the caller's and agent's voices from the real-time telephone call. The electronic representation of the caller's voice is segmented from the agent's voice to produce a caller voice print, and the caller voice print is compared with a plurality of known voice prints to determine if the caller voice print matches any of the known voice prints. An indication of the comparison is output or otherwise transmitted via a network and can be used for a variety of purposes.",

        "The detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention herein makes reference to the accompanying drawings and pictures, which show the exemplary embodiment by way of illustration and its best mode. While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented.",
        "Embodiments consistent with the present invention provide for one-to-few or one-to-many comparisons of callers' voice prints with known voice prints to identify any matches between them. A caller's voice print represents an electronic recording of a caller's voice, and the known voice prints represent electronic recordings of persons having a particular known characteristic. For example, the known voice prints can correspond with persons known to have engaged in attempted fraudulent transactions. Alternatively, the characteristic for the known voice prints may relate to other factors or criteria.",
        "When a customer calls a particular entity, such as a customer service center, the system makes a recording of the real-time call including both the customer's and agent's voices. The system segments the recording to extract at least a portion of the customer's voice to create a customer voice print, typically in digital form for computer processing. The system also formats the segmented customer voice print for network transmission to a server. Although the processing may occur locally, in some embodiments it can occur at a remote server, requiring network transmission of the customer's voice print. Also, the term customer is used for exemplary purposes and is intended to include any type of caller (e.g., merchant, travel agent, cardholder, agent of cardholder, processor, administrator, and/or the like) and any type of communication (e.g., human or electronic voice).",
        "The server compares the customer's voice print with multiple known voice prints to determine any substantial matches, meaning that the customer's voice print and one of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. The identification of any matches can be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer. For example, a cardholder may call a credit card institution to request replacement of a lost or stolen credit card. The credit card institution wants to ensure that the person calling is the true cardholder and not someone attempting to fraudulently obtain another person's credit card. By comparing the customer's voice print with the multiple known voice prints, associated with persons having attempted fraudulent transactions, the system can determine whether this customer is likely attempting to interact with another person's credit card account based upon any matches with the known voice prints.",
        "As other examples, the system and method disclosed herein may be used to help minimize any fraud related to telephone communications, merchant communications, travel communications, cardholder communications, opening a transaction card account, closing a transaction card account, opening a related transaction account, changing demographic information related to the account and changing financial information related to the transaction card account.",
        "An \u201caccount\u201d or \u201caccount number\u201d, as used herein, may include any device, code, number, letter, symbol, digital certificate, smart chip, digital signal, analog signal, biometric or other identifier/indicia suitably configured to allow the consumer to interact or communicate with the system, such as, for example, authorization/access code, personal identification number (PIN), Internet code, other identification code, and/or the like which is optionally located on a rewards card, charge card, credit card, debit card, prepaid card, telephone card, smart card, magnetic stripe card, bar code card, transponder, radio frequency card and/or the like. The account number may be distributed and stored in any form of plastic, electronic, magnetic, radio frequency, wireless, audio and/or optical device capable of transmitting or downloading data from itself to a second device. A customer account number may be, for example, a sixteen-digit credit card number, although each credit provider has its own numbering system, such as the fifteen-digit numbering system used by American Express. Each company's credit card numbers comply with that company's standardized format such that the company using a sixteen-digit format will generally use four spaced sets of numbers, as represented by the number \u201c0000 0000 0000 0000\u201d. The first five to seven digits are reserved for processing purposes and identify the issuing bank, card type and etc. In this example, the last sixteenth digit is used as a sum check for the sixteen-digit number. The intermediary eight-to-ten digits are used to uniquely identify the customer. A merchant account number may be, for example, any number or alpha-numeric characters that identifies a particular merchant for purposes of card acceptance, account reconciliation, reporting, or the like.",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary system 10 for processing calls. System 10 includes an agent computer 18 having a connection via a network 16 with a server computer 14. Agent computer 18 also includes an associated agent telephone or other oral communication device 20. System 10 includes a customer telephone or other oral communication device 24 for a customer or other type of caller to contact an agent at agent telephone 20 via a communications network 22. While the system will be described herein with respect to telephone communications, one skilled in the art will appreciate that any communication device now known or hereinafter developed may also be used in the present invention.",

In one embodiment with one-to-many comparisons, the comparison can determine whether a caller's voice print matches any of the known voice prints in the database. The known voice prints can correspond with any particular criteria. For example, the known voice prints may correspond with individuals known to have attempted fraudulent transactions in the past. Therefore, by knowing if a caller's voice print matches any of the known voice prints, in this example, the system can provide an indication of whether this particular caller will likely attempt a fraudulent transaction.",
        "In one embodiment, the processing for recording callers'voice prints and making the comparison typically occurs at both agent computer 18 and server computer 14.

        "FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an exemplary recording method 50 for recording calls for processing. Method 50 can be implemented in, for example, hardware and/or software modules for execution by agent computer 18. The various steps of method 50, and other described methods, are shown in a particular order for illustrative purposes. The steps may occur in a different order and steps may be added or eliminated from the methods, depending upon a particular implementation, for example.",
        "In method 50, a customer call is received from customer telephone 24 via communications network 22 (step 52). As indicated above, this call can be received from a variety of types of telephones or other communications devices via any communications network. The customer call is routed to agent telephone 20 (step 54), such as via a PBX or other switching device in that system 10 typically includes many agent computers and telephones for processing customer calls.",
        "During the telephone call, agent computer 18 records at least a portion of the call, including both the agent's and caller's (customer's) voice (step 56). Agent computer 18, via a connection with agent telephone 20, can receive an analog signal representing the real-time telephone call and can digitize and store it for processing. Agent computer 18 segments at least a portion of the caller's voice from the agent's voice (step 58). The segmentation refers to identifying within the recording at least a portion representing the caller's voice and extracting it from the recording. Therefore, the segmented recording includes an electronic representation of only the caller's voice, possibly with background noise. Algorithms are known in the art for performing this type of segmentation. Each person's voice has a unique voice print, due to for example the various combinations of frequencies within each person's voice, and thus one person's voice can be extracted from a recording containing multiple voice recordings.",
        "The recording of the segmented caller's voice is formatted by agent computer 18 for transmission via network 16 (step 60). For example, it can be formatted into a wav file, known in the art and identified by a .wav extension. The use of a wav file, for example, provides for a standard format for network transmission to server computer 14. Alternatively, the recording can be formatted into any type of file that can be transmitted via a TCP/IP or other network.",
        "Agent computer 18 transmits the file, having the recorded caller's voice print, to server computer 14 for processing (step 62), explained below. Agent computer 18 can optionally receive back from server computer 14 results of the processing (step 64). For example, an agent at agent computer 18 may want to receive the results while still engaged in a telephone call with a customer at customer telephone 24. The agent can potentially use those results during the telephone call to determine whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer such as, for example, opening a transaction card account, closing a transaction card account, opening a related transaction account, changing demographic information related to an account and changing financial information related to a transaction card account.",
        "FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a method 70 for processing calls by facilitating the comparison of at least a portion of caller voice prints with known voice prints. Method 70 can be implemented in, for example, software modules for execution by server computer 14. In method 70, server computer 14 receives a file via network 16 from agent computer 18 (step 72). The file contains a voice print of the caller's voice, formatted for example in a wav file. In an exemplary embodiment, server computer 14 can possibly operate in at least two modes, real-time and batch processing, as determined in step 74. The real-time mode refers to almost immediately processing the caller's voice print upon receipt and providing results of the processing back to the agent, typically while still engaged in a telephone call with the customer. The batch processing mode refers to saving the file for later processing with a group of files. The batch processing has the advantage of processing many files at once, during a particular time, and thus more efficiently making use of the processing capability of server computer 14.",
        "The particular mode selected can be based upon any particular criteria. For example, server computer 14 may by default operate in the batch processing mode but could be switched to the real-time mode by an agent for a particular customer's voice print. Alternatively, server computer 14 can be programmed to operate in one or both the modes based upon a desired application.",
        "Database 12 can store the known voice prints in any particular data structure and format. In addition, it can also associate other information with each of the voice prints, such as an identification of the person corresponding with each voice print and characteristics of the person. For example, the characteristics can include the types of fraudulent transactions attempted by the corresponding person. Any databases discussed herein may be any type of database, such as relational, hierarchical, object-oriented, and/or the like. Common database products that may be used to implement the databases include DB2by IBM (White Plains, N.Y.), any of the database products available from Oracle Corporation (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Microsoft Access or MSSQL by Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), or any other database product. Database may be organized in any suitable manner, including as data tables or lookup tables. Association of certain data may be accomplished through any data association technique known and practiced in the art. For example, the association may be accomplished either manually or automatically. Automatic association techniques may include, for example, a database search, a database merge, GREP, AGREP, SQL, and/or the like. The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function, for example, using a \u201ckey field\u201d in each of the manufacturer and retailer data tables. A \u201ckey field\u201d partitions the database according to the high-level class of objects defined by the key field. For example, a certain class may be designated as a key field in both the first data table and the second data table, and the two data tables may then be merged on the basis of the class data in the key field. In this embodiment, the data corresponding to the key field in each of the merged data tables is preferably the same. However, data tables having similar, though not identical, data in the key fields may also be merged by using AGREP, for example.",
        "Table 1 illustrates an example of how database 12 can store the known voice prints.",

        "In the real-time mode, server computer 14 compares the caller's voice print with the known voice prints in database 12 (step 76). For example, the comparison step 76 can include determining a match between the caller's voice print and one of the known voice prints based upon a probability, greater than a particular threshold, that the caller voice print and one of the known voice prints are from a voice of the same person. Therefore, the comparison seeks to determine whether the caller's voice print and any of the known voice prints are likely from the same person. Algorithms are known in the art for performing this type of comparison and can include, for example, statistical analysis between the voice prints. This comparison is typically performed sequentially between the caller's voice print and each of the known voice prints.",
        "Server computer 14 records an indication of any matches found as a result of the comparison (step 78). Server computer 14 formats the results into a report (step 80) and transmits the report back to agent computer 18 via network 16 (step 82). Examples of reports are provided below. For step 82, the report may be transmitted back to the live agent handling the corresponding telephone call; alternatively, the report can be transmitted to other agents or entities for processing.",
        "In the batch processing mode, server computer 14 saves the received file in a group of unprocessed files (step 84), possibly in database 12. Server computer 14 determines if it is time for batch processing of the group of unprocessed files (step 86). The batch processing can occur at a time based upon any particular parameters. For example, server computer 14 may be programmed to process, at a particular time each day, the group of files saved since the previous processing of files. Alternatively, server computer can process the group of unprocessed files at multiple times during each day or every multiple days. One advantage of this batch processing is that it can be performed at a time of day, for example, when server computer 14 typically has greater bandwidth.",
        "When it is time for batch processing, server computer 14 retrieves a file from the group of unprocessed files (step 88) and compares the voice print in the file with the known voice prints in database 12 (step 90). The comparison can include the same processing described with respect to step 76. Server computer 14 records an indication of any matches from the comparison (step 92). If there are more files in the group to be processed (step 94), server computer 14 repeats steps 88, 90, and 92 for the next file. Once the group of unprocessed files have all been processed, server computer 14 formats the results into a report and saves them (step 96). Server computer 14 can optionally use the results of processing to determine whether to authorize particular transactions for customers relating to the recorded voice prints in the processed files (step 98). For example, it can automatically and programmatically deny the requested transaction if any matches are found for the caller voice print in question.",
        "FIG. 5 is a diagram of an exemplary report 100 for providing results of the processing in steps 80 and 96. Report 100 can be formatted in, for example, a web page or screen using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for display on the agent computer 18 or server computer 14 using a web browser. It can alternatively be formatted in any type of electronic screen. Report 100 includes, for example, a section 102 providing an identification of a particular customer whose voice print was recorded. A section 104 can display identifications of known voice prints in database 12 that match the caller's voice print. In addition, other information concerning the matches can optionally be displayed as well.",
        "The computers discussed herein may provide a suitable website, webpage or other Internet-based graphical user interface which is accessible by users. In one embodiment, the Internet Information Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and Microsoft SQL Server, are used in conjunction with the Microsoft operating system, Microsoft NT web server software, a Microsoft SQL database system, and a Microsoft Commerce Server. Additionally, components such as Access or SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix MySQL, Intervase, etc., may be used to provide an ADO-compliant database management system. The term \u201cwebpage\u201d as it is used herein is not meant to limit the type of documents and applications that might be used to interact with the user. For example, a typical website might include, in addition to standard HTML documents, various forms, Java applets, Javascript, active server pages (ASP), common gateway interface scripts (CGI), extensible markup language (XML), dynamic HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), helper applications, plug-ins, and the like. A server may include a webservice which receives a request from a browser which includes a URL (http://yahoo.com/stockquotes/ge) and an IP address (123.56.789). The webservice retrieves the appropriate webpages and sends the webpages to the IP address.",
        "Table 2 illustrates a more detailed exemplary format for report 100 containing results of the processing. A caller's voice print might typically match only one of the known voice prints, as the known voice prints may be from different persons. However, it is possible that one person can have multiple voice prints in database 12 of known voice prints, making multiple matches with the caller's voice print a possibility. In addition, the system can be configured to provide a degree of reliability for each match, again providing for multiple matches based upon multiple degrees of reliability. For example, the system might discover a match having a 95% degree of reliability, meaning that statistically there is a 95% probability that the caller's voice print and the matched known voice print are from the same person. If configured in this manner, report 100 (and Table 2) can include a section to identify the degree of reliability for each of the matched known voice prints.",
        "In Table 2, the IDs for the matches can include optional information for identifying a person corresponding with the matched voice print. The characteristics for the matches can include, for example, the types of fraudulent transactions attempted by the corresponding person, as shown in Table 1. Also, additional information can be associated with each report, if desired.",

For example, it can be a web page for transmission via network 16 and display on agent computer 20 or server computer 14 using a web browser. If represented electronically, report 100 can be e-mailed to the agent at agent computer 18 or any particular subscribers to it. If the processing occurs in the real-time mode, report 100 can be transmitted and displayed to the agent in, for example, a pop-up window on agent computer 18. Therefore, the agent can view results of the processing, most likely while still engaged in a telephone call with a customer, and use those results to determine whether to authorize a transaction requested by the customer.",
        "The results of the processing can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, they can be used to determine whether to authorize a transaction or request, or verify the identity of the caller. As other examples, they can be used to help prevent any telephone fraud, merchant fraud, travel fraud, or cardholder fraud, possibly in step 82 of process method 70. In particular, if the caller's voice print matches any of the voice prints of persons known to have attempted to engage in fraudulent transactions, as determined by the processing explained above, the caller can be refused authorization to engage in any merchant, travel, or cardholder transaction.",
        "The information in the reports from results of the processing can also be stored in database 12, or other location, and used for data mining purposes. For example, various types of processing can occur using the stored data to generate statistical analysis of it.",
