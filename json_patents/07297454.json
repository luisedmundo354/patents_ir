    "description": [
        "The present invention is directed generally to non-impact inkjet printers, such as piezo and thermal, and, more particularly, to colorless ink jet ink compositions for such printers.",
        "Along with the computerization of offices in the 1980's came electronically controlled non-impact printers such as the ink jet and laser printers. Drop-on-demand inkjet printers can be piezo or thermal (bubble jet). In piezo ink jet systems, ink drop-lets are ejected by an oscillating piezo crystal. However, the thermal ink jet dominates the drop-on-demand photo ink jet market. In this system, rapid heating behind the ink nozzles cause a bubble of vapor to form in the ink. The resulting bubble expansion and ink ejection from the inkjet printer cartridge causes printing to appear on the substrate.",
        "Full-color inkjet printers are more common than color lasers and are much more economical. The main advantage of inkjet printers over lasers and other non-impact printing techniques include their low cost and simplicity. Thermal inkjet systems are capable of dispensing ink rapidly and accurately. The technology of this and other inkjet systems are discussed in the Chemistry and Technology of Printing and Imaging Systems, edited by P. Gregory, published by Chapman & Hall, 1996. Representative thermal inkjet systems and cartridges are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,895 to Buck et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,513,298 to Scheu, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,794,409 to Cowger et al., which are all hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The technology of inkjet printers has undergone many changes and improvements since they first appeared. Research has been conducted to ensure that the images produced are of consistent high quality. Thus, it is important that the images be permanent by being lightfast, airfast, and stain resistant, and the like when exposed to the atmosphere, light, and daily use by typical consumers. Another important feature is print quality. The image must appear uniform in gloss, especially for photographic printing.",
        "As used herein, air fastness will mean that the images do not fade when exposed to the atmosphere. Air fastness is a measure of permanence as used herein. Air fastness is measured by exposing printed images to gas in a chamber and comparing print density before and after the exposure.",
        "Another desired feature of printed images is light fastness. As used herein, light fastness will mean that the images do not fade when exposed to light. Light fastness is another measure of permanence as used herein. Light fastness is measured by exposing printed images to intense light in light chambers (fadomers) and comparing print density before and after the exposure.",
        "Dye based inkjet ink produces super image quality, or photo quality, with gloss media type substrates. However, the images can not last very long due to light and gas fade. Currently, there are two commonly used ways of addressing this problem: 1) laminate the printer image with a coating; or 2) use pigmented ink instead of dye based inks. The first approach is costly and adds complexity to the printing process. The second approach faces the challenge of matching the photo and image quality of the dye based ink. To help solve the problem associated with pigmented inks, many in the industry use porous semi-gloss media that allows fast dry and good spreading of the pigmented ink. As a result, the inked area has high gloss from the pigment ink formula and good image quality, but the areas without print, or white areas, have loss gloss. This produces an objectionable non-uniform glossy surface when viewed.",
        "As stated above pigmented inks for photographic printing requires, among other things, fast-drying glossy media. By \u201cphotographic printing\u201d is typically meant graphic art and photographic prints, typically from digital. Examples of such printers include Hewlett-Packard's DesignJet series (2000, 2500CP, 2800, 3500CP, 3800, 5000, 5000PS); an example of a glossy media printer includes Hewlett-Packard's Photosmart Printer. The afore-mentioned printers print on porous, glossy media, among others.",
        "Thus, an ink composition is required that eliminates, or at least minimizes, the foregoing problems, while providing improved image quality print on porous, or hybrid porous glossy or semi-glossy media, consistent with silver halide photography.",
        "Moreover, this invention provides durability and stain resistance to photos printed with pigmented inks such that lamination is not needed.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, a colorless ink jet ink composition is provided for use with pigmented inks printed on porous, semi-porous, and hybrid glossy or semi-glossy media. The colorless ink composition comprises a soluble polymer or dispersed latex (collectively referred to herein as \u201cpolymer\u201d) as well as an ink vehicle. Preferred soluble polymers include acrylics and styreneacrylics. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the polymer in the colorless ink acts similarly to pigments and clogs the pores of the porous or semi-porous media to increase the gloss and make it more uniform over the entire surface of the media. In contrast to known colorless fluids used for inkjet printing, especially in 5th pen formulations, this invention does not overprint or underprint the colorless fluid with the color inks but uses the colorless ink to fill in the spaces wherein there is an absence of color to promote a uniform surface. So-called 5th pen, or fixer, formulations are mainly concerned with interactions between the colorless fluid and the color inks for bleed control or stability. This invention is designed to provide a uniform glossy appearance and stain resistance to photos. By \u201c5th pen\u201d is meant additional pens over the basic inkset of C, Y, M, and K. There may be additional pens containing gray and other colors as well.",
        "The total polymer or latex concentration ranges from about 0.5 to about 15, preferably from about 2 to about 7, wt % of the colorless ink composition. The colorless ink is substantially free of colorants visible to the unaided eye. By \u201csubstantially free\u201d is meant that colors are not present such that the unaided eye cannot detect a color. This means typically from 0 to less than about 0.01% colorant is present. Dyes or pigments free of colorants and typically invisible to the unaided eye includes IR or UV dyes and may be included herein.",
        "A printer, such as the DesignJet 5000PS that accommodates the hybrid glossy media will provide the customer with substantially fast ink drying while maintaining the light fastness, air fastness, and stain resistance of the ink, compared to prior art inks.",
        "The ink of the present invention improves overall image quality. The ink can also pass harsh pen material compatibility tests. The ink does not puddle on the surface of the orifice plate in the default pen, yet has low viscosity. The ink is excellent in pen reliability such as long decap time, no decel, no kogation, and good drop directionality.",
        "The term \u201cdecap time\u201d refers to the time required for ink to crust in the nozzles of the pen; a long decap time is desired. By \u201cdecel\u201d is meant that the velocity of ink drops decreases with time during continuous firing of the pen, and is an undesirable property. However, some decel is acceptable in colorless inks because they are invisible.",
        "FIG. 1 reflects the gloss value of ink versus the acrylic polymer concentration.",
        "FIG. 2 shows gloss on Epson Luster media as ink lay-down increases.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates the gloss of magenta and cyan area fills with and without the clear ink.",
        "The invention described herein is directed to improved inks for printing ink-jet images using commercially-available ink-jet printers, such as those manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif. The colorless inks of the present invention can produce a clear, glossy surface on the media, whether porous, semi-porous, or hybrid, with high air fastness, stain resistance, and light fastness. Any known ink formlation, with the removal of the colorant and the presence of the polymers described herein, can work as the colorless ink useful herein. Those skilled in the art will be able to select and optimize the ingredients that work with the polymers of this invention and provide the colorless inks.",
        "The colored inks of the present invention include yellow, cyan, magenta, black inks containing a yellow pigment, a cyan pigment, a magenta pigment, and black pigment respectively.",
        "The amount of pigment used is within the range from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent. A more preferable range of pigment ranges from about 1 to about 15% by weight, still more preferably is a range of from about 2% to about 12% by wt.",
        "Examples of pigments used for a yellow ink include C.I. Pigment Yellow 1, C.I. Pigment Yellow 2, C.I. Pigment Yellow 3, C.I. Pigment Yellow 13, C.I. Pigment Yellow 16, C.I. Pigment Yellow 83, Pigment Yellow 74, Pigment Yellow 138 Pigment Yellow 158, Pigment Yellow 128, Pigment Yellow 151, and the like. Examples of pigments used for magenta ink include C.I.

Vat Blue 6, and the like. Pigments whose performance properties are satisfactory when formulated for the present invention are considered to be within its scope.",
        "The colored ink formulations to use for the print image in conjunction with the colorless inks of the present invention comprises a colorant plus a vehicle. A typical vehicle formulation for an ink useful in the practice of this invention includes the colorant, present in about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent, one or more co-solvents, present from 0 to 50 weight percent, one or more water-soluble surfactants, present in about 0.1 to 4 weight percent. The balance of the formulation is purified water. The colorless ink is similar except for the absence of a colorant and the presence of a soluble polymer or latex.",
        "One or more co-solvents may be added to the formulation of the ink of this invention. Classes of co-solvents include, but are not limited to, aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols, diols, glycol ethers, polyglycol ethers, caprolactams, formamides, acetamides, and long chain alcohols. Examples of such compounds include primary aliphatic alcohols, secondary aliphatic alcohols, 1,2-alcohols, 1,3-alcohols, 1,5-alcohols, ethylene glycol alkyl ethers, propylene glycol alkyl ethers, higher homologs of polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, N-alkyl caprolactams, unsubstituted caprolactams, both substituted and unsubstituted formamides, both substituted and unsubstituted acetamides, and the like.",
        "One class of preferred co-solvents that provides water miscibility to polymers is glycols. A particularly preferred glycol is polyethylene glycol, commonly abbreviated as PEG. Polyethylene glycol is hydrophilic.",
        "Water-soluble surfactants may be employed in the formulation of the vehicle of the ink of this invention. The purpose of surfactants as described herein is to facilitate the miscibility of the ingredients of the ink composition. The surfactant(s) used are known by those skilled in the art of ink formulation and may be alkyl polyethylene oxides, alkyl phenyl polyethylene oxides, polyethylene oxide block copolymers, acetylenic polyethylene oxides, polyethylene oxide (di)esters, polyethylene oxide amines, protonated polyethylene oxide amines, protonated polyethylene oxide amides, dimethicone copolyols, substitued amine oxides, and the like. The amount of surfactant added to the formulation of this invention may range from less than one to about 10 weight percent. A more preferred amount is from 1 to about 3 weight percent.",
        "Consistent with the formulation of this invention, various other additives may be employed to optimize the properties of the ink composition for specific applications. Examples of these additives are those added to inhibit the growth of harmful microorganisms. These additives may be biocides, fungicides, and other microbial agents, which are routinely used in ink formulations. Examples of suitable microbial agents include, but are not limited to, Nuosept (Nudex, Inc.), Ucarcide (Union carbide Corp.), Vancide (R.T. Vanderbilt Co.), and Proxel (ICI America).",
        "Sequestering agents such as EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid) may be included to eliminate the deleterious effects of heavy metal impurities, and buffer solutions may be used to control the pH of the ink. Viscosity modifiers may also be present, as well as other additives known to those skilled in the art to modify properties of the ink as desired.",
        "All concentrations herein are in weight percent of the total ink composition, unless otherwise indicated. The purity of all components is that employed in normal commercial practice for ink-jet inks.",
        "The black ink suitably employed in the practice of the present invention is also pigment-based. The black ink can also be a composite of the three primary colors, yellow, cyan, and magenta.

        "Similar to Example 1, this ink also improved gloss on Epson Luster media as ink lay-down increased (FIG. 2). FIG. 3 illustrates the gloss of magenta and cyan area fills with and without the clear ink.",
        "Gloss uniformity was achieved across entire color tone range through the addition of clear ink mainly onto the white and low color density areas. Total ink flux per unit area was maintained constant. Table 2b and 2c explain the printing mechanism. As indicated by the standard deviation, gloss uniformity was improved to excellence with the use of clear ink.",

Table 3b shows the scores for testing the stain resistance on various media using color ink plus the colorless ink of this invention with Seneca Mixed Berry Juice applied to an area and allowed to stand for one minute. The juice was removed with a dry cloth. Both stains were ranked with the following 5-point scale",
