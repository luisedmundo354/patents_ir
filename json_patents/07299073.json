        "This Application is a Continuation of, and claims the benefit of, application Ser. No. 09/967,058 filed Sep. 28, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,973,314.",
        "The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a system and related methods for clustering multi-point communication targets",
        "Wireless communication systems are not new. Indeed, two-way radio technology dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, while its progeny, cellular telephony systems, were first introduced in the early 70's. In traditional wireless communication systems, a wireless communication station facilitates wireless communication with remote communication device(s) (e.g., wireless subscriber units, mobile computing devices, and the like) via a wireless communication link(s). As the technology developed and the cost associated with owning and using such wireless communication devices has decreased, the popularity of the wireless telephony systems has exploded. To accommodate this growth in the subscriber base, digital cellular techniques were developed and standardized to increase user capacity of the cellular system without a commensurate increase in the radio frequency (RF) power generated within the system.",
        "Initially, individual communication channels were defined as a carrier frequency, i.e., the so-called Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) wireless systems. More recently, a number of different digital wireless communication technologies have been introduced and provide the basis for a number of wireless communication system architectures. Two primary examples of digital wireless technology are the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA) technologies.",
        "In a TDMA system, a carrier frequency is parsed into independent incremental units of time, referred to as a timeslot, wherein each timeslot at a carrier frequency supports an independent communication session between a subscriber unit (or, handset) and a communication station (or, base station). That is, while a communication channel in a conventional analog (FDMA) communication system is commonly defined by its carrier frequency, a communication channel in a TDMA system is defined by a timeslot on a particular carrier frequency. Carving a given carrier frequency into N-independent timeslots results in an N-fold increase in system capacity over traditional FDMA system, with only a nominal increase in radiated power. In practice, an increase in capacity of two- to eight-fold has been achieved.",
        "In a CDMA system, a communication channel is defined by a pseudo-noise (PN) code contained in the header of digital communication packets passed between the subscriber unit and the communication station. To further enhance system capacity, the CDMA system is a spread-spectrum system wherein the communication channel (defined by the PN code) hops through any of a number of carrier frequencies over an assigned band of radio frequency (or higher) spectrum.",
        "Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the wireless communication link between any two communicating entities is often the weakest portion of a communication chain, especially when the location of one or more of the entities is uncontrolled and moves. Under such circumstances, the radio link can become weak as the distance between the entities increases, or as obstacles occur in the physical path of the signal propagation. Furthermore, in the multiple access communication systems discussed above (e.g., FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, etc.) carrier frequency reuse is employed to support communication sessions among a number of geographically dispersed users. Such co-channel users are supposed to be separated geographically by sufficient distance so that their respective communication sessions do not interfere with one another. This constraint of geographic separation in frequency reuse limits the capacity of the system, and is often an imperfect guard against interference.",
        "Adaptive array technology offers increased performance in such radio frequency (RF) networks by employing multiple antennae for radio transmission from one or more of the entities, controlling one or more of the relative phase and amplitude of the signal transmitted from each antenna within the array to spatially direct the RF energy towards desired recipients, and away from co-channel users.",
        "This technique is very effective when the communication link is a point-to-point link, i.e., a wireless communication channel dedicated to communication between a single user terminal and a basestation, such as in conventional two-way communication systems. In an increasingly large number of wireless communication implementations, however, there is more than one intended recipient of a communication link, each of which should be able to receive the signal. An example of just such an implementation is the general packet radio service, or GPRS.",
        "Those skilled in the art will appreciate that GPRS, as originally conceived, is implemented over a TDMA-based wireless communication system, wherein up to eight different users may selectively share a communication channel. From the end-user perspective, the GPRS service managed by a GPRS-enabled communication station provides a virtual packet-switched network utilizing circuit-switched communication resources of the TDMA system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a packet-based communication systems such as the GPRS facilitate the so-called \u201calways on\u201d connection to services via the communication link. In as much as conventional adaptive array techniques were derived in the context of a point-to-point communication link, it has been thought that two-way, multi-point, or \u201cbroadcast\u201d, systems were not amenable to implementations of adaptive array technology.",
        "Accordingly, a system and related methods enabling adaptive array technology within broadcast wireless communication systems is required, unencumbered by the limitations commonly associated with prior art broadcast systems. Just such a system and related methods are disclosed, below.",
        "A system and related methods for clustering multi-point communication targets is presented. According to one aspect of the invention, a method comprising measuring one or more performance characteristics associated for each of at least a subset of a plurality of targets in a wireless communication system, and selectively building one or more clusters, each cluster including one or more target(s) and sharing a wireless communication channel, based at least in part on the performance characteristics.",

        "The present invention is directed to a system and related methods of beamforming in a multi-point communications environment, i.e., wherein multiple targets dynamically share physical communication resources. In accordance with one example implementation, the teachings of the present invention are developed within the context of a GPRS system implemented over a TDMA wireless communication system. In this regard, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention to be developed more fully below, a multi-point communication agent is introduced comprising one or more of a clustering engine and/or a beamforming engine is presented. According to one example implementation to be developed more fully below, the clustering engine is selectively invoked to analyze spatial signature attributes of one or more target(s) for which a communication link is intended. Given the spatial signature attributes, target(s) are grouped into clusters and a cluster spatial signature is developed.",
        "Once a cluster spatial signature is developed, beamforming engine is selectively invoked to generate weighting value(s) applied to a transmitted signal to establish a communication link beam between the transmitting communicating entity and the target(s) of the cluster(s). In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, beamforming engine selectively generates a multi-node wireless communication link beam to targets, of which there is some information regarding their spatial signature, to which simultaneous transmission of the same signal is desirable. According to one example implementation, beamforming engine identifies multiple targets which may benefit from simultaneous reception of the wireless communication link, and develops weighting values (associated with each antenna in an array) to generate a multi-node beam to establish a communication link to each of the identified targets. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the present invention facilitate adaptive antenna technology in a wireless data services environment and, in this regard, is well-suited to implementation within a GPRS data services system.",

To facilitate the multi-point communication introduced above, multi-point communication agent 210 identifies a set of targets (e.g., user terminals, communication stations, etc.), groups the targets into a cluster and develops a spatial signature for the cluster.

In other, perhaps more advanced implementations, performance characteristics of the targets are measured at the antennae 216 and are used by clustering engine 212 as the spatial signature attributes. Given the spatial signature attributes, clustering engine 212 determines which targets are closest to one another, and groups such targets into cluster(s) of close spatial signatures.

That is, clustering engine develops a spatial signature for several users/targets. Over time, clustering engine 212 allocates and reallocates the targets within a cluster to the same physical channel, and allocate the targets in different clusters to different physical channels. According to one implementation, clustering engine 212 continues to monitor the spatial signature attribute(s) of the target(s) within the various clusters and reallocates them to different physical channels if their spatial signature attributes become significantly closer to the cluster of its occupant targets than to the targets sharing its original physical channel.

In accordance with the illustrated example implementation of FIG. 6, the method begins with block 602 where clustering engine 212 begins with an initial set of K beamforming weights. In accordance with one example implementation, the K beamforming weights are predetermined and maintained within the multi-point communication agent 210.

According to one example implementation, clustering engine 212 generates a Least-Squares weight value (eq. 3) from the signal associated with the identified user. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the generation of a least-squares is computed by combining a signal with least squared error from a reference signal.

According to one example implementation, the composite spatial signature difference differential is a sum of normalized spatial signature distance differentials between the target and all remaining non-clustered targets. In accordance with this example implementation, clustering engine 212 calculates a distance differential (di,j) of its normalized spatial signature (ai) to the normalized spatial signature (aj) of each other target, where the distance is calculated as the inner product between said spatial signatures, in accordance with equation 5.\n\ndi,j=|ai\u2212(ai\u2032*aj)aj|\u2003\u2003(5)",

That is, in order to cluster targets with similar spatial signatures, targets that deviate from one another by too large a distance, even if they do represent the next smallest composite distance differential may not be clustered together. In such a case, target(s) that exceed this distance, or cohesion differential threshold (dmin), may well be assigned to a different cluster of one or more target(s) with similar spatial signatures, as quantified by the total distance figure defined above.",
        "According to one example implementation, if N+M targets share substantially similar spatial signature attributes, clustering engine 212 assigns additional communication channel resource(s), as necessary to service the additional M target(s) in the cluster. In this regard, clustering engine 212 may well develop clusters that require multiple share communication channel(s) to effectively service all of the targets in the cluster. Alternatively, clustering agent 212 may well choose to include an outlier target(s) in a cluster and service that target(s) with a separate communication channel.

        "In block 708, clustering engine 212 determines whether there are any remaining, non-clustered targets. If so, the process continues with block 702 wherein clustering engine recalculates the composite spatial signature distance differential for each remaining target with respect to the other remaining (i.e., yet unclustered) targets, and additional clusters are developed.",
        "According to another implementation, clustering engine 212 merely analyzes the normalized spatial signature differential (di,j) to determine whether multiple targets (in this example, two targets) should be clustered.

In this regard, clustering engine 212 ensures that the targets within a cluster enjoy common spatial signature characteristics.",
        "If, in block 708, all target(s) have been assigned to clusters, the process continues with block 710 wherein clustering engine 212 selectively monitors changes to the spatial signature attribute(s) of the target(s), and performs re-grouping of targets as necessary. According to one example implementation, if any cluster has a vacancy (e.g., less than N targets) clustering engine 212 calculates, for each target assigned to other clusters, the average distance to each target member of the under-populated cluster. This value is compared with the average distance to all other clusters with a vacancy and assign the target with the lowest average distance to that cluster. For each pair of targets in different clusters, compare the average distance of each to targets in their own cluster to average distance of targets in the other's cluster. If switching the target(s) lowers the composite spatial signature difference differential of each, then switch the target's clusters.",

As introduced above, clustering engine 212 may well utilize information contained within the received signal for transmission, or information contained within packet (datagram) information (e.g., target identification information) to identify the intended target(s).",
        "In block 804, clustering engine 212 identifies target(s) that may also benefit from receipt of the signal. As provided above, in accordance with the example GPRS implementation, it may be beneficial for the targets associated with the next instance of the channel (i.e., timeslot/frequency combination) to receive an indication that they are the intended recipients of the next instance of the channel. According to one example implementation, introduced above, clustering engine 212 identifies the subsequent target from the target identification information 302 of the datagram received for transmission.",
        "In block 806, clustering engine 212 identifies a first spatial signature for the intended target(s) of the pending transmission, and a second spatial signature for the other identified target(s). In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the targets may well be individual transceivers or clusters of targets, in which case a first cluster spatial signature and a second cluster spatial signature is developed, as described above.",
        "In block 808, clustering engine 212 calculates weighting values to generate a multi-lobe beampattern for each of the first and second target(s). If, for example, there are two desired targets with spatial signatures a1 and a2, clustering engine 212 forms a linear superposition of two weights w1 and w2, respectively, calculated as follows:\n\nw1=[a2\u2032a2]a1\n\nw2=[a1\u2032a1]a2\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhere: a1 and a2 are N\u00d71 vectors;",
        "N denotes the number of antennae 216 associated with the transceiver;",
        "[a2\u2032 a2] is the outer product of a2 with itself, i.e., an N\u00d7N matrix; and",
        "[a1\u2032 a1] is the outer product of a1 with itself, also an N\u00d7N matrix.",
        "Thus, the weights used for transmission are then:\n\n(alpha1*w1)+(alpha2*w2)\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nwhere alpha1 and alpha 2 are scalars controlling the intended power to be received by the targets.",
        "In block 810, beamforming engine 214 generates a multi-lobe beampattern using the weights generated by the clustering engine 212, to direct energy in accordance with at least the first spatial signature and the second spatial signature.",
        "With reference to FIG. 10, a graphical illustration of a multi-node communication link beam is depicted, in accordance with one example implementation of this aspect of the present invention. More particularly, the graphical illustration of FIG. 10 illustrates a communicating entity, a basestation 114 in this example implementation, that establishes a multi-node communication link beam between an intended receiver 106 of the communication link, and a receiver 904 of a subsequent communication link. That is, each of the two target(s) 106 and 904 receive a common signal via two separate communication link beams, e.g., beam 1002 and beam 1004.",
        "In accordance with one example implementation, the multi-node beam, e.g., node 1002 and node 1004, are each assigned to a common communication channel and carry common information to each of the target(s) 106 and 904. In accordance with one example implementation, the second receiver, i.e., receiver 904 receives the signal as an indication that the receiver 904 will receive the immediately subsequent communication signal. That is, receiver 904 receives the signal to provide the receiver with an indication that they are targeted with a subsequent signal, e.g., an immediately subsequent signal.",
