        "This invention relates to semiconductor devices and semiconductor device fabrication. Specifically this invention relates to a method and apparatus of doping semiconductor regions and diffusion of dopants during semiconductor processing.",
        "As the minimum feature size achievable in semiconductor manufacturing decreases, the diffusion rates of dopants become a significant impediment for achieving desired device structures and corresponding performances. Unfortunately there are only a limited number of possible solutions for this problem. As the minimum feature size decreases, the number of devices that can be formed in a given area increases with the inverse square of this feature size while dopant diffusion rates remain constant. As the areal density of devices is raised, both the device size and inter-device distances must shrink accordingly. In addition, as device areas have been shrunken laterally, optimal dopant diffusion depths have been substantially decreased.",
        "Using current processing methods, dopant diffusion depth is largely affected by annealing operations, typically performed subsequent to an implant step. Thermal annealing is performed for a number of reasons, including activation of implanted dopant ions. Annealing also causes diffusion of the dopant species. Depending on the device design requirements and processes, the resulting redistribution of the as-implanted dopant ions can be unacceptably large.",
        "What is needed is a method to control diffusion of dopant species in a matrix lattice. What is also needed is a device with a sharper diffusion gradient of dopant elements. What is also needed is a device capable of withstanding higher processing temperatures for longer periods of time without unacceptable diffusion of dopant elements.",
        "A method of reducing a dopant diffusion rate in a doped semiconductor region is shown. The method includes selecting a plurality of impurity elements including at least one dopant element. Selecting the plurality of impurity elements also includes selecting a first impurity element with a first atomic radius larger than an average host matrix atomic radius, and selecting a second impurity element with a second atomic radius smaller than an average host matrix atomic radius. Amounts of each impurity element of the plurality of impurity elements are selected so that amounts and atomic radii of each of the plurality of impurity elements complement each other to reduce a host matrix lattice strain. The method further includes introducing the plurality of impurity elements to a selected region of the host matrix and annealing the selected region of the host matrix. Impurity dopants can be used that do not become electrically active upon annealing. Such impurities are to be differentiated from other dopant impurities that do become electrically active upon annealing.",

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The term substrate is understood to include semiconductor wafers. The term substrate is also used to refer to semiconductor structures during processing, and may include other layers, such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI), etc. that have been fabricated thereupon. Both wafer and substrate include doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial semiconductor layers supported by a base semiconductor or insulator, as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art.

One example of a host matrix includes, but is not limited to, a semiconductor wafer. The term host lattice refers to a structure or regular pattern of atoms within the host matrix.",
        "In semiconductor processing, diffusion is normally thought of as occurring by the random motion of atoms with the energy being thermal, with the driving force being a function of temperature and concentration. Therefore the higher the temperature, the more rapid the diffusion rate. However, it has been discovered that the rate of diffusion of one element in another is a function of not only temperature but other factors such as crystal defects, in the host matrix. The process of implanting an impurity ion (e.g., As) into a host matrix (such as Si) is sufficiently energetic as to displace the host matrix atoms from their normal lattice sites, thereby introducing localized strains. Such strains serve to increase the diffusion of the implanted ions during subsequent annealing treatments. Rates of diffusion at grosser defects such as grain boundaries may be far larger than an order of magnitude of that in the bulk material.",
        "FIG. 1A shows a semiconductor substrate 100 with a junction 110 formed by ion implantation of a dopant in a portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. In one embodiment, the junction 110 is formed within a well region or pocket 112 that is also formed in a portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. A second, shallower pocket 114 is formed in pocket 112 by ion implantation. As noted above, the ion implanted dopants are subsequently activated by an annealing treatment at high temperatures. The annealing also causes the dopant element to diffuse vertically and laterally into the pocket 112 so that it forms a larger pocket 116. As device geometries continue to shrink with advancing technologies, this increase in pocket size (from 114 to 116) will be unacceptably large.",
        "FIG. 1B depicts schematically the much-smaller increase in pocket size (from 124 to 126) upon annealing the pocket 124 formed according to the teachings of this invention. A semiconductor substrate 100 is shown with a junction 120 formed in a portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. Similar to FIG. 1A, in one embodiment, the junction 120 is formed within a well region or pocket 122 that is also formed in a portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. Using novel methods that will be described below, dopant elements are introduced to a first region 124. Following an annealing procedure, dopant elements are driven by diffusion from the first region 124 to a diffused region 126. As shown by FIG. 1B, the diffused region 126 shows a steeper diffusion profile with a smaller diffusion depth 127. It should be noted that FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams for illustration of differences between junctions in prior configurations in contrast to junctions after using the methods described below. FIGS. 1A and 1B are not necessarily drawn to scale.",
        "FIG. 2A shows one embodiment of a host semiconductor lattice 200. The lattice 200 is made up of a number of host atoms 210 that are held together by bonds 212. Although a two dimensional lattice is shown for illustration, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the concepts illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C apply to three dimensional lattices. In one embodiment, the host semiconductor lattice 200 is made up of silicon atoms. Although a silicon host semiconductor lattice 200 is used as an example, other host semiconductor lattice compositions such as gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, carbon containing host matrices, etc. are within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, the host semiconductor lattice 200 is structured in a regular patterned crystalline form. In a crystal, the bonds 212 are arranged in a regular pattern throughout the lattice 200. For illustration purposes, the bonds 212 are shown with equal bond lengths 214.",
        "Although in one embodiment, all bonds 212 are substantially the same length 214, other embodiments are included where bond lengths 214 vary within the lattice 200 to form an energetically favorable atomic stacking arrangement in the host lattice 200. In describing a lattice 200, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, individual atoms 210 can be described as hard spheres that can be stacked a number of ways. A number of regular patterns of atomic stacking are therefore possible, some with equal bond lengths 214 and some with repeating variations in bond lengths 214, depending on the atomic composition and solid phase of the host matrix.",
        "FIG. 2B shows a regular pattern semiconductor lattice that includes two different semiconductor atoms such as gallium and arsenic to form a host lattice 202. In one embodiment, other pairs of elements from group 3 and group 5 of the periodic table are chosen to form the host lattice 202. In one embodiment, pairs of elements from group 2 and group 6 of the periodic table are chosen to form the host lattice 202. The host lattice 202 includes an average host radii equal to (radius 204+radius 206)/2. The host lattice can also be defined by a lattice constant 208. Embodiments as described in the present specification can be used with a host lattice as described in FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B or other substantially crystalline semiconductor lattices.",
        "Dopant elements used to form the junctions in a silicon transistor are substitutional (i.e., occupy lattice sites normally occupied by host lattice atoms). Since the radii of dopant ions differ from that of the host matrix, the resulting differences in size imparts strain to the doped semiconductor region. This strain becomes especially large as the dopant concentration is raised to the levels needed to form the necessary junctions.",
        "FIG. 2C illustrates the host matrix 200 from FIG. 2A with the addition of a dopant atom 220. As discussed above, the dopant atom 220 is located in a substitutional lattice site. The dopant atom 220 causes lattice strain, thus distorting the regular pattern of the host lattice 200 that existed when the dopant atom 220 was not present. Host atom 230 has been moved from an unstrained position on line 232 to a strained location, thus distorting bonds 234 and 236. As can be seen from the Figure, other host atoms and bonds are similarly distorted. The effect of lattice strain is not limited to the host atoms directly adjacent to the dopant atom 220. Host atom 240 has been moved from an unstrained position on line 242 to a strained location, thus distorting bonds 244 and 246.",
        "Although FIG. 2C shows a dopant atom 220 with an atomic radius that is larger than the atomic radius of the host matrix atoms, a dopant atom 220 with an atomic radius that is smaller than the atomic radius of the host matrix atoms causes similar lattice distortion. Instead of the bonds such as 234 and 236 being compressed, the bonds adjacent to a smaller dopant atom are stretched, thus causing host lattice distortion. It has been discovered that such dopant-induced strains provide a driving force to cause enhanced, non-random diffusion effects. To reduce unwanted diffusion, it therefore follows that the net lattice strain in a junction should be at or near zero.",
        "This can be achieved by adding one or more additional type(s) of impurity atoms to the structure. If the added atoms are of a neutral species (i.e. carbon or germanium can be used in a silicon based structure), then only the relative atomic sizes must be considered. If however the compensating impurity element is of the opposite type, i.e. N instead of P type, then the compensating atom must have a larger difference in atomic size, from the matrix atom(s), than the chosen dopant. If the chosen dopant is larger in atomic size than the matrix atom, then the compensating dopant must be smaller. The amount of the compensating dopant is chosen such that the net effect of all of the dopant atoms is to produce no net change in the average atomic spacing. If the compensating dopant is of the opposite type, then the net charge will be the effective doping level. If the matrix structure is a compound semiconductor then silicon, carbon and germanium may then be used as neutral compensating elements.",
        "In one embodiment, no net change in the average atomic spacing can be achieved by using two or more impurity elements in each junction. At least one of the impurity elements is chosen with an atomic size smaller than an average host lattice atomic size, and the other of the impurity elements is chosen with an atomic size larger than an average host lattice atomic size. Necessarily for electrical operation of the junction, at least one of the impurity elements chosen is a dopant element, although in some embodiments, other impurity elements are not dopant elements. In selecting the impurity elements, an average host lattice atomic size is used for comparison in semiconductor lattices using two or more elements such as GaAs or InP. In a silicon host lattice, the atomic size of silicon is used for comparison in choosing the impurity element sizes. The percentages of each impurity element is chosen such that the net size effect in the host lattice approaches zero.",
        "FIG. 2D shows the host matrix 200 with the addition of multiple impurity atoms. In one embodiment, the multiple impurity atoms include a first impurity atom 250 with an atomic radius 251 that is larger than an atomic radius 211 of host atoms 210. In one embodiment, the multiple impurity atoms further include a second impurity atom 260 with an atomic radius 261 that is smaller that the atomic radius 211 of host atoms 210. As illustrated in FIG. 2D, the use of at least two complementary sized impurity elements reduces lattice strain.",
        "In one embodiment, at least two impurity elements chosen include two dopant elements of the same conductivity type such as P-type or N-type. Examples of suitable N-type dopant atoms include, but are not limited to, arsenic (As), phosphorous (P), Bismuth (Bi), and Antimony (Sb). Examples of suitable P-type dopant atoms include, but are not limited to, Aluminum (Al) and Boron (B).",
        "In one embodiment, a specific proportion of impurity atoms is further chosen for introduction to the lattice 200. When a specific combination of multiple impurity atoms is used at a specific proportion, strain in the lattice 200 is reduced significantly. As shown in FIG. 2D, the larger radius 251 of the first impurity atom 250 complements the smaller radius 261 of the second impurity atom 260. In contrast to the lattice distortion shown in FIG. 2C, atoms in the lattice, including both host matrix atoms and impurity atoms, are substantially lined up as in the unstressed state of FIG. 2A. Impurity atom 260 is shown along substantially undistorted lines 264 and 268, and impurity atom 261 is shown along substantially undistorted lines 266 and 268. Although selected bonds such as bond 262 in the doped lattice 200 of FIG. 2D may be shorter or longer than host matrix bonds 212, a center to center spacing 265 is approximately equal to that of the undistorted host matrix.",
        "Although FIG. 2D shows the larger first impurity atom 250 bonded adjacent to the smaller second impurity atom 260 this specific configuration is for illustration only. When multiple impurity atoms are selected and introduced to the host lattice 200 in the correct proportions, lattice strain is minimized regardless of which host lattice sites the multiple impurity atoms are located on. Small impurity atoms do not necessarily have to be directly bonded to large impurity atoms. On a macroscopic scale, an average lattice strain is reduced due to the size of impurity atoms selected and the proportion in which they are introduced.",
        "As noted above, more than two impurity elements are used in selected embodiments in size complementing proportions to reduce lattice strain. Use of more than two impurity elements provides an increased number of options for strain reduction in the host lattice. Combinations of three or more impurity elements in specific proportions can provide a better complementary size matching that further reduces lattice strain.",
        "In a two impurity atom embodiment, the proportions of impurity atoms can be chosen by the following formula:\n\nx=(RH\u2212RS)/[(RL\u2212RH)+(RH\u2212RS)]",
        "Where:",
        "RH=the atomic radius of a host atom",
        "RL=the atomic radius of the impurity atom that is larger than the host atom",
        "RS=the atomic radius of the impurity atom that is smaller than the host atom",
        "x=the fraction of large impurity atoms to introduce to the host lattice",
        "1\u2212x=the fraction of small impurity atoms to introduce to the host lattice",
        "For example, if the host atom has a relative radius of 2, the large impurity atom has a relative radius of 6, and the small impurity atom has a relative radius of 1, then \u201cx\u201d would equal 0.20 and \u201c1\u2212x\u201d would equal 0.80. A resulting impurity proportion would include one large impurity atom for every four small impurity atoms. Similarly, if three or more impurity atoms are used, the proportion of impurity atoms that are larger than the host matrix atoms should compensate for the proportions of impurity atoms that are smaller that the host matrix atoms, while taking into consideration the relative sizes of the impurity atoms and the host matrix atoms.",
        "In one embodiment for making an N-type junction, both arsenic (As) and phosphorous (P) are used as dopants. To compensate for the atomic radii of the dopant atoms, approximately 36.37 percent of the dopant concentration is phosphorus and approximately 63.63 percent of the dopant concentration is arsenic. In one embodiment for making a P-type junction, both boron (B) and aluminum (Al) are used as dopants. To compensate for the atomic radii of the dopant atoms, approximately 23.68 percent of the dopant concentration is boron and approximately 76.32 percent of the dopant concentration is aluminum.",
        "In one embodiment, at least two impurity elements chosen include two dopant elements of opposite conductivity type such as P-type or N-type. The use of elements of opposite conductivity type further increases the atomic size options of the impurity elements chosen. Increased atomic size options allows for better lattice strain reduction options in a larger number of junction designs.",
        "Because a net charge effect is desired in a doped junction, when using two or more dopant elements of opposite conductivity type, a dopant element amount of the desired conductivity type is selected to be larger than the dopant element amount of the opposite conductivity type. The difference in dopant element amounts provides a net charge effect for junction operational characteristics, while the complementary atomic sizes reduce lattice strain.",
        "In one embodiment, at least two impurity elements are chosen, including a dopant element of the desired conductivity type, and an electrically inactive impurity element. The use of electrically inactive impurity elements serves the purpose of providing increased options for reducing lattice strain, while the net charge of the junction remains unaffected by the electrically inactive element. Possible electrically inactive impurity elements (for use in a silicon host matrix for example) include, but are not limited to carbon, and germanium. In one embodiment, two or more electrically inactive impurity elements are used to reduce the lattice strain. In one embodiment, at least one electrically inactive element is used with two or more dopant elements of the same conductivity type to reduce lattice strain. In one embodiment, at least one electrically inactive element is used with two or more dopant elements of opposite conductivity type to reduce lattice strain.",
        "In one embodiment, introduction of the multiple dopant atoms to the host lattice 200 includes an ion implantation process. As discussed above, following ion implantation, there is damage to the host lattice that must be repaired. Further, the implanted dopant atoms must be activated to realize their desired electrical properties. In one embodiment, an anneal step is performed following introduction of the dopant atoms to the host lattice. In one embodiment, a rapid thermal anneal process is used following introduction of the dopant atoms to the host lattice. By choosing a combination of multiple dopant atoms, introduced to a host lattice at a specific proportion as described above, the post anneal doped region exhibits significantly reduced lattice strain. The reduced lattice strain significantly reduces unwanted enhanced, non-random diffusion effects.",
        "One advantage of methods described above is that the methods effectively reduce the rate of diffusion of the doping elements in very shallow junctions so that they can be exposed to a higher time temperature envelope without excessive degradation of the structure. Another advantage of methods described above is that the methods sharpen a junction profile by reducing diffusion rates at current anneal times and temperatures. A further advantage of methods described above is that solubility in doped regions will be increased. Thus allowing for a higher maximum doping level.",
        "FIG. 3 shows one example of a device that is formed using the methods described above. FIG. 3 shows a transistor 300 formed in a semiconductor substrate 310. Other devices apart from transistors may also be formed using the methods described above. In one embodiment, the transistor is further formed in a doped pocket 320. The transistor 300 includes a first source/drain region 330, a second source/drain region 332, and a channel region 334 separating the first and second source/drain regions 330, 332.
