        "This application is a 371 of PCT/JP02/07317 filed 18 Jul. 2002.",
        "The present invention relates to a method of producing a fiber molded article comprising a step of transferring a fiber molded article formed in a papermaking mold composed of a set of splits to another mold and an apparatus therefor.",
        "Some methods of producing pulp molded articles involve a step of transferring a molded article having been formed and dewatered in a papermaking mold to a drying mold for drying the molded article. The technique described in JP-A-10-227000 is included under this type of methods.",
        "According to the technique disclosed, a papermaking mold (upper mold) is immersed in a raw material slurry, and the slurry is sucked up to deposit the pulp component on the inner surface (a papermaking screen) of the papermaking mold. The papermaking mold is pulled out of the slurry, and the suction is continued to dewater the pulp component to obtain a molded article having a prescribed water content. The papermaking mold is joined with another mold (lower mold). The suction through the papermaking mold is stopped so that the molded article is transferred to the other mold by its own weight. The other mold is then joined with a drying mold (another upper mold) to dry the molded article.",
        "However, the operation of transferring a pulp molded article from a papermaking mold to another mold sometimes fails because the molded article has been brought into intimate contact with the inner surface of the papermaking mold (papermaking screen) by the suction force exerted for dewatering. Where, in particular, a hollow bottle-shaped pulp molded article is formed and dewatered on a papermaking mold composed of a set of splits and then transferred to another mold by (i) opening the split papermaking mold with the molded article stuck to one of the splits and (ii) attracting the molded article to the other mold by suction, the papermaking screens provided on the inner surface of the splits leaves their mesh marks on the outer surface of the molded article during dewatering. The mesh marks cause a gap between the molded article and the other mold. As a result, the suction force exerted between the other mold and the molded article tends to be insufficient for stably transferring the molded article between the two molds.",
        "Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for producing a fiber molded article in which a fiber molded article formed in a papermaking mold can be transferred to another mold stably and securely.",
        "The present invention accomplishes the above object by providing a method of producing a fiber molded article comprising the step of transferring a fiber molded article formed in a papermaking mold composed of a set of splits to another mold other than the papermaking mold, wherein the step of transferring is carried out by opening the papermaking mold while attracting the fiber molded article to the inner surface of one of the splits by suction to separate the fiber molded article from the other split, closing the papermaking mold, releasing the molded article from attraction to the inner surface of the one of the splits, opening the papermaking mold again while attracting the fiber molded article to the inner surface of the other split by suction, joining the other split with the another mold, attracting the fiber molded article to the inner surface of the another mold by suction, and separating the fiber molded article from the other split.",
        "The present invention also accomplishes the above object by providing an apparatus for producing a fiber molded article comprising a papermaking mold composed of a set of splits, another mold other than the papermaking mold for receiving the molded article formed in the papermaking mold, a moving means for moving the set of splits and the another mold, a suction means for attracting the fiber molded article to the inner surface of the splits and the inner surface of the another mold, and a control means for controlling the moving means and the suction means, wherein the control means controls the moving means and the suction means such that:",

There is a space between the main body 200 and the frame 210, which is divided into three chambers S1, S2, and S3 by partitions 220.
