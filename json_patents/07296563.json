The exhaust camshaft 22b is arranged such that it rotates when the crankshaft of the engine 1 rotates. When the exhaust camshaft 22b rotates, the exhaust cams 22a cause the exhaust valves 22 to open and close.",
        "One fuel injection valve 27 is provided with respect to each cylinder and each fuel injection valve 27 serves to inject fuel (gasoline) into the respective intake port 23. The tip end of the fuel injection valve 27 protrudes into the combustion chamber 63.",
        "One spark plug 29 is provided with respect to each cylinder. Each spark plug 29 is arranged to extend into the respective one of the combustion chambers 63 from a portion of the cylinder head 20 that is positioned above the approximate center of the combustion chamber 63. The tip end portion 29a of the spark plug 29 protrudes into the combustion chamber 63.",
        "In the internal combustion engine 1, fresh air introduced into the intake branches 52 is guided to the intake ports 23 as a second air mixture (described later). Pressurized fuel supplied to the fuel injection valves 27 is injected into the fresh air guided into the intake ports 23. As a result, a mixture of fresh air and fuel is formed in the intake ports 23.",
        "In the intake stroke of any given cylinder, the intake valve 21 is opened by the intake cam 21a and the mixture of fresh air and fuel formed in the intake port 23 is introduced into the combustion chamber 63 from the intake port 23.",
        "During the compression stroke, the piston 3 rises and the mixture of fresh air and fuel inside the combustion chamber 63 is compressed. Then, at a prescribed timing, the tip end portion 29a of the spark plug 29 ignites the mixture of fresh air and fuel (air-fuel mixture) inside the combustion chamber 63, thereby causing the air-fuel mixture to combust.",
        "During the power stroke, the combustion pressure generated by the combustion of the mixture of fresh air and fuel pushes the piston 3 downward.",
        "During the exhaust stroke, the exhaust cam 22a opens the exhaust valve 22 and burned gas remaining after combustion in the combustion chamber 63 is discharged as exhaust gas to the exhaust branch 31 through the exhaust port 24.",
        "Accordingly, the engine 1 is configured to have the mixture of fresh air and fuel inducted into combustion chambers 63 from the intake device 70. The mixture of fresh air and fuel is combusted inside the combustion chambers 63 and the combustion causes pistons 3 to move reciprocally inside cylinders. The reciprocal motion of the pistons 3 is converted into rotational motion of a crankshaft of the engine 1 by means of connecting rods (not shown).",
        "A top plan view of the intake device 70 is shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of the intake device 70 from the direction of the arrows III of FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the intake device 70 taken along a section line IV-IV of FIG. 3.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 1, 4, 5 and 6, the intake device 70 basically includes an intake passage 50, a throttle or regulating valve 91 (see FIG. 1), the intake valves 21 (see FIG. 1), a partitioning part 80, a volume chamber 72 (see FIG. 5), a connector (connector part) 75, and a gas introducing pipe 78 (see FIG. 6). The intake passage 50 is the passage through which fresh air flows until it is drawn into the combustion chamber 63. The intake passage 50 basically includes a throttle or regulating chamber 54 (see FIG. 1), an air induction pipe 53, an intake air collector 51, the intake branches 52, and the intake ports 23 (see FIG. 1). The partitioning part 80 comprises a first partitioning plate 81 and a second partitioning plate 82.",
        "The throttle valve 91 is arranged in the throttle chamber 54. The throttle valve 91 is configured and arranged such that the amount of fresh air flowing through the throttle chamber 54 can be changed by changing the opening degree of the throttle valve 91. As a result, the throttle valve 91 is configured and arranged to adjust the quantity of fresh air taken into the combustion chambers 63.",
        "The air induction pipe 53 is provided between the throttle chamber 54 and the intake air collector 51. As shown in FIG. 2, the air induction pipe 53 is curved in a substantially circular arc-like shape and serves as a communication passage between the throttle chamber 54 and the intake air collector 51. As shown in FIG. 5, the space inside the air induction pipe 53 is divided by the first partitioning plate 81 into a first air induction space 53a and a second air induction space 53b such that the first air induction space 53a is disposed above the first partitioning plate 81 and the second air induction space 53b is disposed below the first partitioning plate 81 with respect to the vertical direction of the vehicle. The first air induction space 53a is fluidly communicated with the right-hand cylinder bank and the second air induction space 53b is fluidly communicated with the left-hand cylinder bank. The first partitioning plate 81 is configured and arranged to extend from a position in a vicinity of the throttle valve 91 (i.e., a position near a flange 53e but slightly downstream from the flange 53e) to a position where the intake air collector 51 begins.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the volume chamber 72 is enclosed by a volume chamber wall and is arranged between the gas introducing pipe 78 (see FIG. 6) and the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b. The volume chamber 72 is connected to the gas introducing pipe 78 by the connector 75 (see FIG. 6). As a result, the gas introducing pipe 78 can introduce blow-by gas (first gas) into the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b through the connector 75 and the volume chamber 72. The blow-by gas is a gas that contains a higher moisture content and has a higher temperature than the fresh air in the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b.",
        "The volume chamber wall 71 is configured and arranged to project outward from the air induction pipe 53. In this way, a volume chamber 72 enclosed by a volume chamber wall 71 can be obtained. By using the volume chamber wall 71 that projects outward from the air induction pipe 53, a higher degree of freedom can be secured with respect to the layout of other members, e.g., a harness bracket mounting boss 79 (see FIG. 3). Additionally, since the harness bracket mounting boss 79 is connected to the volume chamber wall 71, the rigidity of the harness bracket mounting boss 79 can be increased with a comparatively simple structure that is relatively easy to fabricate.",
        "As shown in FIG. 4, the intake air collector 51 is enclosed by a collector wall 51c. The intake air collector 51 is arranged downstream of the throttle valve 91 and the air induction pipe 53. The intake air collector 51 has the form of a generally rectangular box with the air induction pipe 53 being connected thereto in the vicinity of a central portion thereof. The space inside the intake air collector 51 is divided by the second partitioning plate 82 into a first collector space and a second collector space such that the first collector space is disposed above the second partitioning plate 82 and the second collector space is disposed below the second partitioning plate 82 with respect to the vertical direction of the vehicle. The first collector space is fluidly communicated with the right-hand cylinder bank and the second collector space is fluidly communicated with the left-hand cylinder bank.",
        "The second partitioning plate 82 has an end portion 82c that is located close to the air induction pipe 53 and is joined to an end portion 81c of the first partitioning plate 81 that is located close to the intake air collector 51 in a smooth and uninterrupted manner as shown in FIG. 4. Consequently, the first collector space communicates with the first air induction space 53a but does not communicate with the second air induction space 53b. Similarly, the second collector space communicates with the second air induction space 53b but does not communicate with the first air induction space 53a.",
        "As seen in FIG. 4, the intake branches 52 are enclosed by branch walls. The intake branches 52 are arranged between the intake air collector 51 and the cylinder head 20. The intake branches 52 are connected to the opposite side of the intake air collector 51 as the air induction pipe 53. There is one intake branch 52 provided with respect to the intake ports 23 of each of the left and right cylinder banks (FIG. 2 shows an example in which there are six cylinders). More specifically, the intake branches 52 include a first intake branch having a first branch pipe 52a, a second branch pipe 52b, a third branch pipe 52c, and a second intake branch includes a fourth branch pipe 52d, a fifth branch pipe 52e, and a sixth branch pipe 52f. The first branch pipe 52a, the second branch pipe 52b, and the third branch pipe 52c of the first intake branch serve the right-hand cylinder bank and are configured to extend from the first collector space to the respective intake ports 23 of the right-hand bank of cylinders. The fourth branch pipe 52d, the fifth branch pipe 52e, and the sixth branch pipe 52f of the second intake branch serve the left-hand cylinder bank and are configured to extend from the second collector space to the respective intake ports 23 of the left-hand bank of cylinders. One of the intake valves 21 is provided at the downstream end of each intake port 23 and serves to open and close communication between the intake port and the respective combustion chamber 63.",
        "The throttle valve 91 is opened to a prescribed opening degree based on a command from an ECU (not shown). The quantity of fresh air taken in is adjusted according to the opening degree of the throttle valve 91. The fresh air passes through the throttle chamber 54 and into the air induction pipe 53. The fresh air introduced into the air induction pipe 53 is divided into a portion that flows through the first air induction space 53a toward the intake air collector 51 and a portion that flows through the second air induction space 53b toward the intake air collector 51. Consequently, the pulsations of the fresh air in the first air induction space 53a can be offset so as to be out of phase with the pulsations of the fresh air in the second air induction space 53b, thereby enabling resonance to be utilized with respect to the intake of air.",
        "Meanwhile, blow-by gas from the crankcase (not shown) is directed into the gas introducing pipe 78. The blow-by gas passes from the gas introducing pipe 78 through the connector 75 and into the volume chamber 72. At the same time, fresh air is introduced into the volume chamber 72 from the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b. Thus, a mixture of fresh air and blow-by gas (hereinafter called \u201cfirst air mixture\u201d) is formed in the volume chamber 72. The first air mixture is introduced into the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b from the volume chamber 72.",
        "In the first air induction space 53a, a mixture of fresh air and the first air mixture (hereinafter called \u201csecond air mixture\u201d) is formed. The second air mixture in the first air induction space 53a is directly introduced into the first collector space, which in turn introduces the second air mixture into the intake ports 23 of the right-hand bank of cylinders via the first branch pipe 52a, the second branch pipe 52b, and the third branch pipe 52c. The second air mixture introduced into the intake ports 23 is directed into the combustion chambers 63 and combusted when the intake valves 21 open.",
        "Similarly, in the second air induction space 53b, the fresh air and the first air mixture mix together to form a second air mixture. The second air mixture in the second air induction space 53b is directly introduced into the second collector space, which in turn introduces the second air mixture into the intake ports 23 of the left-hand bank of cylinders via the fourth branch pipe 52d, the fifth branch pipe 52e, and the sixth branch pipe 52f. The second air mixture introduced into the intake ports 23 is directed into the combustion chambers 63 and combusted when the intake valves 21 open.",
        "FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of the intake device 70 taken along the section line V-V of FIG. 4. FIG. 6 is a cross sectional view of the intake device 70 taken along the section line VI-VI of FIG. 5.

        "The volume chamber 72 is generally shaped like a backwards letter L and is surrounded by the volume chamber wall 71. The volume chamber 72 has a first space 72a, a second space 72b, and a third space 72c. The first space 72a extends away from the first partitioning plate 81 is arranged to be generally coplanar with respect to the first partitioning plate 81. The second space 72b extends from a portion of the first space 72a that is far from the first partitioning plate 81 and follows along the direction of a side face of the first partitioning plate 81. The third space 72c extends from a portion of the second space 72b that is far from the first space 72a and follows along a direction oriented diagonally away from the first partitioning plate 81.",
        "An opening 71e that enables communication between the first space 72a of the volume chamber 72 and the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b of the air induction pipe 53 is provided in a portion of the volume chamber wall 71 that faces the first partitioning plate 81. The opening 71e has a generally rectangular cross sectional shape and the cross sectional area thereof is larger than the cross sectional area of the gas introducing pipe 78. More specifically, the cross sectional area of the first space 72a of the volume chamber 72 and the opening 71e have a width W1 and a height H1 with the width W1 being at least 1.5 times larger (preferably at least 2 times larger) than the cross sectional area of the introducing pipe 78 which has a width W4. Also, the cross sectional area of the second space 72b of the volume chamber 72 has a width W2 and a height H2 and the cross sectional area of the third space 72c having a width W3 and a height H3 with the widths W2 and W3 both being larger than the cross sectional area of the first space 72a of the volume chamber 72 having the width W1 and the height H1.",
        "Preferably, a notch 81a is provided in a portion of the first partitioning plate 81 near the opening 71e. The notch 81a ensures good communication of the opening 71e with both the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b. As seen in FIG. 7, the first partitioning plate 81 divides or bisects the opening 71e so as to define a first communication surface area 71e1 and a second communication surface area 71e2 that are substantially equal. The first communication surface area 71e1 is the area of the portion 71e1 where the opening 71e directly communicates with the first air induction space 53a. The second communication surface area 71e2 is the area of the portion 71e2 where the opening 71e directly communicates the second air induction space 53b as seen in FIG. 7.",
        "The first partitioning plate 81 is arranged such that it passes nearby the center CP of the area of the opening 71e at an intermediate position along the length of the first partitioning plate 81, which spans from the vicinity of the throttle valve 91 to the intake air collector 51. As a result, the blow-by gas introduced into the volume chamber 72 is distributed substantially evenly to the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b through the opening 71e at a middle region or area of the air induction pipe 53.",
        "A communication passage 71d is formed in a portion of the volume chamber wall 71 that is far from the opening 71e. The communication passage 71d communicates between the space 75d inside the connector 75 and the third space 72c of the volume chamber 72. The gas introducing pipe 78 is attached to the connector 75 such that the connector 75 is inserted into the space 78d inside the gas introducing pipe 78. As a result, the space 78d inside the gas introducing pipe 78 communicates with the space 75d inside the connector 75. As a result, the gas introducing pipe 78 can introduce blow-by gas into the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b through the connector 75 and the volume chamber 72.",
        "If the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W1 and height H1 is too large, the pulsations of the fresh air in the first air induction space 53a and the pulsations of the fresh air in the second air induction space 53b will weaken. Therefore, it is preferable for the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W1 and the height H1 to be small enough that marked weakening of the pulsations of the fresh air does not occur (e.g., not larger than 2.5 times the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W4).",
        "The blow-by gas introduced into the space 78d inside the gas introducing pipe 78 passes through the space 75d inside the connector 75 and the communication passage 71d and flows into the third space 72c of the volume chamber 72. The blow-by gas introduced into the third space 72c of the volume chamber 72 becomes distributed among the third space 72c, the second space 72b, and the first space 72a.",
        "Since the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W1 is at least 1.5 times larger than the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W4, a portion of the fresh air in the first air induction space 53a and a portion of the fresh air in the second air induction space 53b enter the first space 72a of the volume chamber 72 through the notch 81a and the opening 71e. Since the fresh air from the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b enter the first space 72a of the volume chamber 72 while pulsating out of phase with each other, the fresh air mixes rapidly with the blow-by gas in the first space 72a. Thus, a mixture (first air mixture) of fresh air and blow-by gas is formed in the first space 72a. Since the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W2 and the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W3 are larger than the cross sectional area of the portion having the width W1, the first air mixture readily diffuses from the first space 72a to the second space 72b and the third space 72c, further promoting the mixing of the fresh air and blow-by gas. As a result, a portion of the thermal energy of the blow-by gas is absorbed by the fresh air and the temperature of the blow-by gas decreases. In other words, the temperature difference between the blow-by gas and the fresh air in the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b decreases.",
        "The first air mixture in the first space 72a, the second space 72b, and the third space 72c of the volume chamber 72 is introduced into the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b through the opening 71e. The first air mixture (which contains blow-by gas) is distributed substantially evenly to the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b because the first partitioning plate 81 is arranged such that it passes nearby the center CP of the area of the opening 71e at an intermediate position along the length of the air induction pipe 53, and because the first and second communication areas 71e1 and are substantially equal. Additionally, since a first air mixture comprising a mixture of fresh air and blow-by gas is distributed to the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b instead of blow-by gas alone, the ?blow-by gas is less likely to be distributed unevenly to the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, the volume chamber 72 is arranged between the gas introducing pipe 78 and the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b. Since a portion of fresh air from the first air induction space 53a and a portion of fresh air from the second air induction space 53b mix with the blow-by gas in the volume chamber 72, the temperature difference between the blow-by gas and the fresh air in the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b is reduced.",
        "As a result of reducing the temperature difference between the blow-by gas and the fresh air in the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b, the occurrence of freezing at the portion of the intake device 70 where the blow-by gas is introduced into the intake passage 50 is suppressed.",
        "If the cross sectional area of the opening were small, high-temperature blow-by gas would be introduced into fresh air at the ambient temperature. Consequently, the freezing would tend to occur at the opening due to the temperature difference between the blow-by gas and the fresh air. Freezing at the opening would, in turn, tend to block the opening.",
        "In the present invention, the cross sectional area of the opening 71e is larger than the cross sectional area of the gas introducing pipe 78. More specifically, the cross sectional area of the opening 71e is at least 1.5 times larger (preferably at least 2 times larger) than the cross sectional area of the gas introducing pipe 78. Consequently, the portion of fresh air from the first air induction space 53a and the portion of fresh air from the second air induction space 53b readily mix with the blow-by gas inside the volume chamber. As a result, the temperature difference between the blow-by gas and the fresh air in the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b is reduced and the occurrence of freezing at the portion of the intake device 70 where the blow-by gas is introduced into the intake passage 50 is suppressed.",
        "Furthermore, even if freezing does occur at the opening 71e, the degree to which the opening 71e is blocked will be reduced if the cross sectional area of the opening 71e is larger than the cross sectional area in which freezing occurs.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, the first partitioning plate 81 is arranged and configured to extend from the vicinity of the throttle valve 91 to the intake air collector 51. As a result, the fresh air in the first air induction space 53a and the fresh air in the second air induction space 53b can be made to undergo an ample degree of pulsation. Furthermore, the pulsations of the fresh air in the first air induction space are out of phase with the pulsations of the second air induction space. Consequently, the portion of fresh air from the first air induction space 53a and the portion of fresh air from the second air induction space 53b readily mix with the blow-by gas inside the volume chamber 72.",

        "In the embodiment, the gas introducing pipe 78 introduces blow-by gas into the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b through the connector 75 and the volume chamber 72. Thus, the manner in which the blow-by gas is distributed is determined by the relative positioning of the first partitioning plate 81 and the volume chamber 72. As a result, the gas introducing pipe 78 can be arranged as appropriate in consideration of the distribution of the blow-by gas without being completely dependent on the position of the first partitioning plate 81.",

In this way, a volume chamber 72 enclosed by a volume chamber wall 71 can be obtained. By using a volume chamber wall 71 that projects outward from the air induction pipe 53, a higher degree of freedom can be secured with respect to the layout of other members (e.g., harness bracket mounting boss 79 (see FIG. 3)). Additionally, since the harness bracket mounting boss 79 is connected to the volume chamber wall 71, the rigidity of the harness bracket mounting boss can be increased with a comparatively simple structure that is relatively easy to fabricate.",
        "It is acceptable for the gas introduced from the gas introducing pipe 78 to the first and second air induction spaces 53a and 53b to be EGR gas instead of blow-by gas. EGR gas, too, is a gas that contains moisture and has a higher temperature than the fresh air in the first air induction space and second air induction space. Consequently, freezing tends to occur at the opening 71e.",
