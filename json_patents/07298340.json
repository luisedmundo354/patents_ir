        "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-230298 filed on Aug. 9, 2006; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to an antenna device and a radio communication apparatus capable of multiband operation, and in particular to those adapted for mobile use.",
        "As radio apparatus like mobile phones, etc. come into wide use and have a wider range of application, antennas having a broader frequency range are required more than ever for radio apparatus. For instance, it is thought that an ultra-high frequency (UHF) band as broad as a couple of hundred megahertz (MHz) is required for receiving terrestrial digital television broadcast. In order that a radio apparatus using a single antenna for downsizing is adapted for two or more standards of wireless local area networks (WLAN) of different frequencies, the antenna has to cover both 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) and 5.2 GHz bands.",
        "A multi-resonant antenna applicable to WLANs is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai), No. 2003-46318. The multi-resonant antenna includes an antenna element formed by a linear or band-shaped conductor one end of which is fed at a feeding point on and surrounded by a ground plane and another end of which is grounded on the ground plane. The antenna element is loaded with an impedance element so that the multi-resonant antenna resonates at a frequency determined by a length of the linear or band-shaped conductor and resonates at another frequency determined by a value of the impedance element.",
        "An antenna including an antenna element formed by a linear or plate-shaped conductor loaded with a reactance element for multi-resonance is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai), No.2004-40596, and is called here a reactance-loaded antenna. The antenna element of the reactance-loaded antenna is divided by the reactance element by a ratio that determines a resonant frequency of the reactance-loaded antenna.",
        "A majority of radio apparatus adopt built-in antennas these days. In order to select a type of built-in antennas, it is necessary to examine candidates of built-in antennas from viewpoints of size, inefficiency of radiation caused by return currents, necessity of balance-to-unbalance transformation, etc.",
        "As one of the candidates that may somehow satisfy the necessity from the above viewpoints, known is a half-wavelength T-type monopole antenna. One example of that type of antenna is disclosed in:\n\n    Sekine, S. and Shoki, H., \u201cCharacteristics of T-type monopole antenna with parallel resonance mode\u201d, IEICEJ. Trans. Vol. J86-B, No. 2, pp. 200-208, February 2003 (in Japanese).",
        "The above example of the T-type monopole antenna is configured that lengths of a left half and a right half thereof are unequal so that the antenna may be resonant in a parallel resonance mode and may cope with both downsizing and efficiency of radiation by increasing input impedance.",
        "The multi-resonant antenna or the reactance-loaded antenna described above may be multi-resonant by being loaded with a reactance element located at a middle portion of the antenna element, i.e., somewhere between both ends of the antenna element. In a case where a resonant frequency needs to be changed or tuned, however, a value of the reactance has to be adjusted. Hence, there is a problem that the above antennas may not be suitable for an application that needs a significant change of the resonant frequency, e.g., WLANs.",
        "The parallel resonance mode of the T-type monopole antenna described above may be effective depending on a configuration of radio apparatus. The T-type monopole antenna, however, may not be suitable for a radio apparatus a feeder system of which is designed to match the input impedance of the antenna at a series resonant frequency of the antenna, as the increase of the input impedance in the parallel resonant mode is likely to cause a mismatch.",
        "Accordingly, an advantage of the present invention is that a resonant frequency of an antenna device may be significantly changed while causing little mismatch of the antenna's input impedance.",
        "To achieve the above advantage, one aspect of the present invention is to provide an antenna device and a radio apparatus capable of multiband operation. The antenna device is configured to be coupled to a feeding point of the radio apparatus. The antenna device has a first antenna element and a second antenna element. The first antenna element is configured to be an unbalanced-fed antenna fed at the feeding point to resonate at a first frequency. The second antenna element is configured to be a monopole antenna having an open end and to be fed at the feeding point. The first antenna element and the second antenna element have a common portion from the feeding point to a branching point. The second antenna element is configured to be ungrounded in a first state to resonate at a second frequency lower than the first frequency and to be grounded in a second state at a switch point between the branching point and the open end.",

        "A first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 6. FIG. 1 shows a configuration of a radio apparatus 1, including an antenna device, of the first embodiment. The radio apparatus 1 of the first embodiment has a case 10 indicated by a dot-and-dash line. The radio apparatus 1 has a printed board 11 and an antenna device 12 contained in the case 10.",
        "The antenna device 12 includes a first antenna element 13 indicated as encircled by a dashed ellipse on a right hand side of FIG. 1, and a second antenna element 14 encircled by another dashed ellipse on a left hand side of FIG. 1. The first antenna element 13 and the second antenna element 14 are fed in common at a feeding point 15 located on the printed board 11. The first antenna element 13 is located near an end of the printed board 11, and so is the second antenna element 14.",
        "The antenna device 12 includes a switch element 16 located at a middle location of the second antenna element 14, i.e., somewhere between both ends of the antenna element 14 and called a switch point of the antenna device 12. The switch element 16 has at least three terminals, 16h, 16j and 16k. In one state of the switch element 16, the terminals 16h and 16j are shorted and the terminal 16k is open. In another state of the switch element 16, the terminals 16h and 16k are shorted and the terminal 16j is open. The switch element 16 may be located on the printed board 11, but preferably apart from a ground pattern of the printed board 11.",
        "The terminal 16h is coupled to a portion of the second antenna element coupled to the feeding point 15. The terminal 16j is coupled to a portion of the second antenna element including an open end 17 of the second antenna element 14. The terminal 16k is coupled to the ground pattern of the printed board 11 and is thus grounded. Due to these couplings of the terminals 16h, 16j and 16k, the second antenna element 14 is grounded in one state (called a grounded state), and is not grounded in another state (called an ungrounded state).",
        "How to represent a length of each portion and a total length of the first antenna element 13 and the second antenna element 14 will be explained with reference to FIG. 2. Each portion of the first antenna element 13 and the second antenna element 14 shown in FIG. 2 is a same as the corresponding one given the same reference numeral shown in FIG. 1, and its explanation is omitted. Each of small alphabet letters a to f shown in FIG. 2 represents a length of each portion of the first antenna element 13 and the second antenna element 14.",
        "The first antenna element 13 has a starting portion of a length of a starting and going up from the feeding point 15, a following portion of a length of b going right, and an end portion of a length of c going downward. The first antenna element 13 is a monopole antenna having an open end, and has a total length of a+b+c. Hence, the first antenna element 13 has a resonant frequency on which the length of a+b+c corresponds to a quarter wavelength. Here and hereafter, the term \u201cresonant frequency\u201d means a series resonant frequency unless otherwise noted.",
        "The second antenna element 14 has, in the ungrounded state, the starting portion of the length of a in common with the first antenna element 13, a following portion of a length of d going left, a switch portion between the terminals 16h and 16j of the switch element 16 (the reference numeral \u201c16\u201d is not shown in FIG. 2) and an end portion of a length e between the terminal 16j and an open end 17.",
        "The second antenna element 14 is, in the ungrounded state, a monopole antenna having the open end 17, and has a length of a+d+e if an electric length between the terminals 16h and 16j of the switch element 16 is neglected. Hence, the second antenna element 14 has a resonant frequency on which the length of a+d+e corresponds to a quarter wavelength in the ungrounded state. The resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 in the ungrounded state is lower than that of the first antenna element 13 if a following inequality is true, i.e., b+c<d+e.",
        "A configuration of the antenna device 12 in the grounded state of the second antenna element 14 will be explained with reference to FIG. 3 that is different from FIG. 2 only in the state of the switch element 16 (the reference numeral \u201c16\u201d is not shown in FIG. 3). Each portion or its length of the first antenna element 13 and the second antenna element 14 shown in FIG. 3 is a same as the corresponding one given the same reference numeral or the same small alphabet shown in FIG. 2, and its explanation is omitted.",
        "In the grounded state of the second antenna element 14, the starting portion of the length of a, the following portion of the length of d, a switch portion between the terminals 16h and 16k of the switch element 16, and an end portion of a length of f going down from the terminal 16k are coupled in series one by one to form a line. The end portion of the length of f is grounded on the ground pattern of the printed board 11.",
        "The line formed in the grounded state of the second antenna element 14 has a length of a+d+f, if an electric length between the terminals 16h and 16k of the switch element 16 is neglected. The line formed in the grounded state has an end coupled to the feeding point 15, and has another end that is grounded. As is known, the line formed in the grounded state performs as an antenna equivalent to a loop antenna twice as long as the line except for a value of input impedance. Hence, the line formed in the grounded state is an equivalent loop antenna having a resonant frequency on which the length of a+d+f corresponds to a half wavelength.",
        "The resonant frequency of the equivalent loop antenna is nearly twice as high as the resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 in the ungrounded state, if a following condition is true, i.e., e \u2245f. The resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 may thus be changed up to twice as high as its value of the ungrounded state if the switch element 16 is switched to the grounded state, and may be changed even higher if a following condition is true, i.e., f<e.",
        "An effect of the first embodiment examined by simulation will be explained with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 shows a condition of the simulation. Each portion given a reference numeral 11 to 15 or 17 in FIG. 4 is a same as the corresponding one given the same reference numeral in FIG. 1. In FIG. 4, though, the end portion including the open end 17 of the second antenna element 14 is further turned to go downward. In FIG. 4, a length of each portion is indicated in millimeters (mm).",
        "In FIG. 4, the feeding point 15 is located at a right upper corner of the printed board 11. The first antenna element 13 includes a portion 4 mm long going upward from the feeding point 15, a following portion 2 mm long going right, and an ending portion 39 mm long going downward. The second antenna element 14 includes the portion going upward from the feeding point 15, a following portion 42 mm long going left, and the ending portion 39 mm long going downward.",
        "In the simulation, there is assumed a switch element (not shown in FIG. 4) corresponding to the switch element 16 shown in FIG. 1 to be located at a switch point-1, i.e., a middle location of the second antenna element 14 and 20 mm apart from the open end 17. FIG. 5 shows a frequency characteristic of a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the antenna device 12 simulated under the condition shown in FIG. 4. In FIG. 5, a horizontal axis represents the frequency in MHz, and a vertical axis represents the VSWR.",
        "FIG. 5 shows a solid curve and a dashed curve. The solid curve represents a VSWR characteristic in a case where the second antenna element 14 is in the ungrounded state and has a full length including the open end 17. The dashed curve represents a VSWR characteristic in a case where the second antenna element 14 is grounded at the switch point-1 to form equivalently a loop antenna and the portion including the open end 17 is separated.",
        "On the solid curve, i.e., the VSWR characteristic in the ungrounded state, a peak at a frequency of nearly 850 MHz is a resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 (here and hereafter, a peak that looks down is simply called a peak). On the solid curve, a peak at a frequency of nearly 1600 MHz is a resonant frequency of the first antenna element 13.",
        "On the dashed curve, i.e., the VSWR characteristic in the grounded state, a peak at a frequency of nearly 2300 MHz is a resonant frequency of the loop antenna equivalently formed by the second antenna element 14. On the dashed curve, a peak at a frequency of nearly 1600 MHz is the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 13. As the switch point-1 is 20 mm apart from the open end 17 and the condition f<e is true as in FIG. 3, the resonant frequency of the equivalent loop antenna is more than twice as high as the resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 in the ungrounded state.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, the VSWR characteristic on the dashed curve is better than that on the solid curve over a frequency range 1200 to 1600 MHz. That is because the second antenna element 14 grounded at the switch point-1 works as a stub for the first antenna element 13.",
        "In the simulation, there may be assumed a switch element (not shown in FIG. 4) corresponding to the switch element 16 shown in FIG. 1 to be located not at the switch point-1 but at a switch point-2, i.e., the open end 17. FIG. 6 shows a horizontal axis, a vertical axis, a solid curve and a dashed curve, each of which is a same as the corresponding one shown in FIG. 5. In addition, FIG. 6 shows a dot-and-dash curve, i.e., a VSWR characteristic of the antenna device 12 simulated under the condition where the switch element is assumed to be located not at the switch point-1 but at the switch point-2, and the second antenna element 14 is in the grounded state.",
        "As the switch point-2 coincides with the open end 17, the equivalent loop antenna formed in the grounded state has a resonant frequency that is nearly twice as high as the resonant frequency of the second antenna element 14 in the ungrounded state. Depending on where the switch element 16 is located on the second antenna element 14, a high/low relationship of the resonant frequencies may be adjusted between the second antenna element 13 and the equivalent loop antenna formed in the grounded state of the second antenna element 14. The antenna device 12 may thus broaden its frequency characteristic as a whole.",
        "The present invention may be applied as long as the second antenna element 14 is a monopole antenna having an open end and a portion thereof may be grounded as shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. Hence, the first antenna element 13 may not be a monopole antenna having an open end as long as being unbalanced-fed. In that case, the condition explained with reference to FIG. 2, i.e., b+c<d+e, is replaced by a condition that a total length of the second antenna element 14 in the ungrounded state is greater than the quarter wavelength of the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 13.",
        "According to the first embodiment described above, a built-in antenna device of a radio apparatus may significantly change or broaden its frequency characteristic by locating a switch element at a middle location of an antenna element of the antenna device and by turning the switch element on and off.",
        "A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 7 to 12. FIG. 7 shows a configuration of a radio apparatus 2, including an antenna device, of the second embodiment. The radio apparatus 2 of the second embodiment has a case 20 indicated by a dot-and-dash line. The radio apparatus 2 has a printed board 21 and an antenna device 22 contained in the case 20.",
        "The antenna device 22 includes a first antenna element 23 indicated as encircled by a dashed ellipse on a right hand side of FIG. 7, and a second antenna element 24 on a left hand side of FIG. 7. The first antenna element 23 and the second antenna element 24 are fed in common at a feeding point 25 located on the printed board 21. The first antenna element 23 is located near an end of the printed board 21, and so is the second antenna element 24.",
        "The antenna device 22 has a switch point 26 which is a middle location of the second antenna element 24. The antenna device 22 includes a switch element 27 coupled to the switch point 26. The second antenna element 24 is a monopole antenna having an open end 28 formed by a line between the feeding point 25 and the open end 28. The switch element 27 has at least two terminals, 27h and 27j. In one state of the switch element 27, the terminals 27h and 27j are shorted. In another state of the switch element 27, the terminals 27h and 27j are open. The switch element 27 may be located on the printed board 21.",
        "The terminal 27h is coupled to the switch point 26. The terminal 27j is coupled to the ground pattern of printed board 21 and is thus grounded. Due to these couplings of the terminals 27h and 27j, the second antenna element 24 is grounded at the switch point 26 in one state (called a grounded state), and is not grounded in another state (called an ungrounded state).",
        "How to represent a length of each portion and a total length of the first antenna element 23 and the second antenna element 24 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9.

In FIG. 8, the switch element 27 is being open. Each of small alphabet letters p to u shown in FIG. 8 represents a length of each portion of the first antenna element 23 and the second antenna element 24.",

The second antenna element 24 has a total length of p+s+t.",
        "Hence, the second antenna element 24 has a resonant frequency on which the length of p+s+t corresponds to a quarter wavelength.

        "The equivalent loop antenna has a resonant frequency on which the length of p+s+u corresponds to a half wavelength. The resonant frequency of the equivalent loop antenna is nearly twice as high as the resonant frequency of the second antenna element 24 in the ungrounded state, if a following condition is true, i.e., t\u2245u. The resonant frequency of the second antenna element 24 may thus be changed up to twice as high as its value in the ungrounded state if the switch element 27 is switched to the grounded state, and may be changed even higher if a following condition is true, i.e., u<t.",
        "If the antenna device 22 is configured according to FIG. 4, the antenna device 22 has a VSWR characteristic which is a same as the solid curve shown in FIG. 5. A frequency characteristic of the antenna device 22 in the grounded state of the second antenna element 24 is determine by resonant frequencies of the first antenna element 23, the equivalent loop antenna mentioned above and an antenna element of a length of t between the switch point 26 and the open end 28 performing as a quarter wavelength monopole antenna.",
        "Assume that q+r<s+t and the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 23 is higher than that of the second antenna element 24 in the ungrounded state. In that case, a portion of the first antenna element 23 of a length of q+r and a portion of the second antenna element 24 of a length of s+t cause, as a whole, parallel resonance at a frequency on which a length of q+r+s+t corresponds to a half wavelength. The parallel resonant frequency is lower than the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 23 and higher than that of the second antenna element 24 (refer to p. 201 of Sekine and Shoki previously mentioned). At the parallel resonant frequency, the input impedance of the antenna device 22 may increase and may cause a mismatch.",
        "In a case where the radio apparatus 2 operates in a frequency range between the resonant frequencies of the first antenna element 23 and the second antenna element 24, the parallel resonant frequency in the ungrounded state of the second antenna element 24 may be included in the above frequency range. By closing the switch element 27 and forming the equivalent loop antenna, the antenna device 22 may cover the frequency range while avoiding the parallel resonance.",
        "In a case where q+r<t, though, a frequency of parallel resonance caused by the first antenna element 23 and the antenna element of the length of t between the switch point 26 and the open end 28 may be lower than the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 23, and may be included in the above frequency range. The antenna device 22 may avoid the parallel resonant frequency from remaining in the above frequency range by letting t<q+r. FIG. 11 shows a variation of FIG. 10, in which the switch point 26 coincides with the open end 28, i.e., t=0.",
        "FIG. 12 shows a simulated frequency characteristic of a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of the antenna device 22 configured to avoid the parallel resonant frequency from remaining between two resonant frequencies in the ungrounded state of the second antenna element 24 by switching that to the grounded state. In that simulation, the antenna device 22 is assumed to have a meander element and to operate in an UHF band.",
        "In FIG. 12, a solid curve shows a VSWR characteristic indicating two separate resonant frequencies in the ungrounded state. A dashed curve shows a VSWR characteristic indicating that an interval between the two separate frequencies is covered by a resonant frequency generated in the grounded state and the parallel resonance is avoided.",
        "The first antenna element 23 may not be a monopole antenna having an open end as long as being unbalanced-fed, as the first antenna element 13 of the first embodiment may not either. In that case, the condition explained with reference to FIG. 8, i.e., q+r<s+t, is replaced by a condition that a total length of the second antenna element 24 in the ungrounded state is greater than the quarter wavelength of the resonant frequency of the first antenna element 23.",

Each of remaining portions of the antenna device 22b is a same as the corresponding one shown in FIG. 8 given the same reference numeral, and its explanation is omitted.",
        "Being loaded with the reactance element 18, the antenna device 12a may change an effective length of the second antenna element 14 so that the resonant frequency or the input impedance of the antenna device 12a may be adjusted. So may the resonant frequency or the input impedance of each of the antenna devices 12b, 22a and 22b loaded with the reactance elements 19, 29 and 30, respectively.",
        "If values of the reactance elements 18, etc., are variable, the above adjustment may be made in a broader range. For the adjustment, the conditions of the lengths of the antenna elements explained with reference to FIGS. 2 and 8 need to be satisfied with the effective lengths of the antenna elements.",
        "In FIG. 13, the antenna device 12a may further be loaded with the reactance element 19 shown in FIG. 14 between the terminal 16k of the switch element 16 and the ground pattern of the printed board 11. In FIG. 15, the antenna device 22a may further be loaded with the reactance element 30 shown in FIG. 16 between the terminal 27j of the switch element 27 and the ground pattern of the printed board 21.",
