        "The present invention relates to a photographing apparatus connected to another electronic device and power supply method.",
        "1. Prior Art",
        "The USB (Universal Serial Bus) Standard has come into widespread use as an interface standard for communication between a personal computer and its peripheral equipment connected thereto. The USB Standard was worked out by a plurality of business companies and has come to be released to the public. For example when connection is made between a personal computer and a photographing apparatus such as a digital camera according to this USB Standard, the personal computer works as a host machine, while the digital camera as peripheral equipment acts as a slave. The personal computer as a host provides power required for communications between two pieces of equipment.",
        "To supplement the USB Standard, the USB OTG (On The Go) Standard for connection among pieces of peripheral equipment is established. According to the OTG Standard, peripheral equipment working merely as a slave under the USB Standard is provided with the functions of a host. This allows the peripheral equipment to be connected with other peripheral equipment without the aid of a personal computer, whereby communications are established among different pieces of peripheral equipment. For example, when a digital camera is used as peripheral equipment functioning as a host, image data can be transferred to the printer for printing by connection between the digital camera and a printer, the image data can be recorded into the storage apparatus of the PDA by connection between the digital camera and a PDA, or the network can be accessed by connection between the digital camera and cellular phone, so that image data can be sent directly from the digital camera.",

When the slave mode is selected and the communications cable 20a has been connected to the host connector 12, the control section 3 issues a warning signal to the display section 7, and provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20a.",
        "The following describes the operation in the third embodiment:",
        "FIG. 9 is a flow chart representing power supply processing 3 carried out by the control section 3 of a digital camera 300. As shown in FIG. 9, the control section 3 checks whether or not the camera mode is selected by the selector switch 6aa (Step S31). If the camera mode is selected (Step S31; YES), it checks whether or not photographing operation is currently performed (Step 42). If the photographing operation is currently performed, the control section 3 provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20 (Step 45), and terminates processing of power supply 3. If the camera mode is not selected (Step S42; NO), for example, if processing of image data display is going on, the system proceeds to Step S33.",
        "If the camera mode is not selected by the selector switch 6b (Step 31; NO), the control section 3 checks if the host mode is selected or not (Step S32). If the host mode is not selected (Step S32; NO), i.e. if the slave mode is selected, the control section 3 provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20 (Step S45), and terminates the processing of power supply 3.",
        "If the host mode is selected (Step S32; YES), the control section 3 checks if the communications cable 20a is connected to the host connector or not. If the communications cable (USB cable) 20a is not connected to the host connector 12 (Step S33; NO), the control section 3 checks if the communications cable (USB cable) 20b is connected to the slave connector 13 or not (Step S43). If the communications cable 20b is connected to the slave connector 13 (Step S43; YES), the control section 3 issues a warning signal to the display section 7 (Step S44), and at the same time, provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20b (Step S45), thereby terminating the processing of power supply 3.",
        "When the communications cable 20a is connected to the host connector 12 (Step S33; YES), the control section 3 provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20a (Step S34), and at the same time, allows image data to be displayed on the display section 7 (Step S35). Further, the control section 3 starts communications with the equipment connected through the host connector 12 (Step S36).",
        "Then the control section 3 checks if the communications cable 20b is connected to the slave connector 13 (Step S37). If the communications cable 20b is connected to the slave connector 13 (Step S37; YES), the control section 3 checks if communications are exchanged with the equipment connected through the host connector 12 (Step S38). If there is no communication, (Step S38; NO), the control section 3 provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable 20a (Step 40).",
        "If communications are exchanged with the equipment connected through the host connector 12 (Step S38; YES), the control section 3 checks if the communication has terminated or not (Step S39). If the communication has terminated (Step 39; YES), the control section 3 provides control to stop supply of power to the communications cable 20a (Step S40). The control section 3 allows communications with the equipment connected through the slave connector 13, and terminates the processing of power supply 3.",
        "As described above, according to the third embodiment, the digital camera 300 is provided with a selector switch 6b for selection among the camera mode, host mode and slave mode, a host connector 12 for connection with slave equipment, and a slave connector 12 for connection with host equipment. This permits the mode to be set in conformity to the purpose of use of the digital camera 300. At the same time, when connected with equipment to exchange communications, the equipment is connected through the connector in conformity to the requested function. This arrangement permits power to be supplied to the communications cable 20a only when necessary.",
        "Accordingly, for example when the camera mode is selected by the selector switch 6a or the slave mode is selected, the control section 3 does not allow power to be supplied to the communications cable 20a, thereby eliminating unnecessary power consumption. Power is not supplied when the communications cable 20a is not connected to the host connector 12 even when the host mode is selected, or when there is no communication even when the communications cable 20a is connected. This arrangement reduces power consumption.",
        "A warning signal is displayed on the display section 7 if the communications cable 20b is connected to the slave connector 13 when the host mode is selected, or if communications cable 20a is connected to the host connector 12 when the slave mode is selected. This arrangement calls attention of the user to start immediate communication. When the host mode is selected and power supply to the communications cable 20a has started, image data is displayed on the display section 7. This allows easy checking of the image data to be sent, and permits communication with the connected equipment.",
        "The operation of the digital camera 300 given in the aforementioned processing of power supply 3 shows only an example without being restricted thereto. For example, if the communications cable 20b is connected through the slave connector 13 while power is supplied to the communications cable 20a connected through the host connector 12, supply of power is suspended after confirming the termination of communication with the communications cable 20a. Instead of this arrangement, it is also possible to use the arrangement where supply of power and communication is stopped in the communications cable 20a when the communications cable 20b is connected through the slave connector 13, and to start communication with the communications cable 20b. In other words, priority is given to the case where the digital camera 300 works as a slave, thereby reducing the power consumption of the digital camera 300.",
        "It is also possible to adopt the arrangement where power is not supplied to the communications cable 20a if there is communication going on with the communications cable 20b through the slave connector 13 when the communications cable 20a is connected through the host connector 12. This arrangement does not allow power to be supplied while there is communication with the communications cable 20b even when the communications cable 20a has been connected through the slave connector 13. So it eliminates unnecessary supply of power and minimizes power consumption.",
        "It is also possible to use the arrangement where power is supplied to the host connector 12 when the communications cable 20 is not connected to the host connector 12 or slave connector 13. This approach does not allow the power to be supplied to the slave connector 13 when the communications cable 20 is not connected. Thus, this arrangement eliminates unnecessary power supply and minimizes power consumption.",
        "When the host mode is selected and the communications cable 20a is connected through the host connector 12, power is supplied and the image data is shown on the display section 7. It is also possible to use the arrangement, for example, wherein the displayed image is deleted when the slave mode has been selected by the selector switch 6b. In other words, when the digital camera 300 works as a slave, image data can be displayed on the equipment that works as a host. This approach minimizes the use of display section 7 of the digital camera 300, and saves the drive power of the digital camera 300.",
        "It is also possible to use the arrangement provided with a battery remaining charge detector (not illustrated) to detect the remaining charge of the battery provided on a power source 8; it detects the remaining charge of the battery when a host mode is selected by the selector switch 6b, and a warning is given on the display section 7 if the remaining battery charge is below a predetermined level, thereby ensuring that the digital camera 300 does not work as a host. When the remaining battery chage of the digital camera 300 is insufficient, this arrangement permits priority to be given to the drive processing of the digital camera 300. At the same time, the user is immediately notified of the shortage of battery remaining chage, with the result that the convenience of the user is much improved.",
        "Further, it is apparent that the detailed configuration and operations of the component parts of the digital cameras 100 through 300 in the first through third embodiments can be modified as appropriate without departing from the spirit of the present invention.",
        "The present invention provides a photographing apparatus that exchanges data communications with peripheral equipment connected via a communications cable and supplies power thereto, wherein, in conformity to the function required by connected peripheral equipment, decision is made to determine whether or not power should be supplied to the communications cable. Only when necessary, power for communication is supplied to the communications cable, thereby reducing the unwanted power consumption and ensuring an effective use of the power source of the photographing apparatus."
