    "abstract": "A radar pulse compression repair (RPCR) system includes a receiver for receiving a radar return signal, a matched filter for applying matched filtering to the radar return signal to generate a matched filter output, a processor programmed for applying Radar Pulse Compression Repair (RPCR) to the matched filter output to suppress a plurality of range sidelobes from the matched filter output, and a detector for receiving the RPCR-processed output. The RPCR invention in operating upon the output of the matched filter enables RPCR to be employed as a post-processing stage in systems where it is not feasible to replace the existing pulse compression apparatus. RCPR can also be selectively employed when it is possible that large targets are present that may be masking smaller targets, thereby keeping computational complexity to a minimum.",

        "Range sidelobe suppression in radar pulse compression has been a topic of intense scrutiny for several years. The goal is to minimize the effects caused by the correlation of a transmitted waveform with delayed versions of itself while maintaining close to the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). One approach has sought to achieve this by employing some form of least squares (LS) estimation; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,107. LS has been shown to provide the most efficient estimator when the additive noise is white. However, LS is not robust in that it does not account for scatterers closer than some nominal range R0, which can have a deleterious effect on the estimation of the channel at the ranges of interest.",
        "Another approach termed Reiterative Minimum Mean-Square Error (RMMSE) estimation and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,940,450, issued Sep. 6, 2005 and incorporated herein by reference, provides a robust estimate of the radar channel impulse response that is almost completely devoid of range sidelobes. This approach, however, as with LS estimation, involves replacing the standard matched filter within legacy radar systems, which is not always a feasible solution.",
        "It would therefore be desirable to provide an approach for decreasing the radar sidelobes after a,standard matched filter radar signal processing operation.",
        "According to the invention, a radar pulse compression repair (RPCR) system includes a receiver for receiving a radar return signal, a matched filter for applying matched filtering to the radar return signal to generate a matched filter output, a processor programmed for applying Radar Pulse Compression Repair (RPCR) to the matched filter output to suppress a plurality of range sidelobes from the matched filter output, and a detector for receiving the RPCR-processed output.

An example of this is depicted in FIG. 3 for the matched filter output using a length N=30 Frank-Kretschmer P3 code (waveform) whereby the range sidelobes from the large target mask the small nearby target. For targets that greatly exceed the level of the noise (by 60 dB in the example but typically by 30+ dB depending on the particular waveform) , smaller targets can be masked by the residual range sidelobes in the range cells surrounding large targets.",

In FIG. 4 we see that many small targets are masked by the larger targets in the matched filter output. By comparison, RPCR is able to suppress the range sidelobes that result from the matched filter down to the level of the noise. In so doing, it also reveals many smaller targets that were masked by larger neighboring targets and almost exactly coincides with the ground truth. In terms of the MSE, the RPCR reduces the MSE exhibited by the matched filter by 41 dB.",
