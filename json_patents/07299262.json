        "This is a Continuation Application of PCT Application No. PCT/JP02/03394, filed Apr. 4, 2002, which was not published under PCT Article 21 (2) in English.",
        "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-110400, filed Apr. 9, 2001, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a system using a network, particularly to an information providing support system and method in which a client can easily provide information and a user can easily enjoy the information via electronic mail, and to a program and server for use in the system and method.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Advertising activities and various information services by various companies have heretofore been carried out, for example, by advertising posters hung in trains, advertisements on wrapping buses, business cards, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, and articles.",
        "Therefore, when the user records or stores desired information described in these advertisements, it has been necessary to manually take notes or to use special apparatuses such as a copy machine, scanner, and digital camera.",
        "Therefore, for example, even when the user sees interesting advertisements by chance outdoors, and unless the user carries memo pads or various apparatuses described above, it has been impossible to instantly record/store/edit the information described in the advertisements.",
        "Moreover, in recent years, uniform resource locators (URL) of own web pages of the companies have been placed in various advertisements as described above in many cases.",
        "In this case, the user uses a personal computer to access the web page of the company in which the user takes an interest via the Internet, and can accordingly obtain desired information placed in the advertisements or associated information.",
        "However, from a standpoint of the client company, in order to open the own web page on the Internet, hypertext by hypertext markup language (HTML) and required images need to be stored on web servers such as an internet presence provider (IPP) by a file transfer protocol (FTP) tool, processing is complicated, there have also been many cases requiring contracts with the IPP beforehand, and this has been intricate.",
        "Moreover, from a user's standpoint, on accessing the web page of the company in which the user takes an interest, only an HTML source is obtained. In a user's terminal, the received HTML source is analyzed with a browser and only displayed in a predetermined manner. Therefore, it has not been easy to store/edit/arrange obtained information.",
        "On the other hand, in recent years, a cellular phone or a portable information terminal has generally been used to access the web page of the Internet in a place where the user has gone and to obtain the information. However, there have been restrictions on the information (web page) obtained in this case, and it has not been easy to store, edit, or arrange the obtained information as described above. Furthermore, since the capacity of the built-in memory is limited in the cellular phone, there has also been a limit to the amount of information capable of being stored. On the other hand, in order to provide the information to the user which is an object, it is also necessary for the client company to prepare the web page for exclusive use in the cellular phone, a burden is also large, and this has been intricate.",
        "Here, taking notice of user's operability, a technique has also heretofore been developed for automatically converting a predetermined code into a URL, when the code is input instead of the URL in accessing the web page. However, in this technique, the user needs to install predetermined software in the own personal computer for use or to access a unique web page before accessing the desired web page, and eventually intricate operations have been involved.",
        "As described above, the user hopes to obtain the desired information quickly with a simple operation in a form suitable for storing/editing/arranging the information, but there has not been any technique to realize this.",
        "It is to be noted that, for example, in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2000-57066, a technique is disclosed for automatically deciphering a received question content and extracting corresponding data from a database to automatically return the data via electronic mail, when questions and answers concerning provided information content by product catalogs are returned via electronic mail.",
        "However, in the publication, it is described that when the question content is assumed beforehand, the corresponding data can be returned via the electronic mail, but there is not any \u201cconcrete description\u201d concerning a method for deciphering the received question content. The technique is intricate, because it is necessary to send the question content in sentences.",
        "The present invention has been developed in consideration of the above-described problems, and an object thereof is to provide the following convenience to a user and client, support an information providing service between the user and client, and simplify and smooth the service in an information providing support system and method in which a client terminal apparatus, user terminal apparatus, and server are connected to one another via a network for communication and in a program and server for use in the system and method.",
        "That is, as a detailed object, a user only performs a simple operation with a user terminal apparatus (apparatus having a function of being capable of transmitting/receiving electronic mails) so that desired information on advertisements can quickly be obtained via the electronic mail in a form suitable for storing, editing, or arranging the information. A further object is that reception conditions of the electronic mail can appropriately be set, and accordingly, for example, the information on the advertisements can be received in two or more desired addresses.",

        "As shown in FIG. 1, the information providing support system is constituted of a server 1 connected to a client terminal apparatus 2 and user terminal apparatuses 3, 4 via a network 5 so that communication is possible. The client terminal apparatus 2 such as a personal computer is assumed. In addition to the personal computer, the user terminal apparatuses 3, 4 such as a cellular phone and a personal digital assistant (PDA) are assumed.",
        "Moreover, the network 5 such as internet is assumed, but is not limited to this, and, needless to say, LAN, WAN, and the like are included.",
        "It is to be noted that in FIG. 1, to simplify the description, only one client terminal apparatus 2 and two user terminal apparatuses 3, 4 are shown, but, needless to say, a plurality of client terminal apparatuses and user terminal apparatuses are connected.",
        "The client terminal apparatus 2 and user terminal apparatuses 3, 4 include an inner constitution shown, for example, in FIG. 2. That is, a control section 10 for executing a whole control is connected to a transmission control section 11 such as a modem, a display section 12 such as a CRT display and liquid crystal display, an operation section 13 such as a mouse and keyboard, and a storage section 14 such as a memory. In the storage section, general browser software, mailer software, and the like are stored.",
        "On the other hand, the server 1 includes an inner constitution shown, for example, in FIG. 3. That is, a control section 20 for executing the whole control is connected to/constituted of a transmission control section 21 such as a modem and router, a storage section 22 such as the memory, and a database including an s-memo table 23, a user table 24, and a demand log table 25.",
        "Here, an s-memo code is an identification code automatically given to the information at a time when the client supplies the information such as the advertisement to the server.",
        "Moreover, the s-memo table 23 refers to a predetermined table for searching and extracting the information corresponding to the s-memo code. The constitutions of the s-memo table 23, user table 24, and demand log table 25 are shown in FIGS. 7, 12, 14, and the details will be described later.",
        "It is to be noted that a client communication section and user communication section described in claims correspond, for example, to the transmission control section 11, and the server communication section corresponds, for example, to the transmission control section 21. A control section described in the claims corresponds, for example, to the control section 20, and a storage section corresponds, for example, to the database. Predetermined information refers to information provided by the client to receive an information providing support service, that is, information acquired by the user by the service, and a predetermined code refers to the s-memo code.",
        "A function of the information providing support system constituted in this manner will be described hereinafter.",
        "It is to be noted that here those who supply the information so as to receive the information providing support service are referred to as the \u201cclients\u201d, and those who use the information are referred to as the \u201cusers\u201d.",
        "First, a procedure for issuing an s-memo code number with respect to the information supplied from the client by the server 1 will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 4 to 8.",
        "When the client accesses the web page of \u201cs-memo.com (this is a tentative domain name attached for the convenience of the description)\u201d by the client terminal apparatus 2 (step S1), the server 1 transmits an HTML source of a client authentication page to the transmission control section 11 of the client terminal apparatus 2 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S2).",
        "In the client terminal apparatus 2, the HTML source received by the transmission control section 11 is analyzed by the control section 10 to display the client authentication page in the display section 12 (step S3). This client authentication page is as shown in FIG. 5, and suggests input of client's ID and password (PW).",
        "Here, when the client operates the operation section 13 to input the self ID and PW, the information is sent to the transmission control section 21 of the server 1 via the transmission control section 11 and network 5. Then, in the server 1, the control section 20 judges whether or not the client is registered (step S4). When the client is unregistered, predetermined client registration is carried out (step S5).",
        "Next, the server 1 transmits the HTML source of a text registration page to the transmission control section 11 of the client terminal apparatus 2 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S6). Then, in the client terminal apparatus 2, the HTML source received by the transmission control section 11 is analyzed by the control section 10 to display the text registration page in the display section 12 (step S7).",
        "The text registration page is as shown in FIG. 6. In the client terminal apparatus 2, the following information is inputted into the display.",
        "That is, the client writes a desired document such as the advertisement in a \u201ctext\u201d region of the text registration page. In this case, a category of a content of the advertisement is selected from choices of a \u201ccategory\u201d region. In this example, \u201ceducation\u201d is selected.",
        "When an attached file (image, music, program, and the like) is desired to be added, a \u201creference\u201d button is clicked. Then, a dialog box of \u201cfile list\u201d opens. Subsequently, a file desired to be attached is selected from a file group of a \u201cfile list\u201d region, and a \u201cselect\u201d button is clicked. Then, a selected file name (\u201cC:\\ tmp\\01. gif\u201d in this example) is displayed on the left of a screen of the \u201creference\u201d button. When an \u201cupload\u201d button is clicked in this state, the file is uploaded, and displayed in an \u201cattached file\u201d region. When the attached file is to be deleted, the file desired to be deleted is selected from the file group displayed in the \u201cattached file\u201d region, and a \u201cdelete\u201d button may be clicked.",
        "The above-described input information is sent to a server 1 side, and on the server 1 side, the control section 20 adds these records to the s-memo table 23 (step S8).",
        "The s-memo table 23 includes a constitution as shown in FIG. 7.",
        "That is, in this example, the client's ID is associated with the s-memo code, content of the text, category, format of the file, and the like, and stored.",
        "For example, the information inputted by the client in the step S7 is stored as client ID \u201caaaaa\u201d, s-memo code \u201c10128\u201d, text \u201cnew first-grade reference book \u25ef\u25ef phone No. XXX\u201d, category \u201ceducation\u201d, and file format \u201cTEXT\u201d in a fourth row from above in the table 23.",
        "Here, the s-memo code is automatically attached in a stage where the control section 20 of the server 1 accepts the text registration from the client terminal apparatus 2. This respect is one of characteristics of the present information providing support system.",
        "Subsequently, the server 1 transmits the HTML source of the s-memo code notice page to the transmission control section 11 of the client terminal apparatus 2 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S9). Then, in the client terminal apparatus 2, the control section 10 analyzes the HTML source received by the transmission control section 11 to display the s-memo code notice page in the display section 12 (step S10).",
        "This s-memo code notice page is as shown in FIG. 8.",
        "That is, in the s-memo code notice page, the \u201ctext\u201d, \u201ccategory\u201d, \u201cattached file list\u201d, \u201cfile format\u201d registered in the s-memo table 23, and the automatically attached \u201cs-memo code\u201d are displayed.",
        "Therefore, the client can see this page to confirm that the desired information such as the advertisement is exactly registered on the server 1 side and that a state capable of receiving the information providing support service is obtained. That is, thereafter, the s-memo code is printed/included in the self advertisements, and can accordingly be used by the user.",
        "It is to be noted that the content of the s-memo code notice page is transmitted to a client terminal apparatus 2 side from the server 1 even via the electronic mail (step S11). This facilitates the storing/arranging of the information on the client side.",
        "As described above, a series of processes for automatically issuing the s-memo code number with respect to the information provided by the client end.",
        "It is to be noted that in the above-described example, a sequence of numbers of five digits has been used as the s-memo code, but needless to say the present invention is not limited to this. For example, when the registered text has a TEXT format, XXXXX (X=0, 1, 2 . . . ) can be used. With an HTML format, h-XXXXX can be used. When the registered text includes the attached file, a-XXXXX can also be used.",
        "In this case, when seeing an initial letter of the s-memo code, the user demanding the information can know the format of the file to be obtained in advance. It is to be noted that even in this case, although details are described later, needless to say, the initial letter can be omitted in demanding the information.",
        "Next, a series of processes concerning personal reception condition customization by the user will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 9 to 12. It is to be noted that in the present embodiment, the information can be acquired without any user registration. Therefore, the process of the personal reception condition customization is an arbitrary procedure performed only by a user who desires to perform the process.",
        "When the user accesses a homepage of \u201cs-memo.com\u201d by the user terminal apparatus 3 (step S21), the server 1 transmits the HTML source of a user authentication page to the transmission control section 11 of the user terminal apparatus 3 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S22). Then, in the user terminal apparatus 3, the control section 10 analyzes the HTML source received by the transmission control section 11 to display the user authentication page in the display section 12 (step S23).",
        "This user authentication page is, for example, as shown in FIG. 10, and suggests at least the input of the user's ID and PW.",
        "Here, when the user operates the operation section 13 to input the self identifier (ID) and password (PW), the information is sent to the transmission control section 21 of the server 1 via the transmission control section 11 and network 5. Then, in the server 1, the control section 20 judges whether or not the user has been registered (step S24). When the user is unregistered, predetermined user registration is carried out (step S25).",
        "Next, the server 1 transmits the HTML source of a personal reception condition customized page to the transmission control section 11 of the user terminal apparatus 3 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S26). Then, in the user terminal apparatus 3, the HTML source received by the transmission control section 11 is analyzed by the control section 10 to display the personal reception condition customized page in the display section 12 (step S27).",
        "The personal reception condition customized page is as shown in FIG. 11.",
        "That is, in the personal reception condition customized page, as receivers, an address 1 (basic address), address 2 (another address), and address 3 (another address) can be registered. Furthermore, for each of the addresses 1, 2, 3, file formats (TEXT, HTML), disapproval/approval of the attached file, the maximum value of the number of characters (MAX), the maximum value of the attached file size (MAX), and acceptance/rejection of a direct mail (hereinafter abbreviated as DM) can be set.",
        "For example, in FIG. 11, in ddddd's reception condition setting page, \u201cd1@xxx.ne.jp\u201d is set as the address 1, the file format is TEXT, the attached file is disapproved, MAX of the number of characters is 250 characters, and DM is set to be rejected. Furthermore, \u201cd2@xxx.co.jp\u201d is set as the address 2, the file format is TEXT, HTML, the attached file is approved, MAX of the attached file size is 1000 kilobytes, and DM is set to be accepted. Moreover, \u201cd3@xxx.ne.jp\u201d is set as the address 3, the attached file is disapproved, and DM is set to be accepted.",
        "It is to be noted that in the setting of the address 1, the attached file size MAX is not set. This is because the attached file is set to be disapproved, and the setting is not necessary.",
        "The above-described input information is sent to the server 1 side, and on the server 1 side, the control section 20 adds these records to the user table 24 (step S28).",
        "The constitution of the user table 24 is as shown in FIG. 12.",
        "That is, in the user table 24, the user IDs are associated with the addresses 1 to 3 and the reception conditions concerning the respective addresses (set information concerning the file format, disapproval/approval of the attached file, MAX of the number of characters, attached file size MAX, and acceptance/rejection of DM) and stored. The information set beforehand in the reception condition setting page of FIG. 11 is stored as a user ID \u201cddddd\u201d, the addresses 1, 2, 3, and the respective reception conditions in a first row of the user table 24.",
        "In this manner, the server 1 transmits the information registered in the user table 24 to the transmission control section 11 of the client terminal apparatus 2 via the transmission control section 21 and network 5 (step S29). As described above, a series of processes concerning the personal reception condition customization by the user ends.",
        "Next, one example of the process related to the information providing support by the server 1 which has received the electronic mail related to the information demand by the user will be described with reference to FIGS. 7, 12 to 14.",
        "For example, the user has an interest in the information by a certain client via an advertising poster hung in a train, advertisement of a wrapping bus, business card, advertisement on the newspaper and magazine, and articles. In this case, the user transmits the electronic mail in which the s-memo code printed on the advertisement is described in a column of \u201ctitle\u201d to the server 1, and then enters this process.",
        "In this respect, the user may only grasp (register) only the mail address of the server 1 to which the s-memo code is to be sent, and this is very convenient.",
        "In the server 1, on receiving the electronic mail from the user terminal apparatus 3 by the transmission control section 21 (step S31), the control section 20 starts a mail analysis program stored beforehand in the storage section 22 (step S32), and extracts the following items from the received electronic mail (step S33).",
        "That is, in general, the electronic mail is constituted of a header portion and body (mail content), the header portion has the information for exactly sending the electronic mail, but here the following is extracted from the information of the header portion.",
        "From: (user's address) . . . (a)",
        "Subject: (s-memo code) . . . (b)",
        "Subsequently, the control section 20 of the server 1 reads the text (this is assumed as (c)) corresponding to an s-memo code (b) from the s-memo table 23 (see FIG. 7) (step S34). Subsequently, the control section 20 of the server 1 refers to the user table 24 (see FIG. 12) (step S35), and judges whether or not an address (a) exists in the addresses 1 to 3 (step S36).",
        "Here, when the address (a) exists in the addresses 1 to 3, a record is added to the demand log table of FIG. 14 (step S37).",
        "That is, for example, when the address of a transmitter of the electronic mail is (a)=\u201cd1@xxx.ne.jp\u201d and the title is (b)=10128, these exist in the user table 24 (FIG. 12), and therefore the user ID \u201cddddd\u201d, demander address \u201cd1@xxx.ne.jp\u201d, and s-memo code \u201c10128\u201d are added to the demand log table 25.",
        "It is to be noted that the record in the fourth row from above in FIG. 14 corresponds to this.",
        "Moreover, the control section 20 of the server 1 reads the user's address (this is assumed as (d)) from the user table 24 (step S38), and returns texts (c) to demander's return desired address (d) (step S39).",
        "In this example, when the texts (c) to be returned to the user ddddd is only a text file, the texts are returned to the addresses 1, 2. An HTML file or an attached file if any is returned to the address 2.",
        "On the other hand, in the step S36, when the above-described (a) does not exist in the addresses 1 to 3, the record is added to the demand log table of FIG. 14. In this case, the demander's address (a) is stored as a user ID \u201cnone\u201d together with the s-memo code (b) (step S40).",
        "The record in a third row from above in FIG. 14 corresponds to this. Moreover, the texts (c) are returned to the demander's address (a) (step S41).",
        "It is to be noted that when binary information of the data such as the image, sound, and program is attached to the texts (c), an extension function of the electronic mail referred to as multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME) is used.",
        "In this manner, after the process of the step S39, an electronic mail indicating that the electronic mail including the attached file has been sent to a returnable address, that is, in which \u201creturn situation report\u201d is described is transmitted to at least one of the user's addresses (a), (d) (step S42).",
        "As described above, one example of the process related to the information providing support service by the server 1 which has received the electronic mail related to the information demand by the user ends.",
        "Next, a flow of a process for limiting users having specific tastes from the record of a demand action will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 7, 12, 15.",
        "Here, \u201ceducation\u201d will be illustrated as an example of the \u201cspecific tastes\u201d, and a process to limit the specific user will be described. First, the control section 20 of the server 1 acquires the s-memo code whose category is \u201ceducation\u201d from the s-memo table 23 (FIG. 7) (step S50). That is, in this example, the control section 20 refers to the s-memo table 23 of FIG. 7, detects the code whose \u201ccategory\u201d is \u201ceducation\u201d, and obtains \u201c10128\u201d as the corresponding s-memo code.",
        "Subsequently, the control section 20 of the server 1 refers to the demand log table 25 (FIG. 14) to specify the user who has demanded the s-memo code \u201c10128\u201d (step S51). In this example, objects are limited to users ddddd, eeeee.",
