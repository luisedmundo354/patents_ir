    "description": [
        "There is substantial commercial interest in the use of multilayer, weatherable polymeric materials in various product forms such as sheets, films, shaped products, thermoformed articles, packaging, and architectural products, as well as coatings. Many different plastics are used as the base layer, or substrate, in these products in order to take advantage of particular physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. The upper layer, often referred to as the topcoat, often functions to protect the base layer or layers, for example to maintain gloss and shine. However, curing and aging of the layers can result in a color shift, often described as yellowing. This color shift may be observed immediately upon manufacture, or gradually over time. When a white or light colored finish is desired, yellowing of the upper layer is aesthetically undesirable to consumers. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for weatherable compositions, particularly upper coats, that provide protection to an underlying substrate, and that do not appreciably yellow during use.",
        "A weatherable, multilayer composition comprises a upper layer comprising a polymer system consisting essentially of a cycloaliphatic polyester resin, and an additive composition comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a low volatility hydroxyphenyl-triazine or -pyrimidine UV absorber; an intermediate layer comprising a polymer system consisting essentially of a cycloaliphatic polyester, and optionally an additive composition comprising TiO2, dyes, pigments, or special effects additives; and a polymeric substrate wherein the intermediate layer is disposed between, and in intimate contact with the upper layer and the substrate.",
        "It has been unexpectedly found by the inventors hereof that a weatherable, non-yellowing multilayer composition maybe achieved by using specific formulations for the various layers as disclosed herein. An upper layer (most commonly a upper coat) comprises a cycloaliphatic polyester resin, and an additive composition comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a low volatility hydroxyphenyl-triazine or -pyrimidine UV absorber. An intermediate layer comprises a cycloaliphatic polyester resin and optionally, additives including titanium dioxide (hereinafter referred to as TiO2), as well as dyes, pigments, and/or special surface effect additives. These two layers are disposed on a polymeric substrate, which preferably comprises polycarbonate and TiO2.",
        "Cycloaliphatic polyesters are preferred for use in the upper and intermediate layers, as they are characterized by optical transparency and improved weatherability when compared to many substrate compositions alone. Preferably, they also have improved chemical resistance and low water absorption when compared to the base substrate layer alone. In addition, cycloaliphatic polyester layers may also have melt compatibility with the substrate resin, allowing easy recycling of the multilayer structures through simple re-melting of the multilayer article and reforming one of the layers as a combination of the substrate and the cycloaliphatic layer. This attribute is in contrast to other layers known in the art, such as chlorinated polyolefins, which react upon re-melting to cause degradation of the base substrate layer resin, particularly if the base substrate layer resin is a high melting condensation polymer like polycarbonate as is used herein.",
        "Cycloaliphatic polyesters suitable for use herein can be defined in many ways, including by method of preparation. For example, suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters may be prepared by reaction of a diol with a dibasic acid or derivative thereof, provided that at least a portion of the diol and/or the acid is cycloaliphatic. The diols useful in the preparation of suitable polyester resins are straight chain, branched, or cycloaliphatic, with straight chain or branched alkane diols containing at least 2 carbon atoms, and at most 12 carbon atoms on average. Examples of suitable diols include, but are not limited to, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol (i.e., 1,2- and 1,3-propylene glycol), butane diol (i.e., 1,3- and 1,4-butane diol), diethylene glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propane diol,2-ethyl, 2-methyl, 1,3-propane diol, 1,3- and 1,5-pentane diol, di-propylene glycol, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, triethylene glycol, 1,10-decane diol, mixtures of the foregoing, and the like.",
        "Examples of preferred diols include dimethanol-bicyclo-octane, and dimethanol decaline. Most preferred diols are in general cycloaliphatic diols or chemical equivalents thereof, in particular 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol or a chemical equivalent thereof. In the instance when the preferred cycloaliphatic diol can contain a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers, a cis to trans ratio of at least about 1 to 4 cis/trans, and at most about 4 to 1 trans is preferred, a cis/trans ratio of about 1 to 3 cis/trans being most preferred. Also, chemical equivalents of diols include esters, such as dialkylesters, diaryl esters, and the like.",
        "As mentioned above, suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters may be prepared by reaction of a diol with a dibasic acid or derivative. Di-acids (dibasic acids) useful in the preparation of suitable cycloaliphatic polyester resins have at least two carboxyl groups, each of which is attached to a saturated carbon in a saturated ring. A preferred diacid is 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and most preferred is trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid as further explained above. Other examples of suitable cycloaliphatic acids include decahydro-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, norbornene dicarboxylic acids, and bicyclo-octane dicarboxylic acids and salts thereof. Linear aliphatic diacids are useful herein provided the polyester has at least one monomer containing a cycloaliphatic ring. Examples of linear aliphatic diacids include, but are not limited to succinic acid, adipic acid, dimethyl succinic acid, azelaic acid and the like. Various mixtures of diacid and diols are also suitable for use herein to produce suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters.",
        "Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids and chemical equivalents thereof can be prepared, for example, by the hydrogenation of cycloaromatic diacids and corresponding derivatives such as isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid of naphthalenic acid in a suitable solvent. This process may also include preparation with water and/or acetic acid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using suitable catalysts such as rhodium supported on a suitable carrier of carbon or alumina, as disclosed in Friefelder et al., Journal of Organic Chemistry, 31, 34-38 (1966); U.S. Pat. No. 2,675,390 to Roseneblatt, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,754,064 to Lillwitz. Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids and chemical equivalents thereof may also be prepared by the use of an inert liquid medium using a catalyst of palladium or ruthenium in carbon or silica, wherein an acid is at least partially soluble under reaction conditions, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,888,484 to Dekm et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,444,237 to Jaffe.",
        "During hydrogenation, two or more isomers of cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids may be obtained, in which the carboxylic acid groups are in both the cis- and trans-positions. The cis- and trans-isomers can be separated by crystallization with or without a solvent, for example, n-heptane, or by distillation. Cis-isomers tend to provides better blending; however, trans-isomers tend to have higher melting and crystallization temperatures, either of which may be preferred depending on the end use. As such, mixtures of the cis- and trans-isomers of cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids are also useful herein. When a mixture of isomers and/or more than one diacid is used, a copolyester or a mixture of two polyesters may also be used as the cycloaliphatic polyester resin.",
        "Chemical equivalents of these diacids include esters, alkyl esters, dialkyl esters, diaryl esters, anhydrides, acid chlorides, acid bromides, and the like. The preferred chemical equivalents comprise the dialkyl esters of the cycloaliphatic diacids. The most preferred chemical equivalent comprises dimethyl esters of the acid, particularly dimethyl-trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate.",
        "Dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate can be obtained by ring hydrogenation of dimethylterephthalate, wherein two isomers having the carboxylic acid groups in the cis- and trans-positions are obtained. The isomers can be separated, the trans-isomer being especially preferred. Mixtures of the isomers are suitable as explained above and preferably in the ratios as explained above.",
        "Suitable polyester resins may also be identified structurally, and are typically obtained through the condensation or ester interchange polymerization of the above-described diol or diol equivalent component with the diacid or diacid chemical equivalent component, and having recurring units of formula 1:",
        "wherein R1 is an alkyl or cycloaliphatic radical preferably containing at least 2 carbon atoms, and at most 12 carbon atoms on average, and which is the residue of a straight chain, branched, or cycloaliphatic alkane diol having at least 2 carbon atoms, and at most 12 carbon atoms on average, or chemical equivalents thereof, and R2 is an alkyl or a cycloaliphatic radical, which is the decarboxylated residue derived from a diacid, with the proviso that at least one of R1 or R2 is a cycloalkyl group.",
        "A preferred cycloaliphatic polyester is poly-1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (hereinafter referred to as PCCD), wherein R1 and R2 is a cyclohexylidene radical, and further wherein R2 is derived from cyclohexanedicarboxylate or a chemical equivalent thereof, and is selected from the cis- or trans-isomer or a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers thereof.",
        "Suitable cycloaliphatic polyester resins can be generally made as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,465,319 to Whinfield et al. The reaction is generally conducted in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as, for example, tetra(2-ethyl hexyl) titanate, in a suitable amount, typically about 50 to 400 ppm of titanium based upon the final product.",
        "Cycloaliphatic polyester resins may also contain catalyst quenchers (also known as stabilizers) that inhibit activity of any catalysts that may be present in the resins. Catalyst quenchers are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,997 to Walsh et al. Preferably, quenchers provide a transparent and colorless product. Quenchers are used at a concentration of at least about 0.001%, preferably at least about 0.005% by weight of the total layer or substrate. Quenchers are also used at a concentration of at most about 10%, preferably at most about 2% by weight of the total layer or substrate. Preferred quencher/stabilizers include an effective amount of an acidic phosphate salt; an acid, alkyl, aryl or mixed phosphite having at least one acidic hydrogen; a Group IB or Group IIB metal phosphate salt; a phosphorus oxo acid, a metal acid pyrophosphate or a mixture thereof and the like. The suitability of a particular compound for use as a stabilizer may be readily determined without under experimentation by one of skill in the art.",
        "Useful acidic phosphate salts include sodium dihydrogen phosphate, mono zinc phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, calcium dihydrogen phosphate and the like. The phosphites may have the formula P(OR3)(OR4)(OR5), wherein R3, R4 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl and aryl with the proviso that at least one of R3, R4, and R5 is hydrogen. The phosphate salts of a Group IB or Group IIB metal of the periodic table include zinc phosphate, copper phosphate, and the like. The phosphorus oxo acids include phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid or hypophosphorous acid. Suitable polyacid pyrophosphates are of the formula MxHyPnO3n+1, wherein M is a metal, x is from 1 to about 12, y is from 1 to about 12, n is from 2 to about 10, and the sum of x+y is equal to n+2. The preferred M is an alkaline or alkaline earth metal.",
        "Preferred quenchers include oxo acids of phosphorous or acidic organo phosphorus compounds. Inorganic acidic phosphorus compounds may also be used as quenchers, with the most preferred quenchers being phosphoric or phosphorous acid.",
        "Preferably, the upper layer comprises a polymer system that consists essentially of a cycloaliphatic polyester as described above. By this is meant that additional polymers may be present, but not any that would adversely impact the weathering of the weatherable composition, or the yellowing or discoloration of the weatherable composition, particularly over time, for example polycarbonate.",
        "The upper layer further includes an additive composition that contains a combination of a hindered amine light stabilizers and a low volatility hydroxyphenyl-triazine or -pyrimidine UV absorber.",
        "Useful hindered amine light stabilizers (hereinafter HALS) include substituted piperidine moieties and oligomers thereof, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,901 to Ramey et al., U.S. Pat.

        "Example 1 clearly demonstrates the benefits of the multilayer composition disclosed herein. Under the test conditions, Example 1 demonstrates an increased level of weatherability and heat aging than would be expected by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the comparative examples. Specifically, UV2 package protects better against color shift than UV1, (compare e.g. sample 2 with samples 1, 3 and 6, and compare sample 4 with samples 5 and 7.) The presence of polycarbonate in the upper layer also leads to a larger color shift (compare sample 2 with sample 4, and compare samples 1 and 3 with samples 5, and 7).",

This is true even though gloss retention of the top layer is thought to be related to erosion phenomena at the exposed surface, which phenomena would not be expected to be affected by the composition of the intermediate layer.",
