        "This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/680,719 filed on May 13, 2005, entitled \u201cA METHOD FOR IMPROVING OPERATIONAL RELIABILITY DURING A LOSS OF SINGLE PHASE VOLTAGE\u201d the contents of which are relied upon and incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, and the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) is hereby claimed.",
        "The present invention relates to a multi-phase power system and in particular to the reliability of that system during a loss of phase voltage.",
        "As widely known in the art, many protective devices, such as relays, circuit breakers, various types of monitoring, supervising and fault detection units, are used in power system. One basic task of these devices is to allow electrical power to be distributed in a reliable manner and to adequately protect either the transmission lines and the loads or equipments connected therewith, e.g. generators, motors, from hazardous conditions which could lead to malfunction, severe damage, failure, etc.",
        "Often, the protection of power system elements is based on accurate measurement of three-phase voltages in order to provide reliable fault detection and breaker operations and thus minimize power system disruptions. In these cases, incorrectly measuring one or more of the three-phase voltages by a protective unit may result in technical shortcomings, e.g. erroneous trips (breaker operations) and/or clearing more of the power system than desired.",
        "For example a common failure that causes incorrect voltage measurement is when there is a downed line, or due to an equipment failure in an end-user's facility, or when one or more fuses protecting a three-phase voltage transformer (VT) secondary circuit blow. In the latter case, protective relays connected to that secondary circuit would measure zero voltage if a secondary phase is isolated (only phase-to-ground connections) or there exist a non-zero coupled value if there are phase-to-phase connections in the secondary circuit. Conditions, other than blown fuses, may also occur where one or more secondary phase voltages are unintentionally removed from the protective relay.",
        "In the electrical power system industry operating in this abnormal state may for example be referred to as \u201csingle-phasing\u201d, or as fuse failure, or as \u201closs-of-potential (LOP)\u201d, or more commonly as \u201closs-of-voltage (LOV)\u201d and this last definition (\u201cLOV\u201d) will be used hereinafter to refer to the loss of voltage in a single phase.",
        "It is clear that when an LOV state occurs, adequate control of voltage dependent measuring units need to be carried out so as to reduce potential detrimental effects on the whole power system and/or on the various pieces of equipment.",
        "For example, with protection measuring units, such as distance and impedance units, e.g. distance relays, functioning is based on calculating the impedance seen by the units themselves; since the impedance measured is directly dependent on the voltage(s). Thus an LOV condition will adversely affect obtaining correct measurements and therefore missing one or more phase voltages will lead to misoperations, such as untimely tripping.",
        "The same considerations apply also in the case of the so-called directional units, i.e. protection measuring devices that determine the direction of the current flow in an AC circuit and are used to supervise for example an overcurrent relay in order to let it trip only in the desired direction. These directional units can perform their supervision task by comparing the angular relationship between the current in the protected circuit and an independent voltage source. Since the current can vary significantly for various types of faults, in order to determine directionality the independent voltage may be used as a reference or polarizing quantity. This reference voltage may be not correct during an LOV state, and hence the directional units will not be able to provide the required supervision and may contribute to a misoperation.",
        "A further example of the negative impact that the occurrence of an LOV state may have on power line protection is the operation of a recloser. A recloser opens and closes multiple times when a fault condition exists in an attempt to clear the fault. Should the fault condition continue to exist, the recloser opens and remains open until reset manually. The recloser enters a \u201clock out\u201d state when this occurs. Automatic reclosing requires synchronization or comparison of voltage on each side of an open line circuit breaker. These comparisons are often accomplished by comparing the voltage from one phase VT on each side of the open breaker. If an LOV condition exists on either VT, reclosing may operate incorrectly and prevent automatic system restoration, cause a line outage, or possibly cause circuit breaker damage. Thus, the location of the LOV may impact the protection functions provided by the recloser.",
        "In the past, in order to improve reliability under an LOV state, various solutions have been devised varying depending on several aspects of the specific applications, such as type, number and technology of protecting systems, available options provided by the units, architecture of the power system, etc. These known solutions, even though providing some improvements may not be entirely satisfactory as they may, when an LOV condition occurs, either give rise to false trip or not allow for local fault clearing, or require the use of costly redundant protection system.",
        "Thus it is desirable to provide a solution which improves operational reliability during an LOV state.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, a method for improving operational reliability during a loss of a phase voltage in a multi-phase power system, in particular a three-phase power line, is provided. In accordance with the method, when one of the phases is under an LOV state, a fictitious voltage representative of this LOV state phase is calculated and a reference polarizing voltage is computed suitable for any protection unit associated with the power system. The invention also provides a multi-phase power system, such as a three-phase power line, for allowing operational reliability during a loss of a phase voltage (LOV), comprising a computing device having therein program code usable by the computing device itself, wherein the program code comprises code configured to: identify the phase which is in an LOV state; calculate a fictitious voltage representative of the voltage of said phase in an LOV state; and calculate a reference polarizing voltage. Further, the present invention also provides a computer program product for allowing reliable operation during a loss of a phase voltage (LOV) in a multi-phase power system, wherein the computer program product comprises computer usable program code which is configured to: identify the phase which is in an LOV state; then to calculate a fictitious voltage representative of the voltage of said phase in an LOV state; and finally to calculate a reference polarizing voltage.",
        "The features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings where:",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a power system wherein a three-phase protective relay is operatively connected to a three-phase bus or line voltage;",
        "FIG. 2 is an operational block diagram schematically representing an embodiment of the method according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 3 shows a fault oscillography for a practical test based on pre-fault and fault quantities recorded for a forward fault at a remote bus;",
        "It should be noted that in order to clearly and concisely disclose the present invention, the drawings may not necessarily be to scale and certain features of the invention may be shown in somewhat schematic form.",
        "In the following description and illustrative examples, the method according to the present invention is described by making particular reference to its functioning with directional protection units without intending in any way to limit its scope and potential field of application.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a power system apparatus, globally indicated with reference number 1, wherein a primary three-phase power line (or bus) 2 is operatively connected to a protective device 3, preferably a computing device. Such a protective computing device 3 can be constituted for example by any suitable electronic relay.",
        "The protective relay 3 comprises a microprocessor unit 4 with a program code which is embedded therein and is suitable to carry out the method of the present invention, and a memory unit 5 which can be directly incorporated within or operatively connected with the microprocessor unit 4 itself. The protective relay 3 is operatively connected to the phases of the power line, i.e. phase A, phase B and phase C, through voltage transformers (VT) that step down the primary system quantities to values that enable practical and safe implementation of the relay 3 itself. Some equivalent alternatives may be adopted for the connection, for example current transformers can be used in addition with or in alternative to voltage transformers VT. The secondary system circuit indicated at 6, which is normally used by protective devices, such as the relay 3, for their measures and appropriate operations, is suitably fused by means of secondary circuit fuses 7 in order to protect the voltage transformer secondary winding and circuit.",
        "Referring now also to FIG. 2, the relay 3 receives the voltage signals 10 from the phases and, under normal operating conditions, i.e. an LOV state is not occurring, the microprocessor unit 4 computes at block 11 the respective voltage values (VA for phase A, VB for phase B, VC for phase C). These values are recorded in the memory unit 5 and are continuously updated by repetitive calculations.",
        "When an LOV state occurs on one phase, for example because a fuse 7 blows due to a fault on the secondary circuit 6, the relay 3 through its microprocessor unit 4 first identifies (block 12) which phase is under an LOV-state. One possible manner suitable for the identification of the phase under an LOV-state is disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,578 whose disclosure is fully incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Once the phase under an LOV state is identified, the microprocessor unit 4 alarms and calculates (at block 13 for phase A, at block 14 for phase B, at block 15 for phase C) a fictitious voltage which is representative of the voltage of the phase in an LOV state. The fictitious voltage is recorded (block 16) in the memory unit 5 and is continuously updated by repetitive calculations.",
        "Then, a reference polarizing voltage is calculated. This reference polarizing voltage can be used by the relay 3 and its incorporated logic/functions or it can be provided to any protection unit operatively associated with or incorporated in the multi-phase power system, so as to allow an improved operation reliability under some operating conditions, namely occurrence of a fault on one of the other phases, e.g. either phase A or C, which are not subject to a LOV state. Suitable protection units can be for example a unit for monitoring, supervising, detecting, tripping etc.",
        "In the method according to the invention, the step of calculating said reference polarizing voltage can be carried out either by means of zero voltage sequence calculations or of negative voltage sequence calculations, and in particular the following equations can be used:\n\n3V0=VA+VB+VC=0\u2003\u2003Zero Sequence\n\n3V2=VA+a2VB+aVC=0\u2003\u2003Negative Sequence\n\nwhere a is a complex operator",
        "(\n  \n    a\n    =\n    \n      \u2147\n      \n        j2\n        \u2062\n        \n          \u03c0\n          3\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  )\n\n\n\n\nand VA, VB and VC are pre-fault voltages during an LOV state and with the assumption that with a perfectly balanced three-phase system V0 (zero sequence) and V2 (negative sequence) are equal to zero.",
        "For perfectly balanced systems the results using either the zero or the negative sequence voltage equation would be substantially equal; however, there might be some differences if some unbalance exists. In these cases, a purposive selection can be done; for example, the voltage of the lost phase can be preferably calculated by using the zero sequence equation, e.g. for zero sequence directional polarization, and the computation using the negative sequence equation could be preferably used, e.g. for negative sequence directional polarization.",
        "Hence, according to the method of the present invention, when an LOV state occurs on a phase, the above mentioned fictitious voltage representative of the LOV-state phase (VA, when the LOV is on phase A, or VB\u2032 when the LOV is on phase B, or VC\u2032 when the LOV is on phase C) is calculated based on the recorded voltages (VA and VB when the LOV is on phase C, or VA and VC when the LOV is on phase B, or VB and VC when the LOV is on phase A) of the other phases in a non-LOV state; in particular the following equations are used for these calculations:",

        "It is also noted that for this case the fault was not a true single phase-to-ground fault, but the analysis shows that correct operation for the LOV state will occur with this adaptive approach.",
        "Hence, as evident from the above example, the operational reliability of protection units can be significantly improved while protection is in an LOV state by using the method according to the invention.",
        "Likewise, in order to compute ground distance measurement during a single-phase LOV state, the voltage on the lost phase of the secondary circuit can be calculated in the same manner as done for the directional units using the method according to the invention and in particular, the zero and negative sequence voltage equations.",
        "For example, in the case of cross-polarized ground distance measurement units, the operating principal is based on comparing the phase relationship of two phasor quantities, according to the following equations:",

In particular, the program code is configured to calculate the fictitious voltage on the basis of the voltages of the phases other than said phase in an LOV-state. Further, the program code is configured in such a way that, when a fault occur on one of the phases other than the phase in an LOV-state, the calculation of the reference polarizing voltage is carried out on the basis of: the pre-calculated fictitious voltage representative of the voltage of the phase in an LOV state; and of the voltages which are suitably detected during the fault on the phases other than the phase in an LOV-state. The program code preferably comprises code which is configured to assume the fictitious voltage representative of the voltage of said phase in an LOV state equal to zero when a fault occurs on the phase under an LOV-state, and/or to assume no significant phase angle shift for single-line-to-ground-faults between pre-fault and fault condition on the phases in a non-LOV-state.",
