        "This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application Number 2003-007253, filed on Jan. 15, 2003.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer having an anti-theft capability and, more particularly, to a remote control engine starting device for remotely starting an engine while ensuring enhanced security for the vehicle.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Remote control engine starting devices for starting vehicle engines by remote control have been commercially implemented in recent years. On the other hand, an increasing number of vehicles come equipped with an anti-theft function known as the immobilizer. The immobilizer works as follows. A chip having a unique key code is embedded in an ignition (IG) key and, when an engine start operation such as the insertion or turning of the key in an IG key cylinder is detected, the key code is read from the key, and an immobilizer controller compares the thus readout key code with a prestored legitimate code, and permits engine control only when they match. Accordingly, if an attempt is made to start the engine by using a key other than the legitimate key, the engine control system does not operate because the key codes do not match and, therefore, the engine cannot be started, thus preventing theft.",
        "When a remote control engine starting device is installed in a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function, the engine cannot be started remotely unless the immobilizer is disarmed. To solve this problem, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H08-150902 discloses a system in which when a remote engine start command is received from a legitimate transmitter, the remote control engine starting device issues a request signal to the immobilizer which, in response to the request signal, issues a permit signal to the engine controller.",
        "On the other hand, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H10-81201 discloses a system which, while ensuring security such as theft prevention, allows the engine or the like to be started not only by the use of a legitimate vehicle key but also by an operation from a remote location.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function, wherein security for the vehicle is further enhanced.",
        "According to the present invention, there is provided a remote control engine starting device having an immobilizer and a remote engine starter and equipped with a remote engine starting function for starting an engine when an engine start command is given from a remote location, wherein",
        "the immobilizer comprises an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which gives engine start permission when a remote engine starter code, that the remote engine starter outputs in response to the interrogating signal, matches a remote engine starter verifying code preregistered in the immobilizer, and",
        "the remote engine starter comprises an engine start signal outputting section which outputs a signal related to engine starting, for example, an IG key insertion signal, an IG ON signal, etc., and a code outputting section which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.",
        "The engine start signal outputting section of the remote engine starter outputs the signal related to engine starting when a remote commander code transmitted from a remote commander matches a remote commander verifying code preregistered in the remote engine starter.",
        "In one preferred mode, the immobilizer further comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, and wherein the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when an IG key insertion signal is not received but the signal related to engine starting, other than the IG key insertion signal, is received.",
        "In another preferred mode, the immobilizer further comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, and wherein the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when the key code is not received in response to the activation signal.",
        "According to the present invention, there is also provided a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle having an immobilizer and a remote engine starter and equipped with a remote engine starting function for staring an engine when an engine start command is given from a remote location, wherein",
        "the immobilizer comprises an activation signal outputting section which outputs an activation signal to a key cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which receives a key code output from a key in response to the activation signal, and which gives engine start permission when the key code matches a preregistered code, wherein the immobilizer further comprises an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal, different from the activation signal, when the signal related to engine starting is received, and an engine start permitting section which gives engine start permission when a remote engine starter code that the remote engine starter outputs in response to the interrogating signal matches a remote engine starter verifying code preregistered in the immobilizer, and",
        "the remote engine starter comprises an engine start signal outputting section which outputs a signal related to engine starting when the engine start command is given from a remote location, and a code outputting section which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.",
        "In one preferred mode, the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when an IG key insertion signal is not received but a signal related to engine starting, other than the IG key insertion signal, is received.",
        "In another preferred mode, the immobilizer includes an interrogating signal outputting section which outputs the activation signal and interrogating signal when the signal related to engine starting is received, and which outputs an interrogating signal to the remote engine starter when any key code is not received in response to the activation signal.",
        "In another preferred mode, the immobilizer includes a match/mismatch judging section which outputs the activation signal and interrogating signal when the signal related to engine starting is received, and which, when the key code is received, judges whether the key code matches the preregistered code but, when the \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d is received, then judges whether the \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d matches the preregistered \u201cremote engine starter verifying code\u201d.",
        "The engine start permitting section for giving the engine start permission does not give the engine start permission when the \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d has failed to match the \u201cremote engine starter verifying code\u201d a predetermined number of times.",
        "As described above, according to the present invention, since provisions are made, in remote engine starting, to permit the engine to be started only when the code preregistered in the remote engine starter matches the code preregistered in the immobilizer, the engine cannot be started unless the remote engine starter is a legitimate one, and this serves to enhance the security.",
        "Furthermore, when sending the engine start command from the remote commander, since provisions are made to permit the remote engine starter to be started only when the code preregistered in the remote commander matches the code preregistered in the remote engine starter, the engine cannot be started unless the remote commander that issued the engine start command is a legitimate one. This serves to further enhance the security.",

        "FIG. 1 is a diagram schematically showing the configuration of a remote control engine starting device for a vehicle equipped with an immobilizer function according to the present invention. Reference numeral 1 is an ignition (IG) key having a built-in antenna 12 and a built-in transponder 11 in which a unique code identifying the legitimate key is stored. Reference numeral 2 is a key cylinder, and various switches, such as an accessory switch (ACC) for turning power on and off to accessories (ACC), an ignition (IG) switch for turning power on and off to spark plugs, etc., and a starter switch for turning power on and off to the starter motor, are built into the key cylinder 2. When the IG key 1 is inserted in the key cylinder 2, a key insertion signal is output, and when the IG key 1 is turned therein, an ACC ON signal, an IG ON signal, a starter ON signal, etc. are output to an immobilizer 4, an engine controller 5, and the starter motor 10. Reference numeral 3 is an immobilizer amplifier which amplifies signals output from the IG key 1 and the immobilizer 4, and which is provided with a switch 31 for turning off the operation of the immobilizer amplifier 3.",
        "Reference numeral 5 is the engine controller to which a permit signal is output from the immobilizer 4 when a prescribed condition is satisfied, thus permitting the engine to be started. Reference numeral 6 is a remote engine starter; when a start switch 81 on a remote commander 8 is pressed, a remote engine start signal is transmitted from an antenna 9 and received by an antenna 7 of the remote engine starter 6. The remote engine starter 6, upon receiving this signal, outputs an ignition ON signal (IG ON signal), etc. to the immobilizer 4 and the engine controller 5. In addition to the IG ON signal, the remote engine starter 6 outputs an ACC ON signal, starter ON signal, etc. A stop switch 82 is a switch for stopping the engine.",
        "FIG. 2 is a diagram showing the configuration of the immobilizer 4, the remote engine starter 6, and the remote commander 8, focusing on the codes preregistered in their respective storing means. The immobilizer 4 includes a storing section 41 and a control section 42, and a \u201cmaster key code\u201d 43 and a \u201csub key code 44, unique key codes for identifying the legitimate IG key, are preregistered in the storing section 41. Further, a \u201cremote engine starter verifying code\u201d 45 is preregistered which is a code for verifying whether the remote engine starter according to the present invention is a legitimate one or not.",
        "In the storing means of the remote engine starter 6, there are preregistered a \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d 61, which is a code uniquely identifying the remote engine starter, and a \u201cremote commander verifying code\u201d 62, which is a code for verifying whether the remote commander is a legitimate one or not. On the other hand, a \u201cremote commander code\u201d 83, which is a code uniquely identifying the remote commander, is preregistered in the storing means of the remote commander 8.",
        "The immobilizer 4 comprises an \u201cinterrogating signal outputting section\u201d which outputs an interrogating signal when a signal related to engine starting is received, a \u201cmatch/mismatch judging section\u201d which judges whether the remote engine starter code matches the remote engine starter verifying code and whether the key code output from the key matches the preregistered key code, an \u201cengine start permitting section\u201d which permits the engine to be started when the remote engine starter code matches the remote engine starter verifying code or when the key code output from the key matches the preregistered key code, and an \u201cactivation signal outputting section\u201d which outputs an activation signal to the cylinder when a signal related to engine starting is received.",
        "The remote engine starter comprises an \u201cengine start signal outputting section\u201d which outputs a signal related to engine starting, and a \u201ccode outputting section\u201d which, in response to the interrogating signal, outputs the remote engine starter code preregistered in the remote engine starter.",
        "FIGS. 3A and 3B are waveform diagrams for explaining an anti-theft operation when starting the engine by inserting the IG key 1 in the key cylinder 2. Referring to FIG. 3A, when the IG key 1 is inserted in the key cylinder 2, the IG key insertion signal is set ON and is output to the immobilizer 4. Upon receiving this signal, the immobilizer 4 outputs a pulse-like activation signal to the immobilizer amplifier 3. The immobilizer amplifier 3 is equipped with an antenna (not shown) for receiving the unique key code stored in the transponder 11 built into the IG key 1, and transmits the received key code (KC) to the immobilizer 4 when the activation signal is received. If the received key code (KC) matches either the master key code or the sub key code, the immobilizer 4 gives engine start permission to the engine controller 5, while stopping the output of the activation signal until the IG key is removed from the key cylinder.",
        "The IG ON signal is output with a delay relative to the key insertion signal, because the former is output when the inserted key is turned.",
        "On the other hand, even when the legitimate IG key is inserted, the unique key code may not match the code stored in the immobilizer due to the effect of noise. In that case, the activation signal is re-transmitted. FIG. 3B shows the case where the activation signal is transmitted three times and the key code KC transmitted for the third time is judged to match the stored code.",
        "When the key code is transmitted from the immobilizer amplifier 3 to the immobilizer 4, the immobilizer 4 judges whether the key code matches the master key code or the sub key code shown in FIG. 2 and, if they match, outputs the permit signal to the engine controller 5, thus permitting the engine to be started. On the other hand, if an illegitimate IG key is inserted, the key code that matches the code preregistered in the immobilizer is not output even when the activation signal is transmitted from the immobilizer 4 to the immobilizer amplifier 3. If the key code is not output even when the activation signal has been output a predetermined number of times, it is determined that the inserted key is not a legitimate IG key, and the output of the activation signal is stopped. If a key code different from the one preregistered in the immobilizer 4 is output, the permit signal will not be output from the immobilizer 4 to the engine controller 5.",
        "Next, one example of remote engine starting according to the present invention will be described with reference to the waveforms shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B.

        "When the start switch 81 on the remote commander 8 is pressed, the remote engine start signal is transmitted from the transmitting antenna 9 and received by the receiving antenna 7 of the remote engine starter 6. The signal transmitted from the transmitting antenna 9 contains the \u201cremote commander code\u201d 83 which is the unique code of the remote commander. The remote engine starter 6 receives this signal via the receiving antenna 7 and, if the \u201cremote commander code\u201d 83 matches the \u201cremote commander verifying code\u201d 62 preregistered in the remote engine starter 6, the IG ON signal, etc. as the signals related to engine starting are output from the engine start signal outputting section of the remote engine starter 6 and transmitted to the immobilizer 4 and the engine controller 5.",
        "When the IG ON signal output from the remote engine starter 6 is received by the immobilizer 4, the interrogating signal outputting section of the immobilizer 4 outputs the interrogating signal QS to the remote engine starter 6. At the same time, the activation signal is transmitted to the immobilizer amplifier 3, but no key code is returned because the key is not inserted. The interrogating signal QS is output when the \u201cremote starter verifying code\u201d, is preregistered in the immobilizer 4. When the interrogating signal QS is received by the remote engine starter 6, the code outputting section of the remote engine starter 6 outputs a response signal RS which contains the \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d preregistered in the remote engine starter 6. The immobilizer 4, which received this signal, judges whether the \u201cremote engine starter verifying code\u201d preregistered therein matches the \u201cremote engine starter code\u201d contained in the response signal and, if they match, the engine start permitting section of the immobilizer outputs the permit signal to the engine controller 5, thus permitting the engine to be started. If the remote engine starter 6 is not a legitimate one, the code preregistered therein does not match the \u201cremote engine starter verifying code\u201d preregistered in the immobilizer 4, so that the permit signal will not be output to the engine controller.",

At the same time, the interrogating signal QS is also output, but no response signal is returned because the remote engine starter is not operating. In the case of engine starting by insertion of the key, the IG ON signal, etc. are not output when the key is simply inserted, but are output when the key is turned. However, provisions may be made to output the key insertion signal, the IG ON signal, etc. when the key is turned.",

        "In FIG. 5, when the routine is initiated, it is determined whether an engine start command has been issued or not (S1). When the start switch 81 on the remote commander 8 is pressed, the remote engine start signal is transmitted from the transmitting antenna 9 and received by the receiving antenna 7 of the remote engine starter 6. The remote engine start signal transmitted from the transmitting antenna 9 contains the \u201cremote commander code\u201d which is the unique code of the remote commander. The remote engine starter 6 receives this signal via the receiving antenna 7 and, if this unique code of the remote commander matches the \u201cremote commander verifying code\u201d preregistered in the remote engine starter 6, then it is determined that an engine start command has been issued (Yes).",

Next, it is checked whether or not the interrogating signal is received by the remote engine starter 6 (S3). If the interrogating signal is not received (No), it is checked once again whether the interrogating signal is received or not.",
        "If the interrogating signal is received (Yes in S3), the remote engine starter 6 outputs a response signal to the immobilizer 4 (S4). Next, it is determined whether the interrogating signal is once again received (S5).

        "If the interrogating signal is no longer received (No), then it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, one second, has elapsed from the output of the response signal (S6). If the answer is No, the process returns to S5 to determine whether the interrogating signal is once again received. If the interrogating signal is no longer received after one second has elapsed in S6 (Yes), this means that the response signal was output and the codes were found to match each other, the remote engine starter 6 outputs the starter ON signal to the starter motor 10, the immobilizer 4, and the engine controller 5 for a predetermined length of time, for example, two seconds (S7). Next, it is determined whether a predetermined time, for example, four seconds, has elapsed from the output of the starter signal (S8). If four seconds have elapsed (Yes), it is determined whether the engine has started (S9). If the engine has started (Yes), the engine start process is terminated. Here, the determination is made by checking the output of an alternator L terminal 13 because the output of this terminal being input to the remote engine starter 6 should go to \u201cH\u201d when the engine has started.",
