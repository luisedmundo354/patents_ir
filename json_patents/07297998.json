        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This disclosure relates to semiconductor devices and methods of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to semiconductor devices having a buried and enlarged contact hole and methods of fabricating the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In general, in order to improve a design performance goals such as high integration and high speeds, a semiconductor device is fabricated such that an arrangement of a semiconductor circuit formed on a semiconductor substrate is changed or a certain circuit is added to an existing semiconductor circuit.",
        "High integration is obtained by reducing a design rule, and through this reduction a high speed can be implemented. Reduction of a design rule involves decreasing the size of a pitch between components of a semiconductor device. However, due to the reduction of the design rule, a photolithography process may not be stably performed on a semiconductor substrate. This is because light passing through a photo mask during a photolithography process causes more severe dispersion and interference on a semiconductor substrate having a photo resist film than before the reduction of a design rule.",
        "Changing the arrangement of the semiconductor circuit to improve a design performance adds an extra burden to a fabricating process because the photolithography process condition should be set again before and after a circuit arrangement changes in consideration of a process margin between a cell array region and a peripheral circuit region. Adding the certain circuit to the existing semiconductor circuit requires a previous work that makes out a design rule of a desired semiconductor device and then trains again an engineer portions to be monitored a semiconductor substrate. Therefore, methods of changing the arrangement of the semiconductor circuit and adding the certain circuit to the existing semiconductor circuit need much efforts and time of engineers related to fabrication of a semiconductor device.",
        "Recently, many resolutions to increase a design performance by using a semiconductor fabrication process have been suggested. Such resolutions relate to introducing a new material or changing a shape of components of a semiconductor device. Introducing new material decreases a resistance of the circuit wire, thereby improving a wiring capability of a semiconductor device. Changing a shape of components of a semiconductor device maximizes an electrical capability of components, thereby doubling the driving ability of a semiconductor device.",
        "On the other hand, U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2002-79536 to Takashi Terauchi et al. disclosed a semiconductor device that improves design performance by changing the shape of components of a semiconductor device.",
        "According to the U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2002-79536, the semiconductor device comprises lower and upper interlayer insulating layers sequentially placed on a semiconductor substrate, and two adjacent wires are placed between the lower and upper interlayer insulating layers. The lower and upper interlayer insulating layers are oxide films, and each of the wires has a silicon nitride layer pattern, a conductive layer pattern, and a capping layer pattern that are stacked in sequence. The wires can be used as bit line wires in a DRAM cell array region. Spacers are placed on side walls of the wires, and the spacers and the capping layer pattern are silicon nitride layers.",
        "Next, a first contact hole is placed to be self-aligned between the wires by penetrating a predetermined region of the lower and upper interlayer insulating layers, exposing a portion of the semiconductor substrate. By using the first contact hole, the lower and upper interlayer insulating layers are wet-etched to form a second contact hole having a diameter larger than a distance between the wires. Here, the conductive layer pattern is not exposed by the wet etching process and is subsequently surrounded by the silicon nitride layer pattern, the capping layer pattern, and the spacers. A contact plug is placed to fill the second contact hole, and the contact plug is a conductive layer. Therefore, the semiconductor device having the second contact hole can reduce a contact resistance between the contact plug and the semiconductor substrate compared with a case having the first contact hole.",
        "However, when the size of a pitch between the two wires is reduced due to reduction of a design rule of the semiconductor device, it is difficult to lower a contact resistance between the contact plug and the semiconductor substrate by using the second contact hole. Also, since the first contact hole is formed by using the spacers placed on the side walls of the wires, it is more difficult to form second contact hole having the diameter larger than the distance between the wires.",
        "Embodiments of the invention address these and other disadvantages of the conventional art.",
        "According to some embodiments of the invention, there is provided semiconductor devices having a buried and enlarged contact hole and methods of fabricating the same. The buried and enlarged contact hole is a contact hole having a diameter larger than a distance between bit lines. The semiconductor device having the buried and enlarged contact hole can decrease the contact resistance between a landing pad and a buried and enlarged contact hole plug, improving design performance.",
        "Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the detailed description that follows when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals denote like parts.",
        "FIG. 1 is a plan view illustrating a semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the invention.",
        "FIGS. 2 and 3 are cross-sectional views taken along lines I-I\u2032 and II-II\u2032 of FIG. 1, respectively.",
        "FIGS. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 are cross-sectional views illustrating a process of fabricating the semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the invention, taken along line I-I\u2032 of FIG. 1.",
        "FIGS. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 are cross-sectional views illustrating a process of fabricating the semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the invention, taken along line II-II\u2032 of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 1 is a plan view illustrating a semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the invention. FIGS. 2 and 3 are cross-sectional views taken along lines I-I\u2032 and II-II\u2032 of FIG. 1, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, a trench isolation layer 103 is placed on a predetermined region of a semiconductor substrate 100 to define an active region 106. A gate insulating layer 110 is formed over the semiconductor substrate 100 having the trench isolation layer 103 and the active region 106. Two adjacent gate patterns 120 are placed on the gate insulating layer 110 to traverse the active regions 106. Gate spacers 126 cover side walls of the gate patterns 120. Each of the gate patterns 120 includes a gate 113 and a gate capping layer pattern 116 stacked thereon. The gate 113 comprises an N-doped poly silicon layer, and the gate capping layer pattern 116 and the gate spacer 126 include a silicon nitride layer.",
        "Next, a pad interlayer insulating layer 129 is placed to cover side walls of the gate spacers 126, filling a gap region between the gate patterns 120. The pad interlayer insulating layer 129 includes an oxide layer having an etching selectivity ratio different from the trench isolation layer 103. Pad holes 130 are placed in a predetermined region between the gate patterns 120 to penetrate the pad interlayer insulating layer 129 and the gate insulating layer 110, thereby exposing a portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. The pad holes 130 are filled with landing pads 133. The landing pads 133 include an N-doped poly silicon layer. A bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 covers the semiconductor substrate 100 having the landing pads 133, and bit line patterns 143 are placed on the bit line interlayer insulating 136. Each of the bit line patterns 143 includes a bit line 139 and a bit line capping layer pattern 141 stacked thereon. The bit line 139 includes an N-doped poly silicon layer, a polycide layer or a metal layer, and the bit line capping layer pattern 141 includes a silicon nitride layer.",
        "Subsequently, a buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 covers the semiconductor substrate 100 having the bit line patterns 143. The buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 includes an oxide layer having an etching selectivity ratio different from the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136. Here, the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 has a low etching selectivity ratio to the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136. Buried and enlarged contact holes 153 are placed in a predetermined region between the bit line patterns 143 to penetrate the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 and the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136. Each of the buried and enlarged contact holes 153 exposes at least one of side walls of the two bit line patterns 143 adjacent thereto and an upper surface of the landing pad 133. The at least one bit line pattern 143 exposed in the buried and enlarged contact hole 153 is smaller in width than a non-exposed bit line pattern surrounded by the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146. Buried and enlarged contact hole spacers 156 cover side walls of the buried and enlarged contact holes 153. The buried and enlarged contact hole 153 surrounded by the buried and enlarged contact hole spacers 156 is filled with buried and enlarged contact hole plugs 160.

FIGS. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 are cross-sectional views illustrating a process of fabricating the semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the invention, taken along line II-II\u2032 of FIG. 1, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1, 4 and 5, a trench isolation layer 103 is formed on a predetermined region of a semiconductor substrate 100, thereby isolating an active region 106. A gate insulating layer 110 is formed over the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate 100 having the trench isolation layer 103. Two gate patterns 120 are formed adjacent to each other on the gate insulating layer 110. Each of the gate patterns 120 is formed from a gate 113 and a gate capping layer pattern 116 stacked in sequence. Here, the gate patterns 120 are formed to go through the active region 106. Next, impurity ions are doped by using the gate patterns 120 as an ion implant mask to form impurity regions 123, i.e., source and drain regions, in the semiconductor substrate 100. The gate 113 is formed of an N-doped poly silicon layer or a polycide layer, and the gate capping layer pattern 116 is formed of a silicon nitride layer. Also, the gate insulating layer 1 10 is formed of an oxide layer. Subsequently, gate spacers 126 are formed on side walls of the gate patterns 120, and then pad interlayer insulating layers 129 are formed to fill a gap region of the gate patterns 1 20 and expose upper surfaces of the gate capping layer patterns 116. The gate spacers 126 are formed of a silicon nitride layer. The pad interlayer insulating layer 129 and the gate insulating layer 110 are etched to form pad holes 130 that penetrate a predetermined region between the gate patterns 120. Landing pads 133 are formed to fill the pad holes 130. The pad interlayer insulating layer 129 is formed of an oxide layer, and the landing pads 133 are formed of a N-doped poly silicon layer.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1, and 6 to 9, a bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 is formed over the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate 100 having the landing pads 133. A bit line layer 138 and a bit line capping layer 140 are sequentially formed on the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136. By using the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 as an etching buffer layer, the bit line layer 138 and the bit line capping layer 140 are patterned into bit line patterns 143 through a photolithography and etching processes. Each of the bit line patterns 143 is formed from a bit line 139 and a bit line capping layer pattern 141 stacked thereon. The bit line patterns 143 are formed in a direction perpendicular to the gate patterns 120. Also, the bit line patterns 143 are formed on the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 corresponding to portions between the landing pads 133. The bit line 139 is formed of an N-doped poly silicon layer, a polycide layer or a metal layer, and the bit line capping layer pattern 141 is formed of a silicon nitride layer. The bit line 139 has an etching selectivity ratio different from the landing pads 133.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 and 10-13, a buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 is formed over the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate 100 having the bit line patterns 143. The buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 is formed of an oxide layer having an etching selectivity ratio different to the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136. Here, the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 is preferably formed of an oxide layer having an etching selectivity ratio higher than the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146. Then, buried contact holes 149 are formed in the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 and the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 by a photolithography and etching processes. The buried contact holes 149 are formed in predetermined regions between the bit line patterns 143 to expose the landing pads 133. The buried contact holes 149 are self-aligned contact holes formed by using the bit line patterns 146.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 and 14-17, the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 and the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 are etched through the buried contact hole 149 to thereby form enlarged contact holes 150. Here, each of the enlarged contact holes 150 exposes at least one of side walls of the two bit line patterns 143 adjacent thereto. In the etching process for forming the enlarged contact hole 150, the bit line pattern 143 has the same etching selectivity ratio as the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 and the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136, and the enlarged contact holes 150 are isotropically etched by using a wet- or a dry-etching technique. Here, since at least one of the bit line patterns 143 is etched, a diameter of each of the enlarged contact holes 150 is larger than a distance between the bit line patterns 143 adjacent thereto.",
        "Next, the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146 and the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 are sequentially etched through the enlarged contact holes 150 to thereby form buried and enlarged contact holes 153. The buried and enlarged contact holes 153 are formed by further removing one side portion of the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 below the bit line pattern 143. The etching process through the enlarged contact holes 150 is performed by using an isotropic etching technique and has an etching selectivity ratio to the bit line interlayer insulating layer 136 higher than the bit line pattern 143 and the buried contact interlayer insulating layer 146. Therefore, the buried and enlarged contact holes 153 are contact holes that are etched by a specified amount A more than the enlarged contact holes 150. Also, the etching process for forming the buried and enlarged contact holes 153 can be isotropically performed by a wet or a dry etching technique. The buried and enlarged contact hole 153 is larger in diameter than the enlarged contact hole 150, and the enlarged contact hole 150 is larger in diameter than the buried contact hole.",
        "Buried and enlarged contact hole spacers 156 are formed to cover side walls of the buried and enlarged contact holes 153. The buried and enlarged contact hole spacers 156 are formed of the same insulating layer as the gate spacer 126, such as a silicon nitride layer.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 and 18-21, a buried and enlarged contact hole plug layer 159 is formed to fill the buried and enlarged contact holes 153 surrounded by the buried and enlarged contact hole spacers 156 and cover an upper surface of the buried contact interlayer insulating 146. The buried and enlarged contact hole plug layer 159 is formed of an N-doped poly silicon layer. Next, the buried and enlarged contact hole plug layer 156 is etched to thereby form buried and enlarged contact hole plugs 160 that fill the buried and enlarged contact holes 153. Here, the buried and enlarged contact hole plugs 160 are electrically connected to the landing pads 133 through the buried and enlarged contact holes 153.",
        "As described herein before, the invention discloses the buried and enlarged contact holes formed in predetermined regions between the bit line patterns suitable for coping with reductions of a design rule. Each of the buried and enlarged contact holes has a diameter larger than a distance between the two adjacent bit line patterns. Therefore, since the semiconductor device having the buried and enlarged contact holes can maintain the same contact resistance between the buried contact hole plugs and the landing pads as before the reduction of the design rule and thus can meet a design performance that requires a high integration and a high speed.",
