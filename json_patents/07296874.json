        "This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(a) on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-306881 filed on Aug. 29, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "A serial inkjet recording apparatus which incorporate a nozzle head having nozzles has conventionally been known wherein ink is ejected from the nozzles while the nozzle head is moved in the width direction of a recording medium, whereby recording on the recording medium is performed (see, for example, the publication of Japanese Patent No. 2875636). An inkjet recording apparatus which incorporates a line head having nozzles arranged to cover the entire width of a recording medium in view of higher recording rate has conventionally been known wherein recording is performed without moving the head. (For example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-52910.)",
        "In the inkjet recording apparatuses, ink remaining on a nozzle surface is sometimes condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity. In other cases, dust, or the like, is adhered on the nozzle surface. Accordingly, the nozzle surface is contaminated during continuous recording by ink ejection. Thus, in the inkjet recording apparatuses, it is necessary to periodically clean the nozzle surface. For example, a recording apparatus disclosed in the publication of Japanese Patent No. 2875636 has a blade for wiping the nozzle surface and an absorber attached to the nozzle surface for absorbing ink adhered on the blade.",
        "The ink (including the dust, or the like) remaining on the nozzle surface can be collected by wiping the nozzle surface with the blade. However, the remaining ink is sometimes squeezed into nozzles by the wiping operation. Especially, the recording apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.10-52910 has an elongated line head, and therefore, a large amount of remaining ink is collected by wiping the nozzle surface with the blade in the longitudinal direction. Accordingly, the possibility that the remaining ink is squeezed into the nozzles increases.",
        "The present invention was conceived in view of the above problems. An objective of the present invention is to surely clean a nozzle surface of an inkjet recording apparatus.",
        "An inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention is an apparatus for ejecting ink through nozzles onto a recording medium.",
        "The recording apparatus comprises: a nozzle head including a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; and an absorber which abuts the nozzle surface to absorb ink adhered on the nozzle surface.",
        "A portion of the absorber which corresponds to openings of the nozzles is removed such that the absorber abuts the nozzle surface except for a region near the nozzles.",
        "With this structure including the absorber, ink adhered on the nozzle surface of the nozzle head is absorbed by the absorber. Thus, the blade does not collect a large amount of remaining ink when it wipes the nozzle surface. Therefore, squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles is suppressed.",
        "A portion of the absorber which corresponds to the openings of the nozzles is removed, such that the absorber abuts the nozzle surface except for a region near the nozzles. If the absorber should abut an opening of a nozzle, the absorber would absorb ink inside the nozzle head. However, according to the present invention, the absorber does not abut an opening of a nozzle, and therefore, such absorption of ink inside the nozzle head is prevented.",
        "Another inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention comprises: a nozzle head including a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; a blade for wiping the nozzle surface; and an absorber which abuts the nozzle surface to absorb ink adhered on the nozzle surface.",
        "The absorber abuts the nozzle surface to absorb the ink before a wiping operation of the blade.",
        "With this structure, ink adhered on the nozzle surface of the nozzle head is absorbed by the absorber before the blade wipes the nozzle surface. Thus, the blade does not collect a large amount of remaining ink when it wipes the nozzle surface. Therefore, squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles is suppressed.",
        "Still another inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention comprises: a line head including two or more nozzle heads arranged along the width direction of the recording medium, each of the nozzle heads having a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; a blade for wiping the nozzle surface; and an absorber which surrounds the nozzle heads of the line head.",
        "In a line head including a plurality of nozzle heads arranged side by side, ink remains in a gap between adjacent nozzle heads. The ink is sometimes condensed to have high concentration and high viscosity and sticks to the blade again. In this case, if the blade onto which the remaining ink has stuck is used in a wiping operation, the nozzle surface can be contaminated the remaining ink, or the remaining ink can be squeezed into the nozzles.",
        "In the inkjet recording apparatus having the above structure of the present invention, the remaining ink is absorbed by the absorber which surrounds each nozzle head. With this feature, contamination of the nozzle surface and squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles are prevented.",

The recording apparatus A is capable of color printing with four colors of ink.",
        "A recording medium 12 is transferred under the inkjet heads 11 in a predetermined transfer direction (X direction) by a plurality of rollers 12a. The recording medium 12 may be provided in the form of a roll of paper (not shown) such that paper (recording medium 12) is fed from the roll.",
        "Each inkjet head 11 extends in the width direction (Y direction) of the recording medium 12. The four inkjet heads 11 are arranged along X direction in parallel to each other with predetermined intervals.",
        "Each inkjet head 11 has a line head 4 which extends in Y direction as shown in FIGS. 1 and 5. The line head 4 has a plurality of nozzles 44 for ejecting ink and a plurality of piezoelectric actuators (not shown in FIGS. 1 and 5) for expelling the ink from the nozzles 44. The nozzles 44 are distributed over the entire width of the recording medium 12.",
        "As described above, each inkjet head 11 has the nozzles 44 distributed over the entire width of the recording medium 12. Thus, in a recording operation, ink is ejected from predetermined nozzles 44 at predetermined timings while the recording medium 12 is transferred in the transfer direction. That is, a desired image can be formed on the recording medium 12 over the entire width thereof (e.g., JIS: A2 width) without moving the inkjet heads 11 along the width direction of the recording medium 12.",
        "The recording apparatus A includes four purge units 5 for cleaning the line heads 4 of the inkjet heads 11. These purge units 5 are placed at external positions which deviate in Y direction from the transfer position of the recording medium 12. The plurality of purge units 5 are installed along X direction in parallel to each other with predetermined intervals so as to correspond to the inkjet heads 11. Details of the structure of the purge units 5 will be described later.",
        "Each inkjet head 11 is supported by a ball screw 16 and a linear guide 17 which extend in Y direction. The ball screw 16 is rotated by a motor 18 which is attached to an end of the ball screw 16. The motor 18 rotates the ball screw 16, whereby the inkjet head 11 reciprocates along Y direction while being guided by the ball screw 16 and the linear guide 17. In this way, each inkjet head 11 moves between a recording position which is the transfer position of the recording medium 12 and a cleaning position which is the position where the purge unit 5 is provided. The four ball screws 16 are rotated by separate motors 18. Thus, each of the four inkjet heads 11 is capable of independently moving between the recording position and the cleaning position.",
        "Each inkjet head 11 is supported by the linear guide 17 and the ball screw 16 through a first rotation stage 11a which rotates around Z axis (extending in the vertical direction) and a second rotation stage 11b which rotates around X axis. The first rotation stage 11a adjusts the inclination of the line head 4 with respect to the width direction of the recording medium 12. The second rotation stage 11b adjusts the inclination of a line head bottom surface (nozzle surface) with respect to the recording surface of the recording medium 12. Since each line head 4 has an elongated shape, the distance between the nozzle surface and the recording medium changes due to the inclination of the line head 4 with respect to the surface of the recording medium 12. As a result, ink falls on a displaced position. Further, since a plurality of line heads 4 which eject different colors of inks are provided in parallel to each other along the transfer direction of the recording medium 12, a positional displacement is caused between the heads with respect to the recording medium 12, and as a result, color misalignment is caused. In view of such, the inclination of each line head 4 with respect to the recording medium 12 is adjusted by the first and second rotation stages 11a and 11b. With such a feature, an ink droplet falls onto a desired position over the recording medium 12, while displacement of the positions of ink droplets among a plurality of inkjet heads 11 is prevented. As a result, the image quality is improved.",
        "The recording apparatus A has four ink tanks 13. The four ink tanks 13 include the ink tank 13 for containing black ink, the ink tank 13 for containing yellow ink, the ink tank 13 for containing magenta ink and the ink tank 13 for containing cyan ink. The four inkjet heads 11 and the four ink tanks 13 are connected on a one-to-one basis through ink tubes 13a. Ink contained in the ink tanks 13 are supplied to the inkjet heads 11 through the ink tubes 13a.",
        "The recording apparatus A has a power control box 14. The inkjet heads 11 and the power control box 14 are connected through transmission lines 14a. The power control box 14 supplies electric power and a control signal to each inkjet head 11. The power control box 14 also supplies a control signal to each motor 18 attached to an end of the ball screw 16.",
        "The recording apparatus A has an air supply 15. The inkjet heads 11 and the air supply 15 are connected through air tubes 15a. The air supply 15 supplies dry air to the inkjet heads 11. Supply of the dry air increases the lifespan of a piezoelectric actuator, i.e., the period that a piezoelectric actuator (piezoelectric element) normally operates, as will be described later.",
        "The ink tubes 13a, the transmission lines 14a and the air tubes 15a are fixed by a fixing element at an intermediate position and tied in a bundle before being connected to the inkjet heads 11. With such a structure, interference between the reciprocating inkjet heads 11 and the tubes and transmission lines is avoided.",

With such supply of dry air, occurrence of a major defect in the piezoelectric element 67b is prevented. The piezoelectric element 67b has a large number of defects, such as very small cracks and holes, or the like. If a high electric field is applied to the piezoelectric element 67b in the presence of moisture, a large electric current flows through a lead compound at a defect and the vicinity thereof, so that the defect area is broken by Joule heat to form a large hole.

In the head box 3 having such a structure, connection of the electric system and connections of the ink system and air system are established when the head box 3 is vertically (one-directionally) moved to the main box 2.",
        "FIG. 12 shows a different example where the connectors 47a and the couplers 48c and 49b are all provided on the back surface of the head box 3. Also in the head box 3 of this example, the couplers are preferably provided at a level lower than the connectors 47a as shown. In the head box 3 having such a structure, connection of the electric system and connections of the ink system and air system are established when the head box 3 is horizontally (one-directionally) moved to the main box 2.",
        "(Structure of Electric Circuit)",
        "FIG. 13 shows a structure of an electric circuit of each inkjet head 11. As described above, the head box 3 includes the driver boards 45 attached to the head base 41 and the relaying boards 47 to which the driver boards 45 are connected through the FPC 45a. Although only one driver board 45 is shown in FIG. 13, the number of the driver boards 45 is actually equal to that of the nozzle heads 6. Although only one relaying board 47 is shown in FIG. 13, there are two relaying boards 47 provided in an actual device.",
        "The main box 2 includes a main board 81 having a connector 84 in the circuit section 21. The main board 81 includes a control board 82, a D/A converter board 83 and an amplifier board 7. The control board 82 includes an optical conversion board 82a which receives a light signal from the power control box 14 to output a head control signal and a piezoelectric board 82a for outputting head driving waveform data. The D/A converter board 83 D/A-converts the head driving waveform data. The amplifier board 7 amplifies the head driving waveform data. The connector 84 of the main board 81 is coupled to the connector 47a of the head box 3.",
        "FIG. 14 shows circuit components necessary for one nozzle head 6 (including a plurality of piezoelectric actuators 67). The head driving waveform data output from the control board 82 is input to an operational amplifier 71 of the amplifier circuit 7 through the D/A converter 83 and amplified by the operational amplifier 71. FIG. 15 shows an example of driving voltage and current waveforms of the nozzle head 6. In the inkjet head 11 of this embodiment, the voltage waveform of high voltage (V0: generally 30 V or higher) and high slew rate (\u0394V/\u0394t: in FIG. 15, V0/\u0394t) is necessary in view of the ejection characteristics of ink. Thus, the operational amplifier 71 used in the amplifier circuit 7 has to achieve a high voltage and a high slew rate. Therefore, there are only a limited number of types of such amplifiers. For example, a large CAN-type operational amplifier 71a shown in FIG. 16 or a vertically mounted operational amplifier 71b of a resin mold type shown in FIG. 22 can be employed.",
        "Each piezoelectric actuator 67 of the nozzle head 6 functions as a capacitor. Thus, it is necessary to supply a large electric current (A0) to the nozzle head 6 in order to drive a large number of piezoelectric actuators at one time (see the current waveform of FIG. 15). To this end, a current buffer (emitter follower type) which includes pnp-type and npn-type transistors 72 is connected to the operational amplifier 71. The electric current is amplified by this current buffer, and a head driving waveform is input to the driver circuit. The heat value of the transistors 72 which constitute the current buffer is relatively large, and therefore, a large heat sink 73 is necessary for cooling the transistors 72. The power supplies (+V1, \u2212V2, +V3, \u2212V4) connected to the operational amplifier 71 or the current buffer may be provided inside the main box 2. Alternatively, the power supplies may be provided outside the main box 2. (In this case, for example, electric power can be supplied through a transmission line to the operational amplifier 71 or the current buffer.)",
        "The driver circuit 45 receives a head control signal from the control circuit 82. The driver circuit 45 selectively supplies a head driving waveform to the piezoelectric actuators 67 based on the head control signal.",
        "Thus, one large operational amplifier and one large heat sink are necessary for one nozzle head 6, and these components have to be mounted on the amplifier board 7. A relaying board 47 to which a large number of nozzle heads 6 (driver circuits 45) are connected is connected to the amplifier board 7. Accordingly, sets of the large operational amplifier 71 and the current buffer including a large heat sink have to be mounted on one amplifier board 7 as much as the number of the nozzle heads 6 connected to the relaying board 47. As a result, the size (area) of the amplifier board 7 disadvantageously increases.",
        "In view of the above, this embodiment achieves reduction in the size (area) of the amplifier board 7 by employing the structure described below. FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate a board arrangement of the amplifier board 7 where a CAN-type operational amplifier 71a is employed. It should be noted that, in FIG. 16, illustration of electrolytic capacitors, connectors, etc., which are to be mounted on the amplifier board 7, is omitted.",
        "In the case where a large number of large operational amplifiers 71a and large heat sinks 73 are mounted on a substrate, the increase in size (area) of the substrate cannot be avoided. Thus, according to this embodiment, the operational amplifiers 71a and the heat sinks 73 are vertically stacked on when they are mounted on the substrate. Specifically, a large number of operational amplifiers 71a (15 amplifiers 71a in the example of FIG. 16) are arranged over the amplifier board 7. At this step, the operational amplifiers 71a, each of which has a rhombic shape, are arranged such that the long diagonal line has an angle with the row direction. With such an arrangement, the arrangement efficiency is high as compared with a case where the operational amplifiers 71a are arranged such that the long diagonal line is in parallel to the row direction. Thus, the area of the amplifier board 7 can be reduced.",
        "The heat sink 73 has a cut-away recess 73a at the lower end as shown in FIG. 18. The heat sink 73 is provided over the operational amplifier 71a such that the operational amplifier 71a is placed in the recess 73a. With such a structure, interference between the operational amplifier 71a and the heat sink 73 is avoided. On a side surface of each heat sink 73, two transistors 72 which constitute a current buffer are provided.",
        "As described above, the large operational amplifier 71a and the large heat sink 73 are vertically stacked, whereby the size (area) of the amplifier board 7 is decreased.",
        "(Variation 1)",
        "FIG. 19 shows an amplifier board 7 of variation 1. The amplifier board of FIG. 19 is the same as the amplifier board of FIG. 17 in that an operational amplifier 71a and a heat sink 73 are vertically stacked. However, the amplifier board 7 of variation 1 (FIG. 19) is different from the amplifier board of FIG. 17 in that the heat sink 73 does not have a recess 73a. In the amplifier board 7 of variation 1, the heat sink 73 is fixed to the board 7 through spacers 74 provided at both sides of the operational amplifier 71a. (In FIG. 19, the spacer 74 provided at one side of the operational amplifier 71a is only shown, while illustration of the spacer 74 provided at the other side is omitted.) In variation 1, the heat sink 73 is indirectly fixed to the amplifier board 7, whereas the heat sink 73 is directly fixed to the amplifier board 7 in the case where the heat sink 73 has a recess 73a. Thus, the heat sink 73 having a recess 73a is preferable in view of the stability of fixation of the heat sink 73.",
        "(Variation 2)",
        "FIGS. 20 and 21 show an amplifier board 7 of variation 2. In this example, CAN-type operational amplifiers 71a are mounted on sub boards 75 which are different from the amplifier board 7, and the sub boards 75 are vertically distributed over the amplifier board 7. With such a structure, the operational amplifiers 71a and the heat sinks 73 are arranged in parallel to each other along a horizontal direction. Since the operational amplifiers 71a and the heat sinks 73 are arranged in parallel to each other along a horizontal direction, the thickness of the heat sinks 73 has to be adjusted. Each heat sink 73 has an elongated shape and is common among a plurality of current buffers (transistors 72) in FIG. 20, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Every one of the current buffers may be provided with one heat sink 73 as shown in FIG. 16.",
        "(Variation 3)",
        "As described above, a possible candidate of the operational amplifier 71 other than the CAN-type amplifier is a resin mold type operational amplifier 71b shown in FIG. 22. This operational amplifier 71b is of vertical mount type and has a relatively large heat value. Thus, a heat sink 76 is necessary. In this case, if the heat sink 73 of the transistor 72 and the heat sink 76 of the operational amplifier 71b are separately provided as shown in FIG. 22A, the heat sink 73 and the heat sink 76 cannot be placed in the vicinity of each other because of fixation of the legs of the heat sinks 73 and 76 on the board. Thus, this arrangement is disadvantageous as to the installation space. In addition, the number of legs of the heat sinks 73 and 76 increases, and therefore, this structure is disadvantageous as to routing of the board pattern. In view of such, the heat sinks 73 of the transistors 72 and the heat sink 76 of the operational amplifier 71b may be integrated as shown in FIG. 22B. With such a structure, it is possible to adjacently position the transistors 72 and the operational amplifier 71b in the vicinity of each other, and such an arrangement is advantageous in reduction of the size of the amplifier board 7. In addition, the number of the legs of the heat sink 76 is reduced, whereby this structure is also advantageous as to routing of the board pattern.",
        "(Fuse Blow Detection Circuit)",
        "As shown in FIG. 14, a collector of each of the transistors 72 which constitute a current buffer has a fuse 72a for opening a circuit on the occurrence of an overcurrent. The amplifier board 7 has an output detection circuit 85 for detecting an output from the amplifier board 7 to the driver circuit 45. A result of the detection is fed back to the control circuit 82.",
        "As described above, in the case where the number of actuators to be driven is small (i.e., in the case where the number of nozzles from which ink is ejected is small), a required current value is small. Further, the operational amplifier 71 can provide an output if it has a small current value. Thus, in an emitter follower type current buffer, a head driving waveform is output to the driver circuit 45 through a base of the transistor 72 when the current value is small even if the fuse 72a is open. As a result, a fuse blow cannot be detected even when the output detection circuit 85 is provided.",
        "In view of such, a fuse blow detection circuit 86 for detecting a fuse blow in the transistor 72 is provided separately from the output detection circuit 85. A result of the detection is input to the control circuit 82. With such a structure, a fuse blow is surely detected even when the number of nozzles that eject ink is small.",
        "(Structure of Purge Unit)",
        "In an inkjet recording apparatus, ink remaining on an ink ejection surface of the nozzle plate 43 (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cnozzle surface 43a\u201d) is condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity. Accordingly, there is a possibility that the condensed ink causes clogging of the nozzles 44 or contamination of the recording medium 12. Thus, it is necessary to periodically clean the nozzle surface 43a, and to this end, a general inkjet recording apparatus has a cleaner.",
        "As described above, the recording apparatus of this embodiment includes four purge units 5 (see FIGS. 1 and 2). These purge units 5 are provided at cleaning positions (external positions which deviate from the transfer position of the recording medium 12 in Y direction orthogonal to the transfer direction of the recording medium 12) with predetermined equal intervals along the transfer direction (X direction) of the recording medium 12. That is, the four purge units 5 are positioned according to the arrangement of the four inkjet heads 11. The purge units 5 are provided at a level lower than the inkjet heads 11.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 23 and 24, each purge unit 5 has a frame 51 extending in Y direction, a plurality of caps 52 supported by the frame 51, and a suction pump (not shown).",
        "The caps 52 correspond to the nozzle plates 43 included in the inkjet heads 11 (see FIG. 28) and are arranged along Y direction. It should be noted that, in FIG. 23 (and FIG. 28), some of the caps 52 included in the purge unit 5 (the nozzle plates 43 included in inkjet heads) are not shown, so that the number of caps 52 shown in FIG. 23 is not equal to the number of caps 52 (and the number of nozzle plates 43) shown in FIG. 1. In this way, the caps 52 are provided to correspond to the nozzle plates 43, whereby the size of the caps 52 is decreased. As a result, each cap 52 is readily brought into close contact with the nozzle surface. (As will be described later, pressure leakage rarely occurs when the inside of the cap 52 is decompressed.)",
        "Each cap 52 has a box-like shape with the upper face opened. The cap 52 has a through hole 52a which penetrates the bottom of the cap 52. The through hole 52a of each cap 52 is connected to the suction pump.",
        "Each purge unit 5 is supported and vertically moved by a linear actuator 53 as shown in FIG. 25. With this structure, the state of the purge unit 5 alternately changes between the cleaning state where each cap 52 is in close contact with the nozzle surface 43a of the inkjet head 11 at the cleaning position and the retreat state where the cap 52 is physically separate from the nozzle surface 43a.",
        "The linear actuator 53 is supported by a fine adjustment stage 54 and a rotation stage 55 which are vertically stacked. The fine adjustment stage 54 moves by a minuscule distance along the X-axis direction. The rotation stage 55 rotates around the Z-axis. With this structure, the purge unit 5 is movable by a minuscule distance along the X-axis direction and is rotatable around the Z-axis. As described above, the inclination of each inkjet head 11 with respect to the recording medium 12 is adjusted by the first and second rotation stages 11a and 11b. The fine adjustment stage 54 and the rotation stage 55 adjust the position and inclination of the purge unit 5 according to the adjusted inclination of the inkjet head 11. With such a structure, when the purge unit 5 is in the cleaning state, the upper opening of each cap 52 of the purge unit 5 is in close contact with the nozzle surface 43a of a corresponding inkjet head 11, whereby the cleaning operation is surely performed.",
        "The purge unit 5 has a wiping member 56 for wiping the nozzle surface 43a in a longitudinal direction as shown in FIGS. 1 and 25. In the example described herein, the wiping member 56 is a blade made of an elastic material. The blade 56 is provided to stand upright at a longitudinal end of the frame which is closer to the recording medium 12. When the purge unit 5 is lifted (but not up to a level where the cap 52 abuts the nozzle surface 43a), a tip of the blade 56 abuts the nozzle surface 43a. The inkjet head 11 is moved relatively to the purge unit 5 while the blade 56 abuts the nozzle surface 43a, whereby the blade 56 wipes the nozzle surface 43a in a longitudinal direction to remove ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a. Ink remaining around a nozzle is removed by suction while the nozzle surface 43a is covered with the cap 52 before the blade 56 wipes the nozzle surface 43a.",
        "Since the inkjet head 11 (line head 4) has an elongated shape, a large amount of ink is recovered by wiping the nozzle surface 43a with the blade 56. Thus, there is a possibility that the ink recovered by the blade 56 is squeezed into the nozzles 44 by the wiping operation of the blade 56.",
        "In view of the above possibility, the purge unit 5 has an absorber 57 for absorbing ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a as shown in FIGS. 23 and 24. This absorber 57 is supported by the frame 51 and provided to surround the cap 52. In other words, a portion of the absorber 57 which corresponds to the opening of the nozzle 44 is removed, and the cap 52 is provided at the portion from which the absorber 57 has been removed. When the purge unit 5 is in the cleaning state where the cap 52 is in close contact with the nozzle surface 43a, the absorber 57 abuts the nozzle surface 43a. With such a structure, the absorber 57 absorbs ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a (except for a portion covered with the cap 52) before the nozzle surface 43a is wiped with the blade 56.",
        "The absorber 57 may be any material capable of absorbing ink. For example, the absorber 57 may be a porous member.",
        "Next, the cleaning operation of the purge unit 5 for cleaning the nozzle surface 43a is described with reference to FIG. 25. If the inkjet head 11 is moved to the cleaning position (step P21 of FIG. 25), the purge unit 5 is then lifted up by the linear actuator 53, such that the nozzle surface 43a is covered with the cap 52 (step P22 of FIG. 25). Then, suction means (not shown) is activated while the nozzle surface 43a is covered with the cap 52. As a result, the inside of the closed cap 52 results in a negative pressure state, so that ink adhered in the vicinity of the opening of the nozzle 44 is removed.",
        "At the above step, the absorber 57 provided around the cap 52 abuts the nozzle surface 43a, so that ink adhered on a portion of the nozzle surface 43a which is not covered with the cap 52 is absorbed by the absorber 57.",
        "After the ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a has been removed by using the cap 52, the suction means, and the absorber 57, the purge unit 5 is lowered by the linear actuator 53 by a predetermined height (step P23 of FIG. 25). With this state, the inkjet head 11 is moved to a recording position (step P24 of FIG. 25), whereby the tip of the blade 56 wipes the nozzle surface 43a in a longitudinal direction. Thus, cleaning of the inkjet head 11 is completed.",
        "The purge unit 5 of the recording apparatus A is provided at an external position of the recording medium 12 in a width direction (Y direction) and extends along Y direction along with a corresponding one of the inkjet heads 11. The recording apparatus A moves each inkjet head 11 along the longitudinal direction between a recording position and a cleaning position. With this structure, the size of the recording apparatus A in the transfer direction of the recording medium 12 (X direction) is decreased.",
        "Each of the four inkjet heads 11 can independently moved between the recording position and the cleaning position as described above. For example, it is possible that some of the four inkjet heads 11 which need cleaning are moved to the cleaning position to be cleaned whereas the other inkjet heads 11 remain at the recording position. Alternatively, it is possible that the four inkjet heads 11 are sequentially cleaned such that a first-cleaned inkjet head 11 is moved back to the recording position for test printing on the recording medium 12 while the subsequent inkjet heads 11 are being cleaned. Thus, the time required for cleaning is reduced.",
        "The absorber 57 is provided around the cap 52 and therefore does not abut the nozzle 44 even if the purge unit 5 is in the cleaning state. If the absorber 57 should abut the nozzle 44, the absorber 57 would absorb ink inside the nozzle head. Thus, the absorption function of absorbing remaining ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a can be impaired. In view of such, according to the present invention, the absorber 57 is prevented from abutting the nozzle 44, such that the absorber 57 does not absorb the ink inside the head. Thus, the absorber 57 surely absorbs the ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a.",
        "The absorbers 57 may retreat back into gaps between the nozzle plates 43 as shown in FIG. 24 when the purge unit 5 is brought into close contact with the inkjet head 11. For example, the absorber 57 may be supported by the frame 51 such that the surface of the absorber 57 is flush with, or extends ahead of, the upper end of the cap 52. With such a structure, ink remaining in the gaps between the nozzle plates 43 is efficiently absorbed by the absorber 57. As a result, contamination of the recording medium 12, etc., is surely prevented.",
        "In FIG. 23, a plurality of caps 52 are provided to the nozzle plates 43 included in the inkjet head 11 on a one-to-one manner, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, one elongated cap may be provided to cover all of the nozzle plates 43. In this case, it is difficult to bring the entire circumference of the elongated cap into close contact with the nozzle surface 43a. Thus, it is necessary to adopt a measure for surely removing ink in order to enhance the suction capacity of the suction means.",
        "(Other Examples of Absorber)",
        "[First Alternative Example]",
        "If the absorber 57 abuts the nozzle surface 43a such that the entire surface of the absorber 57 comes in contact with a large area of the nozzle surface 43a at one time, the absorber 57 cannot entirely absorb the ink remaining on the nozzle surface 43a, and ink left unabsorbed can be spread over the nozzle surface 43a. In view of such, the absorber 57 may be structured such that a surface region of the absorber 57 which abuts the nozzle surface 43a changes with the lapse of time. Herein, the change of the surface region includes an example where a surface region that abuts the nozzle surface 43a prior to the other region is detached away from the nozzle surface 43a when the other region comes in contact with the nozzle surface 43a and an example where a surface region that abuts the nozzle surface 43a prior to the other region is kept in contact with the nozzle surface 43a when the other region comes in contact with the nozzle surface 43a.",
        "Specifically, a surface of the absorber 57 (a surface which abuts the nozzle surface 43a) may have convexities and concavities. With this structure, when the purge unit 5 is lifted up, the convexities abut the nozzle surface 43a prior to the concavities, and then, the concavities abut the nozzle surface 43a. In this example, the convexities are kept in contact with the nozzle surface 43a even when the concavities come in contact with the nozzle surface 43a. Even when the absorber 57 has an undulated surface, the above effects are achieved. Alternatively, the absorber 57 may have an arch-like surface where a longitudinal center portion is bulkier than both ends of the arch. In this case, when the purge unit 5 is lifted up, the center portion of the absorber 57 first abuts the nozzle surface 43a, and thereafter, the both ends abut the nozzle surface 43a.",
        "[Second Alternative Example]",
        "Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 26, the absorber 57 may have a cylindrical shape, which is attached around the external surface of a cylinder 58. This cylindrical absorber 57 is provided such that the cylinder shaft of the cylindrical absorber 57 extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the nozzle surface 43a. The cylindrical absorber 57 has a height generally equal to that of the blade 56 and is provided behind the blade 56 with respect to the travel direction of the inkjet head 11 (the travel direction taken when the inkjet head 11 moves from the cleaning position to the recording position).",
        "After suction of ink with the cap 52 and the suction means has been completed, at steps P23 and P24 of FIG. 25, the cylindrical absorber 57 is rotated around the cylinder shaft in synchronization with the travel of the inkjet head 11 while the cylindrical absorber 57 is kept in contact with the nozzle surface 43a (the position of the cylindrical absorber 57 is not moved). In this case, a surface region of the absorber 57 which first comes in contact with the nozzle surface 43a is detached from the nozzle surface 43a when another surface region comes in contact with the nozzle surface 43a. That is, the absorber 57 abuts (comes in contact with) the nozzle surface 43a elongated in the longitudinal direction such that the surface region of the absorber 57 which is in contact with the nozzle surface 43a gradually changes in a perimeter direction (i.e., along the rotation direction), thereby absorbing ink adhered on the nozzle surface 43a. In this structure, the nozzle surface 43a abuts the blade 56 after abutting the absorber 57. Thus, a series of cleaning operations are realized such that the nozzle surface is wiped with the blade 56 after ink has been absorbed by the absorber 57.",
        "Since the absorber 57 is attached over the external surface of the cylinder 58, the absorber 57 has a belt-like shape when developed as shown in FIG. 27A. As described above, the absorber 57 preferably has openings 57a at the portions that can abut the nozzles 44 in order to prevent ink inside the nozzle head from being absorbed. In the example of FIG. 27A, one nozzle plate 43 has two rows of nozzles 44, and an opening 57a is formed for each row of nozzles 44. With this structure, ink adhered on a region between the rows of nozzles 44 is absorbed by the absorber 57. Alternatively, the absorber 57 may have openings 57b which correspond to respective one of the nozzle plates 43 as shown in FIG. 27B.",
        "In the example where the absorber 57 is attached onto the external surface of the cylinder 58, the size of the absorber 57 is small as compared with the case where the absorber 57 is attached to the frame 51 (see FIG. 23). Even if a line head 4 having a different length is employed (even if the number of the head bases 41 attached to the base plate 42 is changed to construct a recording apparatus that complies with a recording medium 12 having a different width), the same absorber 57 can also be employed in this recording apparatus. Thus, the same element (absorber) can be commonly used for different types of recording apparatuses.",
        "Alternatively, the cylinder 58 onto which the absorber 57 is attached is formed of a porous material, and a suction pump 59 may be provided in the hollow inside of the cylinder 58 at the central portion thereof. With this structure, ink absorbed by the absorber 57 is collected by the suction pump 59. The cylindrical absorber 57 has a relatively small volume as described above and therefore can be saturated with ink. With the suction pump 59 for sucking up the ink absorbed by the absorber 57, stable ink absorption is realized. It should be noted that the suction pump 59 is applicable to the example of FIG. 23 where the absorber 57 is supported by the frame 51. In this case, the suction pump 59 is connected to a portion of the absorber 57 other than the surface thereof (the surface which abuts the nozzle surface 43a).",
        "The suction pump 59 may be activated during the time when the absorber 57 which is in contact with the nozzle surface 43a is absorbing ink. With such an operation, ink absorbed by the absorber 57 is sucked by the suction pump 59 at all times, whereby ink dripping is effectively prevented when the absorber 57 is detached from the nozzle surface 43a. Alternatively, the suction pump 59 may be activated during the time when the absorber 57 is away from the nozzle surface 43a so as not to absorb ink.",
        "The length of the absorber 57 along the cylinder axis direction (width Ls) is preferably shorter than the length of the blade 56 (width Lb) (Ls<Lb). With such a structure, even if ink is spread in width directions over the nozzle surface 43a at the time when the absorber 57 comes in contact with the nozzle surface 43a, the ink spread in the width directions and left unabsorbed by the absorber 57 is surely wiped away by the blade 56 that is wider than the absorber 57.",
        "[Third Alternative Example]",
        "Although in each of the above examples the absorber 57 is provided in the purge unit 5, an absorber 9 may be provided in the line head 4 as shown in FIG. 28.",
        "In the case where a large number of nozzle heads 6 are arranged side by side to form a line head 4 as in this embodiment, ink sometimes remains at edges of each nozzle plate 43 after the blade 56 has wiped the nozzle surface in the longitudinal direction (the remaining ink is condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity). There is a possibility that the remaining ink causes contamination of the recording medium 12 and that the remaining ink is squeezed into the nozzles 44 when the blade 56 wipes the nozzle surface 43a again.",
        "In view of such, the absorber 9 is provided on the nozzle surface 43a to surround the nozzle plate 43 as shown in FIG. 28. With such a structure, ink remaining after the blade 56 has wiped the nozzle surface 43a is absorbed by the absorber 9. Thus, contamination of the recording medium 12 and clogging of the nozzles 44 are prevented.",
        "Preferably, the absorber 9 is flush with or retreats behind the surface of the nozzle plates 43. Further, the absorber 9 may be provided in the gaps between the nozzle plates 43 as shown in FIG. 28A. Alternatively, especially when the gaps between the nozzle plates 43 are very narrow, it is not necessary to provide the absorber 9 in the gaps as shown in FIG. 28B. It should be noted that, in the case where the absorber 9 is provided in the gaps between the nozzle plates 43, ink remaining at the edges of the nozzle plates 43 is efficiently absorbed.",
        "It should be noted that absorbers may be provided in both the purge unit 5 and the line head 4 or may be provided in any one of the purge unit 5 and the line head 4.",
        "The present invention is not limited to a nozzle head having a piezoelectric actuator. For example, the nozzle head may have a heat generation element.",
        "The present invention is not limited to a line head having nozzles over the entire width of a recording medium.",
        "The recording apparatus may be an apparatus having one line head and one purge unit.",
        "The present invention is applicable not only to a recording apparatus including a line head but also to a serial recording apparatus.",
        "The present invention is not limited to the examples described above but can be embodied in various forms without departing from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof. Every aspects of the above examples are merely exemplary and therefore do no constitute a basis of restrictive interpretation.
