<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reloadable medicine injector and methods are described in which a barrel with a receiving cavity is adapted to slidably receive a syringe subassembly for axial movement therein. Upon removal of a safety and release of a syringe driver, the syringe driver moves forward and injects the syringe needle. A plurality of penetration controls are shown for controlling injection needle penetration depth. The penetration controls have an abutment and various lengths to provide different needle penetration depth positions. In one form of penetration control a sleeve is used against which the syringe or related parts contact. In another form the front return spring is used as a penetration control. A cushioning ring may be used to reduce syringe breakage. A load distribution and guide ring may be used to distribute loading applied to the syringe and help guide the moving syringe.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to injection apparatus and injection of medications into body tissues.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Self-administering a hypodermic medicine injection is a difficult task for many individuals to accomplish. Some individuals experience an aversion to driving a needle into the flesh. The result is that many individuals who have health conditions which require periodic injections or who face an emergency need for self injection, or a need to administer an injection on another human or animal will hesitate or in some instances grow faint at the prospect. At least part of the revulsion may stem from watching the needle penetrate the flesh. Another aspect comes from the act of forcing the needle into the flesh. To many, the aversion is so substantial that they simply refuse to either self inject or to administer an injection to another human or animal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus there is a need for a device that will automatically inject medications without requiring the administering individual to watch the needle penetrate, and without requiring that the individual actually supply the force needed to drive the needle into the flesh and dispense medicine into the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various automatic injection apparatus have been previously developed. Such apparatus may be used to self administer or to administer, injections to others, in such a manner that the apparatus only requires triggering. Mechanisms provided within the apparatus automatically drive the needle and dispense the medication. Many prior forms of automatic injectors are single use, although some allow for reloading of hypodermic cartridges in which an ampule is provided with a single, fixed needle that openly communicates with the medication in the ampule.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is also a need for an automatic form of injector that will accommodate double needle injection cartridges in which two oppositely facing needles are slidably mounted by a hub on a medication ampule. A rearward facing one of the needles is situated adjacent a penetrable seal on the ampule so that forced motion of the syringe assembly will result in the rearward needle piercing the ampule seal and allowing the medication to flow to and out the forward needle. Such action, to be most beneficial, should be accomplished by the automatic injector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another need is for an automatic injector that can be adjusted for different penetration depths, from superficial to subcutaneous to intramuscular and deeper penetration depths. This varies according to the condition of the patient and/or the medication being administered. This is not just a need related to automatic injectors, but also for individuals who are unaware of penetration depth requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Need also exists for automatic injectors that can be reloaded with conventional ampules to allow for administration of multiple doses. Such injectors allow for removal and replacement of the ampules and re-use of the injector mechanism. Another mode of use is as a single ampule for one injection to give a first dose, and then to reset the injector for a second injection from the same ampule for a second or other multiple doses.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another pertinent need is the ability to remove the syringe subassembly from the injection device. This may be needed when the injection device malfunctions or when immediate administration of a second or subsequent dose is required.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some or all of the above needs and others are addressed in part or fully met by various embodiments of the present invention as described below.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Introductory Note</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The readers of this document should understand that the embodiments described herein may rely on terminology used in any section of this document and other terms readily apparent from the drawings and language common for such components or operations. This document is premised upon using one or more terms with one embodiment that will in general apply to other embodiments for similar structures, functions, features and aspects of the invention. Wording used in the claims as filed is also descriptive of the invention. Terminology used with one, some or all embodiments may be used for describing and defining the technology and exclusive rights associated herewith.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Syringe Subassemblies</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate syringe subassemblies <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> that are capable of use with the present invention. The illustrated syringe assemblies or subassemblies <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are both of known structure and are commercially available. Exemplary commercial subassemblies are manufactured, sold, or distributed under the trademark CARPUJECT™ by Hospira, Inc. Other subassemblies may also be suitable but may require some modification depending on the specifics of construction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Both subassembly configurations include an ampule <b>12</b> that may be a small glass or plastic vial for containing a measured volume of fluid medication, medicament or other injectable substance. The quantity of the substance may be predetermined, based upon the nature of the substance and the anticipated usage. The ampule <b>12</b> may be pre-loaded with the substance and provided by the substance producer or distributor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In both versions, the ampule or vial <b>12</b> includes a rearward end <b>13</b> that is potentially open to slidably receive a plunger <b>14</b>. The plunger and plunger piston can be moved axially within the ampule bore <b>15</b> by application of axial force against the plunger shaft or rod. The plunger <b>14</b> will thus force the substance out through a hollow needle assembly <b>16</b> at a forward end of the ampule when the plunger assembly is depressed toward the forward or needle end.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Subassemblies <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> differ in the construction of their needle assemblies <b>16</b>. Subassembly <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is of the fixed needle variety in which a fixed hollow needle <b>17</b> is mounted by a fixed hub <b>21</b> to the associated ampule <b>12</b>. The needle <b>17</b> openly communicates with the substance within the ampule and will eject the substance in response to forced contractionary motion of the plunger <b>14</b>. A sheath <b>19</b> may be included to releasably cover the fixed needle <b>17</b> for sanitary and safety reasons, and must be removed or be pierced by the needle before administration of the injection.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Needle assembly <b>16</b> for syringe subassembly <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) differs from the fixed needle assembly structure described above. Syringe subassembly <b>11</b> makes use of a double needle assembly <b>20</b> in which a double needle hub <b>90</b> or <b>21</b> mounts a seal penetration needle <b>22</b> that projects rearwardly toward a penetrable seal <b>23</b> on the associated ampule. Flesh penetration needle <b>24</b> projects forwardly. In practice, both needles <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> can be made integral. In such an integral construction both needles may be formed of the same needle tube, sharpened at both ends and immovably fixed to needle assembly hub <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hub <b>90</b> mounts both needles <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and has a cup-shaped receptacle for receiving the sealed end of the ampule. It also preferably has features or provisions to mount the needles in axial sliding relation to a seal retainer <b>25</b> of the associated ampule <b>12</b>. Forced sliding movement of the ampule relative to hub <b>90</b> will thus cause the seal penetrating needle <b>22</b> to engage and then pierce the penetrable seal <b>23</b>. Once seal <b>23</b> is pierced, the substance within the ampule may be forced through the needle or needles <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> as the injection is administered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The double needle subassembly <b>11</b> may also make use of a protective needle sheath <b>19</b>. The sheath can vary or be substantially similar, or even identical to that used for the single needle subassembly <b>10</b>. For either form of subassembly, the sheath may be provided as a rigid cover, or as a flexible member that may be penetrated by the adjacent needle upon application of sufficient axial force. This is disclosed in my earlier issued U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,540,664 and 5,695,472; such disclosures being hereby incorporated by reference into this application. Also incorporated by reference are my earlier U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,358,489 and 5,665,071.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Injection Device</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">General Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A reloadable hypodermic injection device according to the invention is shown in the drawings and is identified therein by reference numeral <b>30</b>. Injection device <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) includes a barrel <b>31</b> having a muzzle end <b>32</b>, with a needle receiving aperture or passageway <b>34</b>. A syringe subassembly receiving cavity <b>35</b> is situated along and within the barrel <b>31</b>, and is preferably adjacent to and accessible from the muzzle end <b>32</b>. The cavity <b>35</b> is adapted to releasably and slidably receive a syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b> for movement toward and away from the muzzle end <b>32</b>. The needle assembly <b>16</b> is aligned to project through the needle receiving aperture <b>34</b> or through a protective septum (not shown) positioned across and similar to aperture <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A syringe driver <b>36</b> has an actuator or driver contact <b>37</b> that is movable toward the muzzle end <b>32</b> extending into the syringe subassembly receiving cavity <b>35</b>. A penetration controller <b>38</b> or other penetration control is also advantageously provided. The penetration controller may include a penetration control abutment surface <b>39</b> which engages the ampule assembly, such as at a shoulder or other appropriate feature thereof. The penetration controller has a suitable length and configuration from the muzzle end <b>32</b> to provide a desired needle penetration depth or forward needle stop position.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">The Barrel</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As set forth by example in the drawings, barrel <b>31</b> is elongated and tubular, defining the subassembly receiving cavity <b>35</b> between a rearward end <b>41</b> and the muzzle end <b>32</b>. The barrel may be formed of plastic or any other suitable medically acceptable material of suitable strength.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A driver guide or driver spring guide <b>33</b> can be integral with or fitted as a sleeve within the barrel <b>31</b> to maintain the driver spring or other driver force generator in a desired position, such as coaxially positioned therein. As shown, guide <b>33</b> functions to guide extension and retraction of the syringe driver spring <b>36</b>. Guide <b>33</b> as shown also advantageously functions as a positioner to accurately locate the syringe assembly <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> coaxially within the barrel <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the illustrated forms, the rearward barrel end <b>41</b> is adapted to mount an annular end piece or firing bushing <b>43</b> which is used in conjunction with the driver <b>36</b>, details of which will be described further below. To facilitate assembly, the barrel rearward end <b>41</b> is preferably molded about an inward annular ridge <b>44</b>. It may alternatively be possible to produce each part separately and have the annular ridge snap fit with the firing bushing <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The muzzle end <b>32</b> in preferred forms mounts a separable nose cap <b>45</b> that defines the needle aperture <b>34</b> or other passageway through which the forward needle extends when fired. The aperture or needle puncture location of the nose cap <b>45</b> can be releasably attached to the barrel by means of interfitting threads <b>46</b>, rings or other projections. Cap <b>45</b> may thus be separated from the barrel to permit access to the barrel cavity <b>35</b>, thereby permitting insertion and removal of the needle subassemblies <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Syringe Driver</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Driver <b>36</b> is used to operate against or be connected through a plunger rod <b>61</b> to the plunger or plunger piston <b>14</b> of the needle subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>. The plunger rod may be separable or integral with the plunger piston. The driver is functional to force the subassembly in a forward direction to effect needle penetration and to operate against the plunger to inject the ampule contents. Such forces are automatically applied by spring or other suitable driver force initiated through a triggering operation initiated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Driver <b>36</b> as exemplified herein includes the driver bar or shaft <b>37</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>) which is shown within the barrel <b>31</b> in a rearwardly cocked position by a driver release mechanism <b>53</b> that may be similar or identical to that shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,540,664 and 5,358,489 which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Notwithstanding the above incorporated materials, a preferred driver is further exemplified herein as including a drive spring <b>50</b> that is compressed when ready or cocked. The drive spring <b>50</b> is preferably guided and contained within the barrel by a spring guide which is advantageously in the form of a guide sleeve <b>51</b>. As shown, the guide sleeve is tubular with the guide spring extensible within tubular guide sleeve <b>51</b> with portions of the spring slidable therewithin. Other configurations may also be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The drive spring is selected to provide sufficient stored energy when compressed to force the needle subassembly forwardly against downstream resistance and perform needle penetration and injection functions. It serves to displace the plunger <b>14</b> and thus expel the medicament contained in the ampule through the injection needle <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The drive spring <b>50</b> acts against and is restrained by the firing bushing <b>43</b> at one end. The opposing end bears upon the driver bar <b>37</b> which engages the plunger rod <b>61</b>. The exemplified driver bar or shaft <b>37</b> provides a spring engagement shoulder <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) against which the forward end of driver spring <b>51</b> engages. As shown, driver release <b>53</b> includes a barb or barbs <b>54</b> that fit through the firing bushing <b>43</b> central aperture. The barbs are preferably formed on flexible ends of the legs of the driver bar or shaft <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A safety, advantageously in the form of a safety cap <b>55</b>, has a forwardly projecting pin <b>56</b> that is received between the legs of the driver shaft or stem to hold the barbs <b>54</b> in engagement with the firing bushing <b>43</b> and thereby prevent forward movement of the driver bar <b>37</b> until the safety is removed. The safety or safety cap <b>55</b> can be pulled rearwardly to slide the tapered safety pin <b>56</b> from between the legs of the driver bar. This frees the barbs to be forced inwardly and radially together. As shown, the barbed legs of driver bar <b>37</b> are moved inward by the rearward or end of firing sleeve <b>57</b> as will be further detailed below. The firing sleeve <b>57</b> acts as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show the preferred driver shaft or stem has four legs, although other numbers are believed possible. The driver shaft or stem is preferably made using two parts <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b </i>which fit together. These parts can alternatively be made of metal and be molded or otherwise formed as an integral piece.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Radial inward movement of the barbed legs causes the barbs <b>54</b> to move into a release position as effected by an exterior firing sleeve <b>57</b>. In the design illustrated, the firing sleeve extends over and along the outside of the barrel. The exposed length of the firing sleeve allows the user to grasp the injector by the firing sleeve when the injection is to be administered.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A forward end of the firing or trigger sleeve can include slots <b>58</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) that slide along retainers <b>59</b> formed on the forward end of the barrel. The retainers are advantageously in a peninsular configuration that provides flexibility to retainers <b>59</b> for assembly or possible disassembly. The interaction between retainers <b>59</b> and slots <b>58</b> prevent the firing sleeve from being unintentionally removed from the barrel. Such interaction also limits the extent of axial relative movement while also allowing the parts to be assembled or disassembled by depressing retainers <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The firing sleeve <b>57</b> includes a trigger head having an opening <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) which is preferably centrally located. The trigger head of sleeve <b>57</b> is advantageously beveled along the contact area with barbs <b>54</b>. Opening <b>60</b> receives and inwardly cams the barbs <b>54</b> on the legs of the driver bar <b>37</b>. This forces the barbed ends together once the safety cap is removed and the firing sleeve is moved forwardly with respect to the barrel. Such action triggers the driver release <b>53</b> to free drive spring <b>50</b>. Drive spring <b>50</b> thus extends longitudinally, driving the driver bar <b>37</b> into the plunger shaft and forcing the syringe subassembly forwardly to administer the injection.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> show that the driver bar <b>37</b> is configured to push against an adjustable plunger rod <b>61</b> which is attached to the plunger <b>14</b>. The plunger shaft assembly may be part of the syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the plunger shaft or rod <b>61</b> may be produced as an integral part of the driver or as a separate assembly or part. The plunger shaft may also be made in a non-adjustable configuration, such as solid or as a non-adjustable assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the illustrated embodiments, the plunger rod <b>61</b> is advantageously made up of two axially adjustable components including an actuator or driver engaging section <b>62</b> and a plunger engaging section <b>63</b>. As shown, sections <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> are threadably engaged to allow for adjustment of the overall length of rod <b>61</b>. This is used to help adjust the dosage or volume of material dispensed during a single operation of the injection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The illustrated plunger rod <b>61</b> is advantageous in that the two axially adjustable sections <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> allow for longitudinal rod length adjustment, and for threaded or other connection to the plunger <b>14</b>. Section <b>62</b>, as shown, has a head portion and threads which are received into section <b>63</b>. Plunger rod section <b>63</b> is coupled, such as by threads, or is otherwise attached to plunger <b>14</b>. Relative rotation of the two sections <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> can effectively change the plunger rod length, thereby allowing for accurate dosage adjustment, even though the syringes vary in length until adjusted to have the same or other desired length.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is also possible that a different, conventional form of plunger rods (not shown) might be provided as a part of the syringe subassemblies <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>. In such an alternative construction the adjustable rod <b>61</b> may not be needed or used. In such a construction, dosage adjustment may be sufficiently accurate by using a properly selected stop collar <b>64</b> which will be discussed further below. In either construction, plunger rod <b>61</b> or an alternative integral plunger rod (not shown) can be provided with or as a part of the plunger assembly. With an adjustable plunger rod, such as provided by parts <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>, dosage control is more accurate since each ampule may vary in length and the adjustment capability can accommodate for such variations. This may be needed when medicaments are to be dispensed in very accurate dosage amounts. Other medicaments may not be sufficiently sensitive to dosage amounts and the adjustable plunger costs and adjustment in production may not be needed or justified.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Dosage Adjustment</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The present device is capable of use for single or for multiple injections. To enable such use, one or more stops in the form of dose stop collars <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) can be releasably mounted to the driver <b>36</b> or, in the illustrated example, to the plunger rod <b>61</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, one such collar <b>64</b> is shown attached to the rod <b>61</b> rearward of the ampule <b>12</b>, and forward of the headed section <b>62</b> of the plunger rod. The collar <b>64</b> and possible multiple such collars are advantageously positioned in the forward path of the headed end of the plunger rod <b>61</b>. Collar or collars <b>64</b> stop forward motion of the plunger rod at such point where a selected first dosage has been expelled from the syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If a second dose remains within the ampule following the first injection, the syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b> can be removed from the barrel to gain access to collar <b>64</b>, which then can be removed from the plunger rod <b>61</b> to permit further motion of the plunger to deliver the additional dose.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Following removal of the syringe and collar, the syringe driver <b>36</b> can be recocked, but the process of recocking requires holding the barrel <b>31</b> in reaction to the force needed to recompress the drive spring <b>50</b>. This may be difficult in the constructions shown and described herein due to the firing sleeve or trigger handle <b>57</b> extending over the majority of the length of the barrel <b>31</b>. In other embodiments or with care the syringe can be recocked by holding the barrel and inserting a screw driver or similar tool and depressing the driver bar <b>37</b> and associated driver spring <b>50</b>. If recocked, the syringe subassembly can be re-inserted into the barrel for automatic injection of a second or another dose which becomes available as the plunger is permitted further forward travel in response to subsequent triggering.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The length dimension of the collar <b>64</b> or multiple collars can be selected according to the desired dosages to be administered. Although not illustrated, multiple collars may be stacked along the plunger rod, with each collar representing a dose of medicament or other substance from the ampule. Separate injections may be performed following removal of successive stop collars. Alternatively, in instances where single dosages are desired, a single or even no stop collar may be selected according to the desired single dosage.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Stop collar <b>64</b> may be made having different sizes of arcs. In some cases the collars extend fully about the plunger shaft. A currently preferred stop collar has an arcuate size of about 180-200 arcual degrees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show a currently preferred design having an open side and an arcuate size <b>110</b> of about 185-190 arcual degrees. The relatively open side <b>111</b> is advantageously provided with end faces <b>112</b> which are beveled to converge inwardly. These features provide easier installation of the stop during production and easier removal by a user after the first or other prior dose has been administered.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another feature shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> that facilitates removal of stop collar <b>64</b> is the provision of ribs, flutes, striations or other friction features <b>120</b>. These friction features improve manual grasping of the collar to remove it from the outside of plunger shaft <b>61</b>. This construction allows a user to remove the collar using the thumb and forefinger from a single hand. It improves the removal such that two hands are not necessary as was the case in earlier designs. This improvement greatly reduces the chance that the action of removing the stop collar does not lead to accidental depression or upward movement of the plunger which may compromise the accuracy of the second dose amount.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The outside of the stop collar <b>64</b> may also advantageously be provided with circumferential segments <b>121</b> between the friction features <b>120</b> and a flat segment <b>122</b>. Flat segment <b>122</b> facilitates installation of the stop collar upon the plunger rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The inside surface <b>124</b> is preferably semi-cylindrical and sized to fit the plunger rod <b>61</b>. The particular size may vary depending on the size of ampule and size and type of plunger rod used.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Nose Cap or Muzzle End Piece</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that nose cap <b>45</b> is advantageously removable from the barrel to allow insertion and removal of a syringe subassembly. Cap <b>45</b> may be generally in a cup shaped form to be received upon the forward end of barrel <b>31</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the nose cap fits over the outward surface of the barrel. The nose cap is secured thereon using threads or other suitable connection joint. Depending on the specific construction used, the nose cap may alternatively fit within the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is preferred for accuracy in needle penetration depth control that the nose cap <b>45</b> be secured axially against a positive stop such as a shoulder <b>47</b> formed along the barrel <b>31</b>. Shoulder <b>47</b> can be provided along the barrel to accurately locate an installed nose cap <b>45</b> in a repeatable manner. This is preferred to provide axial accuracy to the relative location of the nose cap <b>45</b> upon the barrel. This is desirable since the nose cap may be removed and re-mounted repeatedly to enable removal and replacement of ampule and needle subassemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is advantageous for accurate positioning of the nose cap <b>45</b> to use the threads <b>46</b>. Threads <b>46</b> are provided along the nose cap <b>45</b> and barrel <b>31</b> to facilitate secure engagement between the abutment shoulder <b>47</b> and nose cap <b>45</b>. However, fastening arrangements between the nose cap <b>45</b> and barrel <b>31</b> may be used other than the illustrated threads <b>46</b>. For example, a bayonet, barb, snap fit or other releasable connection arrangement could also be used to releasably interlock the nose cap with the adjacent forward part of barrel <b>31</b> to provide repeated accurate positioning.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The forward end of nose cap <b>45</b> defines the illustrated needle aperture or passageway <b>34</b>. Aperture or passageway <b>34</b> is advantageously sized to receive needle sheath <b>19</b> therein. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the needle safety sheath can project through the aperture <b>34</b>. Sheath <b>19</b> may be provided with a blunt forward end which may extend forward of the muzzle end <b>34</b>. The projection of the sheath facilitates removal of the sheath immediately prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The outside of nose cap <b>45</b> may advantageously be provided with ribs, flutes, striations or other friction surface to facilitate installation and removal of the nose cap from the barrel. The construction shown uses a threaded connection between the nose cap and barrel. Thus an exterior friction surface allowing torque to be applied is preferred in such constructions. A preferred friction surface has minute linear longitudinal striations (not shown).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Sheath Remover</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Removal of the sheath <b>19</b> from the syringe sub-assembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b> can be accomplished or facilitated by provision of a sheath remover <b>80</b> that is releasably mounted at the muzzle end <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an exemplary sheath remover <b>80</b> from the forward end. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a side view of the sheath remover. The construction illustrated includes a sheath gripper <b>81</b>. The gripper has a central aperture <b>85</b> that is disposed in substantial coaxial relation to the needle receiving aperture <b>34</b> of the nose cap. The central aperture <b>85</b> receives the sheath <b>19</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Gripper <b>81</b> also preferably includes radially inward projecting fingers <b>82</b> that flexibly grip the sheath <b>19</b> behind a lip <b>89</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) near the tip of the sheath remover. The inwardly projecting fingers <b>82</b> provide sufficient flexibility to allow the sheath remover to be pushed onto and installed over the enlarged end of the sheath near lip <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A collar portion <b>84</b> extends rearwardly of the end surface <b>87</b> and is received over the nose cap <b>45</b>. The collar portion <b>84</b> may be provided with circumferential ribs <b>83</b> to improve manual grasping of the sheath remover so as to facilitate pulling the sheath and sheath remover from the injector.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Fingers <b>82</b> will flex rearwardly during removal of the sheath and catch on lip <b>89</b> and securely grip the sheath <b>19</b> when the remover is pulled forwardly. In doing so, the fingers will catch behind the lip and further bind and pull the sheath <b>19</b> from the needle assembly hub <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to expose the outwardly directed needle <b>17</b>. The sheath and sheath remover can later be re-installed, in an instance where it becomes desirable to re-cover the needle for safety purposes.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Penetration Control</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Syringe driver <b>36</b>, when triggered, forces the syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b> forwardly within barrel cavity <b>35</b>. This drives the needle <b>17</b> forwardly through the aperture <b>34</b> to penetrate the flesh of the patient. Depth of penetration according to the present invention is advantageously determined using a penetration controller <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref>) and other alternative forms described herein. The penetration control or controller stops penetration at a desired repeatable penetration depth of needle <b>17</b>. This is different than dose control, since the penetration depth is gauged from the nose cap which actually contacts the flesh during automatic injection.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Penetration controller <b>38</b> in preferred forms is located along the barrel <b>31</b>, with an abutment surface <b>39</b> spaced from the muzzle end <b>32</b> at a selected and desired needle penetration depth stop position. The penetration control is engaged by the syringe assembly to stop forward motion of the flesh penetration needle <b>17</b> at the selected penetration depth. This is done to remove the necessity for the user to determine penetration depth. By providing a penetration control, the device can be selected or adjusted so the needle will penetrate only to a desired depth as an automatic function of the device. Adjustment is preferably provided using a penetration sleeve, spring or other penetration control element.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">First Exemplary Penetration Controller</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one preferred form, the penetration control is provided by penetration controller <b>38</b>. Penetration controller <b>38</b> may be constructed more specifically in the form having a tubular sleeve <b>70</b> portion held within the nose cap <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> show penetration controller <b>38</b> in detail. The penetration controller includes a control sleeve <b>70</b> which has a flange <b>170</b> attached thereto. It is advantageous that the sleeve <b>70</b> and flange <b>170</b> be shaped for frictional engagement within the nose cap <b>45</b>. This is desirable so that removal of the nose cap will also result in removal of the penetration control <b>38</b>. This is facilitated by flange lobes <b>170</b><i>a </i>which tend to cant within the nose cap cavity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). This mounting arrangement also helps to provide repeatable and accurate axial positioning of the abutment surface <b>39</b> within the barrel <b>31</b> and relative to the outer front face of the nose cap or other flesh contacting face of the injector. The flange sleeve <b>70</b> and thickness of flange <b>170</b> define the length of the controller. The end of the sleeve opposite the flange provides a syringe abutment surface <b>39</b> at a selected distance from the muzzle end. In this example, the surface <b>39</b> is at the rearward end of the sleeve and faces the needle subassembly within the cavity <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The overall length of controller <b>38</b> is typically defined by the length of sleeve <b>70</b>. The length may be selected from a group having varying axial dimensions to effect different needle penetration depths. Thus one sleeve may be useful for subcutaneous injections, while another may be selected when deeper intramuscular penetration is required. A selection of sleeves of differing axial lengths may be used dependent upon the medicine being provided in the injector or for specific depths of desired needle penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The sleeve <b>70</b> is also useful to receive a forward or return spring <b>71</b>, preferably of the coiled compression variety, which can be disposed within the barrel, between the nose cap <b>45</b> and needle hub. The front or return spring <b>71</b> is provided to yieldably resist forward motion of the needle subassembly to hold the subassembly in the retracted position until the syringe driver <b>36</b> is triggered. Spring <b>71</b> also helps to reduce the impact of the syringe assembly with the penetration control, thus reducing or eliminating breakage of the hub or penetration controller.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The penetration control unit <b>38</b> can be used to secure the return spring <b>71</b> in position within the barrel, using flange <b>170</b>. This also helps retain the spring for removal along with the nose cap <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). To this end, the spring diameter may be enlarged at its forward end <b>72</b> in order to provide a friction fit between the spring <b>71</b>, sleeve <b>70</b> and the nose cap <b>45</b>, while allowing the remainder of the spring free movement within the confines of the sleeve portion <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">One of the important functions of the return springs is to keep the needle in a hidden, retracted position after the sheath is pulled off. This prevents the user from seeing the needle and prevents the user from being scared due to needle fright. The return spring acts quickly on removal of the sheath to return the syringe up inside the barrel such that the user has no visual reminder that there is a needle positioned in a hidden position therein.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">By providing the return spring <b>71</b> and sleeve <b>70</b> arrangement described above, the fully compressed axial spring length will be less than the sleeve length. Thus the penetration depth is determined by the selected length of sleeve <b>70</b> and flange <b>170</b>. With proper design, the yieldable resistance offered by spring <b>70</b> will remain within suitable limits regardless of the sleeve length selected to adjust penetration depth.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The above arrangement (in which the return spring <b>71</b>, selected sleeve <b>70</b> and flange <b>170</b>, and nose cap <b>45</b> are interconnected) is advantageous to simplify attachment to and removal from the barrel <b>31</b>. A user wishing to gain access to the needle sub-assembly for replacement or for second injection purposes, need only unthread the nose cap <b>45</b> from the barrel end. The return spring <b>71</b> and sleeve <b>70</b> will move along with the nose cap to permit free access to the cavity <b>35</b>. The lobes <b>170</b><i>a </i>also may interact with the internal threads of the nose cap to help prevent the nose cap, sleeve and front spring from flying freely when disconnected from the barrel.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Second Exemplary Penetration Controller</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Another form of the penetration control may be provided in a form and construction which uses a selected spring of a particular fully compressed length dimension. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15C</figref> illustrate by way of example several springs <b>75</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>77</b> that will have different fully compressed lengths but similar lengths when installed in device <b>30</b>. In each one of the springs, one of the spring ends will function as the abutment against which the needle hub engages or other parts engage as explained further below. The needle hub will stop when the spring is fully compressed and the desired penetration depth is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By using a spring <b>75</b> that is selected for a desired compressed length, the spring itself becomes the penetration controller when fully compressed between the needle hub and the nose cap <b>45</b>. Thus the spring can have dual functions: offering yieldable resistance to slow forward motion of the adjacent needle subassembly; and stopping such forward motion once the needle reaches the selected penetration depth and the spring becomes fully compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The selected springs <b>75</b>-<b>77</b> can be made to fit frictionally within the nose cap <b>45</b> in order to keep the spring and nose cap together. This simplifies access to the cavity <b>35</b> and a needle assembly therein. It also mitigates flying discharge of the nose cap and spring when disconnected. Thus, the cap <b>45</b> and spring can be assembled so both can be simultaneously removed from the barrel as a unit. Changing from one spring to another to accommodate different penetration depths is a simple matter of removing the nose cap from the barrel and changing the spring. Alternatively, an assembly including a nose cap and different spring can be used to change penetration depth.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15D</figref>, <b>15</b>E and <b>15</b>F show additional novel concepts in using the forward spring for penetration control and absorption of energy from the moving drive and syringe assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref> shows spring <b>78</b> in a free and uncompressed condition. Spring <b>78</b> has three sections, <b>78</b><i>a, </i><b>78</b><i>b </i>and <b>78</b><i>c. </i>Section <b>78</b><i>a </i>has spaced helical or spiral windings which may be collapsed due to force applied by the driver through the syringe assembly. Section <b>78</b><i>b </i>includes one or more dead windings which are close or tight and are normally not compressible due to application of axial compressive force to spring <b>78</b>. Section <b>78</b><i>c </i>is enlarged end coils or windings that are radially contracted when installed in the nose cap receptacle and serve to tie the spring and nose cap together.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">By adjusting the relative proportion of sections <b>78</b><i>a, </i><b>78</b><i>b </i>and <b>78</b><i>c, </i>the compression and energy absorption properties of the forward spring can be adjusted to provide different penetration control and different deceleration characteristics. More dead coils reduce energy absorption as the forward spring is compressed because there are fewer active coils to absorb energy. Thus the increase in dead coils can be used to maintain adequate syringe power for injection and dispensing of the medication.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> shows spring <b>78</b> in a fully compressed but axially aligned and stacked condition. This occurs when the spring has stronger and/or large spring wire. The spring made with stronger wire will thus reach a fully compressed state and then relatively abruptly stop at the demonstrated penetration depth for that design of spring.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref> shows a spring <b>79</b> similar to spring <b>78</b> with similar sections. Spring <b>79</b> does, however, demonstrate a different type of behavior upon full compression. The spring wire is made finer and less strong. This causes the spring to compress and then distort into a distorted collapsed condition. This condition provides a two-stage compression action. In the first stage or phase, the spring compresses in a typical or nearly typical stack arrangement. In the second stage or phase, the spring distorts with various windings being forced to radially change, thus distorting and collapsing with some winding either moving inside of other windings or overriding other windings. This construction effectively provides shock absorption and energy absorption capabilities that reduce shock after the spring has been fully compressed and allow energy absorption after full compression into a stacked array and helps or eliminates breakage of the syringe hub and other parts of the injector. It also provides cushioning as the syringe and driver decelerate to a stopped condition.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As examples, syringes made of wound or coiled music wire having wire diameter size of about 0.015 inch tend to collapse and distort as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>. In comparison, springs wound from music wire having a diametrical size of 0.018 inch tend to remain in a stacked coil array as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">These are current preferred wire sizes for injection devices using only a spring as the penetration control. Although such constructions are not as precise in demonstrating consistent penetration depth, they are sufficiently consistent for the administration of many medicines. They also are more economical to produce and eliminate the penetration control <b>38</b> having tubular sleeve <b>70</b> and flange <b>170</b> or other similar relatively inelastic penetration control elements. They are also less expensive to produce and assemble.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Use of finer spring wire has another beneficial effect. The springs tend to distort more easily and further reduce the risk that a nose cap and spring assembly fly away upon removal, such as when preparing for administration of a second or subsequent dose.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Syringe Assembly Front Spring Load Distribution, Guidance &amp; Cushioning</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> show front portions of an injection device having many of the same features as described elsewhere herein. Description of the common features are made using the same reference numbers and the description which is common will not be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> differ in that a load distribution ring <b>171</b> is provided to act in several capacities. The first capacity is to distribute the forces developed between the front spring <b>75</b> and the syringe, particularly at the syringe assembly hub <b>21</b>. The second capacity is to act as a guide piece to help maintain the coaxial position of the syringe assembly hub within the barrel cavity. The third capacity is to also distribute and equalize force about the annular abutment <b>170</b> so that the forces developed against the syringe are not concentrated.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The ring <b>171</b> is preferably made about the same size as the barrel cavity portions within which the guide ring moves during operation of the injector. This is advantageously done by making the ring within a range of about −0.001 inch to about −0.004 inch compared to the adjacent barrel cavity interior diameter. Other size relationships are also believed operable.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Ring <b>171</b> is preferably made from a stainless steel or other suitable material which is strong and sufficiently stiff to help distribute the load evenly which is applied across the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> further show a resilient cushion in the form of a cushion or pad ring <b>172</b> which surrounds the syringe hub <b>90</b>. The cushion is preferably made from an elastomer material such as natural rubber or Santoprene 8281-45-med having a durometer value of about 45. In the uncompressed state the cushioning pad ring <b>172</b> is about 0.030 inch smaller in diameter than the load distribution and guide piece <b>171</b>. This allows the pad ring to expand outwardly in a radial direction when load is applied thereto as the syringe is driven against the front spring and resistance is developed in association with dispensing the fluid medication from the front needle. An outer diameter which is larger and closer to the adjacent barrel internal diameter may lead to lateral strain that causes the pad ring <b>172</b> to develop frictional drag against the barrel bore. This in turn requires more driver force to be provided in order to overcome the friction and creates added stress and strain on the syringe and other parts of the injector.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> show another embodiment similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> is not provided with a load distributor and guide ring like ring <b>171</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>. Instead, the cushion pad <b>172</b> directly bears on the syringe hub and the front spring. Although this construction is not as preferred as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, it is believed operable. Due to the less uniform load application a harder and more durable elastomer material may be needed to allow repeated use of an injector so constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In either of the constructions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-27</figref>, the cushion pad <b>172</b> has been found to be superior at moderating forces experienced by the syringe hub <b>90</b> and thus reduces the risks of failure or breakage of the hub or other portions of the syringe assembly.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Summary of Front Return Spring Functions</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The front or return spring thus performs a number of important functions. It maintains the syringe assembly in a retracted position prior to use, such as during handling, shipping, carrying by the user and other situations. Any one of these may by routine or accident cause force to be developed on the syringe and return spring. The return spring thus maintains or helps to maintain the syringe in a retracted position prior to firing but does so in a manner that absorbs shock and minimizes the risk of syringe ampule breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The return springs also serves to help keep the injection needle up inside the nose cap or barrel to keep it in a hidden position to prevent user alarm at sight of the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Another function of the return spring is to counteract against the drive spring upon triggering of the injection. The drive spring accelerates the syringe down the barrel and the kinetic and well as stored spring energy is preferably dissipated to prevent or reduce the risk of syringe ampule breakage or breakage of other components of the forward end of the injector which in one way or another must take the force and dissipate the energy. Dissipation of energy is particularly enhanced when the spring deforms as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Another important aspect of the forward or return spring is in some embodiments to provide for proper insertion of the seal insertion needle <b>22</b> into and through the ampule seal <b>23</b>. This is accomplished by selecting a return spring which develops the return force needed to cause seating of the ampule and insertion of needle <b>22</b> at or slightly before final penetration depth is achieved. Thus, the spring may provide for delayed administration of the medicine until the needle penetration depth is proper.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some forms of the inventions the front or return spring may by itself serve as the penetration control. This simplifies the construction of the injector and saves costs where the required consistency of penetration control for the medicine being used is within the demonstrated consistency of the penetration controller spring being used is satisfactory. Where these parameters are met the more complex penetration control sleeve can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A still further advantageous function of the front return spring is to hold or help hold the spring with the nose cap. This is accomplished in the illustrated embodiments by using a spring which has enlarged coils toward the forward end. These larger coils serve to maintain the spring with the nose cap when the nose cap is removed. This may prevent or minimize any risk of the nose cap and spring flying off. This property of retaining the spring and nose cap also simplifies handling the nose cap by keeping the nose cap, spring and any tubular penetration control together as a cap and penetration control assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Thus it can be seen that the front return spring performs a surprising number of different functions and advantages or combination of different functions and combinations of advantages.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Considerations for Double Needle Syringe Subassembly</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Description to this point has been generic with respect to the different needle subassemblies <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> because both needle forms can be utilized with the structure described. With respect to the double needle subassemblies, however, the penetration depth controller <b>38</b> and the syringe driver <b>36</b> are configured to perform an additional function of penetrating the seal <b>23</b> using penetrating needle <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The seal penetrating task is accomplished as the triggered syringe driver <b>36</b> forces the needle subassembly forwardly. As the subassembly <b>11</b> moves forwardly, the hub <b>21</b> slides into abutment with the syringe abutment surface <b>39</b> of the penetration controller. Continued applied force will cause the associated ampule <b>12</b> to slide on forwardly although the hub <b>21</b> and needles <b>22</b> will remain axially stationary in relation to the abutment <b>39</b>. The forward moving ampule will thus be penetrated by the rearwardly projecting needle <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It should be appreciated that tissue penetration depth is not derogatorily affected by the ampule piercing operation. The forward needle <b>24</b> will move toward the selected penetration depth as the hub <b>21</b> moves to engage the abutment surface <b>39</b>. Continued forward force against the syringe subassembly by the driver <b>36</b> will cause the injection needle <b>24</b> to continue being extended as the rearward needle <b>22</b> penetrates seal <b>23</b>. Hub <b>21</b> is thus seated as full penetration of the forward needle <b>24</b> occurs. Further movement of the driver causes the ampule medication to be dispensed and injected.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The double needle subassembly <b>11</b> may in some cases be preferable to the open communication single needle subassembly <b>10</b>. This can be visualized in that the injection needle will be fully or almost fully penetrated into the flesh before the injected medicine is dispensed into the flesh. With the single needle syringe there is a potential effect of putting medication above the final needle injection depth. So in actual operation the double ended needle may provide more controlled and/or reproducible dispensing of the medicine at the final needle depth. This is what is done in the hospital setting with a manual injection in that the doctor or nurse first places the needle to the desired depth and then presses the plunger. It also prevents loss of medicine as the injection needle passes through intermediate tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The wire diameters for some return springs are suitable for achieving the seating and desired insertion of the ampule by needle <b>22</b> at the same time the injection needles reach their desired final penetration depth. This is caused by the springs either being weak enough (lower spring rate) so that the penetration control sleeve <b>38</b> performs the final seating and insertion of needle <b>22</b> through seal <b>23</b>. In other embodiments, such as when the penetration control is solely by the spring, the spring rate of the return spring is selected to similarly provide for seating and insertion of needle <b>22</b> through seal <b>23</b> also at or near the desired final penetration depth. In either case, this provides proper administration into the tissues which are the intended tissue for the desired final penetration depth.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The injector also performs another important novel function when used with double needle syringe assemblies, such as <b>11</b>. Such assemblies require the needle assembly to be seated manually or with a device holder before performing manual injections. The action of firing the injector carrying a double needle syringe causes the needle assembly to seat or mate with the sealed ampule. Thus a manually useful syringe is automatically formed. This indicates the multiple functions provided by injectors described herein. One function is to automatically administer the first dose. Another function is to seat the double needle syringe assembly with the sealed ampule to form a manually administrable syringe from a dual needle syringe and sealed ampule. A further function is to provide a reliable backup syringe for situations where the syringe may be misused and the second dose is the only dose and can be administered manually for ultimate reliability as may be dictated by difficult situations on the battle field or in other situations.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Storage and Carrying Case</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-36</figref> show a preferred outer or carrying case in which the injectors described herein may be carried in a protected manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows that the preferred carrying case <b>200</b> has a lower or bottom part <b>201</b> and an upper or top part <b>202</b>. The upper and lower parts are joined by a detachable joint used to keep the parts together until such time as an injector, such as injector <b>30</b>, is needed and can be removed from the carrying case. Before explaining the operation of the carrying case, a detailed explanation of the features thereof will now be given.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Carrying case <b>200</b> is designed to carry an injector with the driver and trigger end of the injector inserted into the upper case part <b>202</b>. The muzzle and needle end of the injector is inserted into the lower case part <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the preferred construction shown, a bottom end receptacle <b>205</b> receives the muzzle end of the injector. This is preferably done so that the sheath remover front wall <b>82</b> bears upon a support ledge <b>206</b>. Ledge <b>206</b> is preferably padded with an annular pad <b>209</b>. This construction prevents loading of the exposed needle sheath to forces that develop during movement, handling and mishandling (such as dropping) of the carrying case with injector supported therein.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The length between ledge <b>206</b> and the upper end of the case top piece <b>202</b> is nearly equal but shorter than to the length of the injector between the safety cap or other top end piece and the face surface <b>82</b> of the sheath remover. This construction advantageously provides a small amount of clearance so that the injector is not loaded in an axial manner when stored in the carrying case.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows that the upper part <b>202</b> of the carrying case is advantageously provided with a clip mount <b>206</b> which can be welded to the upper part <b>202</b> or integrally formed therewith during molding of the upper part. The clip mount is used to mount a clip <b>207</b> which is similar to a clip on a pen. The clip is preferably made of metal having spring properties that hold the clip end <b>208</b> against the upper case piece <b>202</b>. The clip may be used to help hold the carrying case in a user's pocket or in luggage, brief cases, cosmetic bags or in or on other parts of a user's garments or accouterments.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref> show the clip mount <b>206</b> in greater detail. Other configurations are also possible. In any design the mount is preferably durable and prevents the clip <b>207</b> or mount <b>206</b> from being broken from the carrying case upper part <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows that the upper and lower case parts are preferably constructed so as to form a detachable joint <b>210</b>. Although a threaded joint is acceptable, it has been found more preferable to have a joint which can be easily and quickly disconnected so that in an emergency the injector can be accessed quickly to administer a medicine without delay. In the construction shown, the bottom part <b>201</b> includes an insertion part <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) which is sized and shaped to fit within an insertion receptacle <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) formed on the open complementary end of the upper case part <b>202</b>. Insertion section <b>220</b> is advantageously provided with a retainer projection or projections <b>221</b> which are received within an annular recess <b>231</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) to provide a catch or mating engagement which retains the two case parts together until needed by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The connection joint <b>210</b> is also advantageously provided with quick release which can be provided in the form of two projections <b>241</b> which are received in complementary receptacles formed on the mating part <b>201</b>. The projections are preferably semicircular to mate into semicircular receptacles <b>242</b> adjacent to the insertion part <b>220</b>. This configuration allows the case to be easily opened by twisting the two case parts <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> relative to each other only a relatively small angular displacement. The semicircular projections and receptacles thus interact to cam the two case parts away from one another and dislodge the retainer projections <b>221</b> from the annular recess <b>231</b>. Thus, by merely twisting the two case parts less than about 1/10th of a rotation, the carrying case is opened and the injector contained therein may be easily removed.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> also shows a shoulder <b>232</b> which is recessed an amount so that the insertion section <b>220</b> extends into the joint receptacle bringing the end surface of the insertion part into engagement with the shoulder <b>232</b>. This also facilitates proper extension of the insertion part into the receptacle so that the projections <b>221</b> properly fit into the annular groove <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Sharps Disposal</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The novel constructions shown herein are also advantageous in that they are adapted to provide a sharps container or containers for holding the syringe assembly after the medicine has been injected. In one form the syringe assembly is removed or withdrawn from the injector through the muzzle end without a needle sheath thereon. The return spring and related parts forward of the syringe assembly are also removed. With the needle end of the syringe first, the syringe is then inserted into the barrel cavity in reverse orientation. The nose cap <b>45</b> without return spring and any penetration control sleeve is then connected or attached to the barrel to secure the syringe therein for safe handling and proper disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In another form the syringe assembly is inserted into the carrying case and the two parts of the carrying case are rejoined. The carrying case acts as a portable sharps container. Thus the invention may also provide a safe means for carrying the syringe and associated needle or needles to a larger sharps disposal container for shipping and disposal. It may also be placed in the carrying case to provide a combination which is extremely resistant to breakage and needle exposure.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Added Methods and Operation</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In addition to the various descriptions given elsewhere herein concerning methods and operation of the inventive components, the following added explanation is provided to supplement the description.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">A method aspect according to the present invention is provided for driving a syringe needle <b>24</b> or <b>17</b> to a selected penetration depth. Aspects of the method will be discussed along with a description of operation and use of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The process initially includes placing the injector in a cocked position. This is preferably done during manufacture. The injector is cocked with the safety cap <b>55</b> removed and pressing the driver bar <b>37</b> rearwardly. The barbs <b>54</b> on the driver shaft are moving and then extending into hole <b>60</b> at the trigger end of firing sleeve <b>57</b>. This performs a compressing of the drive spring <b>50</b> and catching of the barbs <b>54</b> upon annular piece <b>43</b>. Once the device is cocked, the safety cap <b>55</b> can be installed to prevent accidental firing of the driver. This action places the pin <b>56</b> between the barbed legs of the driver bar <b>37</b>. Pin <b>56</b> prevents the barbed ends from moving toward one another and releasing the driver bar or shaft. This readies the apparatus for reception of the selected syringe assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Then the process involves selecting a suitable syringe subassembly. The selecting involves syringes having the desired fluid volume, injection needle length and durability for the intended purposes. In preparation for installation of the syringe subassembly, the plunger rod <b>62</b> may be attached to the syringe plunger <b>14</b>, which allows for performance of a step in which at least one stop collar <b>64</b> may be attached to the plunger rod <b>61</b> for dosage control if the syringe is provided with a multiple dose charge. If the plunger rod <b>61</b> can be adjusted for axial length, then adjusting the plunger rod occurs at this time to provide a desired or consistent discharge volume or dose. Thus a step of determining a dosage to be dispensed from the apparatus is accomplished. Once adjusting and/or determining step has been completed, the dose setting step is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Further preferred methods include inserting a selected syringe subassembly through the open forward end of barrel <b>31</b>. The methods further include locating and installing the syringe subassembly to a desired position within the interior of barrel <b>31</b>. This is accomplished with the nose cap <b>45</b> removed and by sliding the selected syringe subassembly with the open end <b>13</b> first, into the barrel cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The above steps and procedures according to the inventions may in general be accomplished with either the fixed needle or double needle syringe subassemblies <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Further processes according to the invention may also include adjusting penetration depth. Adjusting penetration may be accomplished by selecting a desired penetration controller <b>38</b>, spring penetration control or other penetration control, having a length which positions the abutment surface <b>39</b> at a desired location. This may include a selectable number of penetration stop positions. This can be accomplished while the nose cap <b>45</b> is separated from the barrel <b>31</b> either by placing a selected length of penetration control sleeve <b>38</b> into the nose cap, or by placing a selected penetration control spring <b>75</b>-<b>79</b> into the nose cap. A combination of control spring and fixed control element may also be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the sleeve type penetration controller <b>38</b> is used, and is frictionally positioned within the cap to abut the nose cap interior front wall adjacent the needle aperture <b>34</b>. Return spring <b>71</b> is also placed within sleeve <b>70</b>, prior to installing the controller and spring subassembly into the nose cap interior cavity. This is preferably done with the enlarged end of the spring engaging the front, flanged end <b>170</b> of sleeve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The spring, penetration controller and nose cap assembly can then be installed to the barrel. This is advantageously done in the illustrated embodiments by threading the nose cap onto the barrel until the stop shoulder <b>47</b> is engaged by the rearward end of the nose cap, to assure proper axial spacing between the syringe abutment surface <b>39</b> and the syringe hub. The return spring may be made to abut a ring-shaped stainless steel guide and load distributor <b>171</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>) to help assure accurate firing and less decelerated stopping of the syringe subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Alternatively, a spring of selected compression length (for example, one of the springs <b>75</b>-<b>79</b>), can be used to determine penetration depth. In this aspect, a spring is selected that has a compressed axial length related to a desired needle penetration depth. The selected spring is then mounted to the nose cap <b>45</b>, such as by frictionally sliding the spring into place within the cap and/or along with the guide <b>171</b>. Now the end of the spring facing the syringe hub becomes the syringe abutment surface and the penetration depth will be gauged by the fully compressed length of the spring. The spring may have various number of active coils and in some designs dead coils to help provide desired penetration with sufficient energy for penetration. Once the selected spring is mounted within the nose cap, the assembly can be threaded onto the barrel to a point where the stop shoulder <b>47</b> is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The sheath remover <b>80</b>, if not already in position on the nose cap <b>45</b>, can be slid into position on the nose cap <b>45</b>, to position the sheath engaging fingers <b>82</b> over the sheath. The fingers will perform by flexing, thereby allowing the sheath remover to act by sliding over the extent of the needle sheath <b>19</b> that is exposed forwardly of the nose cap <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Once the nose cap <b>45</b> and sheath remover <b>80</b> are in place and the safety <b>55</b> is attached, the device is loaded, cocked and in a safe condition nearly ready for use. The device can be safely carried or stored in this condition until such time that an injection is to be administered.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The following discussion will describe a single dose use, and a double dose use of the illustrated and other auto-injectors according to the invention. The described uses are both possible using the same or similar procedures with both a single fixed needle syringe subassembly <b>10</b>, or the double needle subassembly <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Prior to injection, the user can remove the protective sheath <b>19</b> from the needle subassembly by moving, such as by sliding, the sheath remover <b>80</b> forwardly. This performs a disengaging step, freeing the sheath remover from the nose cap <b>45</b>. The sheath remover fingers <b>82</b> perform by engaging and catching or binding against the sheath lip <b>89</b>. Further removal of the sheath remover applies axial forces upon the sheath that act by pulling the sheath outwardly through the needle aperture <b>34</b> in the nose cap <b>45</b>. The sheath remover thus performs an action of removing the sheath from the syringe assembly and other parts of the auto injector.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The user may perform a removing step to remove the safety <b>55</b> from the opposite end of the barrel. This is advantageously done by pulling the safety and attached safety pin <b>56</b> from between the barbed legs of the driver bar <b>37</b> or other driver shaft assembly. This arming step involves removing or disabling the safety, thus readying the injection device for dose administration.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">To perform injecting, the user presses the nose cap against the tissue area to be injected. The pressing action causes movement of the firing sleeve <b>57</b> forwardly relative to the barrel. The barbs on the driver bar or shaft assembly will move toward one another collapsing inwardly by engaging the barbs against the walls of opening <b>60</b>. This action releases the driver bar, which is now allowed to move forwardly, such as by sliding, in response to force applied by the driver. This forcing of the driver shaft serves to free the driver release into a driving action wherein the driver bar moves forward and acts by engaging the plunger rod. The driving action also forces the needle subassembly forward. This acts by penetrating the adjacent tissue of the user with the needle and also serves by penetrating any second needle through the seal of the ampule.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As the needle subassembly moves forwardly, the return spring <b>71</b> or selected penetration control springs <b>75</b>-<b>79</b> are acted upon to perform a compressing of the forward spring. The spring, nose cap and any penetration control acts by restraining and stopping the forwardly moving needle hub. In arrangements in which the engaged end of the return spring also constitutes the syringe abutment surface, the selected spring will fully compress at a preselected axial location, stopping needle penetration at the desired penetration depth. The same penetration depth can be effected in arrangements in which the return spring <b>71</b> compresses to a point where the needle hub engages the fixed abutment surface <b>39</b> on the selected sleeve type penetration controller <b>70</b>. Penetration depth is determined by the selected axial position of the abutment surface, whether it be on a penetration control sleeve or by fully collapsing a spring having a desired fully compressed length.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Once the abutment surface or full spring compression point is reached, the drive spring <b>50</b> will continue pushing the plunger rod forwardly, dispensing medicine. In instances where a single needle syringe subassembly <b>10</b> is used, continued forward motion of the plunger will result in injection of the medication. Medication is also injected when a double needle assembly <b>11</b> is provided within the barrel <b>31</b>, but after the ampule is driven forward onto the seal penetrating needle <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Medication will be injected as the spring <b>36</b> performs by forcing the plunger forwardly. Such forcing continues until such time that the plunger shaft engagement head engages any desired stop collar <b>64</b> or stack of stop collars. This marks the end of the injection, and the prescribed dosage amount will have been injected at the selected injection penetration depth. The device is now ready for either recocking and reloading with another syringe subassembly, or for preparation to inject a second dose or subsequent doses of medication which are still within the ampule due to stopping action performed by one or more stop collars <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The penetration depth and the dosage amount are controllable as discussed above. This is advantageously done by provision of the removable or adjustable stop arrangements within the barrel <b>31</b>. The dosage can be selectively controlled by the stop collar <b>64</b> and the adjustable length plunger rod <b>61</b>. Penetration depth can be controlled by selecting the axial position at which the needle hub is stopped within the barrel <b>31</b> as a function of the selected or adjusted penetration control, such as by penetration controller <b>38</b> or the collapsed condition of a penetration control spring.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The novel methods may also include administering a second injection. According to some forms of the invention, this can be done with the same syringe assembly. Alternatively it may be done using a second or subsequent syringe assembly. When using a single syringe, the user performs by removing the nose cap <b>45</b> and sliding or extracting the syringe assembly from the barrel cavity. Any stop collar <b>64</b>, collars or portions thereof can then be removed, such as by laterally removing the collar, collars or portions thereof from the plunger rod, thereby allowing the plunger to be pushed further forward within the ampule to inject another dose. This is preferably used to administer a second dose in a manual mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If the injector is to be used for administering the second dose, then the injector is recocked by removing the syringe assembly and then holding the barrel and depressing the driver using a screw driver or other tool which is extended into contact with the driver bar or shaft <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The safety, such as safety cap <b>55</b>, can now be placed back over the rearward end of the device. This safety placing action causes inserting of safety pin <b>56</b> wherein the driver bar legs form a safety opening receiving the safety pin <b>56</b>. The installed safety pin performs by holding them apart and rendering the device into a safe condition, thereby avoiding unintentional firing.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">When the syringe subassembly <b>10</b> or <b>11</b> is received back in the barrel (such as with stop collar <b>64</b> removed), the ampule will slide back further into the barrel until it abuts with the spring guide sleeve <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The subassembly will be held in this position by the spring <b>71</b> (or by the selected other springs <b>75</b>-<b>79</b>) as the nose cap <b>45</b> is replaced. Replacement of the nose cap completes the needed steps for a second or subsequent use of the device to deliver a second auto-injected dose. If the injection is to be given immediately, there is no need to replace the sheath and sheath remover. However if the second injection is to be delayed for a time, it is possible for the sheath <b>19</b> and sheath remover <b>80</b> to be re-installed even though the needle is now carried safely within the nose cap. Alternatively, the sheath and sheath remover are not reinstalled to reduce risks of injury or contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Administration of the second dose may be accomplished automatically in the same manner as described above. In such operation the driver will function to depress the plunger through the axial distance previously occupied by the stop collar <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The injection apparatuses according to this invention may also allow the administering of a second or subsequent dose in a manual manner. In such alternative mode of operation the syringe assembly is removed from the barrel in a manner the same as or similar to that described above. If the initial dose does not work with sufficient effectiveness, then the user may manually insert the forward needle into the flesh of the patient and depress the plunger rod with the thumb. This procedure may be used when recocking the driver is difficult or impossible, or to speed administration of the second or subsequent doses.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">More than one stop collar can be provided, and more than two injections from the same syringe may be administered. It is also noted that the injection device may be provided without a stop collar, so the syringe would be used only for one auto-injection. Excess medicine can be provided in the syringe for manual administration. Dosage amounts can be more accurately determined by axially adjusting the headed part <b>62</b> of the plunger rod <b>61</b>. In either case, the device can be re-used. In a first mode of operation, the device can be reset by recocking and installing the same syringe previously used. In a second mode of operation, the device can be reset in the manner described above and a second syringe subassembly can be installed and used and operated as done with the first syringe.</p>
