<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to printed products and a method for printing the same, such as banknotes, passports, stocks/bonds, cards, and valuable printed products, which require anti-forgery and anti-alteration functions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Along with the recent increase in image quality of color copying machines and the progress in computerization of color plate making techniques, the forgery means for banknotes or stocks/bonds tends to become rich in variety. Especially, since image input/output devices used in the printing industry are obtaining much higher resolutions, it is becoming easy to extract thin lines or microcharacters used in stocks/bonds. This makes it possible to not only forge printed products by a general commercial printing method using simple four color halftone dots but also accurately extract, by using input/output devices such as scanners, designs using two values of white and black such as ground tints, lathe works, or relief patterns employed for many of current stocks/bonds. Hence, counterfeits are made more realistic by using various special color plates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-205917 filed by the present applicant discloses an image masking method, in which visible and invisible images are generated by uniformly laying out two kinds of halftone dot images on the same plane, aiming at imparting an anti-forgery measure to continuous-tone images. According to this method, a latent image printed by using a functional ink can visually be recognized under predetermined visual recognition conditions corresponding to the optical characteristic of the ink regardless of its type.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">However, such an anti-forgery measure requires expensive functional materials, and therefore, can be applied to only economically viable products from the viewpoint of production cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Using this phenomenon, a halftone dot printed product according to the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of sets of a first region and a second region adjacent to the first region are laid out, the second region has a 2ath region formed by using ink of a predetermined color containing an infrared absorptive dye and a 2bth region formed by using ink which is based on a color similar to the predetermined color and contains no infrared absorptive dye, and in accordance with a ratio of the 2ath region to the 2bth region in each second region, a halftone image is formed by the 2ath regions in the plurality of second regions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The ink used in the 2ath region may be black ink, and the ink used in the 2bth region may be a black-color-based ink containing three primary color inks of cyan, magenta, and yellow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">An area of the first region may be set larger than that of the second region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In the second region, the 2ath region may be surrounded by the 2bth region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Ink containing no infrared absorptive dye may be used in the first region.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Halftone dots can be laid out in each first region by using ink containing no infrared absorptive dye, and a halftone image can be formed by a plurality of first regions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Each second region may be surrounded by the plurality of first regions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The halftone dot printed product can further comprise an image region formed by using ink containing no infrared absorptive dye.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The image region formed by using the ink containing no infrared absorptive dye and the first region and second region may be printed while being at least partially superposed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">A halftone dot printed product printing method according to the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of sets of a first region and a second region adjacent to the first region are laid out, the second region has a 2ath region formed by using ink of a predetermined color containing an infrared absorptive dye and a 2bth region formed by using ink which is based on a color similar to the predetermined color and contains no infrared absorptive dye, and in accordance with a ratio of the 2ath region to the 2bth region in each second region, a halftone image is formed by the 2ath regions in the plurality of second regions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">In the printing industry, halftone dots are always necessary for expressing a halftone dot image, i.e., a continuous-tone image in addition to two values of white and black on a printing paper sheet. This depends on the human visual nature that recognizes an aggregate of small dots as one tone in identifying a grayscale. Since techniques for converting a continuous-tone image into a halftone dot image have been led by major platemakers, users cannot freely create halftone dots by themselves. In the recent plate making industry, however, a postscript (registered trademark) language as one of computer page description languages has been developed, and commercially available application software based on the postscript language is becoming popular. For these reasons, color printed products that integrate characters and images can relatively easily be created. In addition, as the postscript language is widely used, users can launch creating halftone dots.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">However, the technique for directly defining two kinds of halftone dot data in the postscript halftone dot generation method does not suffice for achieving the desired purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">The present inventor has proposed, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-205917, an image processing method of uniformly laying out two kinds of halftone dot images on the same plane by applying the above-described technique.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">More specifically, a halftone dot printed product of the present invention provides a printed product which uses an infrared reflection (transmission) characteristic between a portion printed by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks used in known color inks and a portion printed by black (Bk) ink generally used and in which an invisible image is printed by the black (Bk) ink so that the image cannot be recognized unless a special authentication apparatus such as an infrared camera is used.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">The embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention is not limited to the following embodiments, and various changes and modifications can appropriately be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">An example will be described as the first embodiment in which an image is printed in a predetermined region including a first halftone region having m×m pixels and a second halftone region having n×n pixels such that the image can be seen as a full-color image under ordinary light, and the other continuous-tone image can visually be recognized under a predetermined visual recognition condition different from the visual recognition condition and, for example, by using an infrared camera.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0060">In the first halftone region having m×m pixels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a halftone dot image P<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) laid out by circular dots <b>1</b> is printed by three colors, i.e., cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). In the second halftone region having n×n pixels, a halftone dot image P<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) laid out by circular dots <b>3</b> is printed by only black (Bk) ink containing an infrared absorptive dye. As halftone dots <b>2</b> around the halftone dot image P<b>2</b>, three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) containing no infrared absorptive dye are laid out.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0061">The shape of halftone dots in each halftone region is not limited to the circular shape. Instead, random dots or a special halftone dot shape with a degree of freedom, which is obtained by converting an input image with a design into continuous-tone halftone dots made of halftone dots (halftone screen) by using a special halftone dot generation method proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-268228 filed by the present applicant, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a partial enlarged view dl (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) of the halftone dot image P<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) generated by a technique for directly defining two kinds of halftone dot data in the postscript halftone dot generation method, a partial enlarged view d<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>) of the halftone dot image P<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>), and a partial enlarged view m (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) of an image mask generated by the image processing method of uniformly laying out two kinds of halftone dot images on the same plane, which is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-205917 filed by the present applicant. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref> explain halftone dot images of a cyan (C) plate in the halftone dot images which reproduce a full-color image containing cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> explains that a visible halftone dot image d<b>1</b>′ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) is generated by image arithmetic processing of the partial enlarged view d<b>1</b> of the halftone dot image P<b>1</b> and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask, and an invisible halftone dot image d<b>2</b>′ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) is generated by image arithmetic processing of the partial enlarged view d<b>2</b> of the halftone dot image P<b>2</b> and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask. Image arithmetic processing of the invisible halftone dot image d<b>2</b>′ and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask is also executed to generate a halftone dot image d<b>3</b> to multiply the three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks around the invisible halftone dot image d<b>2</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0064">The inks that can be used in the present invention are not limited to cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). A combination of three colors including two colors having a complementary color relationship and black (Bk) which has an isochromatic relationship to the two colors and contains an infrared absorptive dye can also be implemented. In this case, the first halftone region <b>1</b> having m×m pixels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is laid out by double tones of two colors having a complementary color relationship and containing no infrared absorptive dye. In the second halftone region <b>3</b> having n×n pixels, printing is performed by using only black (Bk) ink which has an isochromatic relationship to the two colors having a complementary color relationship and contains an infrared absorptive dye. The halftone region <b>2</b> around the second halftone region is laid out by solid images of two colors having a complementary color relationship and containing no infrared absorptive dye, which are the same inks as in the first halftone region <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0065">A printed product thus obtained by this embodiment has the structure of a partial enlarged view P<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. In a visible state, the landscape P<b>1</b> of a mountain is recognized, though it is difficult to recognize that the landscape P<b>2</b> of a river is hidden. When this printed product is observed as an infrared photo, the halftone image of the landscape P<b>2</b> of the river can be recognized as a latent image.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0066">An identification card is produced as the second embodiment. In a portion a shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a general halftone dot image which does not use the halftone dot structure of the present invention is laid out by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). A portion b shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is halftone-processed by a method based on the postscript halftone dot generation method by using the halftone dot structure of the present invention. No visible image is laid out in a first halftone region <b>1</b> having m×m pixels. An invisible image is laid out in a second halftone region <b>3</b> having n×n pixels by using only black (Bk) ink containing an infrared absorptive dye. A portion <b>2</b> around the invisible image is constituted by three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) containing no infrared absorptive dye so that the second halftone region having n×n pixels has a black-color-based isochromatic solid image layout.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> explains the halftone dot layout state of each color plate in the second halftone regions <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> having n×n pixels on the portion b shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When these halftone dots are superposed, a black-based uniform tint state is obtained. Hence, an invisible image P<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) cannot visually be recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0068">When an infrared reflection/transmission characteristic between a portion d<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) printed by black (Bk) ink generally used and a portion d<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) printed by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks is used, and an invisible image is printed by the black (Bk) ink, the invisible image P<b>5</b> on the portion b in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> cannot be recognized unless a special authentication apparatus such as an infrared camera is used.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0069">As the third embodiment, an example in which production of an identification card is applied to on-demand printing by the method of the first embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0070">A technique called “on-demand printing” can be interpreted in various ways. It sometimes indicates short-run color printing, a service for continuously executing processes up to bookbinding and providing books just in time, or a service for outputting books one by one. Of such applications of a multifunctional printer, page variable printing takes the best advantage of uniqueness of the on-demand printing. This means to print different contents (information), i.e., “variable data” and quickly and properly provides character or image information specialized to an individual or company through a “paper medium”.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0071">Invisible images according to this embodiment are uniformly laid out on the same planes as those of face images c of individuals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A variable printed product with four plates P<b>6</b>-<b>1</b> to P<b>6</b>-<b>4</b> is obtained by an on-demand printer. Personal names are also simultaneously variable-printed. In this embodiment, the personal names are added as visible information.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0072">When the printed product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is observed by an infrared camera, the invisible images P<b>6</b>-<b>1</b> to P<b>6</b>-<b>4</b> which cannot visually be recognized are variable-printed by the four plates, as indicated by c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">As the fourth embodiment, production of an identification card is applied to on-demand printing by the method of the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">In each portion d shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a general halftone dot image which does not use the halftone dot structure of the present invention is halftone-arranged by cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk) inks. Each portion e shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is halftone-processed by a method based on the postscript halftone dot generation method by using the halftone dot structure of the present invention. The portion e has a black-based uniform tint state. Hence, the invisible image cannot visually be recognized. Invisible images P<b>7</b>-<b>1</b> to P<b>7</b>-<b>4</b> are variable-printed in four plates by an on-demand printer. Personal names are also simultaneously variable-printed. In this embodiment, the personal names are added as visible information.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0075">When the printed product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is observed by an infrared monitor, the invisible images P<b>7</b>-<b>1</b> to P<b>7</b>-<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which cannot visually be recognized, are variable-printed by the four plates. In the second to fourth embodiments, each personal name and company name are also displayed on the infrared monitor. The black (Bk) component of the face image in each portion d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is also displayed. Whether these portions are to be made visible or invisible can freely be arranged as a design, and the present invention is not limited to the second to fourth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0076">According to the present invention, a continuous-tone image is printed by using halftone dots that can hardly be copied by a general plate making device and can be read by a machine, thereby preventing any forgery or alteration of a printed product. According to the present invention, one continuous-tone image can be printed in a predetermined region. In addition, two continuous-tone images which do not overlap each other are equally laid out in a predetermined region without fusing the halftone dots. With this arrangement, security printing by four color printing using cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk), which is widely used in a general market, can be implemented at a low cost. When an on-demand printer is used, individual information such as a character, symbol, pattern, or grayscale image can be printed as an invisible image on each page of printed products which require an anti-forgery and anti-alteration functions, including valuable printed product.</p>
