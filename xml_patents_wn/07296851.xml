<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 10/786,482 filed Feb. 25, 2004 now abandoned, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a vehicle roof, comprising an opening roof panel, which can be moved from a first, closed roof position into a second, fully opened roof position, the roof panel being held essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance from the rest of the vehicle roof in the second roof position, and a lateral guide, the roof panel being guided at least during a part of an opening movement on the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In modern vehicle construction there is a demand for roofs that can be partially opened, giving the largest possible roof opening. This affords the vehicle user driving pleasure comparable to that obtainable with the roof of a full convertible without the disadvantages associated with roofs of such convertibles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 42 38 944 C1 describes a vehicle roof that can be opened and in which an extensive roof panel in a rear area is guided by means of guide pins in guides which are formed in a roof luggage rail. When opening the roof, the roof panel can first be moved by means of a deployment lever into an intermediate position raised at the rear in which the roof panel assumes an inclined position. On reaching the intermediate position, the roof panel can be displaced into a fully opened position toward the rear of the vehicle, the inclination of the roof panel being maintained. This has the disadvantage that the inclination of the roof panel fundamentally prevents the roof panel being displaced by its full length. The proposed solution to this, however, which involves disengaging the deployment lever from the roof panel in the course of the roof opening sequence in order to achieve the greatest possible travel, can also impair the reliability of the drive mechanism due to the increasing mechanical tolerances that occur in use. Furthermore, the proposed vehicle roof does not permit additional positions of the roof panel such as a raised, opened position parallel to the rest of the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE 42 27 400 C2 describes an opening roof part guided on a guide rail which is formed in the manner of a roof rail, parts of a driving device for the roof part being arranged outside a sealed inner space of the vehicle even with the roof part closed, hence those parts of the driving device being unprotected from weather impact.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 195 25 839 C1 describes an opening roof part guided on a guide rail which is formed in the manner of a roof rail, it being impossible to move the roof part by its entire length due to an inclined position of the roof part.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the invention is to specify a vehicle roof in which a maximum and at the same time versatile opening of the roof can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This and other objects are achieved by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A vehicle roof according to the invention comprises an opening roof panel, which can be moved from a first, closed roof position into a second, fully opened roof position, the roof panel being held essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance from the rest of the vehicle roof in the second roof position; a lateral guide, the roof panel being guided at least during a part of an opening movement on the guide; a third, partially opened roof position in which the roof panel is held in a position that is essentially inclined with respect to the rest of the vehicle roof, rising counter to the direction of travel; and an elevating means for elevating a front edge area of the roof panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This achieves the advantage that any inclination of the moveable roof panel does not restrict its travel when it is run from the closed position into the fully opened position, so that an especially large roof opening is ultimately possible. A means of elevating a front edge area of the roof panel is provided, so that by operating the elevating means the roof panel can assume a position parallel to the rest of the roof and at a distance therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment, the roof panel is advantageously connected to a first slide element moveably accommodated in a guide rail and the elevating means comprises a telescopic guide and a control lever having a slotted link and pivotally connected to a second slide element, so that the front edge area of the roof panel can be elevated by simple mechanical means. In particular, the elevation of the front edge area can be accomplished in that the roof panel is forcibly carried by a movement of the first slide element in relation to the second slide element, the second slide element being releasably held by means of a catch lever and capable of being releasably fixed to the first slide element by means of a coupling element.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention a fourth, partially opened roof position is furthermore provided, in which the roof panel is held in a position essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance from the rest of the vehicle roof. This creates, in addition to the third, inclined position, a ventilation position of the roof, which is available as an alternative depending on the road speed and weather conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The lateral guides are formed, for particular preference, on rail elements which stand proud of a surface of the vehicle roof in the manner of roof luggage rails. This represents a simple way of ensuring a significant lift of the roof panel in its rear end area whilst ensuring a secure guide and mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A guide element supporting the roof panel on the guides and moveable in the guides is preferably moveable in relation to the roof panel. The rear end area of the roof panel can thereby be easily raised by movement of the guide elements, without the need to move the roof panel itself rearward.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An especially preferred embodiment of a vehicle roof according to the invention comprises a guide element which is assigned to the lateral guides and can be moved in relation to the roof panel by means of a push rod, a simple actuation of the push rod for elevating a rear edge area of the vehicle roof preferably being achievable in that the push rod is operatively connected to the first slide element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to achieve automatic driving of the vehicle roof, the first slide element can advantageously be driven in particular by a Bowden cable that is capable of transmitting both push and pull forces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment of a vehicle roof according to the invention a further, non-opening, transparent roof element is arranged behind the roof panel, so that an especially large overall roof area is transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A vehicle roof according to the invention preferably has a driveable, opening anti-glare device, which for particular preference comprises a first driveable reel and a second driveable reel. In this way multiple sections of the vehicle roof can be separately covered or exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an especially preferred embodiment of a vehicle roof according to the invention a pivotable wind deflector is furthermore provided on the vehicle roof so that air vortices in the area of the opened roof and corresponding wind noises are effectively reduced. Raising of the wind deflector can preferably be controlled automatically by an opening movement of the roof panel. In an especially simple and therefore advantageous embodiment, the wind deflector is operatively connected to a control lever, the control lever at the same time driving the roof panel when raising it. In a simple mechanical embodiment the control lever can be disengaged from the wind deflector when opening the roof panel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further advantages and features of the vehicle roof according to the invention are set forth in the example of an embodiment described below and in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A preferred example of an embodiment of a vehicle roof according to the invention is described below and explained in more detail with reference to the drawings attached.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The vehicle roof according to the invention comprises a moveable, opening roof panel <b>1</b>, which is preferably composed of glass or a transparent plastic and is arranged in front of a likewise transparent, non-opening roof element <b>2</b> when the roof is in a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The roof panel <b>1</b> comprises a support element <b>1</b><i>a, </i>preferably composed of metal, to which it is fixed by means of fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A raisable wind deflector <b>13</b> is arranged in front of the roof panel <b>1</b> in the direction of travel and is articulated on the body of the vehicle or at a front edge of the roof opening.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Starting from the first closed roof position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the roof panel <b>1</b> can be moved backwards into a partially opened position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, before it reaches a second fully opened roof position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The different positions of the roof panel <b>1</b> are also shown in the simplified cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the roof panel <b>1</b> in its first closed roof position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the roof panel <b>1</b> in its second, fully opened roof position in which the roof panel <b>1</b> is held essentially parallel to the non-opening roof element <b>2</b>, i.e. to the rest of the vehicle roof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the roof panel <b>1</b> in a third, partially openend roof position in which the roof panel <b>1</b> is held in a position that is essentially inclined with respect to the rest of the vehicle roof, rising counter to the direction of travel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the vehicle roof <b>1</b> in a fourth, partially opened roof position in which the roof panel <b>1</b> is held in a position essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance from the rest of the vehicle roof. In its fourth roof position, the roof panel <b>1</b> is not yet moved above the non-opening roof element <b>2</b>. Details of the functioning of moving the roof panel <b>1</b> between its different roof positions are further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the vehicle longitudinal direction the mechanism of the vehicle roof is of essentially symmetrical design on each of the two vehicle sides, so that only one side will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the roof panel <b>1</b> is essentially designed as a profiled rail with a push rod <b>3</b>, which is moveably guided in the support element <b>1</b><i>a</i>, passing through it. A guide element <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which is accommodated and guided so that it can slide in a lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>of a rail element <b>4</b> in the form of a roof luggage rail, is formed at a rear end of the push rod <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for example, the rail element <b>4</b> comprises a rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b</i>, in which the guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>runs straight and essentially horizontally, and a centre foot <b>4</b><i>c</i>, in which the guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>assumes an inclined path and in the closed state terminates in a rear end area of the roof panel <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in particular, shows that the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>can be moved by the push rod <b>3</b> inside a recess <b>3</b><i>b </i>provided in the support element <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The simplified perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the area II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> reveals that the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>is formed on the rail element <b>4</b>, which stands proud of the surface of the vehicle roof, i.e. the surface of the non-opening roof element <b>2</b>. The rail element <b>4</b> is located at a distance from the surface of the vehicle roof, i.e. from the surface of the non-opening roof element <b>2</b>. The lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>runs straight and essentially horizontally in the rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b, </i>wherein the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>assumes an inclined path in the center foot area <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the rail element <b>4</b>. The guide element <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which is attached to the push rod <b>3</b>, is guided within the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rail element <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is laterally fixed on both sides of the opening roof panel <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>can be moved along the recess <b>3</b><i>b </i>and is thus movable in relation to the roof panel <b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the roof panel <b>1</b> is shown in its first closed position (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) wherein the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Upon moving in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle, the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>reaches the different areas of the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a</i>. Since the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is guided within the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>as explained above, the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>supports the roof panel <b>1</b> on the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the rail element <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a front end area <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is articulated on one end of an elongated control lever <b>5</b> by means of a hinge <b>1</b><i>b. </i>The control lever <b>5</b> has a multiply wound slotted link <b>5</b><i>a</i>, which is formed as a slotted opening in the control lever <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is to be understood that the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is simplified in that some parts of the moving mechanism are not shown for reasons of clarification.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A first slide element <b>6</b> has a link pin <b>6</b><i>a, </i>which engages in the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the control lever <b>5</b>. At its end opposite the articulation of the support element <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the control lever <b>5</b> is articulated on a second slide element <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a rear view of that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> wherein the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not shown for reasons of simplification only. It is clearly shown that the control lever <b>5</b> is articulated on the second slide element <b>7</b>. Further, the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b> engages the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the control lever <b>5</b>. The slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>comprises three portions, i.e. a first bent area <b>15</b><i>a</i>, a straight level area <b>15</b><i>b </i>and a straight, inclined area <b>15</b><i>c. </i>The more the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>is guided within the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>in direction of the end of the inclined area <b>15</b><i>c </i>(like in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), the more the control lever <b>5</b> is pivoted upwards relative to the second slide element <b>7</b> (counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), i.e. the more the distal end of the control lever <b>5</b>, which is pivotally connected to the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>(cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), is elevated. The functioning of the different areas of the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>is further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a lower half <b>8</b><i>a </i>of a telescopic guide <b>8</b> is fixed to the first slide element <b>6</b>. An upper half <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the telescopic guide <b>8</b> is accommodated on the lower half <b>8</b><i>a </i>so that it is displaceable in an essentially vertical direction in relation to the latter. The upper half <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the telescopic guide <b>8</b> is articulated on a front end of the push rod <b>3</b> projecting from the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>that guides the push rod <b>3</b>. In total, the telescopic guide <b>8</b> with its connected parts forms out an elevating means <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> for elevating a front region of the roof panel <b>1</b>. This elevating means is independent from the rail element <b>4</b> which is responsible for an elevation of a rear region of the roof panel <b>1</b>. Thereby the elevating means <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> according to the invention as well as the driving cables, driving motors (not shown) and major parts of the roof mechanism can be arranged such that those parts are not exposed to weather influence in a closed state of the roof panel <b>1</b>. In the closed state, those parts are arranged within the inner space of the vehicle with respect to seals of the roof part.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The articulation of the push rod <b>3</b> on the upper half of the telescopic guide <b>8</b><i>b </i>being linked to the first slide element <b>6</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) provides for a connection of the first slide element <b>6</b> to the guide element <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Thus, when the first slide element <b>6</b> is moved in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is moved in relation to the roof panel <b>1</b> if it travels within the recess <b>1</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, both the first slide element <b>6</b> and the second slide element <b>7</b> are each held in a guide rail <b>9</b> aligned essentially in a horizontal direction. The guide rail <b>9</b> is profiled so that the slide elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are each moveable in the longitudinal direction of the rail, the first slide element <b>6</b> being arranged in front of the second slide element <b>7</b> in the direction of travel. On lateral areas of a roof opening corresponding to the roof panel <b>1</b>, the guide rail <b>9</b> is immovably fixed in relation to the rest of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the area I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> reveals that a bearing bracket <b>10</b> is immovably fixed to the guide rail <b>9</b>, the bearing bracket being situated in front of the second slide element <b>7</b> in the direction of travel.

The catch lever <b>12</b> moreover has a cam <b>12</b><i>b, </i>which is capable of interacting with a corresponding extension <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A stop <b>22</b> in form of a block element is fixedly attached to the guide rail <b>9</b> in the vicinity of the bearing bracket <b>10</b>. The functioning of the block element <b>22</b> is further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The articulation of the catch lever <b>12</b> at the bearing bracket <b>10</b> is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.

The wind deflector lever <b>13</b><i>a </i>is in turn connected to the control lever <b>5</b> by way of a drive block <b>14</b>, so that it slides on the former lever, i.e. the drive block is slidably engaged with the control lever <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At a distal end of the control lever <b>5</b> facing the drive block <b>14</b>, a pin <b>19</b> is fixedly attached which is connected with the drive block <b>14</b>. When the distal end of the control lever <b>5</b> is raised due to a backwards sliding movement of the first slide element <b>6</b>, the pin <b>19</b> fixedly connected to the control lever <b>5</b> lifts the drive block <b>14</b> so as to raise the wind deflector lever <b>13</b><i>a </i>therewith.</p>

As depicted by the arrows a and b in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, push forces (arrow a in direction to the front of the vehicle) and pull forces (arrow b in the direction of the rear of the vehicle) can be transmitted by said driving cable <b>21</b> to the first slide element <b>6</b>. Contrary to all other parts as i.e. the second slide element <b>7</b>, the push rod <b>3</b> or the like, the first slide element <b>6</b> is the only part of the vehicle roof which is driven by the driving cable <b>21</b>. For further clarification of the first slide element <b>6</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows the opposite part of the first slide element <b>6</b> in comparison to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The telescopic guide <b>8</b> is in its rest position wherein the upper part <b>8</b><i>b </i>is essentially fully accommodated on the lower part <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a preferred embodiment of the vehicle roof a driveable, opening anti-glare device is furthermore provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, this anti-glare device comprises a first driveable reel <b>15</b> and a second driveable reel <b>16</b>, which are each provided in reel holders <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>a </i>fitted to the guide rails <b>9</b>. The reels <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are carried in the guide rails <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The invention now functions as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With the roof closed, as shown e.g. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the push rod <b>3</b> is maximally displaced in the direction of travel relative to the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>(position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), so that the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is at minimum elevation in the area of the centre foot <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the roof luggage rail <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the first closed roof position, the push rod <b>3</b> is maximally displaced forward, i.e. in the direction of travel, so that the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, in the closed roof position the first slide element <b>6</b> has a maximal distance to the second slide element <b>7</b>, wherein the end of the push rod <b>3</b> opposite to the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is articulated on the upper half <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the telescopic guide <b>8</b>. In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the second slide element <b>7</b> is blocked by the catch lever <b>12</b> because the hook-shaped end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the catch lever <b>12</b> engages with the extension <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the second slide element <b>7</b> (cf. also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Thus, in this position a movement of the second slide element <b>7</b> relative to the guide rail <b>9</b> is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Starting from an arrangement of the mechanism as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, in the course of an opening movement of the roof panel <b>1</b> the first slide element <b>6</b> is now first displaced toward the rear of the vehicle by means of the driving cable <b>21</b> fitted to it. Through the interaction of the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>with the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the area of the first bent area <b>15</b><i>a </i>in the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the control lever <b>5</b>, the roof panel <b>1</b> or the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is slightly elevated in its front edge area (front end area ac of the support element <b>1</b><i>a</i>, cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for example), so that the roof panel <b>1</b> separates from its seals. At the same time a rear edge area of the roof panel <b>1</b> is also slightly elevated by the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>moving slightly upward (depicted by arrow c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rail element <b>4</b> in the area of the centre foot <b>4</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Once this slight initial movement section to release the seal has been exceeded, the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>passes through the straight, level area <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the front edge area of the roof panel <b>1</b> thereby not being elevated further. At the same time the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>performs the remainder of its travel relative to the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>and hence to the roof panel <b>1</b> in the recess <b>3</b><i>b </i>and a further upwardly inclined part of the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a</i>, so that the roof panel <b>1</b> is elevated further in its rear edge area without the roof panel <b>1</b> as a whole moving toward the rear of the vehicle. A ventilation position of the roof panel <b>1</b> is accordingly attained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), in which the roof panel <b>1</b> is essentially raised in its rear edge area and overall is inclined downward in the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The aforementioned ventilation position of the roof panel <b>1</b> is designated as the third, partially opened roof position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The movement of the first slide element <b>6</b> from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> backwards to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is transmitted to the push rod <b>3</b>, which is moved relative to the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>so that the opposite end of the push rod <b>3</b>, to which the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is attached, is moved to the end of the recess <b>3</b><i>b. </i>This end position of the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>with respect to the recess <b>3</b><i>b </i>is depicted by arrow d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The length of the recess <b>3</b><i>b </i>provided in the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is sufficient so that the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>climbs up the center foot region <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rail element <b>4</b>. As a result, if the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>has reached the position of arrow d shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it comes to the end of the center foot area <b>4</b><i>c </i>which is depicted by arrow e in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As a result, the rear edge of the roof panel <b>1</b> is raised up to the level of the rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a further movement of the first slide element <b>6</b> counter to the direction of travel, the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>now passes through the straight, inclined area <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a</i>, as a result of which the control lever <b>5</b> forces the front end of the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>and hence the front edge area of the roof panel <b>1</b> upward. In the process the telescopic guide <b>8</b> connecting the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the first slide element <b>6</b> is extended, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">This also causes the control lever <b>5</b>, the drive block <b>14</b> and the wind deflector lever <b>13</b><i>a </i>to execute a lifting movement of the wind deflector <b>13</b>. Once the control lever <b>5</b> disengages from the drive block <b>14</b>, which has an open guide slot, in the further course of an opening movement, the wind deflector <b>13</b> is held spring-loaded in its raised position by a coil spring (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The roof panel <b>1</b> is not fully displaced in its entirety toward the rear of the vehicle until such time as an essentially horizontal, elevated position of the roof panel <b>1</b> is reached, since the second slide element <b>7</b> is still secured by the catch lever <b>12</b> as at the start of the opening movement.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the first closed roof position and the partially opened third roof position, the first slide element <b>6</b> and the second slide element <b>7</b> are only connected via the control lever <b>5</b> wherein the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b> engages with the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the control lever <b>5</b>. A movement of the second slide element <b>7</b> and also a movement of the roof panel <b>1</b> towards a rear of the vehicle is prevented by the catch lever <b>12</b> being pivotally connected to the guide rail <b>9</b> via the bearing bracket <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> the first slide element <b>6</b> finally encounters the second slide element <b>7</b>, the first slide element <b>6</b> previously having run over the cam <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the catch lever <b>12</b> and elevated the catch lever <b>12</b> in order to release the second slide element <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The pivoting of the control lever <b>5</b> upwardly (clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> for example) leads to a lifting of the front end area <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>so as to raise the front edge of the roof panel <b>1</b>. In the position of the first slide element <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the front end area <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>and thus the front edge of the roof panel <b>1</b> are raised up to the level of the rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Simultaneously, the push rod <b>3</b>, which is connected to the first slide element <b>6</b> via the telescopic guide <b>8</b>, is moved to the rear direction within the support element <b>1</b><i>a. </i>This makes the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>moving within the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a</i>. As explained above, in the position of the first slide element <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is moved to the position indicated by the arrow d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, so that the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is guided within the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>up to the position indicated by the arrow e in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when the first slide element <b>6</b> comes into the vicinity of the second slide element <b>7</b>, the extension <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b> abuts against the cam <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the catch lever <b>12</b> so that the catch lever <b>12</b> is lifted upwards, i.e. in the counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. This lifting of the catch lever <b>12</b> disengages its hook-shaped end <b>12</b><i>a </i>from the extension <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the second slide element <b>7</b>. As a result, the second slide element <b>7</b> is no longer blocked by the catch lever <b>12</b> and is movable relative to the guide rail <b>9</b> in the longitudinal direction, respectively. When the first slide element <b>6</b> is further moved to the rear direction, i.e. counter to the direction of travel (right direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), it abuts against the second slide element <b>7</b> so that both elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> travel together to the rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the first slide element <b>6</b> abuts against the second slide element <b>7</b>, the latter is still blocked by the catch lever <b>12</b>. The catch lever <b>12</b>, which is connected to the guide rail <b>9</b> via the bearing bracket <b>10</b>, is raised by the extension <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b> in form of a slant tip end, so as to release the second slide element <b>7</b>. Subsequently, the movement of the first slide element <b>6</b> towards a rear of the vehicle also moves the released second slide element <b>7</b> in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Once the two slide elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> have together traveled beyond the starting position of the second slide element <b>7</b>, the coupling element <b>11</b> is furthermore released, which thereby engages in a corresponding recess <b>6</b><i>c </i>in the first slide element <b>6</b>. In the subsequent closing movement of the vehicle roof, this engagement allows the second slide element <b>7</b> to be also carried in this direction by the single driven first slide element <b>6</b> which is the only driven part. When the starting position of the second slide element <b>7</b> during the closing movement is reached again, a release of the first slide element <b>6</b> from the second slide element <b>7</b> is achieved due to the coupling element <b>11</b> encountering the corresponding stop <b>22</b> in the vicinity of the bearing bracket <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The release of the coupling element <b>11</b> means that once the first slide element <b>6</b> abuts against the second slide element <b>7</b>, the coupling element <b>11</b> being articulated on the second slide element <b>7</b> is moved off the block element <b>22</b> so as to engage in the corresponding recess <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The functioning of the block element <b>22</b> is to serve as a rest surface for the tip end of the coupling element <b>11</b> as long as the second slide element <b>7</b> is secured by the catch lever <b>12</b>. This means that the hook-shaped end <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the coupling element <b>11</b> rests on the block element <b>22</b> as long as the first slide element <b>6</b> has not reached the second slide element <b>7</b>. As soon as the first slide element <b>6</b> abuts against the second slide element <b>7</b> so that both elements travel together in the rear direction, the hook-shaped end <b>11</b><i>a </i>is moved off the block element <b>22</b> so that the coupling element <b>11</b> pivots downwards, i.e. in the counterclockwise direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a rear view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrating the first and second slide elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, wherein some parts, for example the control lever <b>5</b> are omitted for reasons of simplification only. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the coupling element <b>11</b> locks with the first slide element <b>6</b> by pivoting downwards in the clockwise direction when the first and second slide elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> have traveled together beyond the starting position of the second slide element <b>7</b>. As a result, the hook-shaped end <b>11</b><i>a </i>engages with the corresponding recess <b>6</b><i>c </i>in the first slide element <b>6</b> so as to lock the second slide element <b>7</b> to the first slide element <b>6</b>. Thus, the second slide element <b>7</b> is coupled to the first slide element <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the first slide element <b>6</b> and the second slide element <b>7</b> travel together to the rear of the vehicle, the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>being in the position of arrow d shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is simultaneously guided within the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>backwards to the rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b </i>as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In its fully opened position, i.e. the second roof position, the roof panel <b>1</b> reaches the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for example.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">During a closing movement of the vehicle roof, the first slide element <b>6</b> is moved forwardly, i.e. in the direction of travel. Because of the coupling by means of the coupling element <b>11</b>, the second slide element <b>7</b> is moved forwardly together with the first slide element <b>6</b>. If the hook-shaped end <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the coupling element <b>11</b> comes in contact again with the block element <b>22</b>, the coupling element <b>11</b> is moved upwardly so as to disengage from the recess <b>6</b><i>c</i>. This decouples the second slide element <b>7</b> from the first slide element <b>6</b>. Further, when the first slide element <b>6</b> travels further forwardly independent from the second slide element <b>7</b>, the extension <b>6</b><i>b </i>comes out of engagement from the cam <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the catch lever <b>12</b>. As a result, the catch lever <b>12</b> drops down (i.e. in the clockwise direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) and engages with the extension <b>7</b><i>a </i>so as to secure the second slide element <b>7</b> with respect to the guide rail <b>9</b> and the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The position of the drive mechanism of the vehicle roof according to the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> therefore corresponds to a fully opened position of the roof panel <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for example) and also to a partially opened position in which the roof panel <b>1</b> has been only partially moved toward the rear of the vehicle and is disposed essentially parallel and elevated in relation to the rest of the vehicle roof (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The partially opened position, in which the roof panel <b>1</b> is held in a position essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance from the rest of the vehicle roof, is designated as a fourth position and is shown e.g. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this roof position, the drive mechanism is also in the position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. As explained above, because of the interaction of the link pin <b>6</b><i>a </i>with the straight inclined area <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the slotted link <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the front end area <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the support element <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is connected by the hinge <b>1</b><i>b </i>to the control lever <b>5</b>, is lifted up to the level of the rear rail area <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the rail element <b>4</b>. This brings the roof panel <b>1</b> into the position essentially parallel to the rest of the vehicle roof and at a distance therefrom, since the rear edge of the roof panel <b>1</b> is lifted simultaneously by moving the guide element <b>3</b><i>a </i>inside the lateral guide <b>4</b><i>a </i>backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A kinematic characteristic of the vehicle roof according to the invention is that the roof panel <b>1</b> is first elevated to a position essentially parallel to the rest of the roof (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wherein the drive mechanism is in the position of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, for example) before the roof panel <b>1</b> is moved towards the rear of the vehicle, into its fully opened position as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At the start of the opening movement of the roof panel <b>1</b>, the second slide element <b>7</b> is secured with respect to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle roof by said catch lever <b>12</b> until the catch lever <b>12</b> is released by the interaction of the extension <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the first slide element <b>6</b> with the cam <b>12</b><i>b. </i>Thus, the roof panel <b>1</b> is not moved towards the rear of the vehicle until it has reached its fourth roof position. Subsequently, after the first slide element <b>6</b> abuts against the second slide element <b>7</b>, a common movement of the first and second slide elements <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> towards the rear of the vehicle is possible. When the first slide element <b>6</b> travels backwards together with the second slide element <b>7</b>, the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is also moved backwards so as to open the vehicle roof. Simultaneously, the drive block <b>14</b> being attached to the control lever <b>5</b> which is hinged to the support element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is also moved to the rearward direction so that is comes out of engagement of the wind deflector lever <b>13</b><i>a</i>. By means of a coil spring or the like, the wind deflector <b>13</b> is then held in its raised position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for example,</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The vehicle roof according to the invention further comprises a cassette holder <b>23</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The cassette holder <b>23</b> can be pre-assembled with the movable roof part <b>1</b> and the non-opening roof part <b>2</b> and is adapted to an opening provided in the vehicle roof. Thus, the cassette holder <b>23</b> can be fitted into this opening of the vehicle roof so as to mount the roof parts <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and the corresponding driving mechanism to the vehicle roof.</p>
