<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,125 discloses a washing liquid distribution system employing spiral separators. Internally a plurality of dampening receivers receive the washing liquid into a top portion and provide a low kinetic energy liquid flow output onto the material being separated via the distribution system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Control of the flow in many separation systems is accomplished via pet-cocks or valves in line with a supply hose. Because the outlet flow is to be very low, very small openings are provided. The disadvantage with this approach is that the openings are subject to clogging. A larger opening can be used to prevent clogging but the very low flow required to aid in separation results in an unstable liquid stream.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, the outlet from a receiver is via a small passageway formed in a removable and rotatable insert mounted in the bottom of the receiver. The inserts provide outlet holes that can be elongated in the vertical or horizontal or both directions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inserts provide a means whereby the outlet stream can be directed towards the vertical divider that separates the separator trough from the concentrate trough with the stream having a horizontal component. The horizontal component of the flow can be directed upstream or downstream as desired in the circumstances. The small head developed within the insert provides for a stable flow stream. In addition, a larger outlet opening prevents clogging.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With respect to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates receiver cup <b>10</b> having an inlet flow pipe <b>11</b>. The specific construction of cup <b>10</b> may vary In the circumstances. In particular, horizontal pipe <b>12</b> (shown in broken line) may be provided to direct some of the incoming flow to another cup <b>10</b> as illustrated in Pat. No. 6,524,125, referenced hereinabove and incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The receiver cup <b>10</b> preferably is formed to provide a recess <b>13</b> into which the directional nozzle formed as an insert <b>14</b> will be mounted. Recess <b>13</b> provides a collection point for the incoming liquid to stabilize the liquid flow prior to exiting via horizontally disposed outlet opening <b>15</b>. The diameter, shape, and angle with the horizontal of the outlet <b>15</b> vary with the specific separation application.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The upper portion <b>16</b> of insert <b>14</b> is formed as a flange <b>17</b> that fits tightly into recess <b>13</b>. The lower portion <b>18</b> is sized in height to create a head of approximately 1.0″ to provide for a stable stream. The lower tapered portion <b>19</b> assists in directing the flow to outlet <b>15</b>. Preferably, insert <b>14</b> has a pair of oppositely disposed flats <b>20</b> to allow the insert <b>14</b> to be rotated to position outlet <b>15</b> in the desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the relationship of receiving cups <b>10</b> in accord with the present invention with respect to the spiral separator. With regard to the upper flight <b>30</b>′, an upper receiving cup <b>10</b> feeds water onto the flight <b>30</b>′ as does a lower cup <b>10</b>. An outlet pipe <b>12</b> is not used in this particular configuration. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,125.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lower flight <b>30</b>″(preferably identical to upper flight <b>30</b>′) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> employs an upper receiving cup <b>10</b> that includes outlet pipe <b>12</b> to feed into a lower cup <b>10</b> which provides effluent only to the flight <b>30</b>″.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each receiving cup <b>10</b> is identical but may employ different nozzles such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref> as desired in a specific application. Incoming flow is directed by the hoses <b>26</b>′ and pipe <b>28</b>′ that may be of any appropriate size or number for the specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A side view of insert <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Flange <b>17</b> is formed to provide a smooth rounded inlet portion <b>21</b> to further stabilize the incoming flow downwardly through passageway <b>22</b> for greater stability of the outlet stream. The insert <b>14</b> is formed of material that is appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an alternate insert <b>23</b> having a rounded inlet <b>24</b> and flange <b>25</b> that fits tightly into a recess <b>13</b> of a cup <b>10</b>. Flats <b>26</b> provide a means for grasping the insert <b>23</b> and rotating it to a desired position. The outlet <b>27</b> is a vertically elonoated generally rectangular slot that provides a horizontally directed flow.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another embodiment of a directional nozzle in accord with the present invention is illustrated by insert <b>28</b>. A rounded inlet <b>29</b> and flange <b>30</b> fits tightly into recess <b>13</b> of a cup <b>10</b>. Flats <b>31</b> allow for rotation of the insert <b>28</b>. Outlet <b>32</b> is formed as a curved slot to provide a horizontally directed outlet stream.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of a nozzle is illustrated by insert <b>33</b> having a rounded inlet <b>34</b> and flange <b>35</b> fits into recess <b>13</b>. Flats <b>36</b> provide a grasping surface as before. Two oppositely disposed outlets <b>37</b> are provided to allow for two oppositely disposed horizontal outlet streams.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, an embodiment of an insert <b>38</b> having outlets formed as angled slits <b>42</b> formed therein. Inlet <b>39</b>, flange <b>40</b>, and flats <b>41</b> are as before. The slits <b>42</b> provide a substantially horizontal fan-like outlet stream. Alternatively the slits <b>42</b> may be horizontal as shown by broken lines <b>43</b> or any angle between the approximately 45° angle of slits <b>42</b> and slits <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The particular insert chosen for a given application will depend on the material that is being processed as understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
