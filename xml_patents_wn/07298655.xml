<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to memory circuits, and more particularly, the present invention relates circuits and methods for isolating memory cells of a memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional memory device, such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown, a plurality of memory cell arrays <b>10</b> and sense amplifiers <b>20</b> are alternately arranged. Each memory cell array <b>10</b> is associated with a row decoder <b>30</b> which generates word line signals (WL) for selection of word lines of the corresponding memory cell array <b>10</b>. Likewise, a column decoder <b>50</b> generates column select signals (CSL) for selection of bits lines of the memory cells arrays <b>10</b>. Also, as shown, each sense amplifier <b>20</b> is controlled by control signals (CONTROL) generated by respective a control circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is characterized by the sharing of each sense amplifier <b>20</b> between two adjacent memory cell arrays <b>10</b>. Isolation circuitry contained in each sense amplifier <b>20</b> is utilized to isolate one of the adjacent memory cell arrays <b>10</b> while the sense amplifier <b>20</b> is being used in conjunction with the other of adjacent memory cell arrays. This is explained in more detail with reference to the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a sense amplifier region is operatively connected between a first memory cell array block <b>1</b> (BLOCK<b>1</b>) and a second memory cell array block <b>2</b> (BLOCK<b>2</b>). Each block contains complimentary memory cells C<b>0</b> and C<b>1</b> connected between source voltage VP and complimentary bit lines BLn and BLBn (where n=0, 1, 2, . . . ), respectively. A column decoder <b>50</b> receives a pre-decoded column address signal DCA and generates corresponding column select signals CSLn for selection of the complimentary bit lines BLn and BLBn. Also, as shown, the complimentary memory cells C<b>0</b> and C<b>1</b> are respectively read/write enabled by word lines WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b> (or word lines WL<b>510</b> and <b>511</b>), which in turn are connected to a row decoder <b>30</b> which decodes pre-decoded row address signals DRA. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only shows a small portion of a typical memory block, and in reality each memory block includes numerous pairs of word lines and bit lines connected to numerous pairs of complimentary memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sense amplifier region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes equalization transistors E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b> and E<b>3</b> which form an equalization circuit connected as shown between each pair of bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b>. This equalization circuit is responsive to an equalization control signal PEQL (or PEQR) generated by an equalization control signal generator <b>41</b> (PEQL GEN. and PEQR GEN.) to equalize, or pre-charge, the bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b> to VCC/2 (=VBL). Generally, this is done prior to accessing (e.g., reading) the memory cells connected to the bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Transistors P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> and N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b> are connected as shown to form a sense amplifier which functions in a well know manner to amplify a voltage differential across the bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b>. The sense amplifier is enabled by sense enable voltages LA and LAB generated by amplification voltage generators <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> (LA GEN. and LAB GEN.).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Transistors S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are isolation transistors which are responsive to isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR generated by an isolation control signal generator <b>42</b> (PISOL GEN. and PISOR GEN.) in response to block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b>. The isolation transistors S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are controlled to selectively isolate one of the blocks <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> while the sense amplifier is being used for the other of the blocks <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Transistors L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are column select transistors which are used to selectively couple the bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b> to input/output lines IO and IOB, respectively. These transistors L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are activated in response to the column select signals generated by the column decoder <b>50</b>. For example, column select signal CSL<b>0</b> controls coupling of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b> to the input/output lines IO and IOB, column select signal CSL<b>1</b> controls coupling of the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BLB<b>1</b> to the input/output lines IO and IOB, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram for explaining the generation of the word line signals WL and the column select signals CSL. Externally supplied command and address signals are applied to terminals of the memory device as shown. A command decoder <b>60</b> is response to the command signals to generate a row access master signal PR and a column access master signal PC. An address buffer <b>70</b> receives the externally supplied address, and outputs a row address RA and a column address CA according to the externally supplied address and the row and column access master signals PR and PC. Pre-decoders <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> convert the row and column address signals RA and CA to pre-decoded row and column address signals DRA and DCA, respectively. These pre-decoded signals are then decoded by main decoders <b>90</b> and <b>95</b> to generate the word line signal WL and the column select signal CSL, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing the generation of the isolation control signals, the equalization signals, and the sense enable signals of the memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pre-decoder <b>80</b> outputs pre-decoded row address signals DRA. Bits DRAij of the pre-decoded row address signal DRA are applied to the main decoder <b>90</b> which, as described above, outputs a corresponding word line signal WL. The remaining bits DRAkl of the pre-decoded row address signal DRA (typically, the most-significant bits of DRA) are used for block selection and applied to the block generator <b>100</b>. The block generator <b>100</b> outputs a block selection signal PBLOCK<b>1</b>,<b>2</b> which is indicative of one of the two memory array blocks <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the memory device. Although two blocks are described in this example, the memory device may include many more memory array blocks (e.g., 16 or more).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the isolation control signal generator <b>42</b> controls isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR in accordance with the block selection signal PBLOCK<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>. Likewise, the equalization control signal generator <b>41</b> controls equalization control signals PEQL and PEQR in accordance with the block selection signal PBBLOCK<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Meanwhile, the sense control circuit <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> outputs a sense enable master signal PS in accordance with the row access master signal PR (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the row address signal bits DRAij or DRAkl. The sense enable master signal PS is received by sense amplifier control circuits <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, which respectively output sense amplifier control signals PS_PSA and PS_NSA. These control signals PS_PSA and PS_NSA are used to respectively control the voltage level of the sense enable voltages LA and LAB illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary circuit diagram of the isolation control circuit generator <b>42</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a logic table of the same. Generally, at least one of the block signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> is isolation enabled (Low) at all times. Here, isolation enabled means that the corresponding memory block is isolated from the sense amplifier. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and as shown in the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when PBLOCK<b>1</b> is enabled (Low) and PBLOCK<b>2</b> is non-enabled (High), isolation signal PISOL becomes VSS (Low) and isolation signal PISOR becomes VPP (High). As such, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cell array block <b>1</b> is isolated from the sense amplifier circuitry, while cell array block <b>2</b> is coupled to the sense amplifier circuitry. In contrast, when PBLOCK<b>1</b> is non-enabled (High) and PBLOCK<b>2</b> is enabled (Low), isolation signal PISOL becomes VPP (High) and isolation signal PISOR becomes VSS (Low). Thus, the cell array block <b>1</b> becomes coupled to the sense amplifier circuitry, and cell array block <b>2</b> is isolated from the sense amplifier circuitry. When both PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> are non-enabled (Low), for example during a standby mode, then the circuit block identified by reference number <b>150</b> functions to pre-charged and equalized PISOL and PISOR to voltage VCC.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a simplified circuit diagram for explaining a charge sharing operation of a conventional memory device. The bit lines BL and BLB of the device include pre-charged capacitors CBL_CELL and CBL_SA (CBLB_CELL and CBLB_SA). As examples, CBL_CELL is about 3 times the size of CCELL of the memory cell, and CBL_CELL is greater than the size of CBL_SA of the sense amplifier. In operation, assume the capacitor of memory cell C<b>0</b> contains a data “1”. When the word line WL is enabled, the charges stored in the various capacitors of bit line BL are “shared” as depicted by the two-headed arrow. The result is a small increase (e.g., 100 mV or more) in the voltage of bit line BL which is to be detected by the sense amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing diagram of the charge sharing operation of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, again in the case where cell C<b>0</b> contains data “1”. In an isolation (ISO) activation period, isolation control signal PISOL is increased from VCC to VPP, and isolation control signal PISOR is decreased from VCC to VSS. At the end of the ISO activation period, the voltage of word line WL is increased from VSS to VPP. As such, the capacitor CCELL becomes coupled to the bit line BL, and the resultant charge sharing operation causes the voltage of bit line BL to increase from VBL to VBL+ΔVBL. Note that the voltage of bit line BLB remains at VBL.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to speed up the bit line sense operation, it is generally necessary to lower the threshold voltages of the sense amplifier transistors. However, a trade-off situation arises in that lower threshold voltages result in increased leakage current, which in turn reduces an effective sense interval of the sense operation. The dashed lines shown in the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depict sense amplifier leakage current paths in the case where bit line BL is at voltage VBL+ΔVBL, and bit line BLB is at voltage VBL. The result of this leakage is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. After the charge sharing operation which follows activation of the isolation control signal PISO, the voltage level of bit line BL gradually decreases as a result of the sense amplifier leakage. The line identified by circle-<b>2</b> of the figure shows the bit line voltage characteristic in the case where the VCC voltage (i.e., the sense amplifier transistor thresholds) is reduced relative to that of the line identified by circle-<b>1</b> of the figure. The leakage is more pronounced at lower thresholds, and accordingly, the voltage drop is more rapid. As shown, the result is a significantly reduced sensing interval. As the trend in the industry is for lower and lower VCC operating voltages, sense amplifier leakage is becoming increasingly problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the meantime, a number of bit line bridge defects tend to occur in the manufacture of the memory device. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, these defects are generally of two types. The first type (circle-<b>1</b>) results from a short or leakage between bit lines of the same bit line pair (e.g., BL<b>0</b> and BLB<b>0</b>). The second type (circle-<b>2</b>) results from a short or leakage between bit lines of adjacent bit line pairs (e.g., BLB<b>0</b> and BL<b>1</b>). As is schematically shown, the bit lines of the memory cell array are packed more densely than those in the sense amplifier regions, and accordingly, bit line bridge defects are relatively common. As such, the memory device is thoroughly tested after manufacture for the presence of bit line bridge defects, and techniques are known for replacing defective bit lines with spare bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One problem with testing for bit line bridge defects, however, is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish bit line leakage from the leakage of the sense amplifier. As mentioned above, sense amplifier leakage causes a gradual drop in ΔVBL. The leakage attended by a bit line bridge defect can similarly reduce ΔVBL. Accordingly, it has become to difficult identify bit line bridge defects, particularly in the case where low threshold sense amplifier transistors are utilized.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to preferred but non-limiting embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a circuit diagram of an isolation control signal generator according to one embodiment of the present invention. Inputs to the generator include the block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b>, and control signals CON<b>0</b>, CON<b>1</b> and CON<b>2</b>. The block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> may, for example, be generated in the same manner as discussed previously in connection with the related art. The control signals CON<b>0</b>, CON<b>1</b> and CON<b>2</b> may, for example, be externally generated and applied to one or more pin terminals or pad terminals of the memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the logic OR of control signal CON<b>0</b> and inverted block selection signal PBPLOCK<b>1</b> is applied to the gate of transistor P<b>3</b>, and the inverted signal thereof is applied to the gate of transistor N<b>4</b>. Similarly, the logic OR of control signal CON<b>0</b> and inverted block selection signal PBPLOCK<b>2</b> is applied to the gate of transistor P<b>4</b>, and the inverted signal thereof is applied to the gate of transistor N<b>3</b>. Accordingly, when the control signal CON<b>0</b> is Low, the isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR are dependent on the block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> in the same manner as described previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, when CON<b>0</b> is High, the transistors P<b>3</b>, N<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b> and N<b>4</b> are all maintained in an OFF state regardless of the block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b>. As such, the isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR become dependent on the control signals CON<b>1</b> and CON<b>2</b>. That is, when CON<b>1</b> is High and CON<b>2</b> is Low, transistors P<b>5</b> and N<b>6</b> are OFF, and transistors N<b>5</b> and P<b>6</b> are ON. The isolation control signal PISOL thus becomes VSS, and the isolation control signal PISOR becomes VCC or VPP<b>2</b>. Here, VPP&gt;VPP<b>2</b>&gt;VCC. As examples only, VPP≈2.1v, VPP<b>2</b>≈1.4v, and VCC≈1.0v. In contrast, when CON<b>1</b> is Low and CON<b>2</b> is High, transistors P<b>5</b> and N<b>6</b> are ON, and transistors N<b>5</b> and P<b>6</b> are Off. The isolation control signal PISOL thus becomes VCC or VPP<b>2</b>, and the isolation control signal PISOR becomes VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation of the isolation control signal generator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is summarized in the logic tables of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the control signal CON<b>0</b> is Low, the circuit operates in a normal operating mode which may, for example, be the same as that of the conventional memory device already discussed. On the other hand, when the control signal CON<b>0</b> is High, the normal operational mode is effectively blocked, and the external control mode is activated. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when CON<b>0</b> is High, and CON<b>1</b> is Low and CON<b>2</b> is High, the isolation control signal PISOL is enabled (High at VCC or VPP<b>2</b>). In contrast, when CON<b>0</b> is High, and CON<b>1</b> is High and CON<b>2</b> is Low, the isolation control signal PISOR is enabled (High at VCC or VPP<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A timing diagram of the normal operational mode (where control signal CON<b>0</b> is Low) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Initially, in a standby state, signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> are Low (VSS), which means that isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR are at VCC (see the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Also, in this state, equalization control signals PEQL and PEQR are held at VCC.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, block selection signal PBLOCK<b>1</b> goes to VCC. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, this causes isolation control signal PISOL to go High (VPP) and isolation control signal PISOR to go Low (VSS). As such, the memory array block <b>1</b> is connected to the sense amplifier (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the memory array block <b>2</b> is isolated from the sense amplifier. In addition, equalization control signal PEQL goes Low (VSS), thus deactivating the equalization and pre-charge circuit on the side of the memory array block <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the word line signal WL is raised from Low (VSS) to High (VPP). As a result, a charge sharing operation causes the voltage of bit line BL to be raised to VBL+ΔVBL (it is assumed here that a memory cell connected to bit line BL contains a charge representing a data “1”). During this state, the sense interval of the sensing operation occurs as discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Then, the sense enable voltage LA is increased from VBL to VCC and the sense enable voltage LAB is decreased from VBL to VSS. As such, the voltage of bit line BL becomes VCC and the voltage of bit line BLB becomes VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The normal operational mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is the same as that found in the conventional memory device as discussed previously. However, when screening for defective bit lines, it is difficult to discriminate the voltage behavior of defective bit lines from the voltage characteristics resulting from leakage in the sense amplifier circuitry. Accordingly, this embodiment of the present invention is configured to run in the externally controlled operational mode as shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, in an initial state, block selection signals PBLOCK<b>1</b> and PBLOCK<b>2</b> are at VSS (Low), control signal CON<b>0</b> is at VSS (Low), control signals CON<b>1</b> and CON<b>2</b> are at VPP (High), isolation control signals PISOL and PISOR are at VCC, and equalization control signals PEQL and PEQR are at VCC.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, upon the selection of memory block <b>1</b>, the block selection signal PBLOCK<b>1</b> goes to VCC, control signal CON<b>0</b> goes to VPP, control signal CON<b>2</b> goes to VSS, and PISOL goes to VSS. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In this state, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the memory block <b>1</b> is isolated from the sense amplifier by the isolation transistor (connected to PISOL) on the left side of the sense amplifier region, and the equalization circuit (connected to PEQL) connected ton the left side of the sense amplifier region is deactivated. Further, the sense amplifier is allowed to be pre-charged by the equalization circuit (connected to PEQR) on the right side of the sense amplifier region via the other isolation transistor (connected to PISOR).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, the word line signal WL is raised from Low (VSS) to High (VPP). As a result, a charge sharing operation causes the voltage of bit line BL of the memory block to be raised to VBL+ΔVBL (it is assumed here that a memory cell connected to bit line BL contains a charge representing a data “1”). Note, however, that since the sense amplifier is isolated from the memory block <b>1</b>, the voltage of the bit line BL of the memory block does not fall as a result of leakage of the sense amplifier. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, where the bit line BL voltage is maintained until the isolation control signal PISO is increased to a high voltage level. In the meantime, the voltage of the bit line BL at the sense amplifier remains at VBL as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After the charge is transferred to the bit line BL in the cell region of the memory block <b>1</b>, but prior to enabling of the sense amplifier, the control signal CON<b>0</b> goes to VSS (Low) and the control signal CON<b>2</b> goes to VPP (High). This causes the isolation control signal PISOL to become VPP (High) and the isolation control signal PISOR to become VSS. As such, again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the isolation transistor (connected to PISOL) electrically connects the bit line BL of the memory block <b>1</b> to the sense amplifier, and the other isolation transistor (connected to PISOR) electrically isolates the second memory block <b>2</b> from the sense amplifier. As such, the memory cell charge previously transferred to the bit line BL of the memory block is further transferred to the sense amplifier. Charge sharing results in an increase of the voltage of the bit line BL in the sense amplifier region to increase to VBL+ΔVBL<b>2</b>. Likewise, the voltage of the bit line BL in the cell region of the memory block <b>1</b> decreases to VBL+ΔVBL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the sense amplifier is enabled by the sense enable signal LA increasing from VBL to VCC, and by the sense enable signal LAB decreasing from VBL to VSS. As a result, the voltage of the bit line BL becomes VCC, and the voltage of the bit line BLB becomes VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The operational mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is at least partially characterized by the delayed activation of the isolation transistor after charge has been transferred to the bit line BL within the memory block <b>1</b>. As a result, the amount of time in which the leakage current of the sense amplifier can impact the bit line voltage is substantially reduced. In other words, the short time period between activation of the isolation transistor and enablement of the sense amplifier does not allow for the sense amplifier leakage to be a factor when testing the bit line.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram of a circuit which may be used to generate the control signals CON<b>0</b>, CON<b>1</b> and CON<b>2</b>, and the sense enable signal SES, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a timing diagram showing the operation of the same. When the first block <b>1</b> is selected (i.e., PBLOCK<b>1</b> is High, and PBLOCK<b>2</b> is Low), and control signal CON<b>0</b> becomes High, then CON<b>1</b> becomes Low and CON<b>2</b> remains High. As a result, node A becomes High. Then, sense enable signal PS goes High and inverted sense enable signal PSB goes Low. Thereafter, when control signal CON<b>0</b> goes Low, the control signal CON<b>1</b> goes High, causing node A to become Low. Then, after a delay caused by the NOR gate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the sense enable signal SES goes High. This delay corresponds to the timing between the two vertical dashed lines appearing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a functional block diagram of the normal operation mode of an embodiment of the present invention. As explained previously, the normal operational mode may be the same as that of the related art. In this case, the address DRA is used to control the PBLOCK signal generation and to enable the word WL. The PBLOCK signals are used to control the isolation control signal PISO generation. In addition, the PBLOCK signals, together with the row active command PR, are used to control the sensing control circuit. The sensing control circuit includes a sensing control block which is responsive to the row active command PR, and a PSA/NSA control circuit that is responsive to the sensing control block. Finally, the bit line sense amplifier BLSA is controlled according to the sense amplification lines LA and LAB, the isolation control signal PISO, and the word line signal WL.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a functional block diagram of the externally controlled operational mode of an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, this mode is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, except that the isolation control signal PISO generation is selectively controlled base on an external control signal received from a PAD or PIN terminal. In addition, the sensing control circuit is selectively controlled according to this external control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, embodiments of the present invention delay activation of the isolation transistor until after a memory charge has already been transferred to the bit line within the memory block of the memory cell. As a result, the amount of time in which the leakage current of the sense amplifier can impact the bit line voltage is substantially reduced. The short time period between activation of the isolation transistor and enablement of the sense amplifier does not allow for sense amplifier leakage to be a factor when testing the bit line.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, embodiments of the present invention include an external pad terminal or pin terminal control of the isolation control signal. This allows for user-friendly isolation and sensing control.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the present invention has been described above in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof, the present invention is not so limited. Rather, various changes to and modifications of the preferred embodiments will become readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
