<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates to snow removal apparatuses and, more particularly, to a roof snow removal apparatus for assisting a user to remove accumulated snow from a roof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Snow has accumulated on roofs for generations. The build-up of snow on roofs can cause serious problems if melting occurs, creating ice dams causing water to back up under shingles and leak through the roof into the house or other building. Also, if the weight of the snow becomes too heavy for the roof to support, caving in of the roof from the weight of snow and water accumulated on the roof can result in dumping snow and water into the house or like building. Thus, not only must the roof itself be repaired, but anything in the interior of the house or like building that acquired water damage must be replaced or repaired. Additionally, this is often a problem which can occur annually. The common practice is to remove the snow, with a shovel, while standing on the roof, a dangerous and a very treacherous task.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One solution to snow build-up is to remove snow off the roofs of houses and like buildings. A common method of snow removal is shoveling which creates a risk of slipping and falling and places undue strain on the back of the person shoveling. Additionally, shovels can only remove a certain amount of snow at a time causing the person shoveling to be subjected to the cold for a longer time than is necessary. Also, shoveling can damage the roof from the shovel being forcefully pushed into the shingles in attempts to remove the bottom layer of snow from the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other methods such as raking the snow off roofs can cause the snow to fall on top of the person trying to remove the snow and limits the ability to reach the highest or middle part of the roof if the handle is too short. Unless the person using prior rakes climbed onto the roof, which makes accidents more likely, the amount of snow that would get removed would be minimal. Additionally, rakes could pull shingles from the roof or otherwise damage them when the rake is dragged across them.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, a need remains for a roof snow removal apparatus in order to overcome the above-noted shortcomings. The present invention satisfies such a need by providing a snow removal apparatus that is easy and convenient to use, lightweight and compact in design, and improves the user's safety. Home owners and owners of small businesses find this apparatus quite helpful, in that it permits an individual to remove roof snow without having to climb onto the roof. In this manner, the snow no longer poses a danger to an individual walking under the snow or the one removing the snow from the roof of a residence or building.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a roof snow removal apparatus. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention are provided by a snow removal apparatus for assisting a user to remove accumulated snow from a roof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The apparatus includes an elongated rectilinear pole that has a centrally disposed longitudinal axis and further has axially registered proximal and distal end portions. The distal end portion of the pole preferably includes a grip member directly conjoined thereto for advantageously increasing a user's grip.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A central anchor includes a plurality of brackets equidistantly and radially spaced about a perimeter thereof. Such an anchor threadably and directly receives the proximal end portion of the pole. The brackets are preferably securely and statically fastened to the anchor such that the paddles move along a fixed and predetermined arcuate path during operating conditions. The central anchor preferably has a protrusion extending parallel to the longitudinal axis such that a user can advantageously easily insert the apparatus into a bank of snow when the paddles are at a retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A plurality of coextensive paddles are pivotally connected to the brackets respectively. Each paddle is articulated along a unique pivot axis between extended and retracted positions. The paddles are radially extended from and equidistantly juxtaposed along an outer perimeter of the anchor when a user exerts a linear force directed towards the proximal end portion of the pole for effectively fanning the paddles to an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A flexible canvas is directly connected to the paddles for effectively and conveniently collecting snow therein when the paddles are fanned to an open position. Such a canvas is foldable to a compact position when the paddles are articulated to a closed position. The canvas further has an outer edge provided with a radius substantially equal to a longitudinal length of the paddles. Such a canvas may be formed from mesh material for allowing a selected quantity of snow and debris to pass therethrough when the user pulls the apparatus away from an edge of a roof top. In an alternate embodiment, the canvas is preferably formed from fluid impermeable material for advantageously prohibiting snow and debris from passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is noted the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this application will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the true scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the figures and prime numbers refers to alternate embodiments of such elements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The apparatus of this invention is referred to generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> by the reference numeral <b>10</b> and is intended to provide a roof snow removal apparatus. It should be understood that the apparatus <b>10</b> may be used to remove snow from many different types of surfaces and should not be limited in use to only removing snow from roofs.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> includes an elongated rectilinear pole <b>20</b> that has a centrally disposed longitudinal axis and further has axially registered proximal <b>21</b>A and distal <b>21</b>B end portions. Of course, the pole <b>20</b> may be produced in a variety of different lengths and shapes, depending on the use thereof, and may even be telescopic, as is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The distal end portion <b>21</b>B of the pole <b>20</b> includes a grip member <b>22</b> directly conjoined, with no intervening elements, thereto for advantageously increasing a user's grip. Such a grip member <b>22</b> advantageously prevents the user's hand from slipping off of the pole <b>20</b>, which may become wet or icy during operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>, a central anchor <b>30</b> includes a plurality of brackets <b>31</b> equidistantly and radially spaced about a perimeter thereof. Such an anchor <b>30</b> threadably and directly receives, with no intervening elements, the proximal end portion <b>21</b>A of the pole <b>20</b>. The brackets <b>31</b> are securely and statically fastened to the anchor <b>30</b> such that the paddles <b>33</b> (described herein below) move along a fixed and predetermined arcuate path during operating conditions. Thus, a user advantageously does not need to guess which direction the paddles will extend upon retracting the pole <b>20</b> during operating conditions, allowing for the optimum amount of snow <b>11</b> to be removed each time. The central anchor <b>30</b> has a protrusion <b>32</b> extending parallel to the longitudinal axis, which is essential such that a user can advantageously easily insert the apparatus <b>10</b> into a bank of snow <b>11</b> when the paddles <b>33</b> are at a retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, a plurality of coextensive paddles <b>33</b> including opposed end portions <b>34</b> are pivotally connected to the brackets <b>31</b> respectively. Of course, such paddles <b>33</b> may be produced in a variety of different lengths and shapes, as is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Each paddle <b>33</b> is articulated along a unique pivot axis between extended and retracted positions. The paddles <b>33</b> are radially extended from and equidistantly juxtaposed along an outer perimeter of the anchor <b>30</b> when a user exerts a linear force directed towards the proximal end portion <b>21</b>A of the pole <b>20</b>, which is critical for effectively fanning the paddles <b>33</b> to an extended position, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Of course, the apparatus <b>10</b> may be used to collect other materials, such as leaves, in a similar manner, as is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The paddles <b>33</b> further include a flange portion <b>35</b> monolithically formed at one end portion <b>34</b>A thereof. Such a flange portion <b>35</b> is advantageous and essential for prohibiting the paddles <b>33</b> from pivoting beyond a predetermined position in relation to the central anchor <b>30</b>, thus preventing collected snow <b>11</b> and other debris from escaping the canvas <b>36</b> (described herein below)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, a flexible canvas <b>36</b> is directly connected, with no intervening elements, to the paddles <b>33</b>, which is essential for effectively and conveniently collecting snow therein when the paddles <b>33</b> are fanned to an open position. Such a canvas <b>36</b> is foldable to a compact position when the paddles <b>33</b> are articulated to a closed position, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The canvas <b>36</b> further has an outer edge <b>37</b> provided with a radius substantially equal to a longitudinal length of the paddles <b>33</b>. Such a canvas <b>36</b> is formed from mesh material for allowing a selected quantity of snow <b>11</b> and debris to pass therethrough when the user pulls the apparatus <b>10</b> away from an edge of a roof top. This feature is advantageous in preventing the apparatus <b>10</b> from collecting more snow than the paddles or a user can bear.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an alternate embodiment <b>10</b>′, the canvas <b>36</b>′ is formed from fluid impermeable material for advantageously prohibiting snow <b>11</b> and debris from passing therethrough. This feature is advantageous for larger applications of the apparatus <b>10</b> that can effectively bear the weight of greater quantities of snow <b>11</b> and debris.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In particular, with respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the present invention may include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation. The assembly and use of the present invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>
