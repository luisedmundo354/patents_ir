<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a fire protection sprinkler head support system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical automatic fire sprinkler system includes a network of pipes that carry a fire suppression fluid, e.g., water, to each room in the building. Conduit sections carry the fluid from the pipes to sprinkler heads strategically located in different rooms. The position and orientation of each sprinkler head is typically maintained in place by a support mechanism. When the room reaches an elevated temperature due to a fire, the sprinkler head is activated allowing a stream of fire suppression fluid to be directed over the intended area of coverage. During operation, the fluid pressure at each sprinkler head can reach significant levels of pressure (e.g., 175 psi), generating substantial back pressure on the sprinkler head's support system. The support mechanism must be capable of holding the sprinkler head securely in place during operation. Flexible fire protection sprinkler systems are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,076,608 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,154, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sprinkler system <b>2</b> includes two decorative support panels <b>10</b> mounted within a ceiling <b>4</b> having a ceiling frame <b>6</b> and an array of rectangular frame sections <b>8</b>. The array of rectangular frame sections <b>8</b> support the decorative support panels <b>10</b> as well as an array of decorative ceiling panels <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As will be described in greater detail below, each decorative support panel <b>10</b> includes a decorative panel <b>12</b> and a hub <b>14</b>. Hub <b>14</b> further includes a plate <b>16</b> and a sleeve <b>18</b> and is configured to receive a sprinkler head <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Decorative support panel <b>10</b> secures sprinkler head <b>42</b> at a predetermined position within one of the rectangular frame sections <b>8</b>. A flexible conduit <b>20</b> carries a fire suppression fluid, e.g., water, from supply pipes <b>22</b> to sprinkler head <b>42</b>. Pipes <b>22</b> can be part of a fluid delivery system dedicated to fire suppression or can also deliver water to other functions (e.g., a water faucet, toilet, dishwasher, etc.). When the room reaches elevated temperatures, sprinkler head <b>42</b> is activated and a stream of fire suppression fluid is directed into the room to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to function effectively, sprinkler head <b>42</b> must be held firmly in place during operation. Due to the significant back pressure of the fluid flowing through the sprinkler head during operation, sprinkler head <b>42</b> is subjected to significant side, rotational, and torsional forces, which are capable of changing the position of the sprinkler head <b>42</b>, thereby causing the fluid to be directed away from the intended target. During operation, the decorative support panel <b>10</b> is configured to resist movement of sprinkler head <b>42</b> by distributing the forces to the four edges of decorative panel <b>12</b> which, in turn, are distributed to the ceiling frame <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The underside (i.e., the side exposed to the room) of decorative panel <b>12</b> may be designed to match adjacent decorative ceiling tiles <b>11</b> in order to present an aesthetically pleasing appearance in the room. Additionally, decorative panel <b>12</b> may be formed from materials commonly used to make standard decorative ceiling panels such as softboard, wood fiber composite, polymers, melamine foam, or fibrous plaster.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in a sprinkler system <b>2</b>, a length of flexible conduit <b>20</b> is located between a pipe <b>22</b> and a decorative support panel <b>10</b>. One end <b>20</b><i>a </i>of flexible conduit <b>20</b> is attached to pipe <b>22</b> by a fitting <b>32</b>. Fitting <b>32</b> can be any one or more commonly known methods of connecting to pipe, including, for example, threaded, grooved, socket welded, socket glued, regular welded, pressed fit, compression fitting, or a flare fitting connection. In addition, an adaptor (not shown) can be used to attach fitting <b>32</b> to flexible conduit <b>20</b>. The method selected for fitting <b>32</b> will depend on the material used for conduit <b>20</b> and the type of fire suppression fluid using in the sprinkler system. Fitting <b>32</b> can be made of any material, but the material will also generally depend on the material used for the conduit <b>20</b> and the type of fire suppression fluid used in sprinkler system <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A second end <b>20</b><i>b </i>of flexible conduit <b>20</b> is attached to a fitting <b>34</b> which is, in turn, attached to sprinkler head <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) by any of the above methods. As with fitting <b>32</b>, the type of connection and the material used for fitting <b>34</b> can depend on the material used for conduit <b>20</b> and fire suppression fluid. Fitting <b>34</b> can be a rigid, substantially cylindrical tube such as a reducing fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, decorative support panel <b>10</b> includes a decorative panel <b>12</b> and a hub <b>14</b>. Hub <b>14</b> further includes a sleeve <b>18</b> and a plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hub <b>14</b> is mounted to the decorative panel <b>12</b> such that it will remain attached to the decorative panel during operation in a high temperature environment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, plate <b>16</b> is laminated to decorative panel <b>12</b>, however, it may be mounted to decorative panel <b>12</b> in a number of ways, including by glue, adhesive, cement, bolts, screws, or a combination of these. Additionally, the decorative panel <b>12</b> may be formed (e.g., by injection molding) partially or completely around the plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hub <b>14</b> may be formed from any rigid material capable of withstanding high temperature environments likely to be experienced in a fire such as steel, steel alloy, iron, aluminum, titanium, copper, ceramic, ceramic composite, or high temperature plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Sleeve <b>18</b> of hub <b>14</b> is secured to plate <b>16</b><i>a </i>and is adapted to receive sprinkler head <b>32</b>. Sleeve <b>18</b> may be secured to plate <b>16</b> either permanently or removably using a number of commonly known methods including, for example, welds, glue, adhesive, cement, rivets, bolts, screws, clips, pins, a sliding slot (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), or any combination of these. Additionally, sleeve <b>18</b> and plate <b>16</b> may formed of a single-piece construction by, for example, injection molding hub <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Sprinkler head <b>42</b> and fitting <b>34</b> form a sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b>. The sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> fits into sleeve <b>18</b> and is removably secured by set screw <b>46</b>. Sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> may also include a series of grooves on its outer surface to receive set screw <b>46</b> which would further secure sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> within sleeve <b>18</b>. The inner diameter of sleeve <b>18</b> should be only slightly larger than the outer diameter of sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> in order to reduce the ability of sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> to move within sleeve <b>18</b> during operation. Using a set screw <b>46</b> allows the height of sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> to be adjusted relative to the bottom surface of the decorative panel <b>12</b><i>b </i>while also functioning to secure sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> in place. While the use of a set screw is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, many other commonly known methods may be used to removably secure sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> within sleeve <b>18</b>, such as bolts, clips, pins, and the like. Additionally, sprinkler head <b>42</b> may be secured to sleeve <b>18</b> by configuring sleeve <b>18</b> as a telescoping sleeve. In this embodiment, the telescoping sleeve is rotated in one direction to open its center. While open, sprinkler head <b>42</b> is inserted and positioned to the proper height. Once sprinkler head <b>42</b> is in place telescoping sleeve is rotated in the opposite direction to close it and fasten sprinkler head <b>42</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Sprinkler head <b>42</b> can be any of the sprinkler head designs commonly used in the fire protection industry. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sprinkler head <b>42</b> includes a length of cylindrical pipe <b>45</b> having a fluid passage obstructed by a plug <b>46</b>. Plug <b>46</b> is held in place by fusible links <b>47</b>, which are fabricated to melt within a specific temperature range, e.g., between 130° F. and 212° F.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternative methods of holding plug <b>46</b> in place include a bottle of glycerin that expands when heated to break the vile. When links <b>47</b> break, plug <b>46</b> is released from pipe <b>45</b> by the pressure of the sprinkler system fluid, and the fluid is scattered over a wide area by a dispersion device <b>48</b>. The outer surface of pipe <b>45</b> includes threads <b>49</b> for connection to a fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain situations, a support structure, such as the suspended ceiling <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can either fail, that is, fall down, or may be removed during renovations or repairs. For example, during a fire or an earthquake all or parts of ceiling frame <b>6</b> can collapse. Similarly, a crew removing ceiling frame <b>6</b> during renovations may not always take care to separate the sprinkler system from the decorative support panel <b>10</b> before it is torn down. In addition, if it is suspected that a fire is located above a suspended ceiling, a suspended ceiling may be torn down. Also, local codes may require that the sprinkler system continue to operate when the ceiling is tom down.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In these situations, if the sprinkler heads are solely supported by a decorative support panel <b>10</b> inserted in a ceiling frame <b>6</b>, then the sprinkler head support system will likely fail when the ceiling frame <b>6</b> is torn down. This could result in significant damage to the sprinkler system as well as damage to building due to water leaks. Moreover, if, due to this damage, sprinkler system <b>2</b> fails to operate during a fire or an earthquake the building may be destroyed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A sprinkler system <b>2</b> will likely not be damaged or fail to operate if a support system includes an auxiliary support mechanism such as a rod, chain, wire, or rope attached to a building component.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, sprinkler system <b>2</b> can include a primary support system and an auxiliary support system <b>50</b>. Primary support system includes a decorative support panel <b>10</b><i>a. </i>Auxiliary support system <b>50</b> includes a rod <b>51</b> attached between the sleeve <b>18</b> and a building component <b>52</b>. Rod <b>51</b> is designed to perform two functions. First, rod <b>51</b> helps to hold sprinkler head <b>42</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in place by resisting the back pressure and twisting forces generated during sprinkler head operation. Second, in the event of support structure failure, as described above, the sprinkler head <b>42</b> (and decorative support panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>), will hang from rod <b>51</b>, enabling sprinkler head <b>42</b> to remain in position and continue to provide fire protection.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To provide these advantages, an upper portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>of rod <b>51</b> is connected to a building component, e.g., an I-beam <b>52</b>, by a washer <b>55</b> and nut <b>54</b>. A lower portion <b>51</b><i>b </i>of rod <b>51</b> is connected to the hub <b>14</b> by screwing a portion of the lower portion <b>51</b><i>b </i>of the rod <b>51</b> into a threaded hole drilled into a mounting block <b>56</b> attached to the sleeve <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Rod <b>51</b> can be attached to sleeve <b>18</b><i>a, </i>plate <b>16</b><i>a</i>, or directly onto the sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> by welding, bolting, clipping, or by screwing rod <b>50</b> into a threaded hole (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), or by any other commonly known attachment mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Rod <b>51</b> can be threaded or non-threaded and can be constructed from numerous materials, including but not limited to stainless steel, other steels, rubbers, plastics, polymers, ferrous metals, non ferrous metals, polycarbonates, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatives to using a rod <b>51</b> in an auxiliary support system <b>50</b> include a chain, wire or rope, all of which can be attached to the hub <b>14</b> or sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b>. These devices will similarly prevent the sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> and decorative support panel <b>10</b> from falling during support structure failure. Further, in locations that experience frequent seismic events, a rod will transmit any shocks or vibrations directly from the building component to the support system. The more flexible devices will cushion the vibrations. However, flexible secondary support devices such as chains, wires, or ropes may not alone provide adequate support for the sprinkler head assembly during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another decorative support panel <b>10</b><i>b </i>is shown with four support legs, <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d</i>. These support legs are formed from a rigid material able to maintain their rigidity in high temperature environments that would be present during a fire. The support legs are attached, e.g., by welding, to plate <b>16</b><i>b </i>of hub <b>14</b><i>b. </i>Each of the support legs, <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d</i>, extend from one of the four corners <b>61</b><i>a</i>-<b>61</b><i>d </i>of plate <b>16</b><i>b </i>to the corresponding corners of decorative panel <b>12</b>. Additionally, each of the support legs, <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d</i>, include an angled foot <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<b>62</b><i>d </i>which is configured to engage the ceiling frame <b>6</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). During operation of the sprinkler head, support legs <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d </i>help to transfer forces caused by the back pressure to ceiling frame <b>6</b>. The support legs <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d </i>are substantially parallel with the plane of decorative panel <b>12</b> and are on the back surface of decorative panel <b>12</b>. However, in other separate embodiments, the support legs may be angled relative to the plane of the decorative or they may be completely or partially integrated within the decorative panel. Additionally, clips (not shown) may be attached between the ceiling frame <b>6</b> and the feet of the support legs <b>61</b><i>a</i>-<b>61</b><i>d </i>in order further attach the decorative support panel to the ceiling frame <b>6</b>. In another embodiment, support legs, <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<b>60</b><i>d</i>, may extend from each of the side edges <b>63</b><i>a</i>-<b>63</b><i>d </i>of the plate <b>16</b><i>b </i>to the corresponding side edge of decorative panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an additional embodiment of a decorative support panel <b>10</b><i>c </i>is shown. In this embodiment, the plate <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>) and decorative panel <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>) are integrated in a single-piece rigid decorative support panel <b>13</b>. Decorative support panel <b>13</b> is formed of a rigid material (e.g., aluminum, titanium, stainless steel and other steel alloys, ceramic, high temperature plastic) that is capable of withstanding the back pressure forces created by the flow of water through the sprinkler head during operation in a high temperature environment. Sleeve <b>18</b><i>c </i>is attached to rigid decorative support panel <b>13</b> and provides a housing for the sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Rigid decorative support panel <b>13</b> fits into rectangular frame section <b>8</b> and helps to hold sprinkler head assembly <b>44</b> in place during operation by distributing some of the forces created by the flow of water through the sprinkler head to the ceiling frame <b>6</b>. Additionally, the bottom surface (i.e., the surface exposed to the room) may be coated with a material to match the surface of other decorative panels <b>11</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
