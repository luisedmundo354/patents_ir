<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates in general to medical instrumentation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a surgical instrumentation system that enables the interchange of any one of a number of different surgical instruments at an operative site.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In open surgery a surgeon uses a variety of different surgical implements with the total number that are used being a function of the particular operation being performed. For the most part these instruments or implements are hand held devices directly held and manipulated by the surgeon through the open incision. Typical surgical instruments include forceps, needle drivers, scissors, scalpels, etc. A number of different instruments or implements may be used during an operation depending upon the complexity of the medical procedure being performed, and even a greater number of instrument exchanges occur. Thus, a great deal of time may be spent during the surgery simply in exchanging between different types of instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In minimally invasive surgery (MIS) there is likewise a requirement, depending upon the particular surgical procedure, to exchange instruments or implements during a medical procedure. The primary difference in minimally invasive surgery is that the incision or incisions are relatively small, typically 5 mm to 10 mm in diameter, in comparison to open surgery. Also, in current MIS instrumentation, such instruments as forceps, scissors, etc., are inserted into the body at the end of long slender push rods actuated by the surgeon from outside the patient. Due to the size and increased complexity of these instruments it may be even more difficult to carry out an exchange due to the need to extract and re-insert through a relatively small incision.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Both open and MIS procedures involve control of the instrument directly by the human hand. In the case of open surgery, of course, the surgeon directly holds and manipulates the instrument, while in MIS the operable tool (scalpel, scissors, etc.) is controlled by hand, but through some type of mechanical transmission that intercouples from outside the patient to an internal operative site.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In more recent years computer control of instrumentation systems has come into being, typically referred to as robotic surgical systems, in which a surgeon controls an instrument carrying an end effector from a remote site, and through an electronic controller or the like. These robotic systems do provide an improvement in the dexterity with which medical procedures can be performed. However, even in these more advanced systems there is still a need to manually exchange instruments during a procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a system and associated method for the ready exchange or interchange between a plurality of different instruments at an operative site, whether it be in connection with open, MIS, robotic, or other types of surgical systems, apparatus, or procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to a system, apparatus, or method for enabling the exchange or interchange between one of several different instruments or implements, so that these different instruments or implements can be readily delivered to an operative or target site within a patient for performing a medical or surgical procedure. The present invention carries out this exchange or interchange without the usual manual withdrawal and insertion that is typical of prior art systems, and can be said to perform this interchange or exchange essentially automatically, with little or no manual intervention. The principles of the present invention are intended to apply to any instruments or implements, whether for open, MIS, or robotic surgery uses. The tool or end effector of the instrument may be of any type including, but not limited to, articulated and non-articulated types.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided an interchangeable instrument apparatus that includes a plurality of separate instrument members each capable of assisting in a different phase of a medical procedure to be performed at an operative site within the anatomy. An instrument storage chamber releasably receives the plurality of instrument members. The instrument members are accommodated in separate storage locations within the instrument storage chamber. An instrument driver is constructed and arranged for cooperative positioning relative to the instrument storage chamber, for selective alignment with one of the instrument members at a time, and for displacing or driving the aligned instrument member from the instrument storage chamber toward the operative site. At least one of the instrument driver and instrument storage chamber are positionally controllable so as to provide relative displacement therebetween so as to selectively align the instrument driver with another of the instrument members.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a surgical instrument apparatus that comprises an instrument member that includes two sections including a work section that supports at its distal end a tool used in performing a medical procedure at an operative site within the anatomy, and a driver section that is releasably engageable with the work section. The apparatus also includes a guide member for receiving the work section and the driver section, and for directing, upon engagement of said driver section with said work section, the delivery of the tool to the operative site. The driver section, in an inoperative position thereof, is disengaged from the work section, and in an operative position thereof, is engageable with the work section to direct the work section, via the guide member, to the operative site, and further is engageable with the work section to enable operative coupling to the tool for actuation of the tool from a remote drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of delivering, to an internal operative site, a selected one of a plurality of instruments. The method comprising the steps of; storing a plurality of separate instruments in a storage chamber with each instrument capable of assisting in a different phase of a medical procedure to be performed at the operative site, and providing an instrument driver constructed and arranged for;

</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a storage chamber that supports a plurality of separately arranged instruments, and further includes inlet and outlet ports. The outlet port is arranged in alignment with the target or operative site where the instrument is to be delivered. The instrument carries at its distal end a work implement(tool). An instrument driver is in alignment with the inlet port, and is adapted to engage a registered instrument disposed in the storage chamber, so as to deliver the selected instrument, via the outlet port, to the target or operative site. The instrument driver, in addition to engagement with the instrument, also operatively couples with and enables operation of the work implement of the instrument. The storage chamber is selectively operable, upon command, to permit different instruments to align between the inlet and outlet ports.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a surgical instrument apparatus that includes an instrument member having a work section that supports at its distal end a tool used in performing a medical procedure at an operative site within the anatomy, and a driver section that is releasably engageable with the work section. A guide member receives the work section and the drive section, and is for directing, upon engagement of the driver section with the work section, the delivery of the tool to the operative site. The driver section, in an inoperative position thereof, is disengaged from the work section, and in an operative position thereof, is engageable with the work section to direct the work section, via the guide member, to the operative site, and is further engageable with the work section to enable operative coupling to the tool for actuation of the tool from a remote drive unit. The apparatus also preferably includes an interface or coupling section between the work and driver sections for selectively and releasably intercoupling therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">The present invention is also directed to an interchangeable medical instrument system that includes an instrument storage retainer that supports a plurality of separately arranged instruments, and further includes inlet and outlet ports, the outlet port arranged in alignment with the a target or operative site where the instrument is to be delivered for performing a medical procedure. A work implement is supported at the distal end of each instrument. An instrument transporter is in alignment with the inlet port, and adapted to engage a registered instrument disposed in the storage retainer, so as to deliver the selected instrument, via the outlet port to the target or operative site. The instrument transporter, in addition to engagement with the instrument, also operatively couples with and enables operation of the work implement of the instrument The retainer is selectively operable, upon command, to permit different instruments to align between the inlet and outlet ports.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">The present invention is also directed to an interchangeable instrument system that includes an instrument retainer having multiple storage location for receiving a plurality of instruments disposed separately in the respective storage locations, and an instrument driver constructed and arranged for cooperative positioning relative to the instrument retainer, for selective alignment with one of the instruments at a time, and for displacing the aligned instrument from the instrument retainer and toward the operative site. An indexing mechanism controls the position of the instrument retainer so as to selectively align different instruments with the instrument driver. An actuation member is disposed at a user interface for controlling the indexing mechanism.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">In this detailed description there is described an apparatus for enabling the interchange, at an operative site, between different types of surgical instruments and in an automated fashion. In this way a substitution of one instrument for another can be readily accomplished, without manually withdrawing one instrument followed by manual insertion of another instrument. Further, with this apparatus, and the associated use of a guide tube, or the like, for receiving and guiding the instrument, the interchange can be carried out quickly and safely, thus enabling medical procedures to be performed in a far shorter period of time. The guide tube preferably extends to the operative site OS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) so that the instrument can transition safely thereto. Also, the guide tube preferably remains at the operative site even as the instruments are exchanged in the guide tube, so as to avoid any tissue or organ damage during an instrument exchange. The operative site may be defined as the general area in close proximity to where movement of the tool occurs in performing a surgical procedure, usually in the viewing area of the endoscope and away from the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">In this description the instrument interchange principles are illustrated in association with two separate surgical systems, both of which are robotic systems, sometimes also referred to as telerobotic systems. However, the principles of this invention also apply to other surgical instrumentation, such as used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), where a number of instrument exchanges are typical in performing a medical or surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">It is assumed, by way of example, that the systems disclosed herein are for use in laparoscopic surgery. Thus, one system is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8A</figref> and <b>8</b>B, while a second system is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>. A variation of the first system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It is noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the instrument-to-driver registration is accomplished with a linear arrangement, while in the other versions described herein a rotating arrangement is employed, all to be described in further detail later. Also, in the embodiments described herein the driver has only linear translation while the instrument storage chamber rotates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>) or slides (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). In an alternate embodiment the driver may rotate or otherwise move to different registration positions, as the instrument storage chamber remains stationary, as long as there is relative motion between the instrument driver and instrument storage chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">Before reference is made to the detailed embodiments described herein, consideration is given to co-pending applications that are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, and that describe in further detail aspects of the several components that make up the overall robotic surgery system. In connection with descriptions set forth herein reference is made to the applications set forth in the related application part of this application as well as to pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/783,637 filed Feb. 14, 2001; U.S. application Ser. No. 10/014,143 filed Nov. 11, 2001; as well as issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,017.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">The first embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a surgical instrument system <b>10</b> that performs surgical procedures. The system may be used to perform minimally invasive procedures. The system may also be used to perform open or endoscopic surgical procedures. The system <b>10</b> includes a surgeon interface <b>11</b>, computation system <b>12</b>, and drive unit <b>13</b>. The system controls the instrument so as to position the end effector (tool) <b>18</b> of the instrument <b>20</b> at the very distal end of and extending through the outlet guide tube <b>24</b>. During use, a surgeon may manipulate the handles <b>30</b> of the surgeon interface <b>11</b>, to effect desired motion of the end effector <b>18</b> within the patient, at the operative site which is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The movement of a handle <b>30</b> is interpreted by the computation system <b>12</b> to control the movement of the end effector (tool) <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">The system may also include an endoscope with a camera to remotely view the operative site. The camera may be mounted on the distal end of the instrument, or may be positioned away from the site to provide additional perspective on the surgical operation. In certain situations, it may be desirable to provide the endoscope through an opening other than the one used by the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">The entire assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown supported over the surgical table <b>27</b>, and in a position so that the guide tube <b>24</b> can be inserted through an incision in the patient and directed to the operative site of the patient. The incision is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the dashed line L. The surgical instrument system <b>10</b> of the present invention is preferably mounted on rigid post <b>19</b> which may be movably affixed to the surgical table <b>27</b>, at bracket <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">The surgical system <b>10</b> includes two mechanical cable-in-conduit bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. These cable bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> terminate at one end at the two connection modules(couplers) <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B, which removably attach to the drive unit <b>13</b>. The drive unit <b>13</b> is preferably located outside the sterile field, although it may be draped with a sterile barrier so that it may be operated within the sterile field. The other end of the bundles terminate at the surgical system <b>10</b>. These terminations are shown in further detail in the description of the second embodiment that is described later. Basically cables in the bundle <b>21</b> may control; the indexing for controlled rotation of the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>; rotation of the guide tube <b>24</b>; as well as motion of the carriage <b>54</b> for control of the linear translation of the driver <b>50</b>. On the other hand the bundle <b>22</b> may control, for example, rotation of the instrument within the guide tube <b>24</b>, as well as actuation of the tool <b>18</b>. The instrument storage chamber is also referred to herein as an instrument retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> that is illustrated as supported over the base piece <b>51</b>, which, in turn, is supported from the rigid post <b>19</b>. The cable bundle <b>21</b> couples to the base piece <b>51</b> and controls motion of the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>, as well as the driver <b>50</b>. The guide tube <b>24</b> is supported at the outlet port side of the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>, and is controlled for rotation relative to the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>. Rotation of the guide tube <b>24</b> provides a corresponding rotation of the instrument and tool. The instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> has at its inlet side a port for receiving the driver <b>50</b>, and for permitting engagement of the driver with the one of the instruments in the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> that is in registration with the driver <b>50</b>. The driver <b>50</b> is supported from the carriage <b>54</b> which transitions on rails <b>55</b>, and is controlled from cable bundle <b>22</b>. The driver may also be referred to herein as an instrument transporter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">In accordance with the setup of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the guide tube <b>24</b> of the surgical instrument system <b>10</b> is inserted into the patient usually through an incision. Usually, a cannula is positioned in the incision, is maintained in position and receives the guide tube <b>24</b>. This incision is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the dashed line L. The system is then mounted to the rigid post <b>19</b>. The cable bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are then coupled to the drive unit <b>13</b>. The connection modules or couplers <b>23</b>A and <b>23</b>B at the end of respective cable bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are then engaged into the drive unit <b>13</b>. The system is then ready for use and control from the master station side at surgeon interface <b>11</b>. For further details of the entire slave side of the system, including the drive unit, detachability at the drive unit, the cabling and cable couplers, refer to U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/783,637; and 10/014,143, previously mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">Now, reference is made, not only to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 6</figref> that illustrate further details depicting the interchangeable instrument concepts of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates schematically a cabling scheme that may be used in the instrument. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an alterative to the revolving chamber construction, in the form of a linearly translatable housing or chamber arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">The revolving instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> includes a base <b>42</b>, opposite end walls <b>43</b> and a cylindrical chamber or magazine <b>44</b>. In the embodiment illustrated herein, chamber <b>44</b> has six elongated passages <b>46</b> each for receiving an instrument. The chamber <b>44</b> is supported by a centrally disposed support rod <b>47</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The support rod <b>47</b> may be supported in bearings (not shown) at the opposite end walls <b>43</b>. The instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> has its rotation controlled at base piece <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) so that when an operator at interface <b>11</b> wants to change instruments, a command can be sent from the master to the slave side to rotate the magazine <b>44</b> so that a different instrument is in alignment with the driver <b>50</b>. Of course, this exchange only occurs when the driver has been withdrawn to its rest (disengaged) position. Specific sequences of the interchange action are described later. The command that is sent may be initiated by any one of several means, some of which are described in some detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> also illustrate the outlet guide tube <b>24</b>. The tube <b>24</b> is secured to one of the end walls <b>43</b> and is essentially fixed in axial position relative to that end wall <b>43</b> of the rotating instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>, but is capable of rotation on its own axis, and relative to the chamber <b>40</b>. Details of this rotational support are described further in connection with the second embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>. The end walls <b>43</b> supporting the magazine <b>44</b> are fixed to the base <b>42</b>, which is supported over the base piece <b>51</b> which, in turn, is fixed to the rigid post <b>19</b>. Thus, in this particular embodiment the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b> rotates but does not have any significant linear movement toward or away from the operative site. Thus, in this first embodiment the instrument control has a somewhat limited number of degrees-of-freedom. The degrees-of-freedom can be increased by providing the guide tube with a curved distal end, like that illustrated in the second embodiment of the invention in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> also illustrates the instrument driver <b>50</b>. The instrument driver <b>50</b> is adapted to enter an end inlet port <b>49</b> in the wall <b>43</b> of the rotating chamber <b>40</b>. In this regard, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for the inlet port <b>49</b>. Also, as discussed previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the base piece <b>51</b> there is an indexing mechanism that controls the rotation of the rotating storage chamber <b>44</b> so that different ones of the passages <b>46</b> are adapted to be aligned with the input driver port <b>49</b>. This registration control may be carried out using a detent mechanism so that the proper instrument is aligned and selected from the chamber by the instrument driver <b>50</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the cable bundle <b>21</b> that interconnects with the chamber <b>44</b> for selective and registered rotation thereof. Also, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> for an example of an indexing mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">In a similar manner, at the opposite end wall <b>43</b> of the chamber <b>40</b>, there is provided an outlet port <b>48</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and that aligns with the outlet guide tube <b>24</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> there is illustrated the carriage <b>54</b> that carries the instrument driver <b>50</b> and that transitions along the support rails <b>55</b> to enable the driver to selectively engage with and drive the instrument forward through the guide tube <b>24</b> and toward the operative site.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of the interchangeable instrument apparatus of the present invention. An instrument <b>20</b> with its end effector (tool) <b>18</b> is illustrated disposed in one of the elongated chambers <b>46</b> of the rotating chamber <b>44</b>. In practice, each of the other passages <b>46</b> can contain other types of instruments, with a variety of different tool or end effectors. For the sake of clarity, only one of the instruments is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it being understood that up to six other instruments of different types may be disposed in other ones of the elongated passages <b>46</b>. Also, the magazine <b>44</b> may be constructed with fewer or more instrument-receiving passages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also illustrates the driver <b>50</b> in a position where the end <b>56</b> thereof is positioned just entering the inlet port <b>49</b> with the end <b>56</b> about to engage the end <b>25</b> of the instrument <b>20</b>. The position of the instrument driver <b>50</b> is considered as a “rest position” when the end <b>57</b> is disposed in wall <b>43</b>, but has not yet entered the magazine <b>44</b> so that the magazine <b>44</b> is free to rotate. To interlock and align the driver and the instrument, there is provided a post <b>58</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) on the driver <b>50</b> and an accommodating recess <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in the instrument end <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">As mentioned previously, there are mechanical cables extending in bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The cables in bundle <b>22</b>, in particular, couple by way of pulleys and then extend the length of the driver <b>50</b> to the instrument <b>20</b>. The cabling and control pulley arrangements are disclosed in further detail in the second embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>. This cabling is for operating the end effector <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To provide continuity of this mechanical control cabling, both the instrument driver as well as the instrument carry interconnecting cable connections. These are illustrated clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>. Also refer to the schematic perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> showing the manner in which the cables couple about pulleys <b>29</b> and extend through the driver to intercouple with cabling of the instrument <b>20</b>. These cable connections between the driver and instrument may also be considered as defining a coupling section or coupling interface <b>59</b> where the driver and instrument are releasably engageable. One may also consider the driver and instrument, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, as collectively being an instrument member including a work section (instrument <b>20</b> and tool <b>18</b>), and a driver section (driver <b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">The instrument driver <b>50</b> has passages <b>61</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for receiving a cable <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> the end of cable <b>62</b> terminates in a hook <b>64</b>. The hook <b>64</b> is adapted to engage with a similar-configuration hook <b>66</b> at the end of cable <b>68</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a series of slots or passages <b>61</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment comprise six such slots <b>61</b>. Each of these slots receives a cable <b>62</b> with its end hook <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, this illustrates the end <b>25</b> of the instrument <b>20</b>. Also illustrated are the elongated slots <b>61</b> in the driver(transporter) <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the cables <b>68</b> and their associated hooks <b>66</b> associated with the instrument <b>20</b>. Also shown is the cable <b>62</b> with its hook <b>64</b> disposed in slot <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the end <b>56</b> of the instrument driver <b>50</b> as the driver <b>50</b> is transitioning through the port <b>49</b> for engagement with the instrument <b>20</b>. The driver <b>50</b> has not yet engaged the instrument <b>20</b>, but has just left its rest position. The “rest” (disengaged) position for the instrument driver <b>50</b> is one in which the end <b>56</b> of the driver <b>50</b> is disposed in the end wall <b>43</b> and out of the passage <b>46</b> so that the chamber <b>44</b> is free to rotate. In the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the hook <b>66</b> associated with the instrument <b>20</b> is preferably biased to a somewhat outward deflected position. In this regard, it is noted that the passage <b>46</b> has an enlarged section <b>46</b>A that permits the hook <b>66</b> to deflect outwardly, as illustrated. The hooks are essentially spring biased outwardly so as to contact the inner wall surface of enlarged section <b>46</b>A. This enables the driver to pass by the hooks <b>66</b> for engagement with the instrument <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">As the driver <b>50</b> proceeds from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, toward the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the hook <b>64</b> passes under the hook <b>66</b> and as the driver is driven further to the left, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hooks <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> become interlocked in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and there is thus cable continuity from cable <b>62</b> to cable <b>68</b>. As is discussed in further detail hereinafter, the operation of these cables provide operation of certain actions of the end effector <b>18</b>. As the driver end <b>56</b> engages the instrument end <b>25</b>, the post <b>58</b> engages with the recess <b>26</b> so as to properly align the driver and instrument. At the initial point of contact the hooks <b>66</b> are still out of engagement with the hooks <b>64</b>. However, as the driver moves further to the left the instrument starts to transition out of the storage chamber passage <b>46</b>, and the hooks <b>66</b> transition into the smaller diameter section of the passage <b>46</b>, causing them to deflect into engagement with the hooks <b>64</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The coupling interface <b>59</b> formed essentially between the hooks <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> is maintained as the instrument transitions out of the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">The driver <b>50</b> is of a sufficient length so that the selected instrument <b>20</b> is driven out of the chamber <b>44</b> and into the outlet guide tube <b>24</b>. The instrument is then transitioned through the guide tube <b>24</b> to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where the end effector or tool <b>18</b> of the instrument extends from the distal end of the guide tube <b>24</b> at a position inside the body cavity (operative site). All the while that the instrument is being transitioned to the end of the guide tube <b>24</b>, the interconnecting cables are maintained in an interlocked position such as illustrated by the engaged hooks <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0064">When it is desired to change to a different instrument, the driver <b>50</b> is withdrawn or in other words is moved in a direction to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This carries the instrument with the instrument driver to the right and when the instrument reaches a position approximately as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, because of the increased diameter of the section <b>46</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the hooks <b>66</b> are biased outwardly and disengage from the hooks <b>64</b>. This essentially disengages the driver from the instrument and the driver is then in a position to be withdrawn through the port <b>49</b>, no longer engaging with the instrument. This also leaves the instrument <b>20</b> in place in the instrument storage chamber <b>44</b> in readiness for a subsequent usage.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0065">With the driver disengaged from the instrument, the instrument storage chamber can then be rotated to align a different instrument with the driver. The cabling in bundle <b>21</b>, via base piece <b>51</b>, controls the position of chamber <b>40</b> so as to select a different instrument by rotating the chamber <b>44</b> so that a different instrument registers with the driver <b>50</b>. For an example of a registration mechanism refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. A different instrument would also carry cabling similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Once the new instrument is in-line with the instrument driver <b>50</b> then the driver <b>50</b> may be engaged once again to pass through the port <b>49</b> engaging the new instrument and thus transitioning the new instrument out the outlet guide tube <b>24</b> to a position where the tool of the instrument is at the operative site in readiness for use and control from the master station surgeon interface.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">A wide variety of different instruments may be supported in the instrument storage chamber <b>40</b>. Tool <b>18</b> may include a variety of articulated tools, such as jaws, scissors, graspers, needle holders, micro dissectors, staple appliers, tackers, suction irrigation tools, clip appliers, that have end effectors driven by wire links, eccentric cams, push-rods or other mechanisms. In addition, tool <b>18</b> may comprise a non-articulated instrument, such as cutting blades, probes, irrigators, catheters or suction orifices. Alternatively, tool <b>18</b> may comprise an electrosurgical probe for ablating, resecting, cutting or coagulating tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">To provide proper alignment of the instrument <b>20</b> in the chamber <b>40</b> and with the driver <b>50</b> there are preferably provided interlocking surfaces such as a tongue and groove (not shown) between the walls of the chamber passage and the outer surface off the instrument and/or driver. Interlocking or guiding surfaces may also be provided within the guide tube <b>24</b>. Thus, as the different instruments are moved in and out of the rotating chamber they will always be properly aligned with the driver so that the proper cabling is provided to control the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for a schematic illustration of the cabling as it extends from the bundle <b>22</b>, through the driver <b>50</b>, to the instrument <b>20</b>, and the tool <b>18</b>. The cabling extends about pulleys <b>29</b> and into the slots <b>61</b> in the instrument driver <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the driver <b>50</b> in a position in which it has entered the guide tube <b>24</b> and transitions to a location essentially at the end of the guide tube where the tool <b>18</b> is located and at the operative site OS. At the end of the driver where the cable hooks engage, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, there is the coupling or interface section <b>59</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also illustrates the passages <b>46</b> and another non-selected tool within the instrument storage chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">The construction of one form of tool is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. This is in the form of a set of jaws or grippers. This tool is shown for the purpose of illustration, it being understood that a variety of other tool may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a perspective view showing the tool pivoted at the wrist while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is an exploded view of the tool. The tool <b>18</b> is comprised of four members including the base <b>600</b>, link <b>601</b>, upper grip or jaw <b>602</b> and lower grip or jaw <b>603</b>. The base <b>600</b> is affixed to the flexible stem section <b>302</b>. This flexible section may be constructed of a ribbed plastic. This flexible section may be used when a curved end guide tube (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is used so that the instrument will readily bend through the curved actuator tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">The link <b>601</b> is rotatably connected to the base <b>600</b> about axis <b>604</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates a pivot pin at <b>620</b>. The upper and lower jaws <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> are rotatably connected to the link about axis <b>605</b>, where axis <b>605</b> is essentially perpendicular to axis <b>604</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates another pivot pin at <b>624</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">Six cables <b>606</b>-<b>611</b>, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, actuate the four members <b>600</b>-<b>603</b> of the tool. Cable <b>606</b> travels through the insert stem (section <b>302</b>) and through a hole in the base <b>600</b>, wraps around curved surface <b>626</b> on link <b>601</b>, and then attaches on link <b>601</b> at <b>630</b>. Tension on cable <b>606</b> rotates the link <b>601</b>, and attached upper and lower grips <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, about axis <b>604</b>( wrist pivot). Cable <b>607</b> provides the opposing action to cable <b>606</b>, and goes through the same routing pathway, but on the opposite sides of the insert. Cable <b>607</b> may also attach to link <b>601</b> generally at <b>630</b>. Cables <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> may be one continuous cable secured at <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">Cables <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> also travel through the stem <b>302</b> and though holes in the base <b>600</b>. The cables <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> then pass between two fixed posts <b>612</b>. These posts constrain the cables to pass substantially through the axis <b>604</b>, which defines rotation of the link <b>601</b>. This construction essentially allows free rotation of the link <b>601</b> with minimal length changes in cables <b>608</b>-<b>611</b>. In other words, the cables <b>608</b>-<b>611</b>, which actuate the grips <b>602</b> and <b>623</b>, are essentially decoupled from the motion of link <b>601</b>. Cables <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> pass over rounded sections and terminate on grips <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, respectively. Tension on cables <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> rotate grips <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> counter-clockwise about axis <b>605</b>. Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the cables <b>609</b> and <b>611</b> pass through the same routing pathway as cables <b>608</b> and <b>610</b>, but on the opposite side of the instrument. These cables <b>609</b> and <b>611</b> provide the clockwise motion to grips or jaws <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, respectively. At the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the ends of cables <b>608</b>-<b>611</b> may be secured at <b>635</b>. This securing may occur with the use of an adhesive such as an epoxy glue or the cables could be crimped to the jaw.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> schematically illustrated an alternate embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> the different instruments are selected by means of a rotating arrangement. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the selection is made on an essentially linear basis. Thus, instead of the rotating member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, there is a flat array <b>70</b> also having a series of elongated passages <b>72</b> extending therethrough. Each of these passages accommodates an instrument. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also schematically illustrates, by the same reference characters, the instrument driver <b>50</b> and the outlet guide tube <b>24</b> such as previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>. The flat array <b>70</b> may be driven selectively in the direction of arrow <b>74</b> so as to align different ones of the passages <b>72</b> with the driver <b>50</b> and guide tube <b>24</b>. Mechanisms for selective linear drive are well known, as are mechanisms for registration so as to provide proper alignment between the instrument and instrument driver.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">In connection with the aforementioned description of the cables/hooks, it is noted that the interchange system is designed preferably to have all cabling maintained in tension. In this way, as an instrument is engaged, all of the cabling running therethrough is in tension and properly operative to control the end effector whether it be a set of jaws as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> or some other type of instrument. If an end effector has less degrees of movement than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> this is still effectively controlled, but with the use of fewer cable control signals (fewer cables will actually be activated).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">Reference is now made to the second robotic surgical system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, and that discloses a system having a greater number of degrees-of-freedom than the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref> the same reference characters are used for similar components as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0076">The surgical robotic system, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, although preferably used to perform minimally invasive surgery, may also be used to perform other procedures as well, such as open or endoscopic surgical procedures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a surgical instrument system <b>10</b> that includes a master station M at which a surgeon <b>2</b> manipulates an input device, and a slave station S at which is disposed a surgical instrument. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the input device is illustrated at <b>3</b> being manipulated by the hand or hands of the surgeon. The surgeon is illustrated as seated in a comfortable chair <b>4</b>. The forearms of the surgeon are typically resting upon armrests <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a master assembly <b>7</b> associated with the master station M and a slave assembly <b>8</b> associated with the slave station S. Assembly <b>8</b> may also be referred to as a drive unit. Assemblies <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are interconnected by means of cabling <b>6</b> with a controller <b>9</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, controller <b>9</b> typically has associated therewith one or more displays and a keyboard. Reference is also made to, for example, the aforementioned U.S. Ser. No. 10/014,143, for further detailed descriptions of the robotic controller operation and associated algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0078">As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the drive unit <b>8</b> is remote from the operative site and is preferably positioned a distance away from the sterile field. The drive unit <b>8</b> is controlled by a computer system, part of the controller <b>9</b>. The master station M may also be referred to as a user interface vis-à-vis the controller <b>9</b>. Commands issued at the user interface are translated by the computer into an electronically driven motion in the drive unit <b>8</b>. The surgical instrument, which is tethered to the drive unit through the cabling connections, produces the desired replicated motion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, of course, also illustrates an operating table T upon which the patient P is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">Thus, the controller couples between the master station M and the slave station S and is operated in accordance with a computer algorithm. The controller receives a command from the input device <b>3</b> and controls the movement of the surgical instrument so as to replicate the input manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, associated with the patient P is the surgical instrument <b>14</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment actually comprises two separate instruments one on either side of an endoscope E. The endoscope includes a camera to remotely view the operative site. The camera may be mounted on the distal end of the instrument insert, or may be positioned away from the site to provide additional perspective on the surgical operation. In certain situations, it may be desirable to provide the endoscope through an opening other than the one used by the surgical instrument <b>14</b>. In this regard, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> three separate incisions are shown, two for accommodating the surgical instruments and a centrally disposed incision that accommodates the viewing endoscope. A drape is also shown with a single opening.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">The surgical instrument <b>14</b> is generally comprised of two basic components including a surgical adaptor or guide <b>15</b> and an instrument <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the surgical adaptor <b>15</b>, which is comprised primarily of the guide tube <b>24</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> the instrument <b>14</b> is not clearly illustrated but extends through the guide tube <b>24</b>. The instrument <b>14</b> carries at its distal end the tool <b>18</b>. Descriptions of the surgical instrument are found hereinafter in additional drawings, particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The surgical adaptor <b>15</b> is basically a passive mechanical device, driven by the attached cable array.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> there is illustrated cabling <b>22</b> coupling from the instrument <b>14</b> to the drive unit <b>18</b>. The cabling <b>22</b> is preferably detachable from the drive unit <b>8</b>. Furthermore, the surgical adaptor <b>15</b> may be of relatively simple construction. It may thus be designed for particular surgical applications such as abdominal, cardiac, spinal, arthroscopic, sinus, neural, etc. As indicated previously, the instrument <b>14</b> couples to the adaptor <b>15</b> and essentially provides a means for exchanging the instrument tools. The tools may include, for example, forceps, scissors, needle drivers, electrocautery etc.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the surgical system <b>10</b> may preferably be used to perform minimally invasive procedures, although it is to be understood that the system may also be used to perform other procedures, such as open or endoscopic surgical procedures. The system <b>10</b> includes a surgeon's interface <b>11</b>, computation system or controller <b>9</b>, drive unit <b>8</b> and the surgical instrument <b>14</b>. The surgical system <b>10</b>, as mentioned previously, is comprised of an adaptor or guide <b>15</b> and the instrument <b>14</b>. The system is used by positioning a tool <b>18</b> of the instrument, which is inserted through the surgical adaptor or guide <b>15</b>. During use, a surgeon may manipulate the input device <b>3</b> at the surgeon's interface <b>11</b>, to effect desired motion of the tool <b>18</b> within the patient. The movement of the handle or hand assembly at input device <b>3</b> is interpreted by the controller <b>9</b> to control the movement of the guide tube <b>24</b>, instrument, and tool <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">The surgical instrument <b>14</b>, along with the guide tube <b>24</b> is mounted on a rigid post <b>19</b> which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as removably affixed to the surgical table T. This mounting arrangement permits the instrument to remain fixed relative to the patient even if the table is repositioned. Although, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> there are illustrated two such instruments, even a single surgical instrument may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0085">As indicated previously, connecting between the surgical instrument <b>14</b> and the drive unit <b>8</b>, are cablings. These include two mechanical cable-in-conduit bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. These cable bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> may terminate at two connection modules, not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which removably attach to the drive unit <b>8</b>. Although two cable bundles are described here, it is to be understood that more or fewer cable bundles may be used. Also, the drive unit <b>8</b> is preferably located outside the sterile field, although it may be draped with a sterile barrier so that it may be operated within the sterile field.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0086">In the preferred technique for setting up the system, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the surgical instrument <b>14</b> is inserted into the patient through an incision or opening. The instrument <b>14</b> is then mounted to the rigid post <b>19</b> using a mounting bracket <b>31</b>. The cable bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are then passed away from the operative area to the drive unit <b>8</b>. The connection modules of the cable bundles are then engaged into the drive unit <b>8</b>. The separate instrument members of instrument <b>14</b> are then selectively passed through the guide tube <b>24</b>. This action is in accordance with the interchangeable instrument concepts of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0087">The instrument <b>14</b> is controlled by the input device <b>3</b>, which is be manipulated by the surgeon. Movement of the hand assembly produces proportional movement of the instrument <b>14</b> through the coordinating action of the controller <b>9</b>. It is typical for the movement of a single hand control to control movement of a single instrument. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a second input device that is used to control an additional instrument. Accordingly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> two input devices are illustrated and two corresponding instruments. These input devices are usually for left and right hand control by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0088">The surgeon's interface <b>11</b> is in electrical communication with the controller <b>9</b>. This electrical control is primarily by way of the cabling <b>6</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> coupling from the bottom of the master assembly <b>7</b>. Cabling <b>6</b> also couples from the controller <b>9</b> to the actuation or drive unit <b>8</b>. This cabling <b>6</b> is electrical cabling. The actuation or drive unit <b>8</b>, however, is in mechanical communication with the instrument <b>14</b>. The mechanical communication with the instrument allows the electromechanical components to be removed from the operative region, and preferably from the sterile field. The surgical instrument <b>14</b> provides a number of independent motions, or degrees-of-freedom, to the tool <b>18</b>. These degrees-of-freedom are provided by both the guide tube <b>24</b> and the instrument <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows primarily the overall surgical system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> show further details particularly of the interchangeable instrument concepts as applied to this system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a control algorithm for the system. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is adapted to provide seven degrees-of-freedom at the tool <b>18</b>. Three of the degrees-of-freedom are provided by motions of the adaptor <b>15</b>, while four degrees-of-freedom may be provided by motions of the instrument <b>14</b>. As will be described in detail later, the adaptor is remotely controllable so that it pivots, translates linearly, and has its guide tube rotate. The instrument also rotates (through the instrument driver), pivots at its wrist, and has two jaw motions at the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0090">Now, reference is made to the more detailed drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a perspective view at the slave station of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrating the interchangeable instrument concepts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view through the storage chamber and as taken along line <b>12</b>-<b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view, as taken along line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective schematic view of the indexing and registration mechanism used in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0091">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> which is a perspective view illustrating the instrument <b>14</b> and the adaptor <b>15</b> at the slave station S. This instrument system is secured in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to the rigid post <b>19</b> that supports the surgical instrument by way of the mounting bracket <b>31</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, but not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also shows several cables that may be separated into five sets for controlling different motions and actions at the slave station. These are individual cables of the aforementioned bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also illustrates the support yoke <b>220</b> that is secured to the mounting bracket <b>31</b>, the pivot piece <b>222</b>, and support rails <b>224</b> for the carriage <b>226</b>. The rails are supported in end pieces <b>241</b> and <b>262</b> with the end piece <b>241</b> attached to the pivot piece <b>222</b>. The pivot piece <b>222</b> pivots relative to the support yoke <b>220</b> about pivot pin <b>225</b>. A base piece <b>234</b> is supported under the carriage <b>226</b> by means of the support post <b>228</b>. The support post <b>228</b> in essence supports the entire instrument assembly, including the adaptor <b>15</b> and the instrument <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0092">As indicated previously, the support yoke <b>220</b> is supported in a fixed position from the mounting bracket <b>31</b>. The support yoke <b>220</b> may be considered as having an upper leg <b>236</b> and a lower leg <b>238</b>. In the opening <b>239</b> between these legs <b>236</b> and <b>238</b> is arranged the pivot piece <b>222</b>. Cabling extends into the support yoke <b>220</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by the cable set <b>501</b>. Associated with the pivot piece <b>222</b> and the carriage <b>226</b> are pulleys (not shown) that receive the cabling for control of two degrees-of-freedom. This control from the cable set <b>501</b> includes pivoting of the entire instrument assembly about the pivot pin <b>225</b>. This action pivots the guide tube <b>24</b> essentially in a single plane. This pivoting is preferably about an incision of the patient which is placed directly under, and in line with, the pivot pin <b>225</b>. Other cables of set <b>501</b> control the carriage <b>226</b> in a linear path in the direction of the arrow <b>227</b>. See also the cables <b>229</b> extending between the carriage <b>226</b> and the end pieces <b>241</b> and <b>262</b>. The carriage moves the instrument and guide tube <b>24</b> back and forth in the direction of the operative site OS. Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> the instrument is in its fully advanced state with the tool at the operative site OS.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0093">The base piece <b>234</b> is the main support for the interchangeable instrument apparatus of the invention. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>. The base piece <b>234</b> supports the guide tube <b>24</b>, the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>, and the instrument driver <b>550</b>. The instrument driver <b>550</b> is supported from another carriage, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref> as the carriage <b>552</b>, and that, in turn, is supported for translation on the carriage rails <b>554</b>. The rails <b>554</b> are supported at opposite ends at end pieces <b>556</b> and <b>558</b>, in a manner similar to the support for the other carriage <b>226</b>. A support post <b>560</b> interconnects the carriage <b>552</b> with the instrument driver housing <b>570</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and as mentioned previously, there are a number of cable sets from bundles <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> coupled to and for controlling certain actions of the instrument system. Mention has been made of the cable set <b>501</b> for controlling instrument pivoting and translation, as previously explained. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts four other cable sets <b>503</b>, <b>505</b>, <b>507</b>, and <b>509</b>. Cable set <b>503</b> controls rotation of the guide tube <b>24</b>. Cable set <b>505</b> controls the carriage <b>552</b>, and, in turn, the extending and retracting of the instrument driver for instrument exchange. Cable set <b>507</b> controls rotation of the instrument through rotation of the instrument driver. Finally, cable set <b>509</b> controls the tool via the instrument driver and instrument. There is also one other set of control cables not specifically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that controls the indexing motor <b>565</b>, to be discussed in further detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a cross-sectional view through the interchangeable instrument portion of the overall instrument system. This clearly illustrates the internal cable and pulley arrangement for the various motion controls. There is a pulley <b>301</b> driven from the cable set <b>503</b> that controls rotation of the guide tube <b>24</b>. There is also a pulley <b>303</b> driven from cable set <b>505</b>, along with a companion pulley <b>305</b> that provides control for the carriage <b>552</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also illustrates another pulley <b>307</b> driven from cable set <b>507</b>, and for controlling the rotation of the instrument driver <b>550</b>, and, in turn, the selected instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the guide tube <b>24</b> supported from the base piece <b>234</b>. The guide tube <b>24</b> is hollow and is adapted to receive the individual instruments or work sections <b>541</b> disposed in the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>, as well as the instrument driver <b>550</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for an illustration of the instrument and instrument driver positioned in the guide tube <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the instrument driver <b>550</b> in its rest or disengaged position. The proximal end <b>24</b>A of the guide tube <b>24</b> is supported in the base piece <b>234</b> by means of a pair of bearings <b>235</b> so that the guide tube <b>24</b> is free to rotate in the base piece <b>234</b>. This rotation is controlled from the pulley <b>237</b> which is secured to the outer surface of the guide tube <b>24</b> by means of a set screw <b>231</b>. The pulley <b>237</b> is controlled to rotate by means of the cabling <b>310</b> that intercouples the pulleys <b>301</b> and <b>237</b> and that is an extension of the cabling <b>503</b>. Thus, by means of the cable and pulley arrangement, and by means of the rotational support of the guide tube <b>24</b>, the rotational position of the guide tube <b>24</b> is controlled from cable set <b>503</b>. Of course, this controlled rotation is effected from the master station via the controller <b>9</b>, as depicted in the system view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and as a function of the movements made by the surgeon at the user interface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0097">As indicated before the proximal end <b>24</b>A of the guide tube <b>24</b> is supported from the base piece <b>234</b>. The distal end of the guide tube <b>24</b>, which is adapted to extend through the patient incision, and is disposed at the operative site OS illustrated about the tool <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and where a medical or surgical procedure is to be performed. In the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> the distal end of the guide tube <b>24</b> is curved at <b>24</b>B. In this way by rotating the guide tube <b>24</b> about its longitudinal axis there is provided a further degree-of-freedom so as to place the end tool at any position in three-dimensional space. The rotation of the guide tube <b>24</b> enables an orbiting of the end tool about the axis of the guide tube <b>24</b>. The guide tube <b>24</b> is preferably rigid and constructed of a metal such as aluminum. The tool <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be the same tool as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Also, when the instrument is fully engaged, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cabling and cable interface is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also illustrates a cross-section of the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b> including the storage magazine <b>549</b>, and showing two of the six instrument passages <b>542</b> in the storage magazine <b>549</b>. The instrument storage chamber may also be referred to herein as an instrument retainer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> one of the instruments <b>541</b> is about to be engaged by the instrument driver <b>550</b>. The other instrument <b>541</b> is in place (storage or rest position) in the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>, and out of the path of the instrument driver <b>550</b>. One of the instruments <b>541</b> carries a gripper tool illustrated at <b>543</b>, while the other instrument carries a scissors <b>544</b>. Because these instruments are adapted to pass to the guide tube <b>24</b> and be positioned at the distal end <b>24</b>B thereof, the body <b>548</b> of the instrument is flexible so as to be able to curve with the curvature of the guide tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0099">Although reference is made herein to the separate instrument and instrument driver, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, once they are engaged they function as a single piece instrument member. Accordingly reference is also made herein to the instrument driver <b>550</b> as a “driver section” of the overall one piece instrument member, and the instrument <b>541</b> as a “working” section of the instrument member. The instrument member has also been previously discussed as having a “coupling section” or “interface section”, which is defined between the working section and the driver section where the cables interlock by means of the engaging hook arrangement, such as clearly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> at <b>559</b>. This is analogous to the interface <b>59</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0100">The carriage <b>552</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is moved linearly by the cables <b>555</b> that extend between pulleys <b>303</b> and <b>305</b>. These cables attach to the carriage <b>552</b>. The carriage movement is controlled from cable set <b>505</b>. It is the movement of the carriage <b>552</b> that drives the instrument driver(driver section) <b>550</b>. The instrument driver <b>550</b>, in its rest or disengaged position, is supported between the instrument driver housing <b>570</b> and the wall <b>562</b> that is used for support of the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. The instrument magazine <b>549</b> is rotationally supported by means of the axle or shaft <b>547</b>, with the use of bushings or bearings, not shown. This support is between walls <b>562</b> and <b>563</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the very distal end <b>525</b> of the instrument driver (transporter) <b>550</b> supported at wall <b>562</b>. In the rest position of the instrument driver <b>550</b> the driver is out of engagement with the instruments and the magazine <b>549</b>, thus permitting rotation of the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. The proximal end <b>526</b> of the instrument driver <b>550</b> is supported at the instrument driver housing <b>570</b>. It may be rotationally supported by means of a bushing <b>527</b>. The instrument driver <b>550</b> is supported for rotation, but rotation is only enabled once the driver has engaged the instrument and preferably is at the operative site. The rotation of the instrument driver <b>550</b> is controlled from cable set <b>503</b> by way of the pulley <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0102">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> the cable set <b>509</b> is illustrated as controlling the instrument motions including tool actuation. These cables control a series of pulleys shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as pulleys <b>529</b>. As indicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> these pulleys control cabling that extends through the instrument driver and the instrument for control of instrument and tool motions. The cables that are controlled from these pulleys may control three degrees-of-freedom of the instrument, including pivoting at the wrist and two for gripper action. For the details of the interlocking of the instrument and instrument driver refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The same engagement arrangement can be used in this second embodiment of the invention including the mating hook arrangement, interlocked at interface <b>559</b> when the instrument driver and instrument are engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0103">Reference has been made before to the indexing motor <b>565</b>. This motor is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> positioned next to the base piece <b>234</b>, and is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> located for interaction with the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. The indexing motor <b>565</b> is controlled from the master station side, and accordingly there is another cable set (not shown) that actuates the indexing motor <b>565</b>. The indexing motor <b>565</b> may be a stepper motor having a degree of rotation that corresponds to the desired rotation of the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. The stepper motor may be designed to provide 60 degrees of rotation for each actuation, corresponding to an instrument storage chamber <b>540</b> having six passages (360 degrees divided by 6) for receiving instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0104">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> the stepper motor <b>565</b> has an output shaft <b>566</b> that supports an indexing disk <b>567</b>, shown also in dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The indexing disk <b>567</b> is fixed to the shaft <b>566</b> and so rotates with the shaft <b>566</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the disk <b>567</b> carrying four pins <b>568</b> disposed at the periphery of the disk <b>567</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> also shows these pins <b>568</b>. The pins <b>568</b> selectively engage in indexing slots <b>569</b> in an end wall of the magazine <b>549</b>. To insure that the rotating chamber stays in proper registration with the instrument driver a spring and ball detent arrangement is employed. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> illustrating a standard ball and spring member <b>575</b> supported in the wall <b>563</b>. The ball of member <b>575</b> is urged against an end wall surface <b>576</b> of the magazine <b>549</b>. This end wall has a series of detent dimples <b>577</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) disposed at locations corresponding to the passages in the magazine <b>549</b>. The stepper motor <b>565</b> is selectively operated under surgeon control from the master station. Each step rotates the disk <b>567</b> through 90 degrees. The engagement of the pins <b>568</b> with the slots <b>569</b> causes a corresponding rotation of the magazine <b>549</b> through 60 degrees. Each subsequent rotation of the stepper motor <b>565</b> causes a further 60 degree rotation of the magazine <b>549</b>. The stepper motor <b>565</b> is controllable in a manner so that, with proper decoding, there may be multiple step actuations to get from one instrument to the next selected instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">The operation of the slave instrument is in a robotic manner from the master station, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The surgeon can control several degrees-of-freedom of the instrument system. In addition, when the surgeon wishes to exchange instruments this can be done directly from the master station from an actuation member and at the proper time in the surgical procedure. One type of actuation member may be by means of a foot switch <b>410</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> within access of the surgeon. The foot switch <b>410</b> couples to the controller <b>9</b>. Appropriate electrical signals are coupled from the master station to the slave station basically to control the stepper motor <b>565</b> for indexing the magazine <b>549</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">The sequence of operation for the indexing is demonstrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. This block diagram indicates the sequence of steps performed commencing with a rest position of the system in which the instruments are all in place in the storage chamber <b>540</b>, and the instrument driver is in the position substantially as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, just out of contact with the registered instrument and with the driver end <b>525</b> disposed in the wall <b>562</b>. It is this position that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by box <b>420</b>. The next step is to check the registration of the instrument driver with the instrument itself. This is depicted by the box <b>422</b>. This step may involve the use of some known registration system, such as one using an optical sensing arrangement to determine proper registration between the instrument driver <b>550</b> and each of the passages in the magazine <b>549</b>, along with the instrument <b>541</b>. If proper registration is detected then the system proceeds to the next step indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by box <b>426</b>, which activates the instrument driver <b>550</b>. This starts the process of driving the instrument to the operative site OS. This involves mechanical control signals on the cable set <b>505</b> controlling the carriage <b>552</b>, and in turn, the instrument driver <b>550</b>. If an improper registration is detected then box <b>424</b> indicates the step of correcting the registration. This may be carried out in a well known manner with the use of an optical system to provide slight rotation to the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b> so as to obtain proper registration. This system may also use some type of a feedback system.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">The next step in the system is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by the box <b>428</b> which simply detects the fully engaged position of the instrument driver and instrument. This is the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Again, this position can be readily detected by optical means. The next step illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by box <b>430</b> is one that commences the interchange process. The intercoupled instrument and instrument driver are withdrawn. This involved movement of the carriage <b>552</b> in the opposite direction. Next, indicated by box <b>432</b>, is where the instrument and instrument driver have reached the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> previously referred to as the “rest position”. In that position the instrument driver (transporter) <b>550</b> is clear of the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>, and thus the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b> can be indexed (rotated). This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by the box <b>434</b>. Following these steps, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> it is seen that there may be another registration check (box <b>436</b>), and a correction (box <b>438</b>), in a manner similar to the operation previously discussed regarding boxes <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>. The process can then repeat at a time determined by the surgeon's instrument selection sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">There has to be some correlation between the indexing, what and where particular instruments are stored, and how the indexing is controlled from the master station. As indicated previously a foot switch can be used, such as the switch <b>410</b> illustrated in FIG. <b>10</b>. In one version of the control the switch <b>410</b> may be comprised of six separate actuation buttons, each one corresponding to one of the six instruments disposed in the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. Indicia may be provided associated with the storage chamber to indicate what particular instrument is disposed in what particular instrument passage. In this way the surgeon would know what button to actuate to select the desired instrument. There could be corresponding indicia associated with the switch buttons so the surgeon knows what button corresponds exactly to what instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">The control system for indexing may also include a decoding scheme so that when the surgeon makes a selection the decoder determines the number of rotations (such as of the stepper motor <b>565</b>) necessary to bring the instrument driver into proper registration with the selected instrument. Because it may not always be clear as to the specific instrument sequence that the surgeon will use, the system has to determine how to index from one instrument to the next one selected. This selection process involves more than just sequencing from one instrument to an adjacent instrument. The process will have to accommodate a selection process in which the next selected instrument is not the adjacent instrument. Thus a simple decoder can be used to determine the number of stepper motor steps necessary to move the storage chamber to the next selected instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Another aid that can be provided to the surgeon is a visible display illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and on which there can be a diagram that matches the storage chamber pattern showing to the surgeon exactly where each instrument is placed including the type of instrument. This could be set up when the instruments are first selected the disposed in the instrument storage chamber <b>540</b>. In association with this display one could also provide, in place of the switch <b>410</b>, a voice activated system so that the surgeon simply indices by voice which instrument to select. This may be done by simply numbering the instruments, such as one through six. A further variation may use a touch screen so that the surgeon simply touches an area on the screen corresponding to the displayed image of the storage chamber with the stored instruments. In all of the above instances, there are electrical signals generated from the master station, through a touch screen, switch, etc. that are conveyed to the controller <b>9</b> and from there to the slave side. The activating signals at the slave side basically control the stepper motor <b>565</b> via a cable set not specifically shown in the drawings but that would couple to the stepper motor <b>565</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0111">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> for a schematic representation of a further alternate embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref> it is noted that the instruments are contained in a parallel array. In accordance with the invention the instruments may also be disposed in a series array, as depicted in the schematic diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This embodiment includes a retainer <b>580</b> that is adapted to store a series of instruments <b>581</b> in a serial array, also referred to herein as a linear chamber or linear retainer. Means are provided to enable the array to move laterally in the directions indicated by arrows <b>585</b>. This movement can be of either the retainer or the instruments themselves. There is an alignment that occurs so that a selected instrument may align with a port <b>584</b> from which the instrument may then be moved to location <b>583</b>. This is by a lateral or transverse movement of the instrument out of the retainer <b>580</b>. This movement is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> by the arrow <b>587</b>. The instrument, once moved, is then in registration with the driver or transporter <b>580</b> which is moveable in the direction of arrow <b>588</b>. The driver is controlled as in previous embodiments to transition the instrument to the operative site, through the represented output port <b>586</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">Although reference is made herein to “surgical instrument” it is contemplated that the principles of this invention also apply to other medical instruments, not necessarily for surgery, and including, but not limited to, such other implements as catheters, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic instruments and implements.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0113">Having now described certain embodiments of the present invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that numerous other embodiments and modifications thereof can be made, some of which have already been described, and all of which are intended to fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, the coupling sections or interface sections have been disclosed as intercoupled cables with hook arrangements, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In another arrangement a different mechanical coupling scheme may be employed using a different interlock between cables. Also, in place of mechanical couplings other technologies may be used for coupling action to the instrument and tool, such as SMA technology. Regarding the tool itself, one has been illustrated with a wrist pivot. Instead the tool may include a bendable section at or near its distal end. In place of the stepper motor other indexing arrangements can be used, such as a ratchet and pawl system. Also, encoders can be used at the rotating storage chamber to detect motions to provide feedback for controlling the overall system.</p>
