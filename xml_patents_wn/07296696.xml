<p id="p-0003" num="0002">None</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to desktop organizers, and in particular relates to a frame attachable to a computer monitor for the organization of desktop items for easy and convenient access.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In today's high paced office environment, increasing demands are placed upon individuals stationed at a computer workstation in areas of limited space, much of which is occupied by desktop computer components including a computer monitor. Accordingly, organization and easy access to necessary items is desired. Conventional organizers sit on the desktop and retain various items that may or may not be needed at a given point in time. However, these organizers occupy space on the desktop regardless of whether the user needs to access the retained items. Accordingly, in instances where access to the stored items is not needed, the organizer still occupies valuable desktop space, and reduces the space available for other items, such as notes, business cards, personal effects, writing implements, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an effort to maximize available desktop space and to provide easy access to desktop items, a number of organizers have been proposed that attach to a computer monitor. Conventional organizers hold clipboards that enable easy visual access to documents, while other organizers include bins and the like for holding miscellaneous desktop items. Still other organizers include apparatus that receives computer-related accessories such as compact disks and floppy disks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately, while these organizers are suitable for their intended purpose, none are configurable to provide flexibility based on a user's given needs. For instance, if an organizer includes bins that are not needed, the user is unable to remove the bins or replace them with other more desired desktop item-retaining implements. Furthermore, the size of conventional monitor-attached organizers is fixed. What is therefore needed is an organizer that is attachable to a desktop monitor that is also configurable by the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a configurable organizer is provided that is attachable to a computer monitor. The organizer includes a telescoping frame including a vertically extending main housing member and an auxiliary housing member connected to the main housing member.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a computer monitor <b>20</b> includes opposing left and right upstanding side walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, and a frame member <b>26</b>, surrounding a screen <b>28</b>, connected between side walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Frame member <b>26</b> is supported on a desktop <b>30</b> via a monitor stand <b>32</b>. A pair of symmetrical organizers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> is attached to opposing side walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, each organizer being operable to retain various removable desktop items as desired by the user. Organizers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, and their attachments, are preferably formed from a plastic unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Because organizers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are symmetrical, both will be described with reference to organizer <b>34</b> as the description of organizer <b>36</b> applies generally to organizer <b>34</b>, it being appreciated that organizer <b>34</b> is configured to be mounted onto left side wall <b>22</b> while organizer <b>36</b> is configured to be mounted onto right side wall <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, organizer <b>34</b> includes a telescopic frame <b>38</b> having a main housing member <b>40</b> and an auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> slideable with respect to main housing member <b>40</b>. Auxiliary housing member <b>40</b> can thus be referred to as an adjustable extension of main housing member <b>40</b> that enables the user to expand and contract organizer <b>34</b> as desired to match the dimensions of computer monitor <b>20</b>. For the purposes of this description, the terms “front” and “rear” are used with respect to a direction facing toward and away from a user stationed at monitor <b>20</b>, respectively, while the terms “laterally inner” and “laterally outer” refer to directions facing toward and away from monitor <b>20</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Main housing member <b>34</b> includes a front face <b>44</b> that faces the user when mounted to monitor <b>20</b>, and a rear face <b>46</b> disposed opposite front face <b>44</b>. Auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> includes a front face <b>48</b> that interfaces with rear face <b>46</b> of main housing member <b>40</b>, and a rear face <b>50</b> disposed opposite the front face <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In particular, a rail <b>52</b> (one shown) extends vertically from rear face <b>46</b> along the laterally inner and outer edges of main housing member <b>40</b>. Each rail <b>52</b> defines a vertically extending groove disposed between itself and rear face <b>46</b> that receives the corresponding lateral edges of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>. Rails <b>52</b> thus retain auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>, and enable auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> to slide vertically relative to main housing member <b>40</b> during operation. The position of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> can be fixed via a track <b>54</b> extending centrally along rear face <b>46</b>. Track <b>54</b> is formed from a plurality of vertically spaced, and substantially hemispherical, locating depressions in the form of detents <b>56</b> formed in rear face <b>46</b>. An inverted U-shaped portion <b>58</b> is partially cutout from, and hingeably connected to, auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>, and includes a substantially hemispherical projection <b>60</b> extending outwardly from the upper end of cutout portion <b>58</b>. Projection <b>60</b> is sized to engage detents <b>56</b>, and is further centrally disposed and therefore aligned with track <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During operation, when auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> is retained by rails <b>52</b> and translated relative to main housing member <b>40</b>, projection <b>60</b> rides along detents <b>56</b> and rear face <b>46</b> in alternating fashion. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, cutout portion <b>58</b> is in its normal position (i.e., substantially flush with front and rear surfaces <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>) when projection <b>60</b> is in engagement with one of the detents <b>56</b>. When auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> is translated relative to main housing member <b>40</b>, projection <b>60</b> is forced out of engagement with the detent and rides along rear surface <b>46</b>, thus causing cutout portion <b>58</b> to flex and exert a force that biases projection <b>60</b> into engagement with the next detent <b>56</b> as auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> continues to travel. Once the auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> has been translated to its desired position (e.g., to match the vertical dimensions of computer monitor <b>20</b>), the engagement between projection <b>60</b> and the desired detent <b>56</b> will resist further movement of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> during normal operation until the user exerts a translating force to adjust the vertical position of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> as desired. The auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> is said to be fixed when projection <b>60</b> is in engagement with a detent <b>56</b>. Alternatively, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> can be removed entirely from main housing member <b>40</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, an enlarged rectangular section <b>62</b> is disposed at the lower end of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>, and has a thickness such that the front face of rectangular section <b>62</b> abuts, and is substantially flush with, front face <b>44</b> of main housing member <b>40</b> when frame <b>38</b> is fully contracted. The laterally outer edge of rectangular section <b>62</b> also extends beyond that of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> so as to be substantially flush with the laterally outer edge of main housing member <b>40</b>. A beam <b>64</b> extends horizontally across the upper end of inner surface <b>46</b>, and engages the upper edge of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> to further limit the permissible upward vertical travel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Frame <b>38</b> is attached to monitor <b>20</b> by way of a first vertical flange <b>66</b> that extends forwardly along the laterally inner edge of main housing member <b>40</b>. A second vertical flange <b>68</b> extends laterally inwardly from, and perpendicular to, first flange <b>66</b>. Both flanges <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> present corresponding monitor-engaging surfaces <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, upon which a double-stick adhesive tape <b>74</b> or the like can be placed. Flange surface <b>70</b> is brought into engagement with side wall <b>22</b>, while flange surface <b>72</b> is brought into engagement with frame member <b>26</b> to affix adhesive <b>74</b> to monitor <b>20</b> at a position whereby the upper end of main housing member <b>20</b> is substantially flush with the upper end of monitor <b>20</b>. Because flanges <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> extend substantially along the entire, or at least a significant, vertical portion of side wall <b>22</b>, the connection between organizer <b>34</b> and monitor <b>20</b> is robust and capable of withstanding greater forces than conventionally achieved. It should also be appreciated that, once frame <b>38</b> has been attached to monitor <b>20</b>, auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> can be translated as desired such that its lower end is substantially flush with the lower end of monitor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, organizer <b>34</b> includes a plurality of desktop item-retaining implements fixedly supported by both outer frame <b>40</b> and inner frame <b>42</b>. Some of the fixed implements attached to inner frame <b>42</b> can be selectively accessible depending upon the position of inner frame member <b>42</b>. Furthermore, a plurality of modular implements can be selectively coupled to outer frame <b>40</b>. Exemplary fixed and modular implements will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a document holder <b>76</b> is disposed at the upper end of main housing member <b>40</b>. Document holder <b>76</b> includes a horizontal bar <b>78</b> slideably coupled to a horizontally extending header member <b>80</b> disposed forwardly from outer surface <b>44</b>. A slot <b>82</b> extends horizontally through header <b>80</b>, and receives a plurality of barbed slider members <b>84</b> extending rearward from horizontal bar <b>78</b>. A clip <b>86</b> is disposed at the laterally outer end of bar <b>78</b>, and extends downwardly from the upper end of bar <b>78</b>. Clip <b>86</b> defines a concave inner surface that interacts with a convex outer surface of bar <b>78</b> to retain a paper or other similar document <b>88</b> therebetween. During operation, bar <b>78</b> can be translated along the direction of Arrow A to its laterally outermost position, such that standard 8½ by 11 inch sheets are centrally supported by clip <b>86</b> without overlapping monitor frame <b>26</b>. Furthermore, the outer surface of bar <b>78</b> is substantially flush with the outer surface of flange <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a plurality of implements is fixedly supported by auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>. Specifically, one or more writing implement holders <b>90</b> are formed in rectangular member <b>62</b> disposed at the lower end of auxiliary housing member <b>42</b>. Each holder <b>90</b> is formed from an aperture <b>92</b> extending through a resilient material <b>94</b> that is, in turn, disposed in an aperture <b>96</b> extending through rectangular member <b>62</b>. Each aperture <b>92</b> is sized to snugly receive a writing implement <b>98</b>, such as a pencil, pen, or the like. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, three such holders <b>90</b> are arranged in a horizontal orientation across rectangular member, and are thus accessible even when frame <b>38</b> is fully contacted.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additional implements fixedly supported by auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> include a tray <b>100</b> provided in the form of a rectangular pocket disposed above writing implement holders <b>90</b> for the storage of paper clips and the like. A shelf <b>102</b> is hingeably connected at its lower end to inner frame member <b>42</b> and, when opened about the direction of Arrow B, can retain various miscellaneous items. Tray <b>100</b> and shelf <b>102</b> are disposed behind outer frame member <b>40</b> and are hidden when frame <b>38</b> is fully contracted, and can be accessed when frame <b>38</b> is extended. The user can thus configure organizer <b>34</b> by positioning auxiliary housing member <b>42</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to the fixed implements, a plurality of modular implements that retain desktop items is also provided that can be attached to, and removed from, outer frame <b>40</b> as desired to configure organizer <b>34</b>. Specifically, with continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a pair of parallel tracks <b>104</b> extends vertically along main housing member <b>40</b> and provides a plurality f mounting locations for the modular implements. Each track <b>104</b> is formed from a plurality of vertically spaced, equidistantly spaced, substantially cylindrical apertures <b>106</b> extending through housing member <b>40</b>. Each implement includes, at its rear face, a plurality of outstanding substantially cylindrical pegs <b>108</b> that are spaced a predetermined distance from each other such that each peg <b>108</b> is inserted in one of the apertures <b>106</b> when the implement is mounted to frame <b>38</b>. The pegs <b>108</b> and apertures <b>106</b> are sized such that a pressure fit is formed when pegs <b>108</b> are inserted, thus preventing the corresponding implement from becoming unintentionally disengaged during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring also again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one exemplary modular implement includes a picture frame <b>110</b> mounted to main housing member <b>40</b> via pegs <b>108</b> extending from its rear surface. Another example is a dry-erase board <b>112</b> that also is mounted to main housing member <b>40</b> via includes pegs <b>108</b> extending from its rear surface. Another example of a modular implement is a holder <b>114</b> formed from a pair of laterally extending base members <b>116</b> that are spaced to retain a pack of Post-it™ notes <b>118</b>, business card(s) <b>120</b>, or the like. The rearward base member <b>106</b> is mounted to main housing member <b>40</b> via pegs <b>108</b> extending from its rear surface. Yet another example of a modular implement includes a convex mirror <b>122</b> supported by a frame that is mounted to main housing member <b>40</b> via pegs <b>108</b> extending from its rear surface. One or more of the above-described modular implements (e.g., picture frame <b>110</b>), or other desirable modular implements not described could be provided and mounted onto main housing member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Organizer <b>34</b> is thus advantageously configurable in several ways to accommodate the desires of the user. First, organizer <b>34</b> can be constructed so as to be mounted on either the left side wall <b>22</b> or the right side wall <b>24</b> of monitor <b>20</b>, based on the user's preferences. Alternatively, a pair of organizers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> can be mounted to both side walls <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Additionally, organizer <b>34</b> can be extended based on either the desired height or the desired accessibility of the various desktop item-retaining implements. Furthermore, a plurality of modular desktop item-retaining implements can be selectively attached to organizer <b>36</b> as desired. Moreover, the position of each desired modular implements is adjustable and removable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be appreciated that the fixed and modular implements described above are presented as examples only, and that other desktop-retaining implements could be provided as desired in the manner described above and, accordingly, the present invention is not to be narrowly construed as being limited to the examples provided above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above has been described as a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It will occur to those that practice the art that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For instance, while the primary intended use of organizer <b>36</b> is to be coupled to computer monitor <b>20</b>, it should be appreciated that other similar uses are anticipated by the present inventors, including attachment to devices other than computer monitors. In order to apprise the public of the various embodiments that may fall within the scope of the invention, the following claims are made.</p>
