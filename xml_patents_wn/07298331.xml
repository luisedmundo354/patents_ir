<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A metalized circuit suitable for application as a radio frequency antenna is produced by forming an antenna coil pattern on a flexible substrate. The antenna coil pattern is formed using a conductive ink which is patterned on the substrate. The conductive ink is cured and an electrical-short layer is formed across the coils of the conductive ink pattern. An insulating layer is formed over top of the electrical-short layer, a metal layer electroplated on top of the conductive layer, and then the electrical-short layer is removed. The use of the electrical-short layer during the electroplating allows for the voltage at the different points on the conductive ink layer to be relatively similar, so that a uniform electroplate layer is formed on top of the conductive ink layer. This results in a better quality radio frequency antenna at a reduced cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods of manufacture of flexible circuits used in construction of radio frequency (RF) antennae.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Radio frequency antennae are typically made in a conductive coil pattern. The conductive coil pattern allows the antenna to receive and radiate energies in the radio frequency range. Typically, the antenna is optimized to transmit and receive energy in a relatively narrow portion of the radio frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Radio frequency antennae are used in a number of different areas including inventory control. Often the radio frequency antenna is connected to an integrated circuit. The integrated circuit receives energy from a detector unit, modulates the energy with an identification pattern stored in the integrated circuit, and then retransmits the modulated energy to the detector unit. Such inventory control units, including the radio frequency antennae, can be made quite inexpensively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way of forming a radio frequency antenna is to stamp out a conductive coil out of a sheet of metal. The downside of this method is that the production of the metal coil results in a large amount of scrap metal. Additionally, the radio frequency antennae produced by stamping from a sheet of metal may be stiffer than desired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another way of forming the radio frequency antenna is to use strip-back techniques common in printed circuit (PC) board fabrication. In PC board fabrication, a layer of the conductive material is formed on top of a substrate, and the areas not used for the antenna are stripped away. This method tends to be wasteful when used to produce the radio frequency antenna, because the radio frequency coil antenna tends to be about 10% of the surface area of the substrate. This compares to coverage areas of 70-80% common with typical PC board implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another way of forming a radio frequency antenna is to use conductive inks. Typically, the conductive ink is printed in a RF antenna coil pattern on top of the substrate. The conductive ink is then cured. The printed antennae may be used as is or electrodes are attached to the conductive ink pattern and a metal layer is electroplated on top of the conductive ink pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates this prior art embodiment. The electrode is attached pad <b>22</b> to electroplate the metal material on top of the conductive ink pattern. Because of its cost, the conductive ink material tends to be applied in relatively narrow and thin layers. This means that when a voltage source is attached to pad <b>22</b>, there is considerable electrical resistance between pad <b>22</b> and point <b>24</b> near the center of the pattern. Due to this electrical resistance, the electroplated material preferentially coats the areas near the electrode at pad <b>22</b>, rather than position <b>24</b>. This makes it difficult to obtain a proper electroplated coating on top of the conductive ink.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One possible solution is to use the conductive ink with a thicker or wider pattern, thus reducing the resistance per length of the conductive ink strip. The downside of this solution is that the conductive ink is expensive compared to the much cheaper electroplated material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For the above reasons, it is desired to have an improved method of forming a radio frequency antenna.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is a method and apparatus of forming a flexible circuit for use as a radio frequency antenna which uses a temporary electrical-short layer. In one embodiment of the present invention, a seed layer, such as a conductive ink layer, is formed in the coil antenna pattern on a substrate. An electrical-short layer pattern of a conductive material is placed over the coils, such that the coil is electrically shunted together. An insulating layer is formed over top of the electrical-short layer. Next, electroplating occurs, so that the electroplated material forms over top of the conductive ink material. The electrical-short layer and the insulating layer are then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The use of the electrical-short layer has the advantage that it allows the resistance between the electrode and the other locations on the conductive ink layer to be reduced. The electrical-short layer effectively results in a more uniform electroplating on all the points on the radio frequency coil pattern. This avoids the problem that occurred in the prior art of requiring a relatively thick conductive ink layer. In the method of the present invention, an effectively uniform conductive electroplate layer can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the present invention is a radio frequency antenna, which is formed by the method of the present invention. This radio frequency antenna includes a substrate, a conductive ink layer in the form of an antenna coil, and a conductive electroplate layer on top of the conductive ink layer, with the conductive electroplate layer having a removed short region. The removed short region comprises a portion of the seed layer not covered by the conductive material, or comprises a portion of the seed layer wherein the conductive layer is thinner than the remaining portions. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a method for forming a radio frequency antenna. The method comprises: providing a substrate layer; forming one or more holes in the substrate layer; attaching a conductive foil layer on one or both sides of the substrate layer, such that the conductive foil covers the holes; and forming conductive layer(s) on one (both) sides of the substrate in an antenna coil pattern, with the conductive ink to form an electric contact with the metal foil. The conductive ink has the advantage that it can easily go into the holes to form that connection to a conductive foil and the circuit elements on the substrate. Prior ways of forming a connection between two sides of the substrate for the radio frequency antenna include punching holes through a conductive metal layer to a conductive metal layer on the other side of the substrate. The punch would hopefully force some metal on the one layer to contact the metal on the other layer. This has the downside of it being unreliable and prone to failure during the operation of the radio frequency antenna.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a radio frequency antenna <b>40</b> being constructed by the method of one embodiment of the present invention. The radio frequency antenna <b>40</b> includes a conductive ink pattern <b>42</b> formed in a coil on the substrate <b>44</b>. An electrical-short layer <b>46</b> is formed over top of the conductive ink coil pattern, and preferably a nonconductive plating resist is formed over the short. The electrical-short layer <b>46</b> ensures that points <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> on the conductive ink pattern <b>42</b> will have relatively similar voltages during the electroplating process. This means all locations on the conductive ink pattern <b>42</b> will be electroplated evenly. Thus the apparatus of the present invention allows for a conductive electroplate layer of sufficient thickness on all points of the radio frequency antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The use of the electrical-short layer <b>46</b> allows for the use of a thinner and/or narrower conductive ink layer <b>42</b>. The resistance of the conductive ink layer during the electroplate process is not as important of a factor because the electrical-short layer is used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Typically it is desired to minimize the resistance of the radio frequency antenna. A desirable property of radio frequency antennae is to have a relatively high Q factor. The Q factor for an antenna is defined as the imaginary over the real part of the impedance. The imaginary part of the impedance is typically a function of the desired operating frequency and geometry and is typically fixed. Thus, to produce a high Q factor antenna, the resistance of the antenna should be kept as small as possible. This means that it is desired to have a relatively thick conductive metal layer forming the coils of the radio frequency antenna. The use of the electrical-short layer of the present invention aids in the construction of a uniformly thick electroplate layer, thus lowering the resistance and raising the Q factor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detail of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the construction of one embodiment of the radio frequency antenna of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a conductive seed layer <b>50</b> is formed on top of the substrate <b>52</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the substrate <b>52</b> is a flexible substrate which allows the constructed radio frequency antenna to bend. One example of a flexible substrate material which is suitable for use with the present invention is Mylar.®, polyester film from E.I. DuPont de Nemours, Wilmington Del. A conductive seed layer <b>50</b> is formed in a coil pattern shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> above. In one embodiment of the present invention, the conductive seed layer <b>50</b> is a conductive ink layer. The conductive ink layer could be of the type such as EnTouch.™. EN-079 from Engelhard Corporation Iselin N.J. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the electrical-short layer material <b>54</b> is formed over top of the coil pattern <b>50</b>. The electrical short ink layer could be of the type such as EnTouch.™. EN-081 from Engelhard Corporation Iselin N.J. An additional insulating layer <b>56</b> is preferably formed on top of the electrical-short layer <b>54</b>. The insulating ink layer could be of the type such as EnTouch.™. EN-080 from Engelhard Corporation Iselin N.J. The conductive ink layer <b>50</b> can be printed upon the flexible substrate, as is known in the prior art. In one embodiment, the electrical-short layer <b>54</b>, and the insulating layer, <b>56</b> are differentially removable (for example soluble in a solvent that the initial seed layer is impervious to) from the conductive ink material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the results of the electroplating, in which a conductive material <b>58</b> is formed over top of the conductive ink layer <b>50</b>. The insulating layer <b>50</b> preferably prevents an electroplate layer from forming on the electrical-short layer. The conductive layer <b>58</b> is preferably an inexpensive metal material. In one embodiment of the present invention, the conductive layer <b>58</b> is made of copper. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the electrical-short layer <b>54</b> and the insulating layer <b>56</b> are stripped away. The stripping can be done using a solvent, ashing, reactive gas or any other method.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the electrical-short layer <b>54</b> is constructed of metallic foil, which could be attached to the RF antenna and then removed after the electroplating. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> shows an optional additional step of a second electroplating in which an additional electroplate layer <b>60</b> is formed on top of the first electroplate layer <b>58</b>. The advantage of the second electroplate step is that it allows for some electroplate material to go into the removed short layer region <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a detail of the formed radio frequency antenna produced with the method of one embodiment of the present invention. Note that most of the radio frequency antenna includes electroplated copper portions <b>70</b>, but the small removed electrode portion <b>72</b> consists of the conductive ink layer by itself. As long as the removed short region <b>72</b> remains relatively thin, the total increased resistance caused by the removed short region <b>72</b> will not be too high. In fact, the total resistance of the radio frequency antenna is reduced as a result of the more effective electroplating of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of the present invention. In Step <b>80</b>, a flexible substrate is provided. In Step <b>82</b>, a coil antenna pattern is formed on the substrate with the conductive ink. In Step <b>84</b>, the conductive ink is cured. In Step <b>86</b>, an electrical-short layer is formed over a portion of the coil pattern. In a preferred embodiment, the electrical-short layer is formed of differentially removable conductive ink. In Step <b>88</b>, an insulating layer is formed over the electrical-short layer. In Step <b>90</b>, the electroplating is done to form a conductive electroplate layer on the conductive ink layer. In Step <b>92</b>, the electrical-short layer and insulating layer are removed. This is preferably using a solvent that removes the electrical-short layer and insulating layer, yet does not affect the cured conductive ink layer. Step <b>94</b> is an optional second electroplating step.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a flexible substrate <b>100</b> is provided. Holes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are punched into the flexible substrate material <b>100</b>. Looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a conductive foil <b>106</b> is attached over holes <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are shown with side <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the flexible substrate <b>100</b> shown on top. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the flexible substrate <b>100</b> is flipped to the other side <b>100</b><i>b</i>. In this side, the conductive ink layer <b>110</b> forms a coil pattern. The shunt <b>106</b> on side <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the flexible substrate <b>100</b> allows that the pads <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> can be adjacent to one another for easy connection to the integrated circuit (IC) (Not shown). By using the metal foil shunt <b>106</b>, the loops of the coil pattern on the radio frequency antenna need not be positioned between pads <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Next, an electroplating step can be done to form an electroplated conductive layer on top of the conductive ink coil pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conductive ink material easily flows inside relatively small holes used to connect between the conductive shunt <b>106</b> and the top side of the flexible substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the construction of the system <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates the flexible substrate <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a hole <b>102</b> is formed in the flexible substrate <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the conductive foil material <b>106</b> is connected to the substrate <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, a conductive adhesive <b>108</b> can be used to hold the metal foil material <b>106</b> to the substrate <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is shown with the conductive ink material <b>110</b> which enters the hole <b>102</b> to form an electrical contact with the shunt <b>106</b>. The electrically conductive ink material easily flows into the hole <b>102</b>. Note that the use of a shunt may make non-plated ink antennae feasible. In one embodiment, the use of the shunt allows the resistance of the antenna to be reduced which can make it feasible to use a non-plated conductive ink layer. The shunt also allows for the conductive antenna coil pattern to be formed on both sides of the substrate layer, allowing for a thicker printed pattern. In one embodiment, only a single hole is used. One example of this embodiment is a system with an internal capacitor in the substrate layer forming a return path.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> illustrate an example, which a portion of the bond pads are not covered by the conductive layer. In one embodiment, the uncovered bonds pads allow for a better connection to an integrated circuit.</p>

The uncovered portion of the antenna pattern can then be plated with a conductive layer in a manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example where an antenna web <b>200</b>, includes a number of antennas <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b>. The seed layer can be laid down as shown in the hatched region. Shunts and resist can be placed in regions, such as region <b>208</b>, connected to the seed layer connector regions, such as connector region <b>210</b>, separate from the antennas can be used to reduce the required size of the shunt and resist. The uncovered portion of the antenna pattern can then be plated with a conductive layer in a manner described above. In one embodiment, multiple antennas can be plated at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, when the shunts and the resist are removed, the antennas <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are electrically isolated. The antennas <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> can then be tested independently before they are removed from the antenna web <b>200</b>. This can provide significant commercial value.</p>
