<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to magnetoresistive (MR) sensors, such as MR read heads for magnetic recording disk drives, and more particularly to MR sensors based on the spin accumulation effect.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One type of conventional MR sensor, often called a “spin-valve” (SV) sensor, has a stack of layers that include two ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic spacer layer. One ferromagnetic layer has its magnetization direction fixed, such as by being pinned by exchange coupling with an adjacent antiferromagnetic layer, and the other ferromagnetic layer has its magnetization direction “free” to rotate in the presence of an external magnetic field. With a sense current applied to the sensor, the rotation of the free-layer magnetization relative to the fixed-layer magnetization is detectable as a change in electrical resistance. The SV MR read head used in all current magnetic recording hard disk drives operates with the sense current directed parallel to the planes of the layers in the sensor layer stack, so it is referred to as a current-in-the-plane (CIP) sensor. In a disk drive CIP-SV read sensor or head, the magnetization of the fixed or pinned layer is generally perpendicular to the plane of the disk, and the magnetization of the free layer is generally parallel to the plane of the disk in the absence of an external magnetic field. When exposed to an external magnetic field from the recorded data on the disk, the free-layer magnetization will rotate, causing a change in electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A type of MR read head based on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) has been proposed. In an MTJ MR read head the nonmagnetic spacer layer between the free and fixed ferromagnetic layers is a nonmagnetic tunnel barrier layer, typically formed of alumina. The MTJ MR read head operates with tunneling current perpendicular to the planes (CPP) of the layers in the sensor stack, and the tunneling current that passes perpendicularly through the layers depends on the relative orientation of the magnetizations in the two ferromagnetic layers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A type of MR sensor and read head based on “spin accumulation” has been proposed in US 2005/0002128 A1 and US 2004/0257714 A1. This type of sensor is based on the experimental results published by F. J. Jedema et al., “Electrical detection of spin precession in a metallic mesoscopic spin valve”, <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 416, April 2002, pp. 713-716. This type of MR sensor has an electrically conductive strip with a first tunnel barrier and a free ferromagnetic layer on the front or sensing end of the strip and second tunnel barrier and a fixed ferromagnetic layer on the back end of the strip. When current is passed from the fixed ferromagnetic layer through the second tunnel barrier into the back end of the strip and the fixed ferromagnetic layer is magnetized in a direction so that the number of spin up electrons in that layer is higher than the number of spin-down electrons, then spin-up electrons accumulate below the second tunnel barrier. However since the strip is nonmagnetic the degree of the spin-accumulation decays exponentially with a characteristic length scale equal to the spin diffusion length of the of the electrons in the strip material. If the front end of the strip is located at a distance about equal to or shorter than the spin diffusion length then the spin accumulation is detected as a voltage across the front end. This voltage depends on the direction of magnetization of the free ferromagnetic layer so that when the free layer is exposed to an external magnetic field the electrical resistance across the first tunnel barrier changes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For maximum read-head stability and output-linearity without hysteresis in the MR read head based on the spin accumulation effect, the magnetization of the free layer should be maintained in a saturated single domain state in the absence of an external magnetic field. In such a state, the local magnetization everywhere in the free layer, including the ends or side edges, is essentially “longitudinal”, i.e., along the length of the free layer and the cross-track direction of the head and parallel to the plane of the magnetic recording medium. The previously-cited references propose longitudinal biasing of the free layer by either ferromagnetic biasing layers located on opposite sides of the free layer or a ferromagnetic biasing layer located in the sensor stack and magnetostatically coupled with the free layer across a nonmagnetic spacer layer. The proposed in-stack biasing approach requires a second antiferromagnetic layer in the sensor to exchange-couple the biasing layer and thus a second annealing step in the presence of an applied field to set the magnetization direction of the biasing layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is an MR sensor based on the spin accumulation effect with improved in-stack biasing of the sensor free ferromagnetic layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is an MR sensor based on the spin accumulation effect that includes an in-stack biasing structure with a ferromagnetic biasing layer that is magnetically-coupled orthogonally with the sensor free ferromagnetic layer across a spacer layer. The sensor has an electrically conductive strip with a first tunnel barrier and a free ferromagnetic layer on the front or sensing end of the strip and second tunnel barrier and a fixed ferromagnetic layer on the back end of the strip. A magnetically-coupling spacer layer is formed on the free layer and the ferromagnetic biasing layer is formed on the spacer layer. The magnetically-coupling layer induces direct orthogonal magnetic coupling between the in-plane magnetization directions of the biasing layer and the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An antiferromagnetic layer is used to exchange-couple the biasing layer to fix its in-plane magnetization direction parallel to the in-plane magnetization direction of the sensor fixed ferromagnetic layer. Because the magnetization directions of the biasing and fixed layers in the sensor are parallel, a single annealing step is used to set their magnetization directions. This allows the same antiferromagnetic material to be used for both the antiferromagnetic layer that exchange-couples the biasing layer and the antiferromagnetic layer that exchange-couples the fixed layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The spacer layer that induces the orthogonal magnetic coupling can be an XMn alloy, where X is Pt, Ni, Fe, Ir, Pd or Rh; elemental Cr or Mn; a rare-earth transition-metal alloy, such as TbFe, ThCo, GdFe and GdCo; or a nonmagnetic transition metal, such as Cu, Ru, Ir, Rh and Os. Preferably the magnetically-coupling layer is PtMn having a thickness between approximately 15 and 50 Å.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sensor of this invention can be used as a magnetoresistive (MR) read head for magnetic recording disk drives and thus the operation of a conventional disk drive will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. However, the sensor of this invention is fully applicable as a magnetic field sensor and as a read head for magnetic recording media other than magnetic recording disks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a conventional magnetic recording hard disk drive. The disk drive includes a magnetic recording disk <b>12</b> and a rotary voice coil motor (VCM) actuator <b>14</b> supported on a disk drive housing or base <b>16</b>. The disk <b>12</b> has a center of rotation <b>13</b> and is rotated in direction <b>15</b> by a spindle motor (not shown) mounted to base <b>16</b>. The actuator <b>14</b> pivots about axis <b>17</b> and includes a rigid actuator arm <b>18</b>. A generally flexible suspension <b>20</b> includes a flexure element <b>23</b> and is attached to the end of arm <b>18</b>. A head carrier or air-bearing slider <b>22</b> is attached to the flexure <b>23</b>. A magnetic recording read/write head <b>24</b> is formed on the trailing surface <b>25</b> of slider <b>22</b>. The flexure <b>23</b> and suspension <b>20</b> enable the slider to “pitch” and “roll” on an air-bearing generated by the rotating disk <b>12</b>. Typically, there are multiple disks stacked on a hub that is rotated by the spindle motor, with a separate slider and read/write head associated with each disk surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged end view of the slider <b>22</b> and a section of the disk <b>12</b> taken in the direction <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The slider <b>22</b> is attached to flexure <b>23</b> and has an air-bearing surface (ABS) <b>27</b> facing the disk <b>12</b> and an end face or trailing surface <b>25</b> generally perpendicular to the ABS. The ABS <b>27</b> causes the airflow from the rotating disk <b>12</b> to generate a bearing of air that supports the slider <b>20</b> in very close proximity to or near contact with the surface of disk <b>12</b>. The read/write head <b>24</b> is formed on the slider's trailing surface <b>25</b> and is connected to the disk drive read/write electronics by electrical connection to terminal pads <b>29</b> on the trailing surface <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view in the direction <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and shows the ends of read/write head <b>24</b> on ABS <b>27</b> as viewed from the disk <b>12</b>. The read/write head <b>24</b> is a series of thin films deposited and lithographically patterned on slider <b>22</b>. Slider <b>22</b> is typically a wafer of ceramic material, such as a composite of alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and titanium carbide (TiC), or silicon. The write head includes magnetic write poles P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> separated by a write gap <b>30</b>. The MR sensor or read head <b>100</b> is located between two insulating gap layers G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> that are typically formed of alumina. Gap layers G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> are located between magnetic shields S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> that are typically formed of permalloy (NiFe) or sendust (FeAlSi).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> illustrate perspective and side-sectional view, respectively, of the MR read head based on the spin accumulation effect as described in US 2005/0002128 A1. The substrate for the read head is the body of slider <b>22</b> with S<b>1</b> formed on it and G<b>1</b> formed on S<b>1</b>. The head includes an electrically conductive strip <b>103</b> that has a first or sensing end <b>103</b><i>a </i>near the ABS and a second or back end <b>103</b><i>b </i>recessed from the ABS. The strip <b>103</b> is formed of electrically conducting material, such as aluminum (Al) or semiconductor material like GaAs. A first tunnel barrier <b>104</b> is deposited on the first end <b>103</b><i>a</i>, and a second tunnel barrier <b>108</b> is deposited on the second end <b>103</b><i>b</i>. The tunnel barrier material is typically alumina, magnesium oxide (MgO) or any of the well-known materials proposed for use in magnetic tunnel junction devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At the first or sensing end of the read head a first or sensing ferromagnetic layer <b>105</b> is formed on first tunnel barrier <b>104</b>. The sensing ferromagnetic layer <b>105</b> has its in-plane magnetic moment or magnetization direction <b>105</b><i>a </i>oriented generally parallel to the ABS in the absence of an external magnetic field, i.e., magnetic fields from recorded data in the magnetic recording layer of the disk. The sensing ferromagnetic layer <b>105</b> is called the “free” layer because its magnetization direction <b>105</b><i>a </i>is free to rotate in the presence of magnetic fields from the recorded data. At the second or back end of the read head a second or “fixed” ferromagnetic layer <b>109</b> is formed on the second tunnel barrier <b>108</b>. The fixed ferromagnetic layer <b>109</b> has its in-plane magnetic moment or magnetization direction <b>109</b><i>a </i>oriented substantially orthogonal to the ABS and prevented from rotation in the presence of magnetic fields in the range of interest, i.e., magnetic fields from the recorded data. The fixed ferromagnetic layer <b>109</b> is typically exchange-coupled with an antiferromagnetic layer <b>110</b> that results in the magnetization direction <b>109</b><i>a </i>of fixed ferromagnetic layer <b>109</b> being fixed or “pinned” from rotation in the presence of magnetic fields from the recorded data. The fixed layer <b>109</b> can also be the well-known antiparallel-pinned (AP-pinned) structure, also called a “laminated” pinned layer, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,185. The AP-pinned structure comprises a ferromagnetic pinned layer, a non-magnetic spacer layer and a ferromagnetic reference layer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The free layer <b>105</b> and fixed layer <b>109</b> are typically formed of an alloy of one or more of Co, Fe and Ni, or a bilayer of two alloys, such as a CoFe—NiFe bilayer. The antiferromagnetic layer <b>110</b> is typically formed of a sufficiently thick Mn alloy layer (PtMn, NiMn, FeMn, IrMn, PdMn, PtPdMn or RhMn). A PtMn layer needs to be thicker than approximately 100 Å to become chemically-ordered and antiferromagnetic when annealed, and an IrMn layer is antiferromagnetic as deposited when it is thicker than approximately 40 Å. These antiferromagnetic Mn alloys may also include small amounts of additional elements, such as Cr, V, Pt, Pd and Ni that are typically added to improve corrosion resistance or increase electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, “hard” or relatively high coercivity ferromagnets <b>107</b>, such as CoPt or CoCrPt, are located on either side of the free ferromagnetic layer <b>105</b> and separated from it by insulating material <b>106</b>. The ferromagnets <b>107</b> provide a longitudinal biasing magnetic field to stabilize the magnetization of the free layer <b>105</b> longitudinally in the direction parallel to the ABS and linearize the output of the read head.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an alternative to the hard-biasing structure of ferromagnets <b>107</b> and insulating material <b>106</b> located on the sides of the free layer <b>105</b>, in-stack longitudinal biasing has been proposed for MR sensors based on the spin accumulation effect, as suggested in US 2004/0257714 A1. In this approach a ferromagnetic biasing layer with an in-plane magnetization direction parallel to the in-plane magnetization of the free layer <b>105</b> is formed on a nonmagnetic spacer on the free layer <b>105</b> and an antiferromagnetic layer is formed on the ferromagnetic biasing layer to fix its magnetization direction by exchange-coupling. Because the magnetization direction <b>109</b><i>a </i>of the fixed layer <b>109</b> is orthogonal to the magnetization direction of the in-stack biasing layer, two annealing steps are required to set the two orthogonal magnetization directions for the free layer <b>105</b> and the in-stack biasing layer. This requires that the two antiferromagnetic layers must either be made of different materials or of the same material with different thickness to ensure that the two antiferromagnetic layers have different blocking temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, electrical contacts or leads <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> are located below and above, respectively, the back end of the head. The back end of the head is connected to circuitry (not shown) that directs current (depicted by arrow <b>120</b>) through the fixed ferromagnetic layer <b>109</b>, second tunnel barrier <b>108</b> and the back end <b>103</b><i>b </i>of strip <b>103</b>. At the front end of the head an electrical lead <b>114</b> is in contact with free ferromagnetic layer <b>105</b>. Electrical-resistance-detection circuitry (not shown) coupled to lead <b>114</b> and the front end <b>103</b><i>a </i>of strip <b>103</b> detects the changes in electrical resistance across the first tunnel barrier <b>104</b>. When current is passed through the back end of the head, the tunnel barrier <b>108</b> provides a high electron-spin-dependent resistance that enhances the spin polarization of the current injected into the back end <b>103</b><i>b </i>of the strip <b>103</b>. Spin accumulation, i.e., unequal densities of spin-up and spin-down electrons, occurs in the strip <b>103</b>, and diffuses along the length of the strip <b>103</b> to the front end <b>103</b><i>a</i>. This spin accumulation is detected by a voltage across the front end of the head. When the free layer <b>105</b> is exposed to external magnetic fields from the recorded data while current is passing at the back end of the sensor, the electrical resistance across the tunnel barrier <b>104</b> changes.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">The Invention</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a view from of the ABS end of the sensor of this invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a side sectional view of the front or sensing end of the sensor of this invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a perspective view of the sensor of this invention. The sensor is substantially identical structurally to the prior art sensor described above, with the primary exception of a longitudinal bias stack <b>240</b> at the front end and the elimination of the ferromagnets <b>107</b> and insulating material <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The bias stack <b>240</b> includes a biasing ferromagnetic layer <b>244</b> that has an in-plane magnetic moment or magnetization direction <b>245</b> that is substantially orthogonal to the moment <b>105</b><i>a </i>of free layer <b>105</b> in the absence of an external magnetic field and substantially parallel to the moment <b>109</b><i>a </i>of fixed layer <b>109</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). As used herein “substantially orthogonal” means that the two moments or magnetization directions are closer to orthogonal than parallel. An antiferromagnetic layer <b>246</b> is formed on biasing layer <b>244</b> and provides antiferromagnetic exchange-coupling to the biasing layer <b>244</b> to assure that its moment <b>245</b> will not rotate in the presence of an external magnetic field in the range of interest of the sensor, i.e, magnetic fields from recorded data in the magnetic recording layer of the disk. The magnetization direction <b>105</b><i>a </i>of free layer <b>105</b>, in the absence of an external magnetic field, is caused to be orthogonal to the magnetization direction <b>245</b> of biasing layer <b>244</b> by direct orthogonal magnetic coupling induced by spacer layer <b>242</b> that acts as a magnetically-coupling layer. The layers <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> in bias stack <b>240</b> have side walls that are contiguous with the side walls of the free layer <b>105</b> and thus are patterned to the trackwidth (TW) dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The magnetization directions <b>245</b> of biasing layer <b>244</b> and <b>109</b><i>a </i>of fixed layer <b>109</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) can be set in a single annealing step. This allows the antiferromagnetic layers <b>246</b> and <b>110</b> to be made of the same material. The easy axes of the biasing layer <b>244</b> and the free layer <b>105</b> initially are parallel to the magnetic field applied during deposition, i.e., parallel to the directions <b>245</b> and <b>109</b><i>a</i>. However, after annealing, the biasing layer <b>244</b> becomes exchange-biased with the antiferromagnetic layer <b>246</b> and the free layer <b>105</b> exhibits a 90-degree rotated easy axis, orthogonal to the annealing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the biasing layer <b>244</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> as a single layer, it can also be the well-known antiparallel-pinned (AP-pinned) structure, also called a “laminated” pinned layer. The AP-pinned biasing layer comprises a ferromagnetic pinned layer exchange-biased with antiferromagnetic layer <b>246</b>, a non-magnetic spacer layer and a ferromagnetic reference layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The orthogonal magnetic coupling layer of free layer <b>105</b> to biasing layer <b>245</b> is induced by the spacer layer <b>242</b> that acts as a magnetically-coupling layer. The spacer layer <b>242</b> is preferably a generally equiatomic Pt<sub>50</sub>Mn<sub>50 </sub>layer having a thickness less than approximately 100 Å, preferably between approximately 15 Å and 50 Å. This thickness is well below the thickness at which Pt<sub>50</sub>Mn<sub>50 </sub>exhibits its antiferromagnetic exchange bias effect, which is typically at a thickness greater than approximately 100 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Orthogonal magnetic coupling has been observed between two Co<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10 </sub>layers, in which the first Co<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10 </sub>layer is exchange-biased to a PtMn antiferromagnetic layer and the two Co<sub>90</sub>Fe<sub>10 </sub>layers are separated by a thin cobalt-ferrite (CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) layer. S. Maat and B. Gurney, “90° coupling induced by exchange biasing in PtMn/CoFe<sub>10</sub>/CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CoFe<sub>10 </sub>films”, <i>J. Appl. Phys</i>., Vol. 93, pp. 7229-7231 (2003). However, because cobalt-ferrite is an electrical insulator, structures incorporating it are generally not usable in sensors because of the increased resistance across the sensor stack.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The effect of direct orthogonal magnetic coupling has been demonstrated for various PtMn spacer layer thicknesses, as described in detail in the previously-cited pending application. The magnetic coupling was very close to 90 degrees. Preferably the magnetic coupling induced by the spacer layer should be approximately orthogonal, e.g., between approximately 80 and 100 degrees. In one test structure a 40 Å Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20 </sub>free layer was orthogonally biased across a 20 Å PtMn spacer layer by a 20 Å Co<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20 </sub>biasing layer that was exchange-coupled to an IrMn antiferromagnet.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A high anisotropy field H<sub>k </sub>from the biasing layer <b>244</b> is desirable to assure that the free layer <b>105</b> response is a linear function of the applied field. Typical fields from the recorded media are less than approximately 150 Oe, and conventional MR read heads have free layers with H<sub>k </sub>of only approximately 40 Oe or less, but the biasing field from the conventional hard bias layer (ferromagnets <b>107</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) creates a unidirectional anisotropy field of similar magnitude (200-400 Oe). In this invention experimental results from test structures show that free layers with orthogonal bias can achieve H<sub>k </sub>higher than approximately 300 Oe for PtMn spacer layer thicknesses of approximately 20 Å and H<sub>k </sub>higher than approximately 400 Oe for PtMn spacer layer thicknesses of approximately 15 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To obtain orthogonal coupling between the biasing layer and the free layer the biasing layer should have a fixed magnetization direction in low externally applied magnetic fields as it is created through exchange biasing with an antiferromagnet. Alternatively, a hard magnet with high remanence may be used as the biasing layer since its magnetization will also be fixed in externally applied magnetic fields lower than its coercive field. Thus the biasing layer may be formed of a CoPt alloy like Co<sub>100-x-y</sub>Pt<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>y</sub>, where x is in the range of 10 to 35 atomic % and y is in the range of 0 to 5 atomic %.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The electrically-conducting magnetically-coupling spacer layer needs to exhibit some degree of antiferromagnetic interactions to invoke orthogonal coupling in the second ferromagnetic layer due to interfacial spin-frustration. Accordingly the spacer layer can be an antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material. However the spacer layer should be below the critical thickness where it exhibits exchange-bias interaction with the adjacent ferromagnetic layers. The orthogonal coupling then is a result of energy minimization. Thus the materials described below are also believed suitable for use as the spacer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other Mn alloys may be suitable for use as the spacer layer providing orthogonal magnetic coupling provided they have thicknesses below which they exhibit the effect of antiferromagnetic exchange-biasing. These other Mn alloys include NiMn, FeMn, IrMn, PdMn, PtPdMn and RhMn. These Mn alloys may also include small amounts of additional elements, such as Cr, V, Pt, Pd and Ni that are typically added to improve corrosion resistance or increase electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Elementary Cr or Mn may also be suitable for use as the spacer layer. Thin layers of either element do not exhibit exchange-bias interaction with an adjacent ferromagnetic layer although they exhibit antiferromagnetic order.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Certain electrically-conducting ferrimagnetic materials, such as the rare-earth transition-metal alloys, may also be suitable for use as the spacer layer. These include TbFe, ThCo, GdFe and GdCo.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to the above materials for the magnetically-coupling spacer layer, all of which exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions, certain non-magnetic transition metals that induce an electron-mediated indirect exchange coupling (RKKY coupling) may also be suitable because the exchange interaction can oscillate between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic values as a function of the spacer thickness. Therefore if the microstructure of the layers was made such that the local thickness of the spacer layer is rapidly fluctuating, both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic values may coexist on a scale smaller than the ferromagnetic domain wall width. This case is magnetically similar to an antiferromagnetic spacer and will therefore also induce frustration leading to orthogonal coupling of the ferromagnetic layers. These non-magnetic spacer materials include Cu, Ru, Ir, Rh, and Os. See J. C. Slonczewski, “Overview of interlayer exchange theory”, <i>Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials</i>, 150 (1995) 13-24.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment described above the biasing ferromagnetic layer was exchange biased to an antiferromagnetic layer. However, as described above, the biasing ferromagnetic layer may also be a hard ferromagnet, such as CoPt or CoCrPt, in which case an antiferromagnetic layer would not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the disclosed invention is to be considered merely as illustrative and limited in scope only as specified in the appended claims.</p>
