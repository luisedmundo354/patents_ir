<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a Continuation of PCT/GB01/05226 filed Nov. 28, 2001.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to current sensors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, there are described many different ways for non-invasively measuring current flowing in a conductor. One well known method is to use what is known as a direct current transformer which typically uses a relatively low frequency excitation current and using a two-core method. In such a two-core method, a DC current through the two cores biases each with flux at the same polarity, while the flux in one core due to a modulator drive remains out of phase with that in the second. Each core reaches a saturation flux level so that it reaches saturation flux level at a different point in the excitation cycle for one alternation than for the other alternation. The result is an output signal at even harmonics of the excitation frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Techniques such as the above are used to provide an absolute measurement of current. In many cases however, such as monitoring insulation breakdown in high current conductors, it is required to measure leakage currents in the presence of very high drive currents. For instance, DC motors on locomotives might have a drive current of 3000 amps and the leakage current desired to be monitored for insulation breakdown may well be in the order of milliamps. In such cases, the large drive currents result in very large magnetic fields and, even though send and return conductors may carry almost the same current, it is clear that the fringing magnetic fields which in this case will not be insignificant, would not cancel and will be dependent on the position of the conductors within the cores. There would therefore result a positionally dependent measurement and no coherent information would be recoverable. Some manufacturers have sought to obviate these problems by utilising complicated bus bar geometry so as to cancel out the fringing magnetic fields. However, apart from being costly such solutions are often not practical.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is a first aim of embodiments of the present invention to provide a novel current sensing apparatus which allows the measurement of small leakage currents in the presence of high drive currents without requiring complicated bus bar geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is a further aim of embodiments of the present invention to provide a current sensor geometry in which only a single measurement core is required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a still further aim to provide means for monitoring insulation breakdown in conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a current sensor comprising an outer shielding means, a toroidal inner core and inner shield means, there being further provided a combined driving and sensing winding being wound around said inner core, first and second ends of said winding being connectable to a sensor head, said inner shield means having a gap formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the inner shield means is located in a region inside an inner diameter of the inner core. Said inner shield means preferably comprises a ring of material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The ring of material may be of, for instance, a magnetic steel. The inner ring may be laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, a cover piece is provided for supporting the magnetic sensor. Preferably, the cover piece is of a non-conductive, preferably plastics, construction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the outer shielding means comprises an outer core forming an outer periphery of said current sensor. The outer core may comprise a series of laminations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the outer core is provided with a gap formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the gap in the outer core is not aligned with the gap in the inner core.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the laminations comprise a magnetic steel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the inner core comprises high performance ferromagnetic material.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The inner core may comprise an amorphous ferromagnetic alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inner core may comprise a high nickel ferromagnetic alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, said winding has a first end which is arranged to receive a drive signal and a second end which is arranged for providing an output sensing signal. Preferably, the second end is connected to a sense resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the first end is connected to a source of excitation at a frequency F. Preferably, the second end is connected to a band pass filter centred at a frequency of 2F. Preferably, the frequency F is substantially 4 KHz.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the output of the band pass filter is thereafter rectified and integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the sensor winding is excited by means of a source of excitation applied to a first, inverting, input of a differential amplifier. Preferably, the second, non-inverting, input of the differential amplifier is connected to earth and the output of the differential amplifier being connected to the first end of the winding.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the rectified band pass filtered and integrated output is fed back to the inverting input of the differential amplifier via a feed back resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The integrated rectified band pass filtered output may be further connected to processing circuitry. The processing circuitry may include data logging circuitry. The data logging circuitry may be arranged to monitor occurrences of non-zero outputs against time.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the number of non-zero outputs within a given time period exceeds a threshold value, then the data logging circuitry may output a warning signal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The warning signal may give notice that an unacceptable level of leakage current has occurred within a given time period.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such data logging circuitry may be useful in monitoring insulation breakdown in conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a clamp on probe comprising a first limb and a second limb, the first and second limbs being shaped so as to cooperate with one another to form a substantially complete magnetic circuit when the probe is in a closed configuration, the probe being characterized by the following features: said first and second limbs comprise ferromagnetic material which act as a flux guide when said probe surrounds a current carrying conductor, said first and second limbs each being provided with a recess in their inner periphery in which first and second current sensors means are housed, said first and second recesses being arranged so as to shield said first and second current sensing means located therein from field effects caused by the earth's magnetic field, and wherein said first and second current sensors are connected differentially so as to respond to a differential magnetic field produced by the conductor around which the probe is fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, said first and second current sensors comprise linear flux gates.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, said first and second sensors are driven, in use, at a high frequency, preferably in the range of 80 to 200 KHz.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, output voltages across the two capacitors are fed to a differential amplifier and subtracted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a fuse monitor, the monitor comprising a fuse holder for receiving a fuse, and an electric field strength sensor, wherein the electric field strength sensor is disposed so as to capacitively charge in response to current flow through the fuse.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the electric field strength sensor is substantially planar and arranged such that one face is directed towards a position in which the fuse is, in use, received.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Said electric field strength sensor may comprise a foil.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the electric field strength sensor is connected via signal processing means to an alarm indicator arranged to display whether the said fuse is intact or blown.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fuse monitor may further comprise a current sensor for monitoring, in use, current flow through a fuse received by the fuse holder.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the current sensor is substantially toroidal and arranged, in use, to circumferentially surround the fuse in the fuse holder such that a conductor comprising said fuse extends through the aperture defined by the toroidal nature of the current sensor and in substantially parallel relation to a central axis of said current sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The current sensor is preferably a sensor in accordance with the first aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how embodiments of the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which:</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a current sensor in accordance with the first aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The current sensor probe comprises an inner shield <b>1</b>, a cover piece <b>2</b>, a toroidal winding <b>3</b> and an outer shielding means comprising an outer shield means wound on an inner core.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The inner shield <b>1</b> is shaped as an incomplete ring and includes a gap <b>1</b>A separating end faces of the ring. The gap is small in comparison to the circumference of the inner shield <b>1</b> and in typical applications may be of the order of 1 or 2 mm, whilst the circumference of the inner shield <b>1</b> may be in typical applications around 30 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The toroidal winding <b>3</b> is formed on an inner core comprising a material having a substantially square B-H loop with high intrinsic permeability. Such a material may be, for instance, nickel iron or an amorphous ferromagnetic alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The outer shield <b>4</b> shields at least an outer periphery of the winding <b>3</b> from external field effects and may comprise a series of magnetic steel laminations. The laminations forming the outer shield <b>4</b> do not form a complete ring, but instead are separated by a small gap <b>40</b> at adjacent end faces. This gap may typically be around 2 mm, the purpose of the outer core is to confine all fringing fields and give positional independence to the sensor. In this way, with send and receive cables running inside the inner periphery of the probe and surrounded by the probe, the measurement result is independent of proximity of those send and receive cables as both of their fringing fields will be confined to the outer core and will sum to zero when there is no leakage current present. The purpose of the gap <b>40</b> is to increase the saturation level of the outer core for a given excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown in plan view the external appearance of a magnetic sensor as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As can be seen, the outer shield <b>4</b> is built up of a number of laminations and features gap <b>40</b>. Inside the outer shield, there is the toroidal winding <b>3</b> formed on the inner core. Then, concentrically arranged inside of the toroidal winding <b>3</b> there is the inner shield <b>1</b>, with gap <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>, there is shown a cover piece which holds the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cover piece <b>2</b> is shown in bottom plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in top plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> and in sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The cover piece <b>2</b> is a stepped plastics member having a first, larger, inner diameter D which is arranged to be the same as the outer diameter of the outer shield <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A second, inner diameter d of the cover piece <b>2</b> is arranged to be the same as the inner diameter of the inner shield <b>1</b>. Therefore, as can be seen, the magnetic sensor arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be simply placed into the plastics cover piece <b>2</b> and, in use, the conductors which are to be monitored with regard to current detection may be fed into a mouth region M (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) and fed through the sensor to pass within the inner diameter of the inner shield <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a circuit which may be used in combination with the current sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In the circuit, there is shown a differential amplifier <b>5</b>, having its non-inverting input grounded and its inverting input connected to a source <b>6</b> of excitation at 4 KHz via a bias resistor R<sub>B</sub>. The inverting input is also connected to a feedback loop via a feedback resistor R<sub>F</sub>. The output of the differential amplifier <b>5</b> is connected to the sensor winding <b>3</b> to provide drive to the one end of the winding <b>3</b>, the other end of the winding <b>3</b> being connected via a sense resistor R<sub>s </sub>to earth. The junction of the sense resistor R<sub>s </sub>and the winding <b>3</b> is connected to the input of a band pass second harmonic filter <b>8</b>, centred at 8 KHz. The output of the filter <b>8</b> is fed to a rectifier <b>9</b>, whose output is then fed to an integrator <b>10</b> and the integrated rectified second harmonic output is thereafter fed to processing circuitry and (typically) display and/or data logging circuitry (not shown). The output is thereafter fed back through the feed back resistor R<sub>F </sub>to the inverting input of the differential amplifier <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a sensor of the type described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is a linear relationship between the second harmonic voltage signal and the external magnetic field. If the sensor is excited asymmetrically, then it produces even harmonics. It is this even harmonic, the second harmonic at 8 KHz, that is therefore demodulated, integrated and used as the controlling voltage to close the feedback loop. The control voltage is an indication of the strength of the magnetic field and, thus, the concommitant current.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As mentioned previously, when there are no leakage currents because of the geometry of the current sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, currents flowing within the core will sum to zero. However, when there is a leakage current, such currents will produce a non-zero core response which, by virtue of the gap <b>1</b>A causes the current sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to produce an output which directly relates to that leakage current and enables very small currents to be measured in the presence of very high drive currents.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Leakage currents give a measure of the integrity of conductor insulation as where there is insulation breakdown, leakage currents occur. In this regard, the sensor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be connected to a data logger so as to monitor the occurrence of such leakage currents over time. In this way, the condition of insulation can be monitored to allow timely replacement before deterioration progresses beyond an acceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, there is shown another aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a first, upper limb of a current sensing probe and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a second, lower limb of the same probe.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper limb comprises a core <b>11</b>, having a recess <b>12</b> formed therein. In the recess <b>12</b>, there is provided a linear flux gate <b>13</b>. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lower limb comprises a core <b>14</b>, having a recess <b>15</b> formed therein and a linear flux gate <b>16</b> situated within the recess <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In use, the upper and lower limbs of the probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> form first and second jaws of a clamp-on probe. Traditional clamp-on current sensing probes utilise Hall sensors for detecting the magnetic field resulting from an electric current passing through a conductor. These sensors are, in the main, insensitive to electric currents less than 10 mAmps. There is a market requirement for a probe to measure such values.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The positioning of the flux gates <b>13</b>, <b>16</b> within recesses <b>12</b>, <b>15</b> is done so as to reduce earth field effects.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The two flux gate sensors <b>13</b>, <b>16</b> are connected differentially (not shown) so as to respond to a differential magnetic field produced by a conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The flux gate sensitivity is dependent upon a number of factors: the number of turns, length of core material and the coupling between the coil and the core material.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The two sensors are driven in parallel at a frequency of 120 Khz. Each sensor is in series with a capacitor C tuned to resonance. The output voltages across the two capacitors C are fed to a differential amplifier and subtracted. The reason for this is that the two sensors do not attain saturation simultaneously, because they are both exposed to different external earth field values. Consequently, the two second harmonic signals are not in phase. It can thus be seen that if these two signals are subtracted, then the carrier signals will cancel out and only the second harmonic signals will remain. These second harmonic signals are then rectified on both the positive and negative peaks and the resulting DC offsets are summed to zero through an integrator. Circuitry similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be adapted for such use.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The phase shift is detected as a DC offset change, because the system comprises a carrier that is both phase and amplitude modulated. The integrator drives a power output stage which drives a compensation coil, resulting in the cancellation of the sampled field.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a further embodiment of the present invention and in particular shows a fuse holder including a current sensor along with electric field strength sensing means.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Considering <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in detail, there is shown, a housing <b>70</b> and a fuse carrier <b>72</b>. The fuse carrier further includes fuse holding brackets <b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B in which a fuse <b>76</b> is insertable, a current sensor <b>77</b> through which the fuse <b>76</b> is insertable and which is arranged, in use, to circumferentially surround the fuse <b>76</b>. There is also provided an electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> built into a wall of the fuse carrier <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The current sensor <b>77</b> is preferably of the type discussed earlier. There is now described the operation of the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> and this is described with the aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref> (in which, for clarity, the current sensor <b>77</b> is omitted).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown a fuse <b>76</b>, electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> and fuse holding brackets <b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B. There is also shown in schematic form a nominal load represented by load resistor R<sub>load </sub>and a current path (I) which in accordance with convention flows in a positive direction from a voltage source V, through the fuse <b>76</b> and into a load R<sub>load</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> may, conveniently, comprise a capacitive or electro-static inductive sensor, perhaps being a simple piece of foil, such as a thin aluminium foil. This electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> effectively charges up capacitively in accordance with the current I flowing through the fuse. Indeed, the sensor <b>78</b> should be mounted as close to the fuse as possible so that one side of this piece of foil is directed towards the conductor comprising the fuse <b>76</b>. This electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> is also preferably shielded from other external electrical fields so that the charge on the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> varies substantially in accordance with the current I flowing through the fuse <b>76</b>. This shield is represented schematically as an element <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the piece of foil comprising the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> is shielded by earthed element <b>79</b> to minimise external field effects and the sensor <b>78</b> is connected to a high input impedance voltage follower VF. The shield <b>79</b> is insulated from the sensor <b>78</b>, for instance, by being glued to one side of it by a non-conductive glue. The voltage follower VF must have a very high input impedence in order to avoid loading the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b>. In this way, bias currents of the amplifier comprising VF must be very small, otherwise the electrostatically induced charge on the sensor <b>78</b> will leak away to contribute to the bias current. Also, input capacitance of the amplifier must be low.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the equivalent circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with the sensor <b>78</b> being represented by capacitance C<sub>sensor</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is shown a voltage alarm circuit for indicating whether or not the fuse <b>76</b> is intact. The circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> comprises sensor <b>78</b> represented by C<sub>sensor</sub>, voltage follower VF as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the output of voltage follower VF being input to the non-inverting input of an amplifier AMP<b>1</b>, amplifier AMP<b>1</b> being connected as a comparator so that a reference voltage V<sub>ref </sub>appears at its inverting input, V<sub>ref </sub>being determined by biasing resistors R<sub>B1 </sub>and R<sub>B2 </sub>which are connected in series between a supply voltage V<sub>supply </sub>and earth. The inverting input of the amplifier AMP<b>1</b> is connected the common connection between series connected bias resistors R<sub>B1</sub>, R<sub>B2 </sub>and the output of amplifier AMP<b>1</b> is connected to an output pull-up resistor R<sub>out</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> will now be described in two cases, in the first case the fuse <b>76</b> being intact, and in the second case, the fuse <b>76</b> being blown.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the first case, where a current I flows through fuse <b>76</b>, one side of the piece of foil comprising the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> charges electrostatically as a consequence of the presence of current I. Because the sensor <b>78</b> reacts in a capacitive manner, the potential difference between the fuse electrode and the piece of foil comprising the sensor quickly increases and stabilises at a particular voltage V<sub>sensor</sub>. In this first case, the voltage V<sub>sensor </sub>is buffered by the voltage follower VF and input to the non-inverting input of AMP<b>1</b>. This voltage is compared with V<sub>ref </sub>and, if V<sub>sensor </sub>is higher than V<sub>ref </sub>then AMP<b>1</b> will output a non-zero voltage indicative of the fact that the fuse <b>76</b> is intact.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the second case, where the fuse <b>76</b> is blown any charge on the electric field strength sensor <b>78</b> will dissipate and V<sub>sensor </sub>will reduce. Once V<sub>sensor </sub>has dropped below the level of V<sub>ref</sub>, then the comparator formed by AMP<b>1</b> will switch states so as to no longer output a positive voltage. With this switching of states, the output of AMP<b>1</b> may be used to drive, for instance, an LED display indicating that the fuse <b>76</b> has blown.</p>
