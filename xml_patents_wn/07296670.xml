<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a disconnect mechanism and to a machine including such a disconnect mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is generally well recognised that it is useful to be able to disconnect a rotating machine, such as a generator, from its drive source or prime mover in the event of a fault developing within the machine. Where the fault is electrical, sensing equipment may cause electrical isolation of the generator. However where the fault is mechanical, for example the loss of lubricating or cooling oil or failure of an associated lubricating or cooling oil pump causing the generator to fill with oil, then the continued rotation of the machine may cause overheating resulting in catastrophic failure or a fire. If the generator is an aeronautical or aerospace generator, then this situation could result in damage to or impairment of the functionality of the engine or gearbox driving the generator. Therefore mechanical protection systems are required.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,949 discloses a protection system in which a generator receives its drive by a drive arrangement comprising two drive shafts which are coupled together via inter-engaging dogs. One of the shafts carries a screw threaded region <b>20</b> and is biased into engagement with the other shaft by a compression spring. In the event that it is desired to disconnect the drive, a spring loaded plunger is driven into a position where it can engage the screw threads and therefore give rise to a unscrewing action which separates the shafts from mechanical inter-engagement. This mechanism is relatively complex and increases the axial length of the generator and drive arrangement. Furthermore the disconnect mechanism is quite complex and hence will be relatively heavy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 4,392,835 discloses an alternative system in which a tungsten carbide cutting blade is spring loaded such that it can be moved into engagement with the drive shaft when it is required to disconnect the generator. The shaft in the region of the cutting tool is formed as a relatively thin walled tube. Friction causes local heating and the relatively thin wall of the shaft becomes plastic, allowing the shaft to separate into two portions thereby disconnecting the drive to the generator. A concern with this arrangement is that it relies on the spring pressure on the cutting tool being great enough to cause the required shaft heating and subsequent failure. Therefore this disconnect mechanism may not operate efficiently in all circumstances. For example, the shaft may be rotating at a high speed and may be in an oil filled and/or cooled environment. The required frictional heating may take some time to develop. Furthermore, if the actuating spring is large enough to ensure that there will always be sufficient pressure to break the shaft then it will be large and relatively heavy and will require a large force to be generated by a trigger mechanism in order to release it.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similar “shaft cutting arrangements” are described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,862,375 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,427,826.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is common practice to provide a shear neck, that is a region of reduced thickness where structural failure will occur in the event of excessive loading, to protect the prime mover and/or gearbox from damage. The shear neck is provided irrespective of whether or not some other disconnect mechanism is also included. U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,412 shows an arrangement in which the provision of the shear neck is utilised. U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,412 is primarily concerned with a generator in which there is a possibility that an oil scavenge system may become incapacitated, thereby resulting in flooding of the generator. This could cause severe damage to the generator. In order to overcome this problem, a fluid brake in the form of an impeller is attached to one end of the generator shaft. If the generator starts to flood the impeller interacts with the oil to generate a large drag torque. This drag torque is greater than the shear torque engineered into the shear region and therefore causes the shear neck to fail thereby disconnecting the generator from the prime mover.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 3,620,046 discloses a shaft having one or more shear necks and also carrying an integrally formed part conical disc region of enlarged radius. A coaxially mounted brake component is mounted such that upon release of a latch mechanism (latch pin <b>25</b>) the brake component moves under the urging of compression springs so as to engage with the disc region. This gives rise to a braking force acting on the disc leading to failure of the shear neck so as to disconnect the drive. The moving brake component is mounted to a housing of the device by inclined keys which serve to increase the application force between the brake component and the disc in response to torque caused by the frictional inter-engagement of these components. A significant disadvantage of this design is the large contact area between the moving and stationary parts. Unless the springs are very strong there may not be sufficient “bite” to enable the non-rotating component to “latch” onto the rotating part. The presence of lubricant only makes this problem worse. The mechanism is also relatively bulky and heavy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">GB 1044094 discloses a disconnect device in which loading of a shaft causes failure of a shear neck. The loading mechanism comprises a flange having axially extending projections (<b>14</b>). A spring loaded pin is held within a housing and can be moved axially to engage with the projections. A concern over this design is that high speed rotation of the shaft could result in the pin either bouncing off the projections or being worn away by successive contact.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,218 discloses a disconnect mechanism in which a cam is helically threaded on a drive shaft. A disconnect element is moved to a position so as to engage one of the radially extending surfaces of the cam thereby stopping the cam from rotating. The cam then moves along the thread until it engages an end stop where the shaft is loaded to cause a shear region to fail. Again there is a risk that high speed rotation of the shaft could cause the disconnect element to bounce off the cam rather than operating the disconnect mechanism as intended.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a disconnect device for disconnecting a driven device from a drive, where a drive transfer element having a shear region transmits torque between the drive and the driven device, the disconnect device comprising a camming element movable from a disengaged position to an engaged position where the camming element becomes caught between a rotating member on the driven device side of the shear region and a support such that rotation of the rotating member urges the camming element into a space between the rotating member and the support.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is thus possible to provide a drive disconnect arrangement in which a camming element can be brought into engagement with, for example, a driven shaft, thereby causing a sufficient torque to be transferred across the shear region to cause failure of the shear region thereby disconnecting the driven device from the drive arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The camming element may, in the engaged position, bear against an outer surface of the driven shaft. Preferably the rotating member is a disc carried on the driven shaft or the drive transfer element and having an increased radius compared to the driven shaft or the drive transfer element. Since torque is a product of the braking force and the radial distance from the axis rotation, then acting on a disc of increased radius will give rise to a larger torque for the same braking force.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously a support element is provided adjacent the rotating member in order that the camming element can bear against the support thereby preventing the camming element from being forced radially away from the rotating member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, when the camming element moves to engage with the rotating member at a contact region, the motion of the camming element and the motion of the surface of the rotating member at the contact region are in substantially the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously the camming member is profiled in order to increase its area of contact with the rotating member. An increased area of contact gives rise to increased frictional inter-engagement between the camming element and the rotating member. The surface area of inter-engagement between the camming element and the rotating member may be arranged by giving them co-operating non-planar profiles. Thus a simple cooperating profile would be for one of the camming element and the rotating member to have a concave surface, and the other one to have a convex surface formed with a similar radius of curvature. However other profiles, for example grooves of various cross-sections might also be envisaged. In embodiments where grooves or other constraining features, such as flanges, are spaced apart in a direction parallel to the axis of the rotation of the rotating member, then the camming element may be arranged to taper in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation as well as or instead of tapering in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously the camming element is held in the disengaged position by a releasable locking arrangement. The releasable locking arrangement may comprise an actuator, such as a solenoid, which can be actuated to remove a locking element from engagement with the camming element, thereby allowing the camming element to move towards the engaged position. Advantageously the camming element is biased towards the engaged position, for example by a compression spring.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, the locking element may itself be spring biased towards the unlocking position and may be held at the locked position by a temperature sensitive element. A suitable element is a eutectic pellet which is arranged to hold the locking element against the biasing force provided by a biasing arrangement, for example a spring. Thus, if the temperature of the driven device rises for some reason, such as failure of a lubricating system either preventing the circulation of cooling/lubrication oil or allowing the generator to fill with oil, then the temperature sensitive element will melt, thereby allowing the locking element to release the camming element to move to the engaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably an abutment is positioned in close proximity to the rotating member on a side of a rotating member substantially opposite to that of the camming element. A clearance exists between the rotating element and the abutment when the camming element is at the disengaged position. However, once the camming element moves to the engaged position, then free play in the bearings or other support structure supporting the rotating member may allow the rotating member to move into engagement with the abutment thereby giving rise to a further force acting to hold the rotating element against further rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably the camming element is arranged to translate linearly from the disengaged position to the engaged position. However the camming element may be arranged to rotate about a axis during its motion from the disengaged to the engaged position. In such an arrangement, the camming arrangement still becomes entrained between the rotating member and the support.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a generator constituting an embodiment of the present invention. Since the invention relates to a disconnect arrangement for a rotating machine and is not specifically limited to use with the generator, then the electrical components of the generator do not constitute part of this invention and hence for simplicity will be assumed to reside within the dotted outline <b>2</b>. The generator comprises a generator shaft <b>4</b> which is supported within a generator housing <b>6</b> by bearings <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>. A first end <b>12</b> of the generator shaft <b>4</b> has a hollow region carrying inwardly facing splines <b>14</b> which, in use, drivingly inter-engage with co-operating outwardly facing splines of a stub shaft <b>16</b>. The stub shaft <b>16</b> has a further set of splines <b>18</b> which drivingly inter-engage with co-operating splines of a further shaft, gearbox or the like driven from a prime mover <b>19</b>. A central portion of the stub shaft <b>16</b> is thinned in order to form a shear neck <b>20</b>. The shear neck <b>20</b> forms an engineered region of weakness in the drive chain between the prime mover and the generator. Thus torque exceeding a predetermined value within the drive train will cause the shear neck <b>20</b> to fail.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second end <b>30</b> of the shaft <b>4</b> carries a rotating member <b>32</b>. The rotating member <b>32</b> is in splined or keyed engagement with the second end <b>30</b> of the shaft <b>4</b> so as to rotate with the shaft. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rotating member may have a profiled outer surface <b>34</b> which, in this example, is concave giving the rotating element <b>32</b> the appearance of a pulley wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A camming element <b>40</b> is disposed adjacent one side of the rotating member <b>32</b> and is positioned between the rotating member <b>32</b> and a support <b>42</b> which, in this example, is integrally formed with the generator housing <b>6</b>. An abutment region <b>44</b> is formed adjacent the rotating member <b>32</b> at a position opposing the camming element <b>40</b> and, for convenience, the abutment <b>44</b> may also be formed as an integral part of the generator housing <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the end portion of the generator in greater detail. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the support <b>42</b> and the abutment <b>44</b> are carried on an end plate <b>50</b> which can be bolted to the generator housing <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It can be seen that the camming element <b>40</b> comprises a tapered head <b>52</b> whose width increases from a relatively narrow end region <b>54</b> to a thicker rear end portion <b>56</b>. The head <b>52</b> of the camming element <b>40</b> has an elongate tail <b>58</b> extending therefrom which passes through a duct <b>60</b> formed as part of the support <b>42</b>. The tail <b>58</b> also passes, in a clearance fit, through a narrower channel <b>62</b>, and a portion of the tail <b>58</b> extends beyond the channel <b>62</b>. Within the duct <b>60</b> a gap exists between the side of the duct and the tail <b>58</b> and a compression spring <b>64</b> is located in the gap. The spring <b>64</b> extends between the closed end of the duct <b>60</b> and an end face of the enlarged head <b>52</b> and thereby urges the camming element <b>40</b> into an engaged position in which the head <b>40</b> engages with the rotating member <b>32</b> and also with the support <b>42</b>, becoming trapped therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to hold the camming element <b>40</b> at the disengaged position the space around the compression spring <b>64</b> is filled with a eutectic mixture whilst the camming element <b>40</b> is held at the disengaged position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The eutectic mixture is then allowed to cool thereby holding the camming element at the disengaged position. In use, if failure of the generator results in excessive heating of the generator, the temperature rise causes the eutectic mixture located in duct <b>60</b> to melt thereby allowing the spring <b>64</b> to move and to urge the camming element along the direction of arrow A such that it becomes caught between the support <b>42</b> and the rotating member <b>32</b> which rotates, in this example, in a clockwise direction signified by arrow B. At the point of contact the surfaces of the rotating member and the camming element are moving in the same direction, thereby avoiding the problem of the camming element bouncing off the rotating member. Frictional engagement between the head <b>52</b> of the camming element <b>40</b> and the rotating member <b>32</b> gives rise to a force which further tries to pull the camming element into the gap between the rotating member <b>32</b> and the support <b>42</b> and, as the rear portion of the head <b>56</b> is significantly wider than that gap the camming element becomes jammed in the gap with a large force acting between it and the rotating member <b>32</b> thereby locking the rotating member <b>32</b> against further rotation, and thereby locking the generator against rotation. This rapid locking of the generator causes a large torque to be generated across the shear neck <b>20</b> thereby causing it to fail and to drivingly disconnect the generator from the prime mover.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates a further disconnect mechanism constituting a refinement of that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Essentially the design of the camming element <b>40</b> remains unchanged and it is still urged towards the engaged position by a compression spring <b>64</b>. However in this arrangement there is no eutectic within the duct <b>60</b> in which the compression spring <b>64</b> is enclosed. Instead, a further release mechanism generally designated <b>70</b> is provided in which a spring loaded plunger <b>72</b> is positioned such that, in an armed state, an end portion <b>74</b> of the plunger <b>72</b> restrains the camming element <b>40</b> against movement towards its engaged position. In this example, the end portion <b>74</b> abuts an end face of the head <b>52</b> of the camming element <b>40</b>. The plunger <b>72</b> is urged by a compression spring <b>76</b> to move to a position where the end portion <b>74</b> disengages from contact with the camming element <b>40</b>. However the motion of the plunger <b>72</b> is restrained by a head end <b>78</b> of the plunger abutting a block of meltable material <b>80</b>. The block of material <b>80</b> is typically a eutectic pellet. The eutectic pellet is held within a generally cylindrical cavity which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has an opening <b>82</b> at an end portion thereof which allows the eutectic to escape into a further cavity <b>84</b>. The cavity <b>84</b> is closed thereby ensuring that the melted eutectic remains trapped within the cavity and hence does not contaminate the lubricant for the generator. In operation, failure of the cooling/lubricating system or flooding of the generator results in a temperature rise. Once the temperature has risen sufficiently the eutectic <b>80</b> melts and can flow into the cavity <b>84</b>. As the eutectic melts the plunger <b>72</b> becomes free to move under the urging of the compression spring <b>76</b> thereby disengaging from the camming element <b>40</b> which in turn becomes free to move from the disengaged position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to an engaged position in which it becomes jammed between the rotating member <b>32</b> and the support <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> schematically show a further embodiment of the invention in the disengaged and the engaged positions, respectively. As before, the enlarged rotating element <b>32</b> is in splined engagement with the end of the rotor shaft <b>30</b>. The camming element <b>40</b> is urged by compression spring <b>64</b> to move towards the engaged position and the camming element is also adjacent a support <b>42</b> which prevents it from being deflected away from the rotating element <b>32</b>. In this embodiment a solenoid <b>90</b> is provided to control the operation of the disconnect mechanism. An armature of the solenoid <b>90</b> is connected to a locking element, such as a locking pin <b>92</b> which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, engages in a recess <b>96</b> formed in the tail <b>58</b> of the camming element <b>40</b>. The locking pin <b>92</b> holds the camming element in the disengaged position. When it is desired to disconnect the generator from the prime mover, the solenoid <b>90</b> is energised so as to retract the locking pin <b>92</b> from engagement with the recess <b>96</b>. The camming element <b>40</b> is therefore free to move under the urging of the compression spring <b>64</b> thereby resulting in a face <b>100</b> of the tapered head end of the camming element <b>40</b> engaging with the rotating element <b>32</b> whilst another face <b>102</b> of the head of the canning element is held against the support <b>42</b>. Thus, as the rotating element rotates in a clockwise direction as shown by the arrow B it once again tries to pull the head of the camming element into the relatively small gap <b>104</b> causing further frictional engagement between the camming element <b>40</b> and the rotating element <b>32</b> which further serves to increase the frictional forces tending to stop the rotating element <b>32</b> from rotating and thereby to hold the rotor of the generator against rotation. The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> has the advantage that the release mechanism can be tested on the ground with the generator stationary by operating the solenoid and observing whether the camming element <b>40</b> moves under the action of the spring <b>64</b>. The test technician can then de-energise the solenoid <b>90</b> and grasp, either manually or with a tool, an end portion <b>106</b> of the camming element in order to move the camming element against the urging of the compression spring <b>64</b> and to return it to the disengaged, and armed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the relative profiles of the camming element <b>40</b> and the co-operating face of the rotating element <b>32</b> in greater detail. The face of the rotating element <b>32</b> which engages with the camming element <b>40</b> comprises a base region <b>120</b> bordered by inclined walls <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. This defines a generally part circular recess which matches with a corresponding profile on the camming element <b>40</b>. Furthermore a flange region <b>130</b> is also provided to make sure that the camming element <b>40</b> cannot escape from inter-engagement with a rotating element <b>32</b> as it is trapped between the flange <b>130</b> and the base plate <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In each of these embodiments the bearings supporting the rotor shaft <b>30</b> and/or the splined engagement between the rotor shaft <b>30</b> and the rotating element <b>32</b> may allow for slight movement of the shaft <b>30</b> or rotating element <b>32</b> towards the abutment <b>44</b> such that motion of the camming element into the engaged position causes the shaft to move thereby bringing the rotating element <b>32</b> into frictional engagement with the abutment <b>44</b>. This gives rise to an additional braking force which further resists the rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is thus possible to provide a compact, simple and inexpensive disconnect mechanism which makes use of the shear region that is routinely provided in the drive train and which does not give rise to a significant increase in the axial length of the generator or the drive train.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In each of the above embodiments the camming member and/or the rotating member may be coated with a friction increasing material such as tungsten carbide or a coarse nickel composite.</p>
