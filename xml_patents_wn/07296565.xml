<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cooling apparatus of a cooking appliance, such as an oven, and more particularly, to a cooling apparatus of a cooking appliance for cooling electric components in a cabinet and a door.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The oven as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a cabinet <b>1</b> having an opened front surface, a cooking chamber <b>2</b> installed in the cabinet <b>1</b> and heated such that food therein is cooked, a door <b>7</b> installed on the opened front surface of the cabinet <b>1</b> for opening and closing the cooking chamber <b>2</b>, and an air blower <b>4</b> installed in an electric component chamber <b>3</b> located on the upper part of the cooking chamber <b>2</b> for cooling electric components in the cabinet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The cooking chamber <b>2</b> is heated by an electric heater or a burner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The air blower <b>4</b> serves to form a cooling channel due to a high temperature generated when the oven performs a cooking operation and an automatic cleaning operation using pyrolysis, and generally includes a fan <b>5</b> and a fan motor <b>6</b> for operating the fan <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fan <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is installed at the rear part of the electric component chamber <b>3</b>, and forcibly discharges air in the electric component chamber <b>3</b> toward the front part of the electric component chamber <b>3</b>, at which the door <b>7</b> is placed, thereby cooling the air in the electric component chamber <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The door <b>7</b> is directly heated by heat radiated and heat convected from the inside of the cooking chamber <b>2</b>, thus having a cooling structure. The cooling structure of the door <b>7</b> is configured such that a channel <b>9</b> for passing external air is formed between two glass plates <b>8</b> disposed in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above channel <b>9</b> of the door <b>7</b> is connected to a discharge channel <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the fan <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, when the air in the electric component chamber <b>3</b> is forcibly discharged by the fan <b>5</b>, the hot current of air in the door <b>7</b> is exhausted to the outside and cooled by the principle of sucking the air passing through the door <b>7</b> according to Bernoulli's Equation using a difference of velocities of an exhausted air flow.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, various cooking appliances, such as an oven and a microwave oven, use a pyrolysis system for increasing the temperature of the cooking chamber <b>2</b>, and cook foods in a state, in which the temperature of the cooking chamber <b>2</b> is more than 500° C., thereby requiring a cooling structure of the door <b>7</b> for coping with the above condition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, since the above-described conventional cooling structure of the cooking appliance is configured such that the air in the door <b>7</b> is sucked and discharged by means of a difference of velocities of the air discharged from the electric component chamber <b>3</b>, in case that the quantity of the air current for cooling the door <b>7</b> is small and the blowing force of the fan <b>5</b> is deteriorated due to long-term use, the air discharged from the electric component chamber <b>3</b> flows again into the channel <b>9</b> of the door <b>7</b>, thereby remarkably deteriorating the cooling capacity of the door <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Particularly, the above-described conventional cooling structure of the door is not suitable for cooking appliances, which perform an automatic cleaning operation using pyrolysis at a high temperature.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a cooling structure of a cooking appliance, which forms a suction channel for supplying a sufficient quantity of air to a door, thereby increasing cooling efficiency of the door and efficiently cooling an electric component chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a cooling apparatus of a cooking appliance comprising: a cabinet having a cooking chamber located therein and an electric component chamber located outside the cooking chamber; a door installed on the cabinet for opening and closing the cooking chamber, and having channels so as to cause external air to flow into the electric component chamber and a part of the air to flow into the electric component chamber via side surfaces of the cooking chamber; and an air blower installed in the electric component chamber for forcibly sucking the external air and discharging air having cooled the door and the electric component chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, suction vents connected to the channels may be formed through at least one surface of side surfaces and an upper surface of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, preferably, at least two channels may be formed at inside and outside portions of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, preferably, the channels of the door may be formed among a plurality of plates separated from each other by a designated interval.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the channels of the door may communicate with each other through circulation slits formed through the plates.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, preferably, the air may flow from the channel of the door located at the outside of the door to the channel of the door located at the inside of the door, or from the channel of the door located at the inside of the door to the channel of the door located at the outside of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, preferably, side vents for causing the air to flow into both side surfaces of the cooking chamber may be formed through the inner surface of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, top vents for discharging the air to the electric component chamber may be formed through the upper surface of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, preferably, the channel for sucking the air into the air blower and the channel for discharging the air from the air blower may be separated from each other. Moreover, preferably, a discharge duct for discharging the air may be connected to the air blower in front of the cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cooling apparatus of a cooking appliance comprising: a cabinet having a cooking chamber located therein and an electric component chamber located outside the cooking chamber; a door installed on the cabinet for opening and closing the cooking chamber, and having at least two suction channels formed among a plurality of plates so as to cause external air to flow into the electric component chamber; and an air blower installed in the electric component chamber for forcibly sucking the external air and discharging air having cooled the door and the electric component chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cooling apparatus of the cooking appliance of the present invention sucks external air through the door, and circulates the sucked air to the door and the inside of the electric component chamber so as to cool the door and the inside of the electric component chamber, thereby improving cooling efficiency of the door and the inside of the electric component chamber.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cooking appliance in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention comprises a cabinet <b>10</b> defining an external appearance, a cooking chamber <b>20</b> installed in the cabinet <b>10</b> such that food therein is cooked, a door <b>50</b> installed on the front surface of the cabinet <b>10</b> for opening and closing the cooking chamber <b>20</b>, and an air blower <b>40</b> for sucking external air into the cabinet <b>10</b> and then discharging the air to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The door <b>50</b> is rotatably installed on the front surface of the cabinet <b>10</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, door channels <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are respectively formed between a plate member <b>51</b> and a plate member <b>52</b> and between the plate member <b>52</b> and a plate member <b>53</b> in the door <b>50</b>, and external air flows into the cabinet <b>10</b> through the channels <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A discharge slit <b>16</b> for discharging air through the air blower <b>40</b> is formed between an upper surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the door <b>50</b> and a front plate <b>11</b> of the cabinet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An electric component chamber <b>15</b>, in which various electric components are installed, is located at the upper part of the cooking chamber <b>20</b>. Here, the cooking appliance is operated by the above electric components, and air flows in the cooking appliance. In this embodiment, the drawings illustrate only the air blower <b>40</b> out of the electric components.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cooking chamber <b>20</b> is placed in the cabinet <b>10</b> such that both side surfaces of the cooking chamber <b>20</b> are separated from the inner surface of the cabinet <b>10</b> by a designated interval through separation members <b>13</b>, and side channels <b>64</b> are formed so that air flows through the separation spaces between the cooking chamber <b>20</b> and the cabinet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The air blower <b>40</b> serves to suck external air into the cabinet <b>10</b> so that the door <b>50</b> and the electric component chamber <b>15</b> are cooled by the sucked air, and then to discharge the air to the outside, and includes a fan <b>42</b> for circulating the air, and a motor <b>44</b> for supplying driving power to the fan <b>42</b>. Preferably, the fan <b>42</b> is a cross flow fan, which is easily placed in the electric component chamber <b>15</b> and maximizes air suction dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A discharge duct <b>30</b> for discharging the air, having cooled the door <b>50</b> and the electric component chamber <b>15</b>, through the discharge slit <b>16</b> is connected to an outlet of the air blower <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Now, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the structure of the above-described door <b>50</b> will be described in detail. The door <b>50</b> includes the first, second, and third plates <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>53</b> for forming the door channels <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. The first, second, and third plates <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>53</b> are separated from each other by the designated interval.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A plurality of suction vents <b>70</b> for sucking air are formed through the edges of the door <b>50</b>, side vents <b>72</b> for discharging air to the side channels <b>64</b> are formed through both edges of the third plate <b>53</b>, and top vents <b>74</b> for causing air to flow into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> are formed through the upper surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the door <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The suction vents <b>70</b> communicate with the external channel <b>60</b> of the door <b>50</b> so that the air sucked through the suction vents <b>70</b> flows to the external channel <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A plurality of the side vents <b>72</b> are formed through the upper and lower portions of the edges of the third plate <b>53</b>, and serve to discharge the air discharged from the internal channel <b>62</b> of the door <b>50</b> to the side channels <b>64</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Circulation slits <b>76</b> for communicating the door channels <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> with each other are formed through the second plate <b>52</b>, and serve to circulate the air, sucked into the external channel <b>60</b> therethrough, into the internal channel <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Now, the functions and effects of the cooling apparatus of the cooking appliance in accordance with the above embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the cooking appliance, in a state in which air is sucked into the cooking appliance, in accordance with this embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of the cooking appliance, in a state in which air is discharged from the cooking appliance, in accordance with this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">First, the motor <b>44</b> installed in the electric component chamber <b>15</b> of the cabinet <b>10</b> is driven by current applied thereto, and then operates the fan <b>42</b>, thereby generating a suction force.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The suction force generated by the fan <b>42</b> sucks the air to the inside of the external channel <b>60</b> of the door <b>50</b> through the suction vents <b>70</b> of the door <b>50</b>. The air sucked into the external channel <b>60</b> flows toward the internal channel <b>62</b> of the door <b>50</b> by means of a difference of pressures due to the flow of the air generated from the air blower <b>40</b>, and the air flows toward the internal channel <b>62</b> through the circulation slits <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, the air flowing from the external channel <b>60</b> of the door <b>50</b> to the internal channel <b>62</b> of the door <b>50</b> eddies around the circulation slits <b>76</b>. The cooling time of the door <b>50</b> is lengthened by the eddy.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The air, having flown to the internal channel <b>62</b>, is discharged from the door <b>50</b> through the side vents <b>72</b> and the top vents <b>74</b>. The air discharged through the top vents <b>74</b> directly flows into the electric component chamber <b>15</b>, thereby cooling various electric components in the electric component chamber <b>15</b> and then being sucked into the fan <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The air discharged through the side vents <b>72</b> is discharged toward the side channels <b>64</b> formed between the cooking chamber <b>20</b> and the cabinet <b>10</b>, and the air discharged toward the side channels <b>64</b> flows into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> along the side channels <b>64</b>. Here, the air flowing into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> has a temperature lower than that of the air retained in the side channels <b>64</b>, thereby cooling the cooking chamber <b>20</b> and the cabinet <b>10</b>, and flowing into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> by means of the convection and the flow of the air generated from the fan <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The air flowing into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> is circulated into the electric component chamber <b>15</b> to cool the electric components, and is then sucked into the air blower <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The air sucked into the air blower <b>40</b> is discharged to the outside through the discharge duct <b>30</b> and the discharge slit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a partially exploded perspective view illustrating the structure of a door of a cooking appliance provided with a cooling apparatus in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the same manner as the above-described door <b>50</b> of the cooking appliance of the preceding embodiment, the door <b>80</b> of the cooking appliance of this embodiment forms internal and external channels <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> through first, second, and third plates <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, and <b>83</b>. However, the suction vents <b>70</b> communicate with the internal channel <b>84</b> of the door <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The air sucked through the suction vents <b>70</b> is circulated into the internal channel <b>84</b> of the door <b>80</b>, such that the third plate <b>83</b> is first cooled by the air, and the air is circulated into the external channel <b>85</b> through the circulation slits <b>76</b> formed through the second plate <b>82</b>. The air having passed through the external channel <b>85</b> is discharged from the door <b>80</b> through the top vents <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, when the air is sucked into the internal channel <b>84</b> of the door <b>80</b>, the external air having a low temperature first cools the third plate <b>83</b>, thereby maximally preventing the thermal deformation of the door <b>80</b>. The circulation slits <b>76</b> circulate the air from the internal channel <b>84</b> to the external channel <b>85</b>, and generate eddy of the air in the internal channel <b>84</b>, in the same manner as the preceding embodiment, during the circulation of the air. The second and third plates <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> are uniformly cooled by the eddy.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A part of the air sucked into the internal channel <b>84</b> is discharged from the door <b>80</b> through the side vents <b>72</b>, and the remainder of the air flows into the external channel <b>85</b> and is discharged through the top vents <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a cooling apparatus of a cooking appliance, which directly circulates external air toward a door and the inside of an electric component chamber, which are required to be cooled, thereby improving cooling efficiency of the door and the inside of the electric component chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Particularly, the cooling apparatus of the present invention achieves a sufficient cooling structure of the door for coping with the high temperature in a cooking chamber, thereby improving reliability of the cooking appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the cooling apparatus of the present invention prevents electric components in the electric component chamber from being damaged by heat or being thermally deformed, thereby improving safety of products and reliability of the cooking appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
