<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a disposable glucose strip sensor configured to rapidly and conveniently measure the concentration of glucose in blood and a glucose measurement method using the glucose strip sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The measurement of the concentration of glucose in blood is of great importance not only to diabetic patients who must control their sugar intake, but also for the early detection and diagnosis of diabetes. To this end, methods for simply and conveniently measuring the concentration of glucose in blood have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known glucose measurement methods are based on oxidation of glucose by glucose-oxidase and peroxidase. They also use orthotolidine or a benzidine-based mixture as an indicator reagent, that is, a chromogen. In accordance with these methods, a color transition of the indicator reagent resulting from the oxidation of glucose is observed to measure the concentration of glucose in blood.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, such techniques are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,061,523 and Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 50-39558. In these references, a glucose-measuring test piece is disclosed. In order to prepare this test piece, a solution is prepared which has a composition including: glucose oxidase and peroxidase as enzymes; a citric acid buffer to maintain a pH of 6.0; gelatin, alginic acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol as stabilizers; and orthotolidine, benzidine, 3-aminopropylcarbarsone, and 2,7-diaminofluorene as a chromogen. The solution is impregnated into a cellulose paper which has a desired thickness and size to be used as a carrier, and then dried. Thus, the test piece is obtained. Also, Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No. 85-1297 discloses a method for manufacturing a glucose-measuring test piece, to which the basic principle of an enzymatic measurement method using glucose oxidase and peroxidase is applied. Where the concentration of glucose in blood is measured using the above mentioned glucose-measuring test pieces, it is difficult to accurately measure a glucose concentration because the measurement is based on a color transition exhibited on the test piece.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above mentioned problem, various techniques have been proposed which measure glucose concentration using an electrochemical method. Such an electrochemical method makes it possible to measure the concentration of glucose in blood with an increased accuracy while reducing measurement time and achieving convenience in measurement. By virtue of such advantages, the use of the electrochemical glucose measurement method has been greatly increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Now, the operating principle of a glucose-measuring sensor based on an electrochemical method will be described. When a blood sample is applied to a reaction layer of the glucose-measuring sensor, glucose contained in the blood sample is oxidized by a glucose-oxidizing enzyme contained in the reaction layer. At this time, the glucose-oxidizing enzyme is reduced. The reduced glucose-oxidizing enzyme is then oxidized by an electron acceptor, whereby the electron acceptor is reduced. The reduced electron acceptor donates electrons at the surface of an electrode to which a desired voltage is applied. As a result, the electron acceptor is electrochemically reoxidized. The concentration of glucose in the blood sample is proportional to the amount of current generated during the process in which the electron acceptor is oxidized. Accordingly, the concentration of glucose can be measured by measuring the amount of current.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example of the above mentioned glucose-measuring sensor is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-294351. This sensor is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, operating and counter electrodes, which are made of carbon or the like, are formed on a substrate <b>111</b> in a screen printing fashion. An insulator <b>115</b> is also formed on the substrate <b>111</b> while allowing the electrodes to be partially exposed. A porous reaction layer <b>117</b>, which contains a reactive material such as a glucose-oxidizing enzyme and an electron acceptor, is arranged on the insulator <b>115</b>. In order to firmly hold the porous reaction layer <b>117</b>, a holding frame <b>116</b> and a cover <b>118</b> are arranged on the insulator <b>115</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numerals <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>114</b> denote the operating and counter electrodes, and reference numerals <b>112</b>′, <b>113</b>′, and <b>114</b>′ denote the exposed portions of the operating and counter electrodes. These electrodes and electrode portions form an electrode system. When a blood sample is dropped onto the porous reaction layer <b>117</b>, the glucose-measuring sensor having the above mentioned structure can measure the concentration of glucose in the blood sample.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this glucose-measuring sensor, however, the amount of blood absorbed in the reaction layer <b>117</b> varies depending on the amount of the blood sample dropped onto the reaction layer <b>117</b>. As a result, measurement errors may be caused by a variation in the amount of blood absorbed in the reaction layer <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve this problem, a biosensor has been proposed. An example of such a biosensor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,420 and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this biosensor includes a non-conductive substrate <b>211</b> made of polyethylene terephthalate. Silver is screen-printed on the non-conductive substrate <b>211</b> to form leads <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>. Conductive carbon paste containing a resin binder is printed on the leads <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>, thereby forming an operating electrode <b>214</b> and a counter electrode <b>215</b>. An insulator <b>216</b> is then printed to allow the electrodes <b>214</b> and <b>215</b> to be partially exposed. A 0.5% aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is spread onto the electrodes <b>214</b> and <b>215</b>, and dried to form a CMC layer. A solution of glucose oxidase (GOD) as the enzyme in a phosphate buffer solution is spread on the CMC layer, and dried to form a main reaction layer comprised of a CMC-GOD layer. Next, a resin plate <b>217</b> and a cover <b>219</b> are attached to the resulting structure while defining a space <b>218</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reference numeral <b>220</b> denotes a sample introducing port, and the reference numeral <b>221</b> denotes a discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the biosensor having the above mentioned structure, when a sample solution comes into contact with the sample introducing port <b>220</b>, it is introduced into the space <b>218</b> by virtue of capillary phenomenon, so that it fills the space <b>218</b>.

So, the measurement may be carried out even when an insufficient amount of sample solution is filled in the biosensor.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating a glucose strip sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of the glucose strip sensor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an assembled perspective view of the glucose strip sensor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the glucose strip sensor includes a non-conductive substrate <b>10</b>, a lead section <b>20</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b> by a silver ink or an ink mixture of silver and silver chloride, and an electrode section <b>30</b> formed on the lead section <b>20</b>. The lead section <b>20</b> includes leads <b>21</b> and lead terminals <b>22</b>, whereas the electrode section <b>30</b> includes an operating electrode <b>31</b>, a counter electrode <b>32</b>, and a checking electrode <b>33</b>. The glucose strip sensor also includes an insulating layer <b>40</b> coated on the lead and electrode sections <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> while allowing the lead and electrode sections <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> to be partially exposed, a reaction layer <b>50</b> formed on the exposed portion of the electrode section <b>30</b>, a resin plate <b>60</b> formed on the structure obtained after the formation of the reaction layer <b>50</b>, and a cover <b>70</b> formed on the resin plate <b>60</b>. The resin plate <b>60</b> defines a space <b>63</b>, a sample introducing port <b>61</b>, and discharge ports <b>62</b>. The sample introducing port <b>61</b> is arranged at the front surface of the glucose strip sensor, whereas the discharge ports <b>62</b> are arranged at opposite side surfaces of the glucose strip sensor, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The glucose strip sensor of the present invention is characterized in that it includes, in addition to the operating electrode <b>31</b> and counter electrode <b>32</b>, the checking electrode <b>33</b> for checking whether or not a sample is completely introduced in the sensor. The glucose strip sensor of the present invention is also characterized in that the sample introducing port <b>61</b> is arranged at the front surface of the glucose strip sensor, whereas the discharge ports <b>62</b> are arranged at opposite side surfaces of the glucose strip sensor, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Now, the fabrication of the glucose strip sensor having the above described structure will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First, the substrate <b>10</b> is prepared. For the substrate <b>10</b>, a polymer substrate may be used which is made of a non-conductive material such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride resin, or polycarbonate resin. The substrate <b>10</b> is preferably made of polyethylene terephthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The formation of the lead section <b>20</b> on the substrate <b>10</b> is then performed. As mentioned above, the lead section <b>20</b> includes the leads <b>21</b> and lead terminals <b>22</b>. The lead section <b>20</b> may be formed using a well-known screen printing method. In accordance with the present invention, the lead section <b>20</b> is formed by screen-printing a silver ink or an ink mixture of silver and silver chloride on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After formation of the lead section <b>20</b>, the electrode section <b>30</b> is formed on the lead section <b>20</b>. In accordance with the present invention, the electrode section <b>30</b> includes the checking electrode <b>33</b> in addition to the operating electrode <b>31</b> and counter electrode <b>32</b>. Although one checking electrode <b>33</b> is illustrated, the electrode section <b>30</b> may include two or more checking electrodes. Where the checking electrode <b>33</b> is arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is checked whether or not the checking electrode <b>33</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>32</b>. Based on the result of the checking, it is possible to determine whether or not the blood sample is sufficiently filled in the sensor. Accordingly, the glucose concentration in the blood sample can be accurately measured.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Under the condition in which the checking electrode <b>33</b><i>a </i>determines that a sufficient amount of blood sample is introduced in the sensor, the checking electrode <b>33</b> can perform the same function as the counter electrode <b>32</b> because the checking electrode <b>33</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>32</b>. In this case, an increased counter electrode area is obtained. By virtue of such an increased counter electrode area, it is possible to obtain a glucose measuring signal with an increased sensitivity when the amount of current flowing between the operating electrode and the counter electrode is measured. The operating electrode <b>31</b> and counter electrode <b>32</b>, which form the electrode section <b>30</b>, may be formed using a well-known method. The formation of the checking electrode <b>33</b> may also be achieved in the same manner as the formation of the counter electrode <b>32</b>. As mentioned above, the electrode section <b>30</b> is preferably formed in accordance with a screen printing method using a conductive carbon ink.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the upper surface of the resulting structure obtained after formation of the electrode section <b>30</b>, an insulating material is screen-printed to form the insulating layer <b>40</b> for insulating the lead section <b>20</b> while partially exposing the electrode section <b>30</b>. For the insulating material, a non-conductive screen printing ink or an insulating ink may be used. In accordance with the present invention, the insulating screen printing ink is preferably used. Thereafter, the formation of the reaction layer <b>50</b> is carried out in such a fashion that the reaction layer <b>50</b> covers the exposed portion of the electrode section <b>30</b>. The reaction layer <b>50</b> is made of a material including hydrogel and glucose oxidase (GOD) as major components thereof. In detail, the formation of the reaction layer <b>50</b> is achieved by preparing a solution obtained by respectively mixing hydrogel, GOD and a stabilizer in a liquid buffer at desired rates, dispensing the solution onto the surface of the electrode section <b>30</b>, and then drying the dispensed solution in an incubator.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the resulting structure obtained after formation of the reaction layer <b>50</b> including hydrogel and GOD as major components thereof, a resin plate <b>60</b> is arranged to define a space <b>63</b>. Also, the resin plate <b>60</b> defines the sample introducing port <b>61</b> at the front surface of the sensor and the discharge ports <b>62</b> at respective side surfaces of the sensor. Since the sample introducing port <b>61</b> and discharge ports <b>62</b> are formed at the front and side surfaces of the sensor, respectively, it is possible to conveniently handle the sensor, as compared to the conventional sensor including a discharge port formed at the upper surface of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cover <b>70</b> is finally arranged on the resin plate <b>60</b> using a well-known method. Thus, the fabrication of the glucose strip sensor according to the present invention is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the glucose strip sensor having the above mentioned structure includes the checking sensor <b>33</b>, it is possible to check whether or not the checking sensor <b>33</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>32</b>, thereby determining whether or not the sensor is filled with a sufficient amount of blood sample. Accordingly, there is an advantage in that the measured glucose concentration has an increased accuracy. In addition, where the amount of current flowing between the counter electrode <b>32</b> and the checking electrode <b>33</b> is measured under the condition in which those electrodes are electrically connected using conduction means, there is an advantage in that a glucose measuring signal with an increased sensitivity can be obtained. Since the sample introducing port <b>61</b> and discharge ports <b>62</b> are formed at the front and side surfaces of the sensor, respectively, it is also possible to conveniently handle the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the arrangement of the operating electrode <b>31</b>, counter electrode <b>32</b>, and checking electrode <b>33</b> is made in such a fashion that the counter electrode <b>32</b> and checking electrode <b>33</b> are arranged at front and rear sides of the operating electrode <b>31</b>, respectively. However, other arrangements may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the counter electrode <b>32</b> may be arranged near the sample introducing port <b>61</b>, and the checking electrode <b>33</b> may be arranged near one of the discharge ports <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this case, the checking electrode <b>33</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>32</b> under the condition in which the space <b>63</b> of the sensor is completely filled with a blood sample. Accordingly, it is possible to accurately check whether or not the space of the sensor is completely filled with a blood sample even when the space has an increased volume.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is also possible to arrange the checking electrode <b>33</b> near the sample introducing port <b>61</b> while arranging the counter electrode <b>32</b> in rear of the operating electrode <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Using the checking electrode having the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or <b>7</b>, it is possible to accurately determine whether or not a sufficient amount of blood sample is introduced in the sensor. Accordingly, measurement errors can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The operation of the glucose strip sensor having the above described structure according to the present invention will now be described in detail. When a blood sample comes into contact with the sample introducing port <b>61</b> of the sensor, it is introduced into the space <b>63</b> of the sensor by virtue of capillary phenomenon, so that it fills the space <b>63</b>. Simultaneously, air existing in the space <b>63</b> is vented from the space <b>63</b> through the discharge ports <b>62</b> respectively formed at opposite side surfaces of the sensor. Thereafter, it is checked, prior to a desired measurement of glucose concentration, whether or not a sufficient amount of blood sample is introduced in the space <b>63</b>. That is, it is checked whether or not an electrical connection is established between the counter electrode <b>32</b> and the checking electrode <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The blood sample filled in the space <b>63</b> of the sensor is impregnated into the reaction layer <b>50</b>. The glucose of the impregnated blood sample enzymatically reacts with the GOD contained in the reaction layer <b>50</b>, so that it is oxidized. Simultaneously, the GOD is reduced. The reduced GOD is then oxidized as it reacts with the electron acceptor contained in the reaction layer <b>50</b>, whereas the oxidized GOD reacts with the glucose not yet oxidized. The reduced electron acceptor migrates to the surface of the operating electrode <b>31</b>, to which voltage of about 0.6 V is applied, and donates electrons at that surface. Simultaneously, the electron acceptor is reoxidized so that it takes part again in the above reaction. The current generated during the oxidation of the electron acceptor is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood sample. Accordingly, the glucose concentration in the blood sample can be quantitatively derived by measuring the amount of current flowing between the operating electrode <b>31</b> and the counter electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An experiment was made in order to identify correlations established between the glucose concentration measured by the glucose strip sensor according to the present invention and the glucose concentration measured by an automatic glucose analyzer. The experiment was carried out as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, a blood sample was prepared by dissolving a desired amount of glucose in a buffer solution. Thereafter, the concentration of glucose in the blood sample was measured using an automatic glucose analyzer, which is the Model YSI 2300 STAT PLUS manufactured by YSI Inc. The signal intensity corresponding to the measured glucose concentration was then measured by the glucose strip sensor according to the present invention. The correlation between the measured glucose concentration and the measured signal intensity is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The measurement was repeated 6 times for each glucose concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the correlation between the measured glucose concentration and the measured signal intensity is well established in a clinically important glucose concentration range, that is, a glucose concentration range of 50 to 600 mg/dL.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a glucose strip sensor in which a checking electrode is additionally provided at an electrode section including an operating electrode and a counter electrode. The checking electrode serves to check whether or not it is electrically connected with the counter electrode, upon measuring the concentration of glucose in a blood sample introduced in the sensor. Based on the result of the checking, it is possible to determine whether or not a sufficient amount of blood sample is filled in the sensor. Accordingly, the measurement of glucose concentration can be accurately achieved. Moreover, where the amount of current flowing between the counter electrode and the checking electrode is measured under the condition in which those electrodes are electrically connected using conduction means, there is an advantage in that a glucose measuring signal with an increased sensitivity can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with the present invention, the glucose strip sensor also includes a sample introducing port arranged at the front surface of the sensor, and discharge ports arranged at respective side surfaces of the sensor. Accordingly, it is also possible to conveniently handle the sensor.</p>
