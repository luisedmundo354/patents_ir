<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to tree processing equipment and more specifically to tree processing equipment with two position pivot point for actuator ends.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tree processing heads have a limited rotation angle relative to a retention bracket. In mountainous terrains, the tree processing equipment is forced to operate at extreme angles of inclination. State of the art tree processing equipment is not designed to operate at extreme angles of inclination. As a result processing trees becomes difficult, if not impossible in certain geographic areas. U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,178 to Duval discloses a tree processor. The Duval patent includes a coupling and processing head. Two pairs of apertures are formed in the processing head. The coupler is mounted to either one of the two pairs of apertures with a shaft. One end of an actuator is mounted to the coupler and the other end is mounted to one of two different mounting brackets located on the processing head. However, the two positions of the coupler relative to the processing head do not increase a rotational angle of the processing head relative to the coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a clearly felt need in the art for tree processing equipment with two position pivot point for actuator ends, which allows the rotational angle of the processing head to be increased for mountainous terrains.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides tree processing equipment with two position pivot point for actuator ends for increasing the rotational angle of a processing head. The tree processing equipment with two position pivot point for actuator ends (improved tree processor) includes a retention bracket, a processing head and at least one actuator. A bottom of a rotator is attached to a top of the retention bracket. A top of the rotator is attached to an end of a forestry equipment boom. A bottom of the retention bracket is pivotally attached to the processing head. One end of the actuator is pivotally attached to the retention bracket and the other end is pivotally attached to the processing head.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first pivot hole and a second pivot hole are formed through the processing head. A pivot pin is inserted through an actuation end of the actuator and the first pivot hole for harvesting and processing in normal terrains or harvesting in mountainous terrains. The pivot pin is inserted through the actuation end of the actuator and the second pivot hole for increasing angular rotation of the processing head relative to the retention bracket for processing trees in mountainous terrains.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second embodiment of the improved tree processor, the first and second pivot holes are formed through the retention bracket and not the processing head. The pivot pin is removable from the actuation end of the actuator and the first or second pivot holes. The second pivot hole increases the angular rotation of the processing head relative to the retention bracket for processing trees in mountainous terrains.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved tree processor, which allows the rotational angle of the processing head to be increased relative to a retention bracket for mountainous terrains.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and additional objects, advantages, features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the following specification.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to the drawings, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a side view of an improved tree processor <b>1</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the improved tree processor <b>1</b> includes a retention bracket <b>10</b>, a processing head <b>12</b> and an actuator <b>14</b>. The retention bracket <b>10</b> includes a pair of bracket support plates <b>11</b>.

The rotator <b>16</b> is pivotally retained on an end of a forestry equipment boom (not shown) by inserting a pin through the end of the forestry equipment boom and a retention bore <b>18</b>. The rotator <b>16</b> allows the retention bracket <b>10</b> to be rotated relative to the forestry equipment boom.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A bottom of the pair of retention bracket support plates <b>11</b> are pivotally attached to the pair of pivot plates <b>15</b> of the processing head <b>12</b> by inserting two pins <b>20</b> through two retention bracket bores <b>22</b> and two head bores <b>24</b>. One end of the actuator <b>14</b> is pivotally attached to one of the bracket support plates <b>11</b> and an actuation end <b>32</b> of the actuator <b>14</b> is pivotally attached to the actuation plate <b>17</b> of the processing head <b>12</b>. However, the one end of the actuator <b>14</b> may also be pivotally attached to the actuation plate <b>17</b> and the actuation end <b>32</b> pivotally attached to one of the bracket support plates <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A first pivot hole <b>26</b> and a second pivot hole <b>28</b> are formed through the actuation plate <b>17</b>. Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a pivot pin <b>30</b> is inserted through the actuation end <b>32</b> of the actuator <b>14</b> and the first pivot hole <b>26</b> for harvesting trees and processing trees in normal terrains or harvesting trees in mountainous terrains. The pivot pin <b>30</b> preferably includes a head <b>31</b> formed on one end and a thread formed on the other end thereof. The pivot pin <b>30</b> is axially retained by threading a nut <b>33</b> on to the other end of the pivot pin <b>30</b>. However, other designs of pivot pins may also be used. Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the pivot pin <b>30</b> is inserted through the actuation end <b>32</b> of the actuator <b>14</b> and the second pivot hole <b>28</b> for processing trees in mountainous terrains. The pivot pin <b>30</b> is removable from the actuation end <b>32</b> and the first or second pivot holes. However, the pivot pin <b>30</b> may be inserted through the one end of the actuator <b>14</b> instead of the actuation end <b>32</b>.</p>
