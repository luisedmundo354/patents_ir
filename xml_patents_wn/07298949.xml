<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An SOI-based photonic bandgap (PBG) electro-optic device utilizes a patterned PBG structure to define a two-dimensional waveguide within an active waveguiding region of the SOI electro-optic device. The inclusion of the PBG columnar arrays within the SOI structure results in providing extremely tight lateral confinement of the optical mode within the waveguiding structure, thus significantly reducing the optical loss. By virtue of including the PBG structure, the associated electrical contacts may be placed in closer proximity to the active region without affecting the optical performance, thus increasing the switching speed of the electro-optic device. The overall device size, capacitance and resistance are also reduced as a consequence of using PBGs for lateral mode confinement.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to silicon-on-insulator (SOI)-based electro-optic devices and, more particularly, to the inclusion of photonic bandgap (PBG) structures within the SOI devices to provide for improved lateral confinement of a propagating optical signal, thus reducing optical loss and improving the speed of such SOI-based electro-optic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Photonic bandgap (PBG) structures, which represent the optical equivalent of the energy gap in semiconductors, promise a wealth of new, very compact, optical devices. PBG structures can confine light in very tight regions, allowing for the radiation to be guided or bent around sharp corners with virtually no energy loss. PBGs are expected to reduce the size of optical devices by orders of magnitude and allow for a larger scale of integration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Indeed, the concept of a PBG is analogous to the periodicity of the atoms or molecules of an ordinary crystal. The PBG comprises an artificial structure in which elements with different refractive indices are disposed in a periodic arrangement. Thus, for a certain range of wavelengths, there are no states for the photons to occupy in the structure. Photons with these wavelengths are thus defined as “forbidden” and cannot propagate. As opposed to opaque materials (such as metals), PBG structures are usually formed of a dielectric, so that no energy is absorbed by the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The presence of a defect in a PBG structure generally results in a “localized state”, that is, a tightly confined region of light energy that must stay within the defect, since it cannot propagate in the structure, and its energy cannot be absorbed by the structure. Therefore, if the defects are appropriately designed and arranged, they can be used to create waveguides with very small dimensions and excellent directional control and light confinement properties. Indeed, many optical devices—such as optical add/drop filters, multiplexers/demultiplexers, resonators, cavities, etc.—have now been realized using PBG structures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the emergence of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology for the fabrication of optical devices, two-dimensional PBG structures have been developed that may be realized by etching the desired hole pattern in the thin silicon surface layer (generally referred to as the “SOI layer”) so as to form the optical band structure. The photons with appropriate energy will pass through regions of high refractive index (e.g., silicon, or a polysilicon layer disposed over the silicon) interspersed with regions of low refractive index (e.g., the “hole” structures, where the holes are generally filled with commonly-used low index dielectric materials such as oxides or nitrides). To a photon, this contrast in refractive index looks just like the periodic potential that an electron experiences traveling through a silicon crystal. The large contrast in refractive index, as mentioned above, allows for the light to be confined in a very small region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The diameter and periodicity of the etched holes (subsequently filled with low dielectric material), together with the contrast in effective refractive index between the high index and low index regions, are the parameters that can be modified to produce the desired two-dimensional PBG structure. Indeed, to form a photonic bandgap, the etched holes need to be separated by a distance roughly equal to the photon wavelength divided by the refractive index. The width of the bandgap depends on the contrast in effective refractive index between the two materials in the lattice—with a larger contrast yielding a wider bandgap.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As mentioned above, extremely tight confinement within the waveguide region of a PBG structure makes it possible to bend the light around sharp corners with low energy loss, enabling the formation of very small optical circuits. For example, state-of-the-art silicon-based strip or rib single mode waveguides can be achieved with dimensions on the order of 0.34 μm. However, a significant portion of the energy will reside in the “tail” outside of the core and into the cladding. By virtue of using a PBG structure, little if any energy will be outside of the waveguide boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Active electro-optic devices including PBGs are currently being fabricated by filling the holes in the structure with a polymer or liquid crystal, then using an applied external signal to re-arrange the periodicity of the material to affect the change in wavelength. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are also being explored to provide the desired active control. However, both of these arrangements exhibit a relatively slow speed of operation (not acceptable for multiple Gb/s applications), and do not readily lend themselves to high volume manufacture. Other arrangements, to date, require the formation of a resonant cavity within the guiding structure and are therefore extremely wavelength-selective.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, a need remains in the art for a tunable PBG structure that exhibits the requisite speed and manufacturability demands for future, high speed opto-electronic applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The need remaining in the prior art is addressed by the present invention, which relates to silicon-on-insulator (SOI)-based electro-optic devices and, more particularly, to the inclusion of photonic bandgap (PBG) structures within the SOI devices to provide for improved lateral confinement of a propagating optical signal, thus reducing optical loss and improving the speed of such SOI-based electro-optic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with the present invention, incorporation of the PBG structure with SOI-based devices allows for the propagating optical mode to be extremely well-confined in the lateral dimension, thus minimizing optical loss for a signal propagating along the SOI waveguide. The use of the PBG structure also allows for the electrical contacts to be placed relatively close to the waveguiding region (as a result of the improved confinement) and thus improve the operating speed of the electro-optic device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An advantage of the incorporation of the PBG structure in the SOI-based electro-optic devices in accordance with the present invention is that the overall device size may be reduced (in comparison to prior art SOI-based devices), thus reducing the overall system capacitance and resistance—further improving the speed and responsivity of the electro-optic device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, a polysilicon layer is added to the based SOI structure and is disposed over the SOI layer, with the PBG structure formed through the combination of layers (or only one or the other of the layers). A relatively thin gate dielectric layer is positioned between the SOI layer and the polysilicon layer, where the SOI and polysilicon layers are complementarily doped to create an active region of a Semiconductor-Insulator-Semiconductor CAPacitor (SISCAP) device that is tunable across the gate dielectric through the application of an electrical modeling signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is an advantage of the PBG structures of the present invention that conventional CMOS processing techniques may be used to form the PBG structures and, importantly, integrate these structures within the same silicon substrate as the associated electronic and optical components, creating a monolithic opto-electronic subsystem.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other and further advantages and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent during the course of the following discussion and by reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, the utilization of a PBG structure within an SOI-based electro-optic device results in providing relatively tight confinement of the propagating optical mode within the defined waveguide region, as opposed to prior structures where a significant amount of the optical power would reside in the evanescent tails in the cladding regions surrounding a silicon strip or rib waveguide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>) illustrate this aspect of an exemplary PBG structure, where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a prior art SOI structure comprising a silicon substrate <b>10</b>, an insulating layer <b>12</b> and an SOI layer <b>14</b>. The boundary of an optical mode <b>15</b> for a signal propagating along a strip waveguide <b>16</b> formed in SOI layer <b>14</b> is also shown. It is obvious from this depiction that a significant portion of the energy within optical mode <b>15</b> resides in the evanescent tails within insulating layer <b>12</b>, as well as in the other low index materials (not shown) that surround strip waveguide <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates the improvement in light confinement within a strip waveguide by virtue of using a PBG structure to define the waveguide boundaries. As shown, the PBG waveguide structure is formed on the same silicon substrate <b>10</b> and insulating layer <b>12</b> as discussed above in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). In this case, SOI layer <b>14</b> is further processed to include a regular lattice structure of holes through the thickness thereof, the lattice structure thus forming the PBG arrangement. A first plurality of holes <b>18</b> is formed within one side of SOI layer <b>14</b> in a regular structure and a second plurality of holes <b>20</b> is formed on the other side, with a central portion <b>22</b> of SOI layer <b>14</b> remaining unprocessed. Thus, central portion <b>22</b> will define the waveguide structure, as bounded by PBG structures <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. As shown, the presence of PBG structures <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> results in confining the optical mode <b>23</b> in a manner such that lateral tailing of the mode along SOI layer <b>14</b> is minimized. It is to be understood that the illustrated mode profiles in these and the following figures are exemplary only and for the purposes of discussion. The specific mode profiles for an actual device would depend upon a variety of factors, such as the refractive indexes of the materials, thickness of the layers, hole pattern of the PBG structures, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Active control of an SOI-based PBG structure in accordance with the present invention, is achieved by introducing free carriers (N) into the silicon waveguide region (such as central portion <b>22</b> of SOI layer <b>14</b>) of the PBG structure to alter the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant (∈) at a frequency ω, based on the free carrier effect as defined by the following equation:</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It has been discovered during the course of developing this invention that a key to achieving a high degree of optical modulation in a very small length of a PBG waveguide (the small length a necessity to minimize waveguide transmission losses, as well as to achieve a higher level of integration), is to optimize the overlap of a high optical intensity region with a region of maximum change in refractive index. Additionally, as will be discussed further below, the speed of the device (in instances where modulation or switching is required) can be improved by placing the required electrodes as close to the optical modulation region as possible. A competing concern, however, remains the optical loss associated with the electrodes (the complete contact structure including highly-doped silicon regions, silicides and metals). Fortunately, the tight lateral confinement of the propagating mode associated with the inventive PBG structure allows for the electrodes to be placed in relatively close proximity to the waveguide, without a significant portion of the optical energy being captured within the contact region. Thus, optical losses are kept relatively low, while the device speed can be maintained in the Gb/s range.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An SOI structure further comprising a polysilicon layer disposed over the surface SOI layer has been used in many arrangements to provide a variety of configurations for optical mode confinement. Silicon-Insulator-Silicon CAPacitor (SISCAP) structures are able to form a variety of modulating electro-optic devices utilizing free carrier-based phase modulation. Indeed, embodiments of the present invention may be created by using a SISCAP design that is compatible with the layer thicknesses of various SOI CMOS processes currently in use. As described in detail in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,198, SISCAP devices provide for reduced optical insertion loss by using an inherent effective index contrast between the waveguide and surrounding cladding areas. Moreover, the SISCAP arrangement enables very high speed modulation in silicon by using small device geometries, allowing the RC time constants to be consistent with the required data rate (for example, 1 Gb/s and above, approaching at least 10 Gb/s). For the purposes of the present invention, amorphous silicon (which exhibits similar optical mode confinement properties as polysilicon) can be used interchangeably with polysilicon so as to form inventive SISCAP structures. In general, any appropriate silicon material, such as polysilicon, amorphous silicon, strained-layer silicon, grain-size-enhanced silicon, grain-boundary-passivated silicon, grain-aligned silicon, Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>1-x</sub>, substantially single crystal silicon, single crystal silicon, or any combination may be used to form this device layer, taking into consideration both the optical properties (associated with grain size, optical absorption) of the various forms of silicon as well as the electrical properties (mobility, conductivity, etc.), in order to optimize these properties to minimize optical loss in the selected material while providing a relatively low electrical resistance. For the sake of the simplicity, the remainder of this discussion will be directed to the use of polysilicon layers, with the understanding that the same concepts may be applied to any of the above-referenced types of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Polysilicon-loaded PBG waveguides can be formed by etching both the polysilicon layer and the underlying SOI layer in a self-aligned manner, preferably forming the columnar holes in a single photolithography/etching step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary SOI-based PBG waveguide structure, where a polysilicon layer <b>30</b> has been formed over SOI layer <b>14</b>, with a relatively thin dielectric insulating layer <b>32</b> (often referred to hereinafter as the “gate dielectric”) separating polysilicon layer <b>30</b> from SOI layer <b>14</b>. A first plurality of columnar holes <b>34</b> and a second plurality of columnar holes <b>36</b> are illustrated as etched completely through the thicknesses of polysilicon layer <b>30</b>, dielectric layer <b>32</b> and SOI layer <b>14</b>, so as to form a waveguiding region <b>38</b> within the combined areas of SOI layer <b>14</b>, dielectric <b>32</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b>, and bounded in the lateral dimension by PBG structures <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. A conventional CMOS fabrication technique using a self-aligned multi-layer etching process including a single photomask may be used to form the desired PBG structures <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. In contrast, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, only polysilicon layer <b>30</b> may be etched (using insulating layer <b>32</b> as an “etch stop”), with a first plurality of columnar holes <b>40</b> and a second plurality of columnar holes <b>42</b> etched through only the thickness of polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. This particular structure results in a different optical mode confinement boundary <b>43</b> with respect to waveguiding region <b>44</b>, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another variation, the PBG structure may be etched into SOI layer <b>14</b> before gate dielectric <b>32</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b> are deposited. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates this particular arrangement, with PBG structures <b>41</b> and <b>45</b> formed in SOI layer <b>14</b>. The optical mode confinement <b>47</b> within waveguiding region <b>49</b> is shown to be well-confined within SOI layer <b>14</b>, and begin to tail somewhat out of waveguiding region <b>49</b> within polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. In forming this exemplary structure, the pluralities of columnar holes <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> are first etched in SOI layer <b>14</b> and then filled with an oxide or other appropriate dielectric material. A planarization process (such as, for example, chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP)) is then used to restore a sufficiently planar surface on the SOI structure. Gate dielectric layer <b>32</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b> are then sequentially deposited over the re-planarized surface.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with the present invention, the advantages of PBG-defined waveguide boundaries have been provided with active SOI-based electro-optic devices in order to provide for a number of improvements in the SOI structure. In particular, the use of the PBG structure allows for very tight lateral confinement of the optical mode within a waveguide of very small cross section. The smaller volume of the waveguide, in turn, allows for relatively low bias voltages (when compared to the prior art) to be sufficient for inducing modulating charge density in the device active region. Moreover, the tight optical confinement significantly reduces optical loss within the device structure and permits the electrodes to be placed relatively close to the waveguide. Further, the doping profiles of the SOI-based PBG device can be optimized using conventional lithography/ion implantation techniques to further reduce optical losses in the active region and minimize exposure of the charge carriers to the silicon/oxide interfaces. At a higher level, the ability to significantly reduce the size of the overall device results in a reduction of the capacitance/resistance inherent in the various components within the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In its most basic form, an SOI-based PBG PN junction device may be formed that exhibits significant advantages over conventional silicon waveguide devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a conventional, prior art silicon PN junction rib waveguide device, with SOI-based PBG PN junction devices being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the PN structure comprises a p-doped SOI layer <b>14</b> and an n-doped layer <b>13</b> formed over a portion of SOI layer <b>14</b>, where the sidewalls of n-doped rib <b>13</b> define the optical mode boundaries in the lateral dimension. A first electrical contact <b>31</b> is disposed to contact an end portion of p-doped SOI layer <b>14</b> and a second electrical contact <b>33</b> disposed to contact a portion of n-doped layer <b>13</b>. The application of an electrical signal between contacts <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> results in an optical signal being created by carrier transfer in the lateral dimension, with significant spreading of the optical mode, as shown. In as much as the electrical contacts overlap the optical signal path, the resultant structure is very lossy and the optimization of loss vs. speed is difficult to manipulate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An improvement in this SOI-based PN structure is provided, in accordance with the present invention, by the inclusion of PBG photonic crystal structures, in the form of lattice-disposed columnar holes, that are etched through the thickness of SOI layer <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates an exemplary embodiment of this improved structure, with a first set of columnar holes <b>51</b> etched through a p-doped region <b>14</b>-P of SOI layer <b>14</b> and a second set of columnar holes <b>53</b> etched through an n-doped region <b>14</b>-N of SOI layer <b>14</b>. As shown, the improvement in mode confinement within the waveguiding region of SOI layer <b>14</b> is significant. Indeed, the vertical PN device structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) may exhibit the various other advantages of the present invention as discussed above, in terms of electrode placement and ability to utilize a smaller overall device structure than was possible with the prior art arrangements. An alternative embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), where a lateral PN structure is formed with the P region disposed over the N region (or vice versa) within the waveguiding region.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned above, an electro-optic SOI-based PBG device formed in accordance with the present invention may include a polysilicon layer (or other suitable type of silicon) that is utilized as an active semiconductor device layer, with the free carrier mobility and dopant conductivity within the polysilicon layer being optimized to provide a fast response, while also providing low absorption of the optical signal to achieve the desired optical modulation properties. In particular, it is desirable to have a maximum overlap between the optical field in the waveguide and the modulating free carrier concentration. This particular characteristic of active SOI devices is thoroughly described in our U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,198 issued Jan. 18, 2005 and herein incorporated by reference. In general, and as described in our '198 patent, optimized overlap of optical field and modulating free carriers is achieved by selecting similar effective optical thicknesses for the SOI layer and the polysilicon layer, as centered around the relatively thin dielectric layer. In this case, the free carrier densities in both layers are actively modulated in the vicinity of the gate dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary SOI-based PBG electro-optic device <b>50</b> formed in accordance with the present invention, based on this overlap of optical field and modulating free carriers. The structure of device <b>50</b> is based upon that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, using a silicon substrate <b>10</b>, insulating layer <b>12</b> and SOI layer <b>14</b> to define the basic SOI structure. Polysilicon layer <b>30</b> is disposed over SOI layer <b>14</b>, with relatively thin gate dielectric layer <b>32</b> disposed between SOI layer <b>14</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. SOI layer <b>14</b> may comprise single crystal silicon, or strained silicon, and is appropriately doped (with respect to polysilicon layer <b>30</b>) so that an active device region is formed upon the application of an electrical signal. Polysilicon layer <b>30</b> (which is also appropriately doped) may comprise one of the various forms of silicon as defined hereinabove. The PBG structure comprises first plurality of columnar holes <b>34</b> etched through the combination of polysilicon layer <b>30</b>, gate dielectric <b>32</b> and SOI layer <b>14</b>. Second plurality of holes <b>36</b> is similarly formed, with waveguide region <b>38</b> disposed therebetween. As is well-known in the art, first and second pluralities of holes <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may be “filled”<b>0</b> with a relatively low index material (such as an oxide or nitride). In order to provide active operation of the structure, a first set of electrodes <b>52</b> is coupled to SOI layer <b>14</b> and a second set of electrodes <b>54</b> is coupled to polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. The application of a bias between electrodes <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> results in the formation of a modulated charge carrier concentration region <b>56</b> in both polysilicon layer <b>30</b> and SOI layer <b>14</b> in the vicinity of gate dielectric <b>32</b>. The overlap between the optical mode and the modulating free carriers thus occurs within waveguide <b>38</b>, in proximity to gate dielectric <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Accordingly, as the applied electrical signal is modulated, the optical signal within waveguide <b>38</b> will similarly be modulated. Advantageously, the use of a PBG structure allows for tight confinement of the optical mode within the waveguide, such that relatively little of the signal is lost to the surrounding “cladding” structure (the cladding structure being defined as the PBG regions surrounding waveguide <b>38</b>). Moreover, the PBG structure allows for contacts <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> to be disposed in relatively close proximity to waveguide <b>38</b>, thus providing the ability for gigabit-speed operation in terms of switching the charge carrier density between polysilicon layer <b>30</b> and SOI layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> contains a top view of an exemplary arrangement of the tunable device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where in this embodiment distributed sets of electrodes <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> are utilized to reduce the resistance between the contacts and the modulating regions and further improve the switching speed of the active SOI-based PBG device. In this view, it is shown that polysilicon layer <b>30</b> has been patterned to include tab regions <b>58</b> where electrodes <b>42</b> may be disposed. Advantageously, the utilization of the PBG structure (illustrated in this top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as first photonic crystal array <b>34</b> and second photonic crystal array <b>36</b>) provides for relatively tight optical mode confinement (as mentioned above), allowing for the electrodes to be in relatively close proximity to waveguide region <b>38</b> without capturing a significant portion of the optical energy. While the dotted-line boundary of polysilicon layer <b>30</b> is shown in this view as essentially rectangular, it is to be understood that the polysilicon layer may be formed to include “tapered” input and/or output areas (as discussed in our '198 patent) in order to minimize reflections as the optical signal transitions between SOI layer <b>14</b> and the SOI layer <b>14</b>/polysilicon layer <b>30</b> combination.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various other modulating arrangements may be formed using the SOI-based based PBG structure as discussed above, where our above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,198 discloses many of these arrangements, including various doping alternatives (doping of both SOI layer <b>14</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b>) and various overlapping constructs. All of these variations are considered to be applicable to the PBG structure formed in accordance with the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates one exemplary overlap variation, in this case with the “overlap” between SOI layer <b>14</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b> defined by terminating edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> of SOI layer <b>14</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b>, respectively. The overlap thus defines a region <b>64</b> of modulated charge carrier concentration, with the optical mode well-confined within waveguide <b>38</b>. In this case, electrical contacts to SOI layer <b>14</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b> are formed as shown, with a first electrical contact <b>66</b> disposed over a portion of SOI layer <b>14</b> removed from waveguide region <b>38</b>, and a second electrical contact <b>68</b> disposed over a portion of polysilicon layer <b>30</b> also removed from waveguide region <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In terms of doping variations, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may utilize a p-doped polysilicon layer <b>30</b> and an n-doped SOI layer <b>14</b> (or vice versa), so as to form a capacitive structure. Layered, or graded dopant profiles may be employed as desired. Moreover, the lateral doping concentration may be graded, as particularly described in our above-referenced patent, to create regions of higher dopant concentration in the electrical contact areas. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if polysilicon layer <b>30</b> is p-doped, a p+-doped region <b>70</b> may be formed in the area of contact <b>68</b>, with a silicides layer <b>72</b> formed on the surface of polysilicon layer <b>30</b> to form the actual electrical connection. A similarly-formed n+ region <b>74</b> and silicide connection <b>76</b> may be used for contact to an n-type SOI layer <b>14</b>. In this case, the silicides contacts <b>72</b>, <b>76</b> and highly doped regions <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> are desired to be located away from the light confinement region so as to minimize optical losses through absorption. A competing desire, however, is to keep the contacts as close to optical waveguide <b>38</b> as possible in order to maximize the speed of modulation as the applied electrical signal is modulated. By virtue of utilizing the PBG light confinement arrangement in accordance with the present invention, the contacts may be located considerably closer to the optical confinement region than previously considered reasonably with a conventional SOI structure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> contains a side view of another SOI-based PBG electro-optic device of the present invention, where an isometric view is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this particular device structure, a first PBG array <b>90</b> is formed within SOI layer <b>14</b> to define a first lateral confinement portion for the optical signal propagating within a defined waveguide region <b>92</b>. Subsequent to the formation of first PBG array <b>90</b>, a dielectric material <b>94</b> is deposited to re-planarize the structure. Gate dielectric <b>32</b> and polysilicon layer <b>30</b> are then formed, as before, and a second PBG array <b>96</b> is formed as shown through polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. Thus, the combination of first and second PBG arrays <b>90</b> and <b>96</b> provide the desired lateral confinement of the optical mode within waveguide <b>92</b>. A first electrical contact <b>97</b> is positioned over SOI layer <b>14</b> and a second electrical contact <b>98</b> is positioned over polysilicon layer <b>30</b>. In this particular embodiment of the present invention, gate dielectric layer <b>32</b> has been processed such that only the portion within the active waveguiding region <b>92</b> remains, so as to form the necessary SISCAP structure. The elimination of the unnecessary gate dielectric allows for capacitance of the device to be significantly reduced, thus increasing its speed of operation. As shown, electrical contacts <b>97</b> and <b>98</b> can be positioned in relative close proximity to waveguiding region <b>92</b> (compare with the placement of electrical contacts <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
