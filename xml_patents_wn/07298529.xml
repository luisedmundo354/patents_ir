<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Document scanners convert a visible image on a media object, such as and not by way of limitation, a document, photograph or a transparent media, into an electronic form suitable for copying, storing and processing by a computer. A document scanner may be a stand-alone device or integrated with a copier, a facsimile machine, a digital sender, or a multifunction device. Documents, or media objects, to be scanned may generally be classified as either transparent or opaque.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For scanning opaque media, light is reflected off an image on the surface of the document onto a photosensitive device by a process referred to as a reflective scan. The photosensitive device converts received light intensity into one or more electric signals. Transparent media are scanned by passing light therethrough, rather than reflecting the light off, the media. The transmitted light is received by an optics system and directed onto the photosensitive device. Transparent media may include either positive or negative images.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Document scanning systems operable to scan both transparent and opaque documents are available. Some conventional scanners include a separate light source to backlight the image on the transparent media.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional scanner systems, the light projected onto the transparent media is only focused on a center section of the photosensitive device. Distal sections on both sides of the center section are typically unused for the most common transparent media object sizes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, a technique and apparatus for imaging two distinct areas of a transparent media and directing light from one of the two distinct scanned areas onto a distal region of the photosensitive device has not been provided. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method of imaging a transparent media object comprising passing light through a first scan line of the transparent media object and focusing the light passed through the first scan line onto a first region of a photosensitive device is provided. Light is passed through a second scan line of the transparent media object substantially concurrently with passage of the light passed through the first scan line and focused onto a second region of the photosensitive device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a scanner system for imaging a transparent media object comprising an illumination source for concurrently illuminating a first and second scan line of a media object, a carriage comprising a photosensitive device located within the carriage, and a light pipe affixed to a surface of the carriage is provided. The carriage is configured to receive, on a first region of the photosensitive device, light passed through the first scan line, and the light pipe is adapted to redirect light passing through the second scan line onto a second region of the photosensitive device. The photosensitive device is operable to sample light directed onto the first and second regions.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a scanner system <b>50</b> is coupled to a computer <b>10</b> and operable to scan images on both opaque and transparent media and in which an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented advantageously. Scanner system <b>50</b> comprises reflective scanner <b>100</b> which comprises a transparent platen <b>110</b> against which the document to be scanned is placed. Scanner <b>100</b> generally comprises a cover (not shown) or similar device that is placed over an opaque document prior to performing a reflective scan.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A transparent media adapter <b>120</b> may be used in conjunction with reflective scanner <b>100</b> to enable reflective scanner <b>100</b> to scan images on a transparent media object <b>170</b> such as a photographic negative or slide. A template <b>150</b> may be used to properly position transparent media object <b>170</b> against platen <b>110</b>. Template <b>150</b> may be dimensioned such that it fits securely within recessed edges <b>115</b> of reflective scanner <b>100</b> around platen <b>110</b>. Template <b>150</b> may include one or more insert areas <b>160</b> for accommodating one or more transparent media objects <b>170</b> therein. Template <b>150</b> may include one or more alignment elements <b>155</b>A-<b>155</b>D, such as recessions, ridges or apertures, that are engaged with positioning elements <b>125</b>A-<b>125</b>C on adapter <b>120</b> to facilitate proper alignment and positioning of adapter <b>120</b> on template <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to scan transparent media object <b>170</b>, template <b>150</b> is securely placed on platen <b>110</b> and transparent media object <b>170</b> is placed in insert area <b>160</b> of template <b>150</b>. Transparent media adapter <b>120</b>, positioned over template <b>150</b>, produces a backlight that illuminates transparent media object <b>170</b> when the scanning operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Computer <b>10</b> may be coupled to, and facilitate control of, scanner system <b>50</b> by a cable <b>15</b> via an external peripheral interface such as a parallel interface, a universal serial bus interface or other communications medium. Computer <b>10</b> typically includes one or more input devices, such as a keyboard <b>30</b> and a mouse <b>40</b>, that enable user interaction therewith and facilitate user control of scanner system <b>50</b>. One or more output devices, such as a monitor <b>20</b>, a printer (not shown), or another device, may provide visual feedback for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross-sectional side view of reflective scanner <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in a configuration for scanning an image on a transparent media. Scanner <b>100</b> comprises an internal lamp <b>215</b> that is attached to a carriage <b>219</b> operable to impart a linear motion of the lamp along a rail <b>217</b> or other carriage guide structure. An optic device <b>218</b> may also be located within carriage <b>219</b> as well as a photosensitive device <b>221</b> which may comprise an array of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or other photosensitive elements operable to perform optical-to-electrical conversion on incident light. A typical photosensitive device comprises hundred or thousands of individual photosensitive elements. Each photosensitive element is operable to generate a data set, e.g., a 16-bit, 20-bit, or another sample size, that numerically defines the light intensity incident on the respective photosensitive element. Carriage <b>219</b> may comprise a housing having a slot <b>223</b> that provides a light path through which light passes prior to being directed onto a surface of photosensitive device <b>221</b> by optic device <b>218</b>. Generally, carriage <b>219</b> has a home position (X=0) from which scan operations are initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Template <b>150</b> is properly positioned on platen <b>110</b> of scanner <b>100</b>. Transparent media object <b>170</b> is secured within insert area <b>160</b> of template <b>150</b> and transparent media adapter <b>120</b> is placed on template <b>150</b>. Transparent media adapter <b>120</b> preferably comprises an active illumination source, such as a lamp <b>240</b>, for backlighting media object <b>170</b>. Alternatively, a passive transparent media adapter without a backlight source may be used. Adapter <b>120</b> may include a translucent panel <b>235</b> for enabling light radiating from lamp <b>240</b> to pass through a bottom surface of adapter <b>120</b>. Preferably, transparent media adapter <b>120</b> is detachably coupled to scanner <b>100</b> via one or more cables <b>255</b>. Cable <b>255</b> may provide power for the lamp <b>240</b> and/or other electronic components of the adapter as well as a communication channel between adapter <b>120</b> and scanner <b>100</b>. It is preferable that lamp <b>215</b> of carriage <b>219</b> is deactivated and adapter lamp <b>240</b> of transparent media adapter <b>120</b> is activated when scanning images on a transparent media. Light radiating from adapter lamp <b>240</b> will pass through translucent panel <b>235</b>, through transparent media object <b>170</b> and through platen <b>110</b> whereupon it is passed through optic device <b>218</b> and focused onto photosensitive device <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> are respectively a top schematic, a side-sectional schematic, and a front-sectional schematic of carriage <b>219</b> implemented according to an embodiment of the present invention. Slot <b>223</b> extends along a carriage top surface <b>219</b>A substantially parallel with a transverse axis <b>230</b> of carriage <b>219</b>. An anterior-posterior axis <b>231</b> of carriage <b>219</b> is generally aligned along a scan direction defined by the carriage translation direction (X). A light pipe comprising light pipe elements <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B (collectively referred to as light pipe <b>270</b>) is disposed on a top surface <b>219</b>A of carriage <b>219</b>. In the particular arrangement illustrated, light pipe element <b>270</b>A is located longitudinally forward of the light pipe element <b>270</b>B and light pipe element <b>270</b>B is located laterally from light pipe element <b>270</b>A although other configurations of light pipe elements <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B are possible. Notably, light pipe element <b>270</b>A is located longitudinally forward slot <b>223</b> by a distance d.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a primary scan line is sampled by passing light <b>305</b>A through a first scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>(also referred to herein as a primary scan line) of media object <b>170</b>. The light <b>305</b>A passes directly into slot <b>223</b> and onto optic device <b>218</b> after passage through scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>and is thereafter focused onto medial region <b>221</b>A of photosensitive device <b>221</b>. Medial region <b>221</b>A comprises a plurality of photosensitive elements that respectively perform optical-to-electrical conversion on the incident light. Each of the photosensitive elements of medial region <b>221</b>A generates a respective sample <b>331</b>A-<b>331</b>N of a data set <b>331</b> that numerically defines light <b>305</b>A (and thus scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1</sub>). A secondary scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>is sampled by passing light <b>305</b>B through scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>(located a distance d from the primary scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1</sub>) and into incidence with light pipe element <b>270</b>A concurrently with sampling of primary scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1</sub>. Light pipe element <b>270</b>A redirects light <b>305</b>B to element <b>270</b>B that, in turn, directs light <b>305</b>B into slot <b>223</b>. Optic device <b>218</b> focuses the redirected light from secondary scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>(that is, light <b>305</b>B) onto distal region <b>221</b>B of photosensitive device <b>221</b>. Distal region <b>221</b>B comprises a plurality of photosensitive elements that respectively perform optical-to-electrical conversion on the incident light <b>305</b>B. Each of the photosensitive elements of distal region <b>221</b>B generates a respective sample <b>332</b>A-<b>332</b>M of a data set <b>332</b> that numerically defines light <b>305</b>B (and thus scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1</sub>)</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As most clearly shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, light <b>305</b>B is directed substantially orthogonal with top surface <b>219</b>A of carriage <b>219</b>. Upon incidence with light pipe element <b>270</b>A, light <b>305</b>B is redirected substantially parallel with top surface <b>219</b>A until incident with light pipe element <b>270</b>B. Light pipe element <b>270</b>B is adapted to redirect light <b>305</b>B into slot <b>223</b> for incidence with optic device <b>218</b>. As most clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the redirected light <b>305</b>B is focused onto distal region <b>221</b>B of photosensitive device <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, light pipe <b>270</b> is detachably affixed to carriage top surface <b>219</b>A although the light pipe may be permanently mounted thereto. In one embodiment, the light pipe comprises two elements <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B. In the illustrative embodiment, first light pipe element <b>270</b>A is located on top surface <b>219</b>A near a carriage anterior surface <b>219</b>B. In general terms, light pipe element <b>270</b>A is disposed in a forward position on carriage <b>219</b> with respect to slot <b>223</b>. Light pipe <b>270</b> may comprise a reflective apparatus, such as a configuration of mirrors, operable to capture light and redirect the captured light onto at least one of photosensitive device distal regions <b>221</b>B and <b>221</b>C. Other implementations of light pipe <b>270</b> are possible. For example, light pipe <b>270</b> may be implemented as an injection molded plastic structure(s), a configuration of prisms comprising optical grade glass, or another suitable device for capturing light directed thereon and redirecting the light to impinge on photosensitive device distal regions <b>221</b>B and/or <b>221</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the illustrative example, light pipe element <b>270</b>A is adapted to receive light directed thereon and redirect the received light at an offset (α) from a plane of the anterior surface <b>219</b>B of carriage <b>219</b> such that the light redirected from light pipe element <b>270</b>A impinges second light pipe element <b>270</b>B. It should be noted that light pipe elements <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B may be of common or different lengths L<sub>PA </sub>and L<sub>PB</sub>, respectively. In the case that light pipe elements <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B are of equal lengths, all light redirected from light pipe element <b>270</b>A to light pipe element <b>270</b>B will be redirected at a substantially equivalent offset α. However, in the case that light pipe element <b>270</b>A is of a different length than light pipe element <b>270</b>B, the offset α of redirection may vary along the length of light pipe <b>270</b>A to facilitate incidence of the redirected light with light pipe element <b>270</b>B. Light pipe <b>270</b>B has redirection capabilities for directing light impinging thereon into slot <b>223</b>. Light pipe element <b>270</b>B is positioned on carriage surface <b>219</b>A such that light directed onto element <b>270</b>B is guided into slot <b>223</b>, impinges optic device <b>218</b>, and is focused on distal region <b>221</b>B of photosensitive device <b>221</b>. Accordingly, primary scan line data is obtained by sampling light <b>305</b>A impinging medial region <b>221</b>A that originates from directly above slot <b>223</b>. Secondary scan line data is obtained by sampling light <b>305</b>B that impinges light pipe element <b>270</b>A, is redirected to element <b>270</b>B, and is redirected into slot <b>223</b> thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C, and <b>6</b>, a procedure for scanning a media object <b>170</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is described. Carriage <b>219</b> is positioned at a scanning origination position, e.g., X=0 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and lamp <b>240</b> of media adapter <b>120</b> is activated. The configuration of carriage <b>219</b> enables sampling of a scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>by collecting light passing through scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>and into slot <b>223</b> where the light is focused onto medial region <b>221</b>A of photosensitive device <b>221</b>. In general, the light collected by optics device <b>218</b> for sampling scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>is directed substantially orthogonal to top surface <b>219</b>A and into slot <b>223</b>. A secondary scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>is concurrently sampled with scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In the present example, light directed onto scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>from lamp <b>240</b> is directed orthogonal to surface <b>219</b>A and onto light pipe element <b>270</b>A. Light pipe element <b>270</b>A is adapted to redirect received light along a light path substantially parallel with surface <b>219</b>A and into incidence with light pipe element <b>270</b>B. Light pipe element <b>270</b>B is adapted to receive light directed from element <b>270</b>A substantially parallel with top surface <b>219</b>A and redirect the light orthogonally with surface <b>219</b>A through slot <b>223</b>. Thus, light <b>305</b>A passing through a first scan line <b>375</b>A<sub>1 </sub>of media object <b>170</b> and into slot <b>223</b> is collected by optics device <b>218</b> and focused onto medial region <b>221</b>A of photosensitive device <b>221</b>. Concurrently, light passing through second scan line <b>375</b>B<sub>1 </sub>of media object <b>170</b> is collected by light pipe <b>270</b> and directed onto a distal region <b>221</b>B of photosensitive device. As carriage <b>219</b> is driven along rail <b>217</b>, subsequent sets of scan lines, e.g., scan lines <b>375</b>A<sub>2</sub>-<b>375</b>A<sub>M </sub>and <b>375</b>B<sub>2</sub>-<b>375</b>B<sub>N</sub>, are sampled in a similar manner. Imaging software is used to assemble the sampled scan lines <b>375</b>A<sub>1</sub>-<b>375</b>A<sub>M </sub>and <b>375</b>B<sub>1</sub>-<b>375</b>B<sub>N </sub>into a contiguous image.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be understood that the particular arrangement, implementation, and configuration of light pipe <b>270</b> with carriage <b>219</b> and photosensitive device <b>221</b> is exemplary only. While the illustrative embodiments provide a light pipe of two elements, a light pipe may be implemented from a single light pipe element or may comprise elements in excess of two components. Moreover, while the illustrative embodiments have described focusing light from a secondary scan line onto a distal region of a photosensitive device for concurrent sampling with another scan line by a medial region of the photosensitive device, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to such an implementation. For example, the light from the secondary scan line may be collected and directed towards two distal regions of a photosensitive device surrounding a medial region that provides samples of a primary scan line. It should further be understood that the particular areas of the photosensitive device that respectively sample the primary scan line and the secondary scan line can be modified by software and/or light pipe reconfigurations, and that in the most general terms, the present invention provides a method and mechanism of concurrently sampling two discrete scan lines of a media object with a single photosensitive device by directing the light from a first scan line to a region of the photosensitive device and concurrently directly light from the second scan line to different region of the photosensitive device.</p>
