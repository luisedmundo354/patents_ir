<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a seal device disposed in crawler roller, reduction gear, hydraulic motor, track roller or the like. More particularly, the invention relates to a seal device for crawler roller, hydraulic motor or the like used in construction machinery, which provides an effective seal against a process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a seal device of a mechanical seal type as a prior art related to the present invention which is employed in a crawler unit. This seal device is installed between a casing and a rotary member in order to keep out slurry, dirt, water containing abrasive particles or the like from the relatively rotating interface therebetween. This, however, necessitates use of a resilient O-ring for providing a seal between a seal ring of the seal device and the casing which retains the seal ring in a mating manner. Abrasive particles entrapped between the seal ring and the casing are likely to cause rapid wear of the seal ring and the casing. Wear of an urging spring for the seal ring and immersion of the spring in the dirt due to the abrasive particles will lead to an insufficient urging force against the seal ring. To alleviate these problems, resilient rings are introduced to provide not only a resilient force to the seal ring but also a seal at the interface between the contact surfaces where the seal ring is retained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Primary related art of the present invention is found as a floating seal disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,069 issued to Bedford as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This illustrates a cross sectional view of a floating seal <b>101</b> mounted in a crawler roller unit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a reference numeral <b>120</b> represents a shaft. The shaft <b>120</b> is disposed within a through bore of a roller <b>125</b>, and a floating seal <b>101</b> is disposed in the gap formed between the shaft <b>120</b> and the roller <b>125</b>. The floating seal <b>101</b> provides a seal by preventing dirt water or fine dirt particles from entering thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this floating seal <b>101</b>, a first resilient ring <b>102</b> has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is “J”-shaped and outer surface forms a curved concave face <b>105</b>. One end face of the primary resilient ring <b>102</b> is defined as outer fitting face <b>102</b>A while the other end face is defined as inner fitting face <b>102</b>B. Likewise, a second resilient ring <b>103</b> has also an annularly shaped body whose cross section is “J”-shaped and outer surface forms a curved concave face <b>105</b>. Therefore one end face of the secondary resilient ring <b>103</b> defines outer fitting face <b>103</b>A while the other end face defines inner fitting face <b>103</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next a first seal ring <b>110</b> has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is “U”-shaped and its radially extending end face of the first seal ring <b>110</b> defines a seal face <b>110</b>A. An annular groove of the seal ring <b>110</b> which is located on the other side of the seal face <b>110</b>A defines a mount groove portion <b>110</b>B. Likewise, a second seal ring <b>111</b> has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is also “U”-shaped and its radially extending end face of the second seal ring <b>111</b> defines a mating seal face <b>111</b>A. An annular groove disposed on the other side of the seal face <b>111</b>A then defines a mount groove portion <b>111</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b> thus constructed as well as the first seal ring <b>110</b> and the second seal ring <b>111</b> are all installed within the chamber formed between the shaft <b>120</b> and the roller <b>125</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Therefore the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b> retain curved concave surfaces <b>105</b>, <b>105</b> relative to an ambient passage chamber <b>126</b>. Also the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b> possess curved convex surfaces relative to a lubricant-filled internal chamber <b>127</b>. The first resilient ring <b>102</b> exerts a resiliently urging force such that the seal surface <b>110</b>A of the first seal ring <b>110</b> is pressed against the second seal ring <b>103</b>. The opposed seal surfaces <b>110</b>A and <b>111</b>A being pressed against each other provide an effective seal for the process fluid coming into the ambient passage chamber <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the first pressure receiving surface <b>105</b> of the first resilient seal ring <b>102</b> and the second pressure receiving surface <b>105</b> of the second resilient seal ring <b>103</b> are acted on by the sealed fluid from the ambient communication chamber <b>126</b> side, the first pressure receiving surface <b>105</b> of the first resilient seal ring <b>102</b> and the second pressure receiving surface <b>105</b> of the second resilient seal ring <b>103</b> which are bent to form concave surfaces are further bent toward the internal chamber <b>127</b> side due to the fluid pressure. This causes the contact forces at the first seal surface <b>110</b>A and the second seal surface <b>110</b>A to decrease. At the same time, this also induces elastic deformation of the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b> in such a direction that the first inner circumferential mount portion <b>102</b>B of the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second inner circumferential mount portion <b>103</b>B of the second resilient ring <b>103</b> may depart from the first mount concave portion <b>110</b>B and the second mount concave portion <b>111</b>B, respectively. As a result, seal ability at the first mount concave portion <b>110</b>B and the second mount concave portion <b>111</b>B is weakened. Furthermore, sealed fluid or fine dirt particles entering from the ambient communication chamber <b>126</b> side into the interface gap formed between the first inner circumferential mount portion <b>102</b>B and the first mount concave portion <b>110</b>B and another gap between the second inner circumferential mount portion <b>103</b>B and the second mount concave portion <b>111</b>B will cause wear of the contact surfaces of the first inner circumferential mount portion <b>102</b>B and the second inner circumferential mount portion <b>103</b>B. This will lead to a deterioration of the seal performance in the floating seal <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, the first seal ring <b>110</b> and the second seal ring <b>111</b> are resiliently urged against each other by the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b>, respectively. In this configuration, elastic deformation of the first resilient ring <b>102</b> and the second resilient ring <b>103</b> causes the contact force between the first seal surface <b>110</b>A of the first seal ring <b>110</b> and the second seal surface <b>111</b>A of the second seal ring <b>111</b> to decrease. Such elastic deformation also causes the first seal surface <b>110</b>A and the second seal surface <b>111</b>A being in contact to</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, there is another type of floating seal disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,884 issued to Anderton. For the track seal assembly disclosed therein, a loading member corresponding to a resilient ring is arranged to urge a ceramic seal member against a seal surface, similarly to the descriptions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Thus there remain similar problems encountered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is introduced to alleviate the above mentioned problems. A primary technical goal which this invention tries to achieve is to provide a seal ring with a desired urging force by means of a resilient seal ring and to exhibit seal capability of a seal surface by sealingly retaining the seal ring even under the influence of pressure of dirt water or the like. Another goal is to prevent dirt water or the like from leaking to the interface between the resilient seal ring and the support portion by sealingly retaining the seal ring with the resilient seal ring. Yet another goal is to prevent dirt water or the like from giving damage to the mount surfaces of the resilient seal ring.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A primary object of the present invention is to alleviate the above mentioned technical disadvantages, and a solution to such disadvantages is embodied as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A seal device related with the present invention is for effecting a seal between a shaft disposing a retainer portion and a ring member being inserted over the shaft and being rotatable relative to the shaft. The seal device comprises a second seal ring, a first seal ring, a first resilient body member and a first seal lip member, wherein the second seal ring has a second seal surface and is sealingly retained by packings, the packings being disposed at one member of either a retainer portion or a ring member, wherein the first seal ring is inserted over the shaft and has a first seal surface, a first support portion and a first outer diameter seal contact surface, the first seal surface facing oppositely against the second seal surface, the first support portion being disposed on the opposite side to the first seal surface, the first outer diameter seal contact surface being disposed on the outer circumferential surface between the first seal surface and the first support portion, wherein the first resilient body member is made of rubber-like elastic material and retains a first inner circumferential seal portion at its one end and a first outer circumferential seal portion at the other end and provides the first seal ring with an urging force, the first inner circumferential seal portion being engaged with the first support portion of the first seal ring, the first outer circumferential seal portion being engaged with the other member of either a retainer portion or a ring member, wherein the first seal lip member protrudes from the first resilient body member in an integral manner and is matingly brought into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the seal device related to the present invention, since the first seal lip member and the second seal lip member are brought into seal contact with the outer diameter seal contact surfaces, the sealed fluid pressure exerted from the ambient communication chamber side acts on the action circumferential surfaces of the individual seal lip members. This intensifies the contact of the seal lip members against the outer diameter circumferential seal contact surfaces and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interfaces between the first support portion and the first inner circumferential seal portion and between the second support portion and the second inner circumferential seal portion. And elastic deformation of the resilient body members is able to maintain sufficient urging forces to keep seal contact between the mutually opposing seal surfaces. Further, the seal lip members which are in a seal contact relation with the corresponding outer diameter seal contact surfaces resist against the elastic deformation of the resilient body members. This in turn provides urging forces to the seal rings and effectively prevents a decrease in contact strength at the seal surfaces. The first seal surface of the first seal ring which is sealingly retained by the first seal lip member can be brought into secure seal contact with the second seal surface of the second seal ring for outstanding seal performance even against dirt water as sealed fluid.</p>

Also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a seal device <b>1</b> representing a sixth embodiment related to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the seal device (floating seal) <b>1</b> is disposed within a seal chamber <b>70</b> which is formed between a roller <b>50</b> and a shaft <b>60</b>. The seal chamber <b>70</b> is defined as an inner space surrounded by the shaft <b>60</b>, a first fixing surface <b>51</b>A of a bushing (annular portion) <b>51</b> which is mounted via an O-ring <b>20</b> at the end portion of the roller <b>50</b>, and a retainer surface <b>61</b>A of a cover (retaining portion) <b>61</b> which is attached to the shaft <b>60</b>. It is possible to replace the bushing <b>51</b> by a resilient seal ring which is directly mounted to the roller <b>50</b>. In this case, the roller <b>50</b> itself constitutes the annular portion <b>51</b>. Choice of the annular portion <b>51</b> and the retaining portion <b>61</b> should not be restricted to the examples described here. Instead, they should be considered as one component and its mating component both of which mount a seal device and rotate relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Seal device <b>1</b> disposed a first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and a second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> therein. A first resilient body member <b>2</b>A in an annular form constitutes a main body of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. The outer circumferential portion of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A is defined as a first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B while the inner circumferential portion is defined as a first inner circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>C. The first resilient body member <b>2</b>A makes a small angle in a direction from a fixing surface <b>51</b>A toward a first support portion <b>4</b>B wherein the small angle causes a resilient, urging force which presses against a first seal ring <b>4</b> in the axial direction. The angle of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A is a design parameter which is a function of the urging force to the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the length of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A. The first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B is formed so as to engage with the fixing surface <b>51</b>A of “L”-shaped cross section. The first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B also retains a protruding first base portion <b>2</b>B<b>1</b>. The first inner circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>C is formed so as to engage with the outer perimeter surface of a first support portion <b>4</b>B which defines the “L”-shaped outer circumferential surface of the first seal ring <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first resilient body member <b>2</b>A also disposes a first seal lip member <b>6</b>A which has a tapered diameter surface and protrudes forward against the sealed fluid (left direction in the figure). Outer diameter surface of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A defines a first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> to which the sealed fluid acts on. The inner diameter surface of the front tip portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A defines a first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> whose contact length with a first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C is less than 16 mm. The free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A has a larger wall thickness than its root portion located toward the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A. The first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This configuration allows the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> to be brought into contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C at an optimal surface pressure and to exhibit an outstanding seal performance against the sealed fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It has been shown that the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> is configured to form a seal-tight contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C of the first seal ring <b>4</b>. In addition, the first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B retains a first seal portion <b>7</b>A which protrudes toward the same direction as the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and is brought into a seal contact with the fixing surface <b>51</b>A. An annular groove formed between the first seal portion <b>7</b>A and the first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> defines a first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A. The fluid pressure acted onto the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A effectively prevents the fluid from flowing into an internal chamber B because of the seal contact formed between the first seal portion <b>7</b>A and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A of the bushing <b>51</b>. The first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is made of a rubber material, thus elastic. Examples of the rubber material include perfluoro-elastomer, nitrile rubber (NBR) of hardness DuroA <b>60</b> to <b>80</b>, urethane rubber (U), fluoro rubber (FKM), isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), nitrile hydride rubber (H-NBR), elastic resin (for example, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoromethylvinylether rubber) and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> is disposed in a symmetrical manner with respect to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. A second resilient body member <b>3</b>A in an annular form constitutes a main body of the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>. The outer circumferential portion of the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A is defined as a second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B while the inner circumferential portion is defined as a second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C. Furthermore, the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A makes an angle in a direction from the second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B toward the second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C. Namely, the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A makes a small angle in a direction from a retainer surface <b>61</b>A toward a second support portion <b>5</b>B wherein the small angle causes a resilient, urging force which presses against a second seal ring <b>5</b> in the axial direction. The angle of the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A is a design parameter which is a function of the urging force to the second seal ring <b>5</b> and the length of the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A. The second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B is formed so as to engage with the retainer surface <b>61</b>A of “L”-shaped cross section. The second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B also retains a protruding second base portion <b>3</b>B<b>1</b>. The second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C is formed so as to engage with the outer perimeter surface of a second support portion <b>5</b>B which defines the “L”-shaped outer circumferential surface of the second seal ring <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second resilient body member <b>3</b>A also disposes a second seal lip member <b>6</b>B which has a tapered diameter surface and protrudes forward against the sealed fluid (right direction in the figure). Outer diameter surface of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B defines a second action diameter surface <b>6</b>B<b>2</b> to which the sealed fluid acts on. In addition, the second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B retains a second seal portion <b>7</b>B which protrudes toward the same direction as the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and is brought into a seal contact with the retainer surface <b>61</b>A. An annular groove formed between the second seal portion <b>7</b>B and the second action diameter surface <b>6</b>B<b>2</b> defines a second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B. The fluid pressure acted onto the second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B effectively prevents the fluid from flowing into the internal chamber B because of the seal contact formed between the second seal portion <b>7</b>B and the retainer surface <b>61</b>A of the cover <b>61</b>. The second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> is made of a rubber material, thus elastic. Examples of the rubber material include perfluoro-elastomer, nitrile rubber (NBR) of hardness DuroA <b>60</b> to <b>80</b>, urethane rubber (U), fluoro rubber (FKM), isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), nitrile hydride rubber (H-NBR), elastic resin (for example, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoromethylvinylether rubber) and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A pair of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal ring <b>5</b> symmetrically arranged to each other are disposed in a symmetrical manner. The first seal ring <b>4</b> retains an annular body form whose cross section is “L”-shaped. A first seal face <b>4</b>A is disposed on the side surface of a first flange portion <b>4</b>D of the first seal ring <b>4</b>. The optimal contact length of the first seal face <b>4</b>A can be achieved by making the radially inner portion of the side surface a tapered surface or a step shoulder surface. The “L”-sectioned outer circumferential surface of the first seal ring <b>4</b> constitutes the first support portion <b>4</b>B. The outer circumferential surface of the first flange portion <b>4</b>D defining the first seal face <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> constitutes the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. A first inner diameter surface <b>4</b>E of the first seal ring <b>4</b> forms a clearance fit relative to the shaft <b>60</b> with a gap therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second seal ring <b>5</b>, the other component constituting the pair, retains an annular body form whose cross section is “L”-shaped. The side surface of a second flange portion <b>5</b>D of the second seal ring <b>5</b> defines a second seal face <b>5</b>A which comes into seal contact with the first seal face <b>4</b>A. The radially inner portion of the side surface of the second seal face <b>5</b>A is arranged to form a tapered surface or a step shoulder surface to the axial direction. The “L”-sectioned outer circumferential surface of the second seal ring <b>5</b> constitutes the second support portion <b>5</b>B. The outer circumferential surface of the second flange portion <b>5</b>D defining the second seal face <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> constitutes the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C. A second inner diameter surface <b>5</b>E of the second seal ring <b>5</b> forms a clearance fit relative to the shaft <b>60</b> with a gap therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal ring <b>5</b> are made of cast iron, heat treated steel, heat resistive metal alloy, SiC, super-hard alloy, alumina ceramics or the like. Or one of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal ring <b>5</b> can be made of carbon material for a small friction coefficient. The first seal ring <b>4</b> can be fixed with the bushing <b>51</b> via a drive pin, not shown, such that they rotate together. Likewise, the second seal ring <b>5</b> can be fixed with the cover <b>61</b> via another drive pin so that the second seal ring <b>5</b> is not dragged by the first seal ring <b>4</b>. Furthermore, a resilient force may be reinforced for the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A by immersing a leaf spring or coil spring therein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> thus constructed, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B fits the fixing surface <b>51</b>A of the bushing <b>51</b> while the first inner circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>C fits the first support portion <b>4</b>B of the first seal ring <b>4</b>. And the elastic force of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A urges the first seal surface <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> against the second seal surface <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b>. The first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A which is brought into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C of the first flange portion <b>4</b>D effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking through the fit surface between the first inner circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>C and the first support portion <b>4</b>B. This in turn prevents the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A from lifting off the first support portion <b>4</b>B and elastically deforming toward the internal chamber B.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first resilient body member <b>2</b>A is able to provide the first seal surface <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> with a sufficient, resilient force for maintaining a seal-tight contact relative to the second seal surface <b>5</b>A. The first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A acted on by the sealed fluid pressure intensifies the degree of seal contact in the first seal portion <b>7</b>A of the first outer diameter contact seal portion <b>2</b>B relative to fixing surface <b>51</b>A, which further prevents the sealed fluid from leaking to the internal chamber B through the fit surface formed by the first outer diameter contact seal portion <b>2</b>B and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A. The fit surface of the first outer diameter contact seal portion <b>2</b>B and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A thus reinforced due to the first seal portion <b>7</b>A avoids unwanted deformation of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A, and the elastic force of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A enhances the seal performance of the first seal surface <b>4</b>A. In the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>, like the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>, the second outer circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>B fits the retainer surface <b>61</b>A while the second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C fits the second support portion <b>5</b>B of the second seal ring <b>5</b>. And the elastic force of the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A urges the second seal surface <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> against the first seal surface <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B which is brought into seal contact with the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C of the second flange portion <b>5</b>D effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking through the fit surface between the second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C and the second support portion <b>5</b>B. This in turn prevents the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A from lifting off the second support portion <b>5</b>B and elastically deforming toward the internal chamber B. The second resilient body member <b>3</b>A is able to provide the second seal surface <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> with a sufficient, resilient force for maintaining a seal-tight contact relative to the first seal surface <b>4</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The seal device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is so constructed that the roller <b>50</b> rotates, thus the first seal ring <b>4</b> serving as a rotary seal ring. Therefore the second seal ring becomes a stationary seal ring. The arrangement of the rotary seal ring <b>4</b> and the stationary seal ring <b>5</b> can be swapped with each other depending on the type of machine the seal device is mounted on. It, however, is possible to effect a seal by employing a different form from the one indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for either one of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> or the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>. For example, in case of the situation where few fine particles are contained in the sealed fluid, a rectangle-sectioned resilient seal ring can be used along the tilting angle for exerting a resilient, urging force against the seal ring.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The seal device <b>1</b> effects a seal against a sealed fluid such as dirt water or the like which is allowed to flow in through the ambient communication chamber A as the roller <b>50</b> rotates. In an adjacency of the internal chamber B, the roller <b>50</b> and the shaft <b>60</b> dispose bearings <b>25</b> therebetween and lubricants applied thereto. Even if the lubricants exert a pressure to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>, the support offered by the first reinforcement ring <b>22</b> and the second reinforcement ring <b>23</b>, respectively, maintain elastic deformation of the rings without a drop of the seal capability. The lubricant pressure will rather lead to enhancing the seal capability as the result of more secure contact between the first seal surface <b>4</b>A and the second seal surface <b>5</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a half sectional view of first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and first seal ring <b>4</b> mated under an unloaded condition. It is noted that second resilient seal ring (packing) <b>13</b> is configured in a symmetrical manner to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. Its shape, however, is not restricted to be identical to that of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. For instance, the second seal ring <b>5</b> can approximately have a rectangular cross section. The three adjacent faces of the second seal ring <b>5</b> on its back face side are fittingly supported by the “U”-shape sectioned second resilient seal ring (packing) <b>13</b> which is fitted to the groove of the cover (retainer portion) <b>61</b>. The second resilient seal ring <b>13</b> can be replaced by an O-ring (packing) mounted in an installation groove of the cover (retainer portion) <b>61</b>. Under such a circumstance, the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> exhibits a seal performance relative to this invention. This implies that the current invention can be embodied not only by combination of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the first seal ring <b>4</b> but also by substituting the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> by the second resilient seal ring (packing) <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">What the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> (also second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> makes a difference from that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that the inner diameter surface of the front tip portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A defines a first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> whose contact length with a first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C is in a range of from 1 mm to 12 mm. The free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A has a larger wall thickness than its root portion located toward the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A. The first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This configuration allows the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> to be brought into contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C at an optimal surface pressure and to exhibit an outstanding seal performance against the sealed fluid. As a result, unwanted elastic deformation of the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A is prevented and seal ability of the first seal face <b>4</b>A and the second seal face <b>5</b>A is enhanced. The first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B also includes a first base portion <b>2</b>B<b>1</b> which protrudes in an opposite direction relative to the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A. The first base portion <b>2</b>B<b>1</b> provides the first outer circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B with a resilient, urging force in the axial direction. Annular groove formed between the first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A defines a first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates how the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> deforms when loaded by fluid pressure of 0.6 MPa from the ambient communication chamber A. With the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a comparison example 1 wherein a first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is not employed in the resilient seal ring, it has been experimentally verified that application of 0.6 MPa fluid pressure to the resilient seal ring causes the surface pressure on the seal face to be reduced from 2.5 kN at an unloaded condition to one seventh of the surface pressure. On the other hand, with another example wherein the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is employed in the resilient seal ring <b>2</b>, experiments under the same condition result in a surface pressure drop to only 1/2.3. These experimental results show that even if the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is acted on by fluid pressure through the ambient communication chamber A, an elastic deformation of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> toward the internal chamber B does not occur. This will lead to maintenance of the normal, resilient urging force between the first seal face <b>4</b>A and the second seal face <b>5</b>A, which in turn implies outstanding seal capability to be exhibited between the first seal face <b>4</b>A and the second seal face <b>5</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a seal device <b>1</b> as a third embodiment related to the present invention. A difference between the seal device <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A of the former has a trapezoidal shape. Another difference is that the opposite end surface of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> relative to the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A has an arcuate form. This configuration is intended to prevent elastic deformation of the resilient body member <b>2</b>A caused by the fluid pressure through the ambient communication chamber A. Therefore, the elastic forces of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> are strong enough to maintain outstanding seal ability at between the first seal face <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal face <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> even under the presence of the fluid pressure being acted onto the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are made of rubber material such as perfluoro-elastomer, nitrile rubber, nitrile hydride rubber (H-NBR), silicone rubber, fluoro rubber, acrylic rubber, styrene rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, urethane rubber or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a seal device <b>1</b> as a fourth embodiment related to the present invention. The seal device <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is represented by the same reference numerals as the seal device <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>3</b> with the exception for the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>. Thus, the detailed description of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal ring <b>5</b> is omitted. The first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is configured more or less in the same form as the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. There, however, are discrepancies with respect to first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and first seal portion <b>7</b>A. Wall thickness of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is arranged thicker than the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. And the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A retains a first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and a first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> on the inner circumferential surface and the outer circumferential surface, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This angle accommodates a desired axial force at the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A in accordance with the radial contact force of the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> against the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C where the axial force is reduced to 3 to 50% compared with the radial force. This provides an optimal surface pressure at the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interface between the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. Axial length of the protruding portion of the first seal portion <b>7</b>A is arranged smaller than that of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A. The length of the first seal portion <b>7</b>A, if necessary, can be made as large as that of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A. When the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A thus arranged are mounted onto between the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A, the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A between the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C, which is firmly pressed therebetween, provides a sealing contact between the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C as well as a sealing contact between the first seal portion <b>7</b>A and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A while the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A also allows the seal fluid to act thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> which has an identical form with the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is disposed in a symmetrical manner with respect to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. Namely, the wall thickness of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B, like the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A, is arranged thicker. And the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B retains a second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and a second action diameter surface <b>6</b>B<b>2</b> on the inner circumferential surface and the outer circumferential surface, respectively. The second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This angle accommodates a desired axial force at the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B in accordance with the radial contact force of the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> against the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C where the axial force is reduced to 3 to 50% compared with the radial force. This provides an optimal surface pressure at the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interface between the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Axial length of the protruding portion of the second seal portion <b>7</b>B is arranged smaller than that of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B. A second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B is disposed between the second seal portion <b>7</b>B and second action diameter surface <b>6</b>B<b>2</b> and the fluid pressure is allowed to act on the second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B. The length of the second seal portion <b>7</b>B, if necessary, can be made as large as that of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B. When the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and the second seal portion <b>7</b>B thus arranged are mounted onto between the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C of the second seal ring <b>5</b> and the retainer surface <b>61</b>A, the second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B between the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C, which is firmly pressed therebetween, provides a sealing contact between the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C as well as a sealing contact between the second seal portion <b>7</b>B and the retainer surface <b>61</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the seal device thus configured, sands and mud contained in dirt water are accumulated in the ambient communication chamber A and increase the pressure within the chamber A. However, the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A which are installed under a seal contact state between the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the fixing surface <b>51</b>A are capable of effecting a seal against the fluid pressure. The short axial length of the first seal portion <b>7</b>A also contributes to intensifying the contact between the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C since more significant fluid pressure acts on the first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A. Therefore, an increase of the fluid pressure leads to an increase of the contact force of the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> against the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C and also prevents the fluid from entering between the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> against the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. The above argument applies to the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> as well since the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> plays the same role as the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a seal device <b>1</b> as a fifth embodiment related to the present invention.

The first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is configured more or less in the same manner as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Discrepancies are seen in the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A. That is, the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is arranged thick in its wall thickness and there is no first seal portion <b>7</b>A. A first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> located in the outer circumference of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is made thicker as it approaches the free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A while it forms a tapered surface which is made thinner toward the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A. The taper angle is preferably in the range of from 3 degrees to 85 degrees. Thus, it defines a wedge form wherein the free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is made thicker. Another tapered surface on the fixing surface <b>51</b>A, a first fixing surface <b>51</b>B, is defined toward the ambient communication chamber A side. The taper angle of the first fixing surface <b>5</b> is also preferably in the range of from 3 degrees to 85 degrees. When the fluid pressure acts on the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A from the ambient communication chamber A side, the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A generates a wedge-form contact against the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C and the first fixing surface <b>51</b>B and as a consequence seal capability at the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> and the first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> is intensified. Therefore, even a high pressure fluid containing sands and mud can be effectively sealed by means of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> which has an identical form with the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is disposed in a symmetrical manner with respect to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>. That is, the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B of the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> is configured to a wedge shape in such a way that it becomes thicker toward its free end portion and thinner toward the resilient body member <b>3</b>A side. The second seal lip member <b>6</b>B retains a second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and a second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> on the inner circumferential surface and the outer circumferential surface, respectively wherein the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> is a tapered surface. The taper angle is preferably in the range of from 3 degrees to 85 degrees. A second fixing surface <b>61</b>B which is brought into contact with the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> should also form a similar tapered surface. The angle also is preferably in the range of from 3 degrees to 85 degrees. When the fluid pressure acts on the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B from the ambient communication chamber A side, the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B generates a wedge-form contact against the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C and the second fixing surface <b>61</b>B and as a consequence seal capability at the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b> and the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> is intensified. Therefore, even high pressure fluid containing sands and mud can be effectively sealed by means of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B. The second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> works similarly in other aspects to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>.</p>

Therefore, leakage of the sealed fluid from the ambient communication chamber A side to the internal chamber B can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> which has an identical form with the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> is disposed in a symmetrical manner with respect to the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b>.

The first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b> employed in the fourth embodiment through the sixth embodiment are arranged more or less in an identical form and disposed in symmetrical locations.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Described next is alternative inventions of preferred examples related to the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the seal device <b>1</b> related to the second invention, since the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B are brought into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C and the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C, respectively, the sealed fluid pressure exerted from the ambient communication chamber side acts on the first and second action circumferential surfaces <b>6</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>6</b>B<b>2</b> of the first and second seal lip members <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, respectively. This intensifies the contact of the first and second seal lip members <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B against the corresponding first and second outer diameter circumferential seal contact surfaces <b>4</b>C, <b>5</b>C, and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interfaces between the first support portion <b>4</b>B and the first inner circumferential seal portion <b>2</b>B and between the second support portion <b>5</b>B and the second inner circumferential seal portion <b>3</b>C. The first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal ring <b>5</b> are resiliently urged against each other by means of the first resilient seal ring <b>2</b> and the second resilient seal ring <b>3</b>, respectively, and the first seal surface <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> and the second seal surface <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> are capable of exhibiting outstanding seal performance thereat with neither a relative displacement in a radial direction nor a relative angular offset between the two surfaces in a direction the two surfaces fall apart. Both the first and second seal surfaces <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A can maintain a secure seal contact even when dirt water accumulated in the ambient communication chamber causes an increase in the internal pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Seal device of the third invention related to the present invention includes a first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b>, a second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b>, a first fixing surface <b>51</b>B and a second fixing surface <b>61</b>B, wherein the first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> is defined on the outer circumferential surface of the free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A which forms a tapered surface toward the free end, wherein the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> is defined on the outer circumferential surface of the free end portion of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B which forms a tapered surface toward the free end, wherein the first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> is brought into compressive contact with a tapered first fixing surface <b>51</b>B which is disposed on the ring member <b>51</b>, wherein the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> is brought into compressive contact with a tapered second retainer surface <b>61</b>B which is disposed on the second retainer portion <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the seal device related to the third invention, the tapered first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> disposed on the outer circumferential surface of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is brought into compressive contact with the tapered first fixing surface <b>51</b>B. Likewise, the tapered second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> disposed on the outer circumferential surface of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B is brought into compressive contact with the tapered second fixing surface <b>61</b>B. Therefore, the fluid pressure acted on to the free end surfaces of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B induces wedge-forming contact between the first contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>3</b> and the first fixing surface <b>51</b>B. Similarly, the fluid pressure induces wedge-forming contact between the second contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>3</b> and the second fixing surface <b>61</b>B. The first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> is brought into secure contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C by an adequate surface pressure in accordance with the wedge-forming force. In a similar manner to the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A, the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B is brought into secure contact with the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Seal device of the fourth invention related to the present invention includes a first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b> and a second seal portion <b>6</b>B<b>4</b>, wherein the first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b> is a step shoulder which is formed by thickening the outer circumferential surface of the free end portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A, wherein the second seal portion <b>6</b>B<b>4</b> is also a step shoulder which is formed by thickening the outer circumferential surface of the free end portion of the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B, wherein the first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b> is compressively engaged with the first engagement surface <b>51</b>C which is a step shoulder disposed in the ring member <b>51</b> while the second seal portion <b>6</b>B<b>4</b> is compressively engaged with the second engagement surface <b>61</b>C which is a step shoulder disposed in the retainer portion <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the seal device related to the fourth invention, the first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b>, a step shoulder, disposed on the outer circumferential surface of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is brought into compressive contact with the first engagement surface <b>51</b>C which also forms a step shoulder. The second seal portion <b>6</b>B<b>4</b>, another step shoulder, is brought into compressive contact with the second engagement surface <b>61</b>C which also forms a step shoulder. Therefore, when a fluid pressure is applied to the free end surfaces of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B, the first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A is engaged with the first engagement surface <b>51</b>C at the step shoulder. The first seal portion <b>6</b>A<b>4</b> and the first engagement surface <b>51</b>C act at the step shoulder in such a way that the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> is brought into compressive contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C in a direction from the free end portion to the root portion of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A. This enables the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> to exhibit outstanding seal ability by coming into contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C at an adequate pressure in accordance with the fluid pressure. The second seal lip member <b>6</b>B similarly operates for the outstanding seal performance of the second seal contact surface <b>6</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Seal device of the fifth invention related to the present invention includes a first seal portion <b>7</b>A, a second seal portion <b>7</b>B, a first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A and a second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B, wherein the first seal portion <b>7</b>A is integral with the first resilient body member, extends in the same direction as the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and is brought into seal contact with the ring member <b>51</b>, wherein the second seal portion <b>7</b>B is integral with the second resilient body member, extends in the same direction as the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and is brought into seal contact with the retainer portion <b>61</b>, wherein the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A is disposed between the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A, wherein the second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B is disposed between the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and the second seal portion <b>7</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the seal device related to the fifth invention, since the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A is disposed between the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A, a fluid pressure acted onto the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A operates the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> to be brought into compressive contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. Likewise, the fluid pressure in the pocket of the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A operates the first seal portion <b>7</b>A to be brought into compressive contact with the fixing surface <b>51</b>A. This configuration can assure seal ability against sealed fluid of dirt water or high pressure. Similar effects can be obtained for the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B as well. Therefore, even when the sealed fluid contains dirt, the seal device can exhibit effective seal performance between the first seal surface <b>4</b>A of the first seal ring <b>4</b> which is sealingly retained by the first resilient body member <b>2</b>A and the second seal surface <b>5</b>A of the second seal ring <b>5</b> which is sealingly retained by the second resilient body member <b>3</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Seal device of the sixth invention related to the present invention is configured in such a way that the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A are compressively loaded between the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C and the ring member <b>51</b> by bringing the two faces of the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A into contact with each other and the second seal lip member <b>6</b>B and the second seal portion <b>7</b>B are compressively loaded between the second outer diameter seal contact surface <b>5</b>C and the retainer portion <b>61</b> by bringing the two faces of the second pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>B into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the seal device related to the sixth invention, the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A and the first seal portion <b>7</b>A retain the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A therebetween and the two faces of the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A are brought into contact with each other. When a fluid pressure is moderate, the fluid pressure acts on the first action diameter surface <b>6</b>A<b>2</b> located on the outer circumferential surface of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A in order to bring the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. When the fluid pressure becomes high enough to open up the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A, the fluid pressure guided to within the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A operates so as to bring the first seal contact surface <b>6</b>A<b>1</b> of the first seal lip member <b>6</b>A into compressive contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface <b>4</b>C. Likewise, the first seal portion <b>7</b>A is also brought into compressive contact with the fixing surface <b>51</b>A. This configuration allows the sealed fluid, dirt water or high pressure fluid, to operate to open up the first pressure receiving groove <b>8</b>A for effecting seal. The second seal lip member <b>6</b>B operates in a similar manner for the same effect. Thus, a seal fluid such as dirt water can effectively be sealed.</p>
