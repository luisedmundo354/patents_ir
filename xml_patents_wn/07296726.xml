<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a system for welding structures consisting of elements of pressed sheet metal, such as motor-vehicle bodies or their subassemblies, said system being designed to operate in an automatic way on a plurality of different types of structure to be welded (for example, motor-vehicle bodies of different models of motor vehicle, or motor-vehicle bodies of different versions, such as saloons, station-wagons, convertibles, etc., of the same model of motor vehicle, or again, for example, single subassemblies, such as flat boot panels, under-panels, or side panels, of different models of motor-vehicle body). Systems of the type specified above are known (see, for example, GB-A-2 172 555 and EP-A-0 642 878 in the name of the present applicant), which comprise:</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">a welding station;</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">a conveying line, for carrying the structures to be welded, or at least part thereof, through the welding station; and</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">a plurality of pairs of side gates provided with means for clamping structures to be welded during the welding operation and such as can be guided along the conveying line, said clamping means provided on the side gates of each pair being adapted to the configuration of a corresponding type of structure to be welded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In said known systems, the side gates are mobile on guide means provided at the side of the conveying line to enable replacement, according to the type of structure to be welded, of the pair of side gates that is located in the vicinity of the welding station. Each side gate is displaceable between a first position, close to the welding station, and at least one second position, remote from the welding station.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, each pair of side gates, when located in the aforesaid first position close to the welding station, may be displaced between an open condition and a closed condition, in which the respective means for clamping of the side gates are operative for clamping parts of the structure to be welded in a welding configuration on the welding station. The system moreover comprises means for moving the side gates, for their displacement between the respective first and second positions. In some known solutions, the guide means of the side gates comprise fixed structures that carry above them overhead rails, on which the gates themselves are slidably mounted, whilst in other solutions the gates are, instead, self-moving units that move along guides fixed to the ground. The pairs of gates are displaced between the respective first and second positions in the aforesaid open condition, until they reach a position corresponding to the welding station. In said position, the pair is brought into the closed condition, with the gates that provide the suitable clamping of the parts to be welded. Welding is then carried out using programmable automatic welding means, for example programmable robots provided with electrical spot welding heads and/or laser welding heads.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to facilitate the use of various types of side gates, a known technique is to equip the system with suitable stores, from which the required pair of side gates is picked up according to the type of structure to be welded and where the gates used for the welding operation just concluded are parked, awaiting a subsequent use.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Irrespective of the type of guides used, whether overhead ones or ones on the ground, and of the presence of possible stores, the movement of the gates is obtained by equipping each of them with motor means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In light of what is set forth above, the present invention proposes a further improvement in the known systems, by simple and low-cost means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above purpose is achieved, according to the invention, through a system for the welding of structures made of pressed sheet metal, in particular motor-vehicle bodies or their subassemblies, said system having the characteristics indicated in the annexed claims, which are to be understood as forming an integral part of the present description.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The welding system according to the invention, illustrated by way of example in the annexed drawings, is designed to operate on a plurality of different types of motor-vehicle bodies. For the above purpose, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the system comprises a welding station <b>1</b> set along an appropriate conveying line, represented only schematically by the arrow <b>2</b>, used for carrying the motor-vehicle bodies to be welded through the welding station <b>1</b>. The station <b>1</b> is not illustrated in detail in so far as it is of a conception as a whole known, with the exception of some of its specific innovative aspects, which will be described hereinafter. The welding equipment provided at the station <b>1</b> may consist of robots of a known type, the control unit of which contains a set of different operating programs, selected as required each time according to the type of motor-vehicle body to be welded.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Given that the conveying line <b>2</b> and the means for obtaining the displacement of the motor-vehicle bodies along said line can be of any known type, said elements have not been illustrated in the annexed drawings in so far as they do not fall within the scope of the present invention. Their elimination from the drawings moreover renders the latter more immediately understandable. It is evident in any case that the way in which the motor-vehicle body to be welded is formed in the welding station can be any whatsoever. For example, the motor-vehicle body can be entirely pre-assembled in a provisional way upstream of the welding station, or else the various subassemblies constituting the motor-vehicle body can be carried along the conveying line <b>2</b> to the welding station in an as yet unassembled condition, the assembly prior to the welding operation being carried out in the station itself. Alternatively, the conveying line <b>2</b> can carry only part of the motor-vehicle body, for example the under-panel, to the welding station, in which case, the assembly of the complete motor-vehicle body is carried out in the welding station, causing the remaining components of the body to arrive there. Furthermore, the system according to the invention is of course usable also for the welding of single subassemblies of motor-vehicle bodies, or again, in theory, for any other type of structure made of welded sheet metal, designed to be produced in different types or models or versions. Whatever the way in which the motor-vehicle body is assembled, it is necessary to clamp each part of the body in a precise position, when the body undergoes the welding operations in the station <b>1</b>. Said clamping is obtained by means of positioning and clamping tools carried by pairs of operatively interchangeable side gates, designated by <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which can run on longitudinal bottom rails or guides <b>4</b>. Where it is not strictly necessary for the purposes of the detailed description of the operation of the system according to the invention, the side gates <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d </i>will be in what follows identified only by the reference number <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the case exemplified, the guides <b>4</b> extend parallel to the line <b>2</b> for conveying the motor-vehicle bodies and are fixed directly to the ground, with the exception of one of their respective intermediate portions, designated by <b>4</b><i>a</i>, located in a position corresponding to the welding station <b>1</b>. As will emerge clearly from what follows, the portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the guides <b>4</b> are such as can be translated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal development of the guides themselves, for carrying the side gates <b>3</b> of the pair in use on the welding station <b>1</b> in the respective closed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The pairs of side gates <b>3</b> can be displaced along the guides <b>4</b> so as to bring, into a position corresponding to the welding station <b>1</b>, a pair of side gates corresponding to the type of body to be welded. When a body of a type different from that on which the welding station has operated immediately before reaches the station <b>1</b>, the pair of side gates that is located in the station itself can be rapidly replaced by means of sliding in the respective guides <b>4</b>, as will emerge from what follows.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the above purpose, in the case exemplified, there are provided two stores of gates, each comprising a series of stations <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>arranged on the two sides of the conveying line <b>2</b> and of the guides <b>4</b>, where each parking station comprises a guide section <b>7</b>, of a shape similar to that of the guides or rails <b>4</b> and thus designed to support in a slidable way a respective side gate. In the case exemplified, the guide sections <b>7</b> extend substantially parallel to the guides <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the example illustrated, on each side of the conveying line <b>2</b> there are provided two stores, each comprising three different stations <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, which correspond to a total maximum number of six different types of gates <b>3</b>, designed to operate on as many types of motor-vehicle bodies. Of course, in any case the two stores can be provided with any number of parking stations, with the limits that will be illustrated in what follows.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The various gates <b>3</b> carry, in a way in itself known, respective positioning and clamping tools (not illustrated), designed to engage the side and top parts of the body in such a way as to clamp them in a precise position during execution of the welding operations on the station <b>1</b>. The bottom part of the body is instead clamped by means of further positioning and clamping tools provided on the bottom part of the welding station <b>1</b>. Each pair of side gates <b>3</b> is in particular provided with positioning and clamping tools suited to the particular configuration of a respective type of body.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the use of the system, positioned as required each time on the guides <b>4</b> is a first pair of side gates <b>3</b>, in the working position, corresponding to the type of body that is located each time in the welding station <b>1</b>, and a second pair of gates <b>3</b>, in a waiting position, corresponding to the type of body to be welded immediately afterwards. When the latter body enters the welding station <b>1</b>, the first gates <b>3</b> are brought into a waiting position and the second gates <b>3</b> into the working position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an important aspect of the invention, in a position corresponding to the two longitudinal ends of the guides <b>4</b> there are provided respective translatable guide elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>, of a shape similar to that of the guides <b>4</b>. The translatable elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>are equipped with respective motor and drive means <b>9</b>, in order to be displaced laterally, for example on respective pairs of rails <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal development of the guides <b>4</b>, between a first position and a plurality of second positions. In the aforesaid first position, each translatable element <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>is longitudinally aligned to a respective guide <b>4</b> so as to constitute a sort of prolongation thereof. Via the aforesaid lateral displacement, each element <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>can be brought into a position corresponding to a respective parking station <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, i.e., to a guide section <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an important aspect of the invention, the movement of the side gates <b>3</b> of the various pairs is provided by means of independent tractors, each of which can co-operate with different side gates <b>3</b> in order to pick them up from a respective parking station <b>6</b><i>a </i>or <b>6</b><i>b </i>and bring them into the operative position corresponding to the station <b>1</b>, and vice versa. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two pairs of tractors are provided, designated by <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, which are selectively coupleable to the various gates, with the modalities that will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The general operation of the welding system according to the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-20</figref>. For the above purpose, suppose that in the welding station <b>1</b> there is a body of a first type, referred to as type a), the parts of which are clamped in a precise position during the welding operation by positioning tools carried by the pair of side gates <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The body that is located in the welding station <b>1</b> is to be followed by a body of a second type, referred to as type b), where the positioning tools provided for clamping the various parts of the body of type b) during execution of the welding operation are provided on the pair of side gates <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the body of type b) will be followed by a body of a third type, or type c), and this in turn by a body of a fourth type, or type d), to each of which is associated a respective type of side gates <b>3</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be seen, the substitution of a body in the welding station <b>1</b> is accompanied by a corresponding substitution of the pairs of side gates to be used on the station itself, along the guides <b>4</b> in such a way as to bring one pair of gates <b>3</b> into a waiting position and the other pair of gates <b>3</b> into the operative position, in the welding station.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once it has arrived in the operative position, each pair of side gates is displaceable between an open condition, to enable entry into the welding station <b>1</b> of the new body to be welded, and a closed condition, in which the positioning tools of the side gates engage the side and top parts of the body to clamp them in a precise position. As previously mentioned, the aforesaid movement is obtained via translation of the portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the guides <b>4</b>, the modalities of actuation of which constitute another important aspect of the invention, described hereinafter. Clamping of the gates <b>3</b> in the closed condition, with respect to the welding station is obtained via means in themselves known.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Present on the station <b>1</b> is a motor-vehicle body of type a), and in a position corresponding to the station itself, on the mobile guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>there are located the two side gates <b>3</b><i>a</i>, set in the open condition and coupled to the respective tractors <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The gates <b>3</b><i>b </i>designed for processing the body of type b) that is next to undergo the welding process on the station <b>1</b>, with coupled thereto the respective tractors <b>11</b><i>b</i>, are on the translatable elements <b>8</b><i>b</i>, which are aligned at the exit end of the guides <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the example illustrated, as may be seen, the stores <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>are exploited only partially, since they would be suited to receiving two additional pairs of gates <b>3</b>, should the requirements of production so dictate. It is evident in any case that the system according to the invention can be provided with stores having any number of places, it remaining understood that there exists a practical limit to the increase in the number of places owing to the space available and above all to the need to carry out the operations of exchange between a pair of gates adjacent to the welding station and a pair of gates in the store within an interval of time not longer than the duration of the cycle of welding operations in order to enable, at the end of the welding process, the new pair of gates corresponding to a subsequent motor-vehicle body to be welded of a type different from the one that is already completed, to be ready to undergo processing.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is moreover evident that the stores are not exploited in the case where the series of motor-vehicle bodies fed into the welding station <b>1</b> are all of one and the same type, or only of two different types, in which case the two corresponding types of gates are exchanged simply with a longitudinal movement between the first position and the second position by means of the respective tractors.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">From the foregoing description it emerges how the use of the tractors <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b </i>selectively coupleable to various types of gates avoids the necessity, typical of the known art, of having to associate motor means to each gate.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Associated to each assembly <b>21</b> is a support <b>23</b> for a wheel <b>24</b> mounted on a vertical axis, which forms part of a system for hooking and releasing the gates <b>3</b> to/from the respective tractors <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, described hereinafter.</p>

Fixed at the end of the shaft <b>32</b> is a pinion <b>33</b>, meshing on of a rack <b>34</b>, fixed along a guide <b>4</b> (the rack <b>34</b> comprises, of course, a stretch also corresponding to a respective translatable element <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and possibly a stretch corresponding to a mobile guide portion <b>4</b><i>a</i>). The assembly <b>31</b> can be actuated selectively, with modalities in themselves known, so as to obtain rotation of the shaft <b>32</b> in one direction or in the other in order to be able to displace the tractor <b>11</b><i>b </i>in two opposite directions along the guides via the aforesaid pinion-rack system.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, fixed at the end of the carriage <b>30</b> facing the gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>is a sectional element <b>35</b> having a substantially U-shaped cross section, so as to be able to receive the wheel <b>24</b> associated to the support <b>23</b> of the gate <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It should be borne in mind that the tractors <b>11</b><i>a </i>are of construction similar to the tractors <b>11</b><i>b </i>but with an arrangement specular with respect to the one represented schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As may be appreciated, in the condition represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, in which the wheel <b>24</b> is within the groove of the sectional element <b>35</b>, the tractor <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>are engaged with one another, so that the former will be able to push or pull the latter with itself along the respective guide <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Disengagement between tractor and gate is obtained via sliding of the wheel <b>24</b> in the sectional element <b>35</b> until it exits from the latter, which is obtained when one of the two elements is translated in a lateral direction with respect to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, disengagement is obtained when the gates <b>3</b> of a pair are brought into the respective closed condition on the station <b>1</b>, via translation of the mobile guide portions <b>4</b><i>a</i>, with the tractors that remain instead static on the fixed guides <b>4</b> (see, for example, what is described with reference to the gates <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the tractors <b>11</b><i>a </i>in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), or else when the elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>are translated laterally for return into alignment with respect to the guides <b>4</b>, after parking of the gates <b>3</b> in respective stations <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>(see, for example, what is described with reference to the elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, to the tractors <b>11</b><i>a </i>and to the stations <b>6</b><i>a</i>, in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Engagement between tractor and gate is obtained, instead, when the wheel <b>23</b> is brought within the groove of the sectional element <b>35</b>, which occurs when one of the two elements is translated for being brought into alignment with respect to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, said engagement is obtained when the gates <b>3</b> of one pair are brought into the respective open condition on the station <b>1</b> (see, for example, what is described with reference to the gates <b>3</b><i>b </i>and to the tractors <b>11</b><i>a </i>in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), or else when the elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>are brought into alignment with the respective stations <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>for the purposes of picking up new gates (see, for example, what is described with reference to the elements <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the tractors <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the gates <b>3</b><i>c </i>and the stations <b>6</b><i>b</i>, in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are schematic illustrations of a device used for moving the gates <b>3</b> between the respective open and closed conditions, provided at the welding station <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, the station <b>1</b> includes a fixed supporting structure, comprising longitudinal side members <b>40</b>, to each of which are associated respective sectional guide elements <b>41</b>. Slidably coupled to the sectional guide elements <b>41</b>, with modalities in themselves known (for example, via wheels), is a slide <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The slide <b>42</b> comprises fixed supports <b>43</b> for the guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>designed to support the gates. It is to be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, only the bottom part of a gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>is represented, i.e., its bottom structure <b>20</b>, where there is visible one of the assemblies <b>21</b> bearing the support <b>23</b> for the wheel <b>24</b> that forms part of the system for engagement and disengagement between the gate and the tractor, as described previously. As may be seen, the assemblies <b>21</b> further comprise wheels <b>44</b> for resting on the guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>(and obviously on the guides <b>4</b>), as well as substantially L-shaped sectional elements <b>45</b>, set opposite to one another, which, combined with wheels <b>46</b>, guarantee the correct position of rolling of the wheels <b>44</b> on the guides <b>4</b><i>a </i>(and <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A gearmotor assembly <b>47</b>-<b>48</b> is rendered fixed to the longitudinal members <b>40</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, projecting laterally from the gearmotor <b>47</b>-<b>48</b> are the two ends of a respective actuation shaft <b>49</b>, to each of which is fixedly coupled a respective lever <b>50</b>. The end of each lever <b>50</b> opposite to that of fixing to the shaft <b>49</b> carries a pin <b>51</b> for a respective wheel <b>52</b>. Each wheel <b>52</b> is inserted slidably in a respective C-shaped sectional guide element <b>53</b>, which extends vertically therefrom. The two sectional elements <b>53</b> are set opposite to one another and each one is associated to a respective bracket <b>54</b>, connected via longitudinal members <b>55</b> to the slide <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The arrangement described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref> is configured as a connecting rod-crank system, actuated by the gearmotor assembly <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, where the rotation of the connecting rod-crank system is approximately through 180° and occurs on a vertical plane parallel to the direction of displacement of the slide <b>42</b> and hence of the guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>carried thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates the case of a gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the open condition, i.e., in which the guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>are aligned to the guides <b>4</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In said condition, each end of the levers <b>50</b>, which bear the wheels <b>52</b>, faces the side opposite to the slide <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>is to be brought into the respective closed condition, the gearmotor assembly <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> is actuated. Rotation in a clockwise direction of the shaft <b>49</b> of the gearmotor <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> brings about the angular movement of the levers <b>50</b>, substantially through 180°, and hence sliding of the wheels <b>52</b> within the sectional guide elements <b>53</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), which in turn brings about a consequent push on the brackets <b>54</b> connected to the slide <b>42</b> and hence movement of the latter away with respect to the gearmotor assembly <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, until the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is reached. As may be appreciated, the sliding of the slide <b>42</b> on the respective sectional guide elements <b>41</b> brings about translation of the guide portions <b>4</b><i>a </i>that support the gate <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which thus reaches the respective closed condition. In said closed condition, the gate is clamped mechanically in the operative position, which is necessary for execution of the welding operations on the station <b>1</b>, with means in themselves known.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">To bring the gate <b>3</b><i>a </i>back into the open condition a reverse sequence with respect to the one just described will be followed, and thus the gate will be released mechanically from its operative position, and the gearmotor <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> will be actuated in a direction opposite to the previous one, thus bringing the slide <b>42</b> with the guide portions <b>41</b>, and hence the gate <b>3</b><i>a</i>, back into the condition represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The system of course envisages two arrangements of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-26</figref>, each set on a respective side of the welding station <b>1</b> with respect to the conveying line <b>2</b> of the motor-vehicle bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Finally, it is evident that all of the operations previously described with reference to the operation of the system according to the invention are controlled automatically, under the supervision of an appropriate central control unit, of a type in itself known to the person skilled in the branch.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Of course, without prejudice to the principle of the invention, the details of construction and the embodiments may vary widely with respect to what is described and illustrated herein purely by way of example.</p>
