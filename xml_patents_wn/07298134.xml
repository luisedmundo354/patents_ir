<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to electrical-energy meters, also referred to as ‚Äúwatt-hour meters‚Äù or ‚Äúpower meters,‚Äù for measuring consumption of electrical power. More particularly, the invention relates to optical communications between electrical-energy meters and external devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The reading of electrical-energy meters has historically been accomplished with human meter readers who visit a customer's premises and manually document relevant information from the meter. Such readings have usually been limited to information regarding the electrical consumption of the customer. Over time, manual meter reading has been enhanced or eliminated through the use of meter reading systems. In one example of a meter reading system, a probe is held in proximity to and communicates with the meter. The communication between the probe and the meter is two way and involves an exchange of information beyond just the electrical consumption of the consumer. Today, for example, diagnostic information can be communicated by the meter reading system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Information between an electrical-energy meter and a probe or other external device may be exchanged by two-way, optically isolated communications. In such cases, the electrical-energy meter will have an optical port with an optical transmitter and an optical receiver that communicate with the external device through a respective optical receiver and optical transmitter of the external device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various styles of optical ports have been developed for electrical-energy meters. One style was developed in North America in conformity with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Another style was developed in Europe in conformity with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ANSI optical port and the IEC optical port differ in a few significant ways. First, the transmitter and receiver on an ANSI optical port are positioned in an opposite manner from the transmitter and receiver on an IEC optical port. In particular, when facing an ANSI optical port on an electrical-energy meter, the transmit channel is on the right and the receive channel is on the left. When facing an IEC optical port, by contrast, the transmit channel is on the left and the receive channel is on the right. A second significant way in which ANSI and IEC optical ports differ is the mechanical interface between the electrical-energy meter and the external device. For example, though not required under IEC, an IEC optical port commonly may have a number of small posts that are used to help align and hold a probe of the external device in place for the communication exchange. A typical ANSI optical port does not have such posts. An ANSI optical port, however, has a ‚ÄúD‚Äù shape and protrudes from the face of the meter whereas an IEC optical port is generally flush with the cover of the meter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electrical-energy meter manufacturers have produced meter designs corresponding to the industry standard prevalent to the particular geographical area. This has led to the production and distribution of external devices configured to correspond to the electrical-energy meters. For example, in North America, external devices are configured to correspond to ANSI electrical-energy meters. In Europe, external devices are configured to correspond to IEC electrical-energy meters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As manufacturers desire to increase market share while selling a single electric-energy meter design throughout the world, there is a need to provide a single electrical-energy meter design such that the meter is able to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with various industry standards, such as ANSI and IEC.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the invention is an electrical-energy meter, comprising a base for mounting the meter, a transformer mechanically coupled to the base for producing an electrical output proportional to an electrical current in a conductor of electrical energy, a circuit board electrically coupled to the transformer for calculating and displaying a cumulative amount of electrical energy passing through the conductor of electrical energy, a first and second optical transmitter and an optical receiver electrically coupled to the circuit board, wherein the first optical transmitter and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a first type of external device, and wherein the second optical transmitter and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a second type of external device. The first type of device may be constructed in accordance with the standard ANSI C12.10-1997 published by the American National Standards Institute, and the second type of device may be constructed in accordance with the standard IEC 62056-21 (2002) published by the International Electrotechnical Commission.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an alternative embodiment, the electrical-energy meter may comprise a base for mounting the electrical-energy meter, a transformer mechanically coupled to the base for producing an electrical output proportional to an electrical current in a conductor of electrical energy, a circuit board electrically coupled to the transformer for calculating and displaying a cumulative amount of electrical energy passing through the conductor of electrical energy, and a first and a second optical receiver and an optical transmitter electrically coupled to the circuit board, wherein the first optical receiver and the transmitter facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a first type of external device, and wherein the second optical receiver and the transmitter facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a second type of external device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further embodiment, a template for a cover for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a base having a first and a second through hole, wherein the first through hole may substantially align with a first optical transmitter of an electrical-energy meter, the second through hole may substantially align with an optical receiver of the electrical-energy meter, and the template base covers a second optical transmitter of the electrical-energy meter when the template base is attached to the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an alternative embodiment, a cover system for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a cover for attaching to the meter, the cover allowing optical access to a first and a second optical transmitter and to a receiver from a position external to the meter, a template which comprises a base having a first and a second through hole formed therein, wherein the first through hole substantially aligns with one of the first and second optical transmitters of the meter, the second through hole substantially aligns with the optical receiver of the meter, and the base covers the other of the first and second optical transmitters when the template is attached to the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an alternative embodiment, a cover for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a first optical conduit, a second optical conduit in optical communication with the first optical conduit, and a third optical conduit, wherein the cover is capable of being attached to an electrical-energy meter, and wherein the cover is capable of receiving at least one of a first template for configuring the electrical-energy meter to communicate optically with a first type of external device and a second template for configuring the meter to communicate optically with a second type of external device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention may also include a method of configuring an electrical-energy meter for communication with an external device, comprising selecting an electrical-energy meter comprising two optical transmitters, and one receiver, wherein the meter is capable of being configured to communicate with an external device, selecting a preconfigured template that covers one of the transmitters when the template is attached to the electrical-energy meter so that the other of the transmitters and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and external device, and attaching the selected template to the electrical-energy meter so that the template's through holes are substantially aligned, respectively, with the electrical-energy meter's optical receiver and one of the electrical-energy meter's optical transmitters, and so that the electrical-energy meter's optical transmitter that is not substantially aligned with a template through-hole is blocked or covered-over by the template.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An example embodiment of an electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. The electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> is described in detail for example purposes only, as the various features of the present invention can be incorporated into other types of electrical-energy meters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> comprises a cover <b>20</b> and optical templates <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>). Cover <b>20</b> as well as optical templates <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> can be used in conjunction with virtually any type of electrical-energy meter, including electrical-energy meters of the electromechanical type. Additionally, electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> is a round shape consistent with electrical-energy meters constructed in accordance with ANSI. The invention, however, is not limited to such electrical-energy meters and may be used with electrical-energy meters constructed in accordance with other industry standards as well.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> comprises a base <b>12</b>, a current sensor assembly <b>15</b>, a current transformer <b>26</b>, a circuit board <b>38</b>, an inner housing <b>18</b>, an optical port <b>100</b>, and a cover <b>20</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Base <b>12</b> is preferably molded from a reinforced thermoplastic material having the requisite mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, flammability rating, UV stabilization, and resistance to common solvents such as insecticides and cleaning solutions. An example of such thermoplastic material is polyketone, polycarbonate, or polybutylene terephthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Current sensor assembly <b>15</b> and the current transformer <b>26</b> can be mounted or coupled either directly or indirectly on base <b>12</b>. Alternatively, electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> may use other current sensing techniques such as a shunt, a linear coupler (e.g., a Rogowski coil), a sensor to multiply voltage times a magnetic field (e.g., a Hall effect sensor), or a magnetic field sensor including an optical and semiconductor sensor. A circuit board <b>38</b> can be electrically coupled to current transformer <b>26</b>. Circuit board <b>38</b> also receives an input or line voltage, i.e., a voltage corresponding to the voltage in the electrical-energy line (not depicted) to which electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> is connected. Circuit board <b>38</b> is adapted to calculate the total (cumulative) watt-hours of power that have passed through electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> over time based on the current and voltage input, using techniques and components commonly known to those skilled in the field of electrical-energy meter design. Circuit board <b>38</b> continually updates the cumulative watt-hours, and may be displayed on an LCD <b>40</b>, which is mounted on inner housing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Inner housing <b>18</b> is preferably molded from a reinforced thermoplastic material such as polyketone, polycarbonate, or polybutylene terephthalate and includes a substantially flat front face <b>19</b>. Front face <b>19</b> of inner housing <b>18</b> includes LCD <b>40</b> and a nameplate holder <b>70</b>. Nameplate holder <b>70</b> is located below LCD <b>40</b> on front face <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Cover <b>20</b> has a substantially transparent end <b>21</b> that provides visual access to LCD <b>40</b>. Cover <b>20</b> includes a flange portion <b>22</b>. A gasket <b>23</b> is positioned between flange portion <b>22</b> and base <b>12</b> to substantially seal the interface between cover <b>20</b> and base <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further details relating to electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> (other than optical port <b>100</b> and cover <b>20</b>) are not necessary for an understanding of the invention, and therefore are not presented herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optical port <b>100</b> may be formed on front face <b>19</b> of inner cover <b>18</b> and may be optically coupled to circuit board <b>38</b>. Optical port <b>100</b> facilitates optical communication between electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> and external devices (not shown). The term ‚Äúexternal device‚Äù as used throughout the specification and claims means a device located outside of the electrical-energy meter with which the electrical-energy meter communicates. Optical port <b>100</b> enables service personnel to read, test, and calibrate electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> without removing inner housing <b>18</b> or cover <b>20</b> and without exposing service personnel to high voltages within electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>. As discussed below, although optical port <b>100</b> is shown configured to allow electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI, optical port <b>100</b> can also be configured to enable electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with other types of external devices.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example embodiment of inner cover <b>18</b> and, in particular, optical port <b>100</b>. Optical port <b>100</b> is shown on inner cover <b>18</b>, along LCD <b>40</b> but without nameplate holder <b>70</b> attached. Optical port <b>100</b> includes an optical receiver <b>102</b> located in between two optical transmitters <b>101</b> and <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The relative locations of optical receiver <b>102</b> and optical transmitters <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> form a port that enables electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with external devices (not shown) that are constructed in accordance with ANSI, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and other industry standards. For example, for compatibility with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI, transmitter <b>103</b> is located to the right of receiver <b>102</b> consistent with prior art electrical-energy meters constructed with optical ports capable of communicating with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI. Also for example, transmitter <b>101</b> is located to the left of receiver <b>102</b> consistent with prior art electrical-energy meters constructed with optical ports capable of communicating with external devices constructed in accordance with IEC.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, it should be noted that optical port <b>100</b> can alternatively be constructed to include a transmitter <b>101</b> located between two receivers <b>102</b>. Because transmitters are generally less expensive than receivers and are easier to use (from a circuitry point of view), the preferred embodiment is equipped with two transmitters and one receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an example embodiment of a cover system of the electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>. The cover system includes cover <b>20</b> and inner cover <b>18</b>. Cover <b>20</b> covers inner cover <b>18</b>. Inner cover <b>18</b>, in turn, covers circuit board <b>38</b>, etc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Cover flange <b>22</b> may mate with the base <b>12</b> and, in conjunction with gasket <b>23</b>, seal electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optical port <b>100</b> and, more specifically, transmitters <b>101</b> and <b>103</b> and receiver <b>102</b>, are viewed through holes in cover <b>20</b>. Cover <b>20</b> also includes template fastening holes <b>105</b> used for attaching an optical template (not shown) to cover <b>20</b>. In an alternative embodiment, deformable posts may be used instead of template fastening holes <b>105</b> such that holes in a template (not shown) may align with the deformable posts, and, when the template is placed on cover <b>20</b>, the posts may be deformed by pressure from, for example, a hammer, such that the template is held in place. LCD <b>40</b>, nameplate holder <b>70</b>, a nameplate (not shown), and the remainder of inner cover front face <b>19</b> are viewed through transparent end <b>21</b> of cover <b>20</b>. Additionally, cover <b>20</b> includes posts <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> that protrude from the surface of cover <b>20</b>. Posts <b>106</b>. <b>107</b> are located to align with an optical probe that is configured to communicate with IEC devices. The posts help align the optical probe with optical port <b>100</b>. These posts are not required by IEC, but they are commonly used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an example embodiment of an optical template <b>200</b> in accordance with the invention. When attached to electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>, ANSI optical template <b>200</b> enables electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI. Optical template <b>200</b> includes a plate <b>205</b> with two through holes <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> that align, respectively, with receiver <b>102</b> and transmitter <b>103</b> on optical port <b>100</b>. Plate <b>205</b> can also include posts <b>206</b>. The ends of posts <b>206</b> can be deformed to attach plate <b>205</b> to template <b>200</b>. Optical template <b>200</b> may include an extended area <b>207</b> that physically covers transmitter <b>101</b>, thereby inhibiting transmitter <b>101</b> from optically communicating with external devices. In other words, transmitter <b>103</b> and receiver <b>102</b> can communicate with external devices when optical template <b>200</b> is installed, while transmitter <b>101</b> cannot. Optical template <b>200</b> can also include attaching holes <b>208</b> that substantially align with template fastening holes <b>105</b> of cover <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for screwing or otherwise fastening optical template <b>200</b> to cover <b>20</b>. It should be noted that a raised portion <b>209</b> of optical template <b>200</b> covers post <b>106</b> on cover <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The posts can be used to facilitate holding an IEC-compatible probe to the optical port and may be covered when configuring the optical port <b>100</b> for communication with an ANSI device. Likewise, a raised area <b>210</b> on the optical template <b>200</b> covers post <b>107</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Optical template <b>200</b> is preferably constructed from ferromagnetic material so that an external device or probe containing a magnet can be more easily optically connected with ANSI optical template <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an example embodiment of the electrical-energy meter's cover system configured to enable electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with ANSI-compatible external devices (not shown). Optical template <b>200</b> is shown attached to optical port <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) using fasteners <b>110</b> through attaching holes <b>208</b>. ANSI optical template <b>200</b> leaves exposed receiver <b>102</b> and transmitter <b>103</b>, and physically covers transmitter <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts optical template <b>300</b>. When attached to electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>, optical template <b>300</b> enables electrical-energy meter <b>10</b> to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with IEC. Optical template <b>300</b> includes a plate <b>305</b> with two holes <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> that align, respectively, with transmitter <b>101</b> and receiver <b>102</b> on optical port <b>100</b>. Optical template <b>300</b> includes an extended area <b>307</b> that physically covers and thereby inhibits transmitter <b>103</b> from optically communicating with external devices. Optical template may also include attaching holes <b>308</b> that substantially align with template fastening holes <b>105</b> of cover <b>20</b> for screwing or otherwise fastening optical template <b>300</b> to cover <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optical template <b>300</b> may also include posts <b>309</b> for facilitating alignment of the external device with IEC optical template <b>300</b> during the connection of the external device to electrical-energy meter <b>10</b>. In an alternative embodiment, optical template <b>300</b> may not have posts <b>309</b>. Instead, posts <b>106</b> may be molded as part of cover <b>20</b> of meter <b>10</b>. In the preferred embodiment of optical template <b>300</b>, the template is constructed from ferromagnetic material so that an external device or probe (not shown) containing a magnet may be more easily optically connected to optical template <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts the cover system configured to communicate with IEC-compatible external devices (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts the elements described in the description of the cover system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> except that transmitter <b>103</b> is not shown. In addition to the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts optical template <b>300</b> attached to optical port <b>100</b> using fasteners <b>110</b>. Optical template <b>300</b> physically covers transmitter <b>103</b> but not transmitter <b>101</b> or receiver <b>102</b>. In other words, transmitter <b>101</b> and receiver <b>102</b> can communicate with external devices when the optical template <b>300</b> is installed, while transmitter <b>103</b> cannot.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The invention therefore may be an electrical-energy meter capable of communicating with external devices regardless of whether those external devices are constructed in accordance with the American National Standards Institute, the International Electrotechnical Commission, or other industry standards. The invention enables the distribution of electrical-energy meters to more markets without limitations based on the norms in those markets regarding the configuration of external devices with which the electrical-energy meter will communicate.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exploded view of an alternative embodiment of an electrical-energy meter <b>410</b>. The electrical-energy meter <b>410</b> can be constructed in accordance with IEC.

An optical conduit <b>623</b> may be coupled to optical conduit <b>621</b> through use of, for example, a fused biconic taper <b>624</b> of the type commonly known to those skilled in the art of designing or manufacturing fiber-optic cable systems. The use of fused biconic taper <b>624</b> is disclosed for exemplary purposes only. Other types of optical taps can be used to couple transmission conduits <b>621</b> and <b>623</b> in alternative embodiments. Optical conduits <b>621</b> and <b>623</b> carry or facilitate the transmission of signals from optical transmitter <b>521</b>. Such optical conduits could be clear tubes or optical cables, for example. Optical templates such as optical template <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or optical template <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), for example, can therefore be attached to optical port cover <b>691</b> and enable electrical-energy meter <b>510</b> to communicate, respectively, with external ANSI-compatible or IEC compatible devices.</p>
