<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to materials processing, and more particularly, to a method and integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor used to process a substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Manufacturing of integrated circuits includes deposition of various materials onto patterned substrates such as silicon wafers. These materials include metal and metal-containing layers, for example diffusion barriers/liners to prevent diffusion of copper (Cu) conducting layers into dielectric materials and seed layers to promote adhesion and growth of the Cu layers onto the substrate. As the minimum feature sizes of patterned substrates continue to shrink, deposition processes are required that can provide advanced layers onto high-aspect ratio structures at sufficiently low temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has seen increasing use for preparation of coatings and thin layers in semiconductor wafer processing. CVD is a favored deposition method in many respects, for example, because of its ability to provide highly conformal and high quality layers at relatively fast processing times. Further, CVD is beneficial in depositing layers on substrates of irregular shapes including the provision of highly conformal layers even with respect to deep contacts and other openings. In general, CVD techniques involve the delivery of gaseous precursors (reactants) to the surface of a substrate where chemical reactions take place under temperature and pressure conditions that are favorable to the thermodynamics of the desired reaction. The type and composition of layers that can be formed using CVD can be affected by the ability to deliver the reactants or reactant precursors to the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order for the device manufacturing process to be practical, the deposition processes need to be carried out in a reasonable amount of time. This requirement can necessitate efficient delivery of a precursor containing a metal element from a metal precursor vaporization system to a process chamber containing the substrate(s) to be processed. A common problem encountered in the deposition of metals and metal-containing materials by CVD techniques are low deposition rates onto a substrate due to low vapor pressure of the metal-containing precursor and the transport issues associated therewith, thereby making the deposition process impractical. A low vapor pressure can limit the flow of the metal-containing precursor from the metal precursor vaporization system through gas lines to a process chamber of a deposition system where a substrate is exposed to the metal-containing precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The delivery of metal-containing precursors in CVD processing can be carried out using the sublimator/bubbler method where the precursor is usually placed in a metal precursor vaporization system that is then heated to transform the precursor into a gaseous compound (vapor), which is then transported into the process chamber, often using a carrier gas. However, this procedure has not been able to reliably and reproducibly deliver the precursor to the process chamber for a number of reasons. The major problems with the technique are centered on the inability to consistently vaporize a solid precursor at a controlled rate such that a reproducible flow of precursor vapor can be delivered to the process chamber. Also, it is difficult to ensure complete saturation of the fast moving carrier gas stream because of the limited amount of exposed surface area of the solid precursor in the metal precursor vaporization system and a lack of uniform temperature to provide maximum sublimation/evaporation. In addition, the temperature to which the solid precursor can be heated to provide adequate vapor pressure can be limited by premature decomposition of the precursor at that temperature. Decomposition or partial reaction of the solid precursor in the metal precursor vaporization system can further complicate the precursor delivery due to low or negligible vapor pressure of the partially reacted precursor compared to the un-reacted (fresh) precursor. In addition, a metal-containing precursor may contain metal-containing particulates that may be transferred to the process chamber and can accumulate on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, the presence of metal-containing impurities in metal-containing precursors may require purifying the precursor prior to processing substrates. Current separation methods include dissolving the un-reacted precursor using a liquid solvent (e.g., acetone, toluene, etc) and filtering the metal-containing impurities from the solvent. This method commonly require long process times and large amounts of the solvent due to low solubility of the metal-containing impurities in the solvent.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the invention provide a method and integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor used to process a substrate, including a process of depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate. An as-received or used (old) metal carbonyl precursor can contain metal-containing impurities, including partially reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing particulate impurities such as metal particles. The purified metal carbonyl precursor contains significantly lower amounts of the metal-containing impurities, thereby allowing efficient delivery of a high purity metal carbonyl precursor and deposition of metal or metal-containing layers with low amounts of metal-containing impurities. Embodiments of the invention can include various metal carbonyl precursors with the general formula M<sub>x</sub>(CO)<sub>y</sub>. The metal carbonyls include, but are not limited to, W(CO)<sub>6</sub>, Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>, Rh<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, Re<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>, Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>, Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, and Os<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment of the invention, the method includes providing a metal carbonyl precursor containing un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing impurities in a metal precursor vaporization chamber containing a precursor collection plate such that the metal carbonyl precursor is spaced from the precursor collection plate, evacuating the metal precursor vaporization chamber, pressurizing the metal precursor vaporization chamber with a CO-containing gas, vaporizing the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor, and condensing the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor as a purified metal carbonyl precursor on the precursor collection plate, whereby at least a portion of the metal-containing impurities remain spaced from the precursor collection plate.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the current invention provide a method and integrated system for purifying and delivery of a metal carbonyl precursor used to process a substrate in a deposition system. Exemplary deposition systems can include, for example, any of the deposition systems described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/996,145, entitled METHOD FOR INCREASING DEPOSITION RATES OF METAL LAYERS FROM METAL-CARBONYL PRECURSORS, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/996,144, entitled METHOD AND DEPOSITION SYSTEM FOR INCREASING DEPOSITION RATES OF METAL LAYERS FROM METAL-CARBONYL PRECURSORS, each filed Nov. 23, 2004 and the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to embodiments of the invention, the metal carbonyl precursor can, for example, have the general formula M<sub>x</sub>(CO)<sub>y </sub>(where M is a metal, CO is carbon monoxide, and x and y are integers). The metal carbonyl precursor can include a tungsten carbonyl, a nickel carbonyl, a molybdenum carbonyl, a cobalt carbonyl, a rhodium carbonyl, a rhenium carbonyl, a chromium carbonyl, a ruthenium carbonyl, or an osmium carbonyl, or a combination of two or more thereof. These metal carbonyls can include, but are not limited to, W(CO)<sub>6</sub>, Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>, Rh<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, Re<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>, Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>, Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, or Os<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, or a combination of two or more thereof. In general, the metal carbonyl precursor can be any precursor that contains a metal atom and a CO group.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/095,448, entitled “METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR REFURBISHING A METAL-CARBONYL PRECURSOR,” filed Mar. 31, 2005, describes that partial decomposition of a metal carbonyl precursor (e.g., Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>) can contribute to the inability to provide a reproducible flow of un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor vapor to a process chamber for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate. A fresh metal carbonyl precursor can, over time, partially decompose to form a partially decomposed precursor (e.g., M<sub>x</sub>(CO)<sub>y−z</sub>, where z≧1). Since the un-reacted precursor and partially decomposed precursor can have different vapor pressures, the precursor vapor cannot be reliably and reproducibly sublimated/evaporated in the metal precursor vaporization chamber and delivered to the process chamber. In addition, metal carbonyl precursors can contain expensive precious metals, thus requiring that the partially reacted precursor be separated from the un-reacted precursor and recycled for producing a fresh precursor batch.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/238,501, entitled “METHOD FOR PURIFYING A METAL-CARBONYL PRECURSOR,” filed Sep. 28, 2005, describes how the use of an as-received (from a chemical supplier) metal carbonyl precursor containing un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing impurities in a heated metal precursor vaporization chamber can contribute to the inability to provide a reproducible flow of un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor vapor to a process chamber for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer with low particle counts on a substrate. In one example, as-received ruthenium carbonyl precursor can contain partially decomposed Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>and Ru metal particulates. In this example, the as-received Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor can be highly pure with respect to total Ru content but not with respect to un-reacted Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>. In another example, the metal particulate impurity can contain a different metal than found in the metal carbonyl precursor, for example Fe particulate impurity in a solid Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor. In general, the metal particulate impurity can contain any metal or metal-containing material (e.g., metal oxide, metal nitride, metal carbide), including, but not limited to, transition metals, alkali metals, and alkali earth metals. The metal particulate impurities can be non-volatile or have low volatility compared to the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor, but it was observed that when a carrier gas was flowed through the metal precursor vaporization chamber, a significant number of the metal particulate impurities were transferred to the process chamber along with the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>vapor, resulting in unacceptably high levels of accumulated metal particulate impurities on a substrate during processing in the process chamber. As is well known to those skilled in the art of manufacturing of integrated circuits, the presence of metal particulate impurities on the substrate can destroy devices formed from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the invention provide a practical and efficient method and system for separating any metal-containing impurities from the as-received metal carbonyl precursor prior to processing a substrate in a deposition system. According to one embodiment of the invention, the metal carbonyl precursor can be solid ruthenium carbonyl precursor Ru<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>12</sub>. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, embodiments of the invention are not limited to the use of Ru<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>12</sub>, as other ruthenium carbonyl and metal carbonyl precursors may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description, in order to facilitate a thorough understanding of the invention and for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as a particular geometry of the integrated system and descriptions of various components. However, it should be understood that the invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> each depict a schematic view of an integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor according to an embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the integrated system <b>100</b> contains a metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> containing lower section <b>110</b><i>a </i>and upper section <b>110</b><i>b</i>. The lower section <b>110</b><i>a </i>is configured for accommodating in a lower portion <b>111</b> thereof a precursor tray <b>112</b> containing a metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>. Alternately, the precursor tray <b>112</b> may be omitted and the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> placed on the bottom of the lower section <b>110</b><i>a </i>without using the precursor tray <b>112</b>. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> may be positioned in any desired manner in the lower portion <b>111</b> of the vaporization chamber <b>110</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the precursor tray <b>112</b> may contain an array of trays. The integrated system <b>100</b> is coupled to a deposition system <b>150</b> through precursor delivery lines <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> having a valve <b>140</b> therebetween, where the deposition system <b>150</b> is configured for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate from a vapor of the metal carbonyl precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to facilitate vaporization of the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>, the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> is coupled to a chamber temperature control system <b>162</b> configured for controlling the temperature of the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>. The terms “vaporization”, “sublimation” and “evaporation” are used interchangeably herein to refer to the general formation of a vapor (gas) from a solid precursor, regardless of whether the transformation is, for example, from solid to liquid to gas, or solid to gas.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a vacuum pumping system <b>116</b> is configured for evacuating the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> via evacuation line <b>115</b> to a pressure between about 0.1 mTorr and about 760 Torr. In one example, the pressure can be between about 10 mTorr and about 500 mTorr. A gas supply system <b>118</b> is configured to pressurize the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> by flowing a carbon-monoxide-containing (CO-containing) gas into the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> via gas feed line <b>119</b>. The flow of the CO-containing gas can be controlled using a mass flow controller (MFC) (not shown) coupled to the gas feed line <b>119</b> between the gas supply system <b>118</b> and the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>. According to embodiments of the invention, the CO-containing gas contains CO and optionally a carrier gas that can contain an inert gas such as N<sub>2 </sub>or a noble gas, for example argon (Ar). According to one embodiment of the invention, the CO-containing gas may be pure CO gas. Although not shown, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the integrated system <b>100</b> schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> can be configured with any number of valves, regulators, pressure gauges, and/or flow meters for measuring and controlling a flow of the CO-containing gas and monitoring the gas pressure in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is mounted above and spaced from lower portion <b>111</b>, and specifically from the precursor tray <b>112</b> when present, for condensing vapor of the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor from the precursor tray <b>112</b>. The precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is coupled to a vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> via heating/cooling line <b>122</b> for controlling the temperature of the precursor collection plate <b>120</b>. The vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> can, for example, be capable of controlling the temperature of the precursor collection plate <b>120</b> between about 0° C. and about 150° C., or between about 20° C. and about 90° C. Exemplary precursor collection plate designs are described below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A control system <b>160</b> is configured to operate, and to control the operation of, the integrated system <b>100</b>. The control system <b>160</b> includes a microprocessor, a memory, and a digital I/O port capable of generating control voltages sufficient to communicate with and activate inputs of the integrated system <b>100</b> as well as monitor outputs from the integrated system <b>100</b>. Moreover, the control system <b>160</b> is coupled to and exchanges information with the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>, the vacuum pumping system <b>116</b>, the gas supply system <b>118</b>, the chamber temperature control system <b>162</b>, the vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b>, and the valve <b>140</b>. A program stored in the memory is utilized to control the aforementioned components of integrated system <b>100</b> according to a stored process recipe. The control system <b>160</b> may be implemented as a general-purpose computer, digital signal process, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The control system <b>160</b> may be locally located relative to the integrated system <b>100</b> or it may be remotely located relative to the integrated system <b>100</b> via the internet or an intranet.

The control system <b>160</b> may be coupled to an intranet at a customer site (i.e., a device maker, etc.), or coupled to an intranet at a vendor site (i.e., an equipment manufacturer). Furthermore, another computer (i.e., controller, server, etc.) can access the control system <b>160</b> to exchange data via at least one of a direct connection, an intranet, or the internet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Metal precursor vaporization chambers utilized for providing Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>vapor have contemplated operating within a temperature range of approximately 40° C. to 45° C. for Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor under vacuum conditions in order to prevent decomposition, which occurs at higher temperatures. For example, Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>can decompose at elevated temperatures to form by-products, such as those illustrated below:

thereby forming a mixture of Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>x</sub>, and possibly Ru metal in the metal precursor vaporization chamber. The low vapor pressure of Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>and the small process window, can result in a very low deposition rate of a Ru layer on a substrate in a deposition system. In the above-mentioned co-pending applications, it was realized that a CO-containing gas may be used to reduce dissociation of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor, thereby allowing for heating the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor to a high temperature (e.g., 80° C., or higher), which increases the vapor pressure of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor without significant decomposition of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor vapor during vaporization.
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments of the current invention, a CO-containing gas is utilized to effectively vaporize and separate un-reacted Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>from Ru-containing and non-Ru-containing impurities in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>. Further, the use of a CO-containing gas reduces dissociation of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor, thereby shifting the equilibrium in Equation (1) to the left and reducing premature decomposition of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor while allowing for heating the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor to higher temperature in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> than is possible without a CO-containing gas. It is believed that addition of the CO gas to the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor vapor allows for increasing the vaporization temperature from approximately 40° C. to approximately 150° C., or higher. The elevated temperature increases the vapor pressure of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor, resulting in increased vaporization of the Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12 </sub>precursor <b>114</b> from the precursor tray <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the vaporized metal carbonyl precursor may be condensed as a purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>on the precursor collection plate <b>120</b>, which is kept at lower temperature than the precursor tray <b>112</b> and the walls of the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>. To state another way, the precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is maintained at a condensation temperature that is less than the temperature used to vaporize the metal carbonyl precursor, i.e., vaporization temperature. When the transfer of the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor from the precursor tray <b>112</b> to the precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is complete, a metal-containing impurity layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>containing partially reacted metal carbonyl precursor and any metal particulate impurities remains on the precursor tray <b>112</b>. After the purifying process, the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be vaporized by increasing the temperature of the precursor collection plate <b>120</b> from the condensation temperature to a vaporization temperature, and the vapor is then delivered to the deposition system <b>150</b> to be utilized for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate in the deposition system <b>150</b>. When the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>has been spent, the substrate processing may be stopped and the precursor tray <b>112</b> removed from metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> for cleaning and a new batch of metal carbonyl precursor provided in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>208</b>, the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is vaporized by heating the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> to a predetermined vaporization temperature that enables vaporization of the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>210</b>, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is condensed as a purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>on the precursor collection plate <b>120</b>.

Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in step <b>502</b>, a metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> containing un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing impurities is provided in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> containing a first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> and a second precursor collection plate <b>130</b> such that the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> is spaced from the first and second precursor collection plates <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> and the second collection plate <b>130</b> is spaced from the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>504</b>, the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> is evacuated through the evacuation line <b>115</b> by the vacuum pumping system <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>506</b>, the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> is pressurized with a CO-containing gas that is flowed from the gas supply system <b>118</b> through the gas line <b>119</b> into the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> until a predetermined gas pressure is obtained in the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>508</b>, the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is vaporized by heating the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> to a predetermined vaporization temperature that enables vaporization of the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step <b>510</b>, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is condensed as a purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>on the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b>. The first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is maintained at a condensation temperature that is lower than the vaporization temperature for the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>. The condensation temperature is maintained by the vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> in order to adsorb and condense the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>onto the surfaces of the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b>. In one example, the condensation temperature of the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> can be maintained at a temperature that is at least about 20° C. lower than the vaporization temperature of the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>. In another example, the temperature of the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> can be maintained between about 0° C. and about 40° C., for example about 15° C.

At least a portion of the partially reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal particulate impurities remain as impurity layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>on precursor tray <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, in step <b>512</b>, the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>is vaporized by heating the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> from the condensation temperature to a predetermined vaporization temperature that enables vaporization. The vaporization temperature for the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be the same or different than the vaporization temperature used for the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> may be heated to a temperature between about 40° C. and about 150° C., or a temperature between about 80° C. and about 90° C.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>514</b>, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the vaporized purified metal carbonyl precursor is condensed as a further purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>130</b><i>a </i>on the second precursor collection plate <b>130</b>. The second precursor collection plate <b>130</b> is maintained at a condensation temperature that is lower than the vaporization temperature to which the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> is heated, for example at least about 20° C. lower. The respective temperatures of the first and second precursor collection plates <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are separately adjustable and are maintained by the vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> in order to adsorb and condense the further purified metal precursor <b>130</b><i>a </i>onto the surfaces of the second precursor collection plate <b>130</b>. In one example, the condensation temperature of the second precursor collection plate <b>130</b> can be maintained between about 0° C. and about 40° C., for example 15° C., by the vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b>. When the vaporization of the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>from the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b> to the second precursor collection plate <b>130</b> is complete, a metal-containing impurity <b>120</b><i>b </i>may remain on the first precursor collection plate <b>120</b>.</p>

In particular, the precursor collection plate <b>130</b> may be heated to vaporize the further purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>130</b><i>a </i>and a process gas containing the vapor of the further purified metal carbonyl precursor may be delivered by flowing a carrier gas containing CO through the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> to the deposition system <b>150</b> to process a substrate. According to one embodiment of the invention, the carrier gas contains CO and optionally an inert gas such as N<sub>2 </sub>or a noble gas, for example argon (Ar).

In one example, the precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>, and the first and second precursor collection plates <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> may be maintained at the same temperature. In the exemplary case of Ru<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>, a temperature between about 80° C. and about 90° C. may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> each depict a schematic view of an integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor according to yet another embodiment of the invention. The integrated system <b>102</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> is similar to the integrated systems <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>. The integrated system <b>102</b> contains a precursor collection plate <b>132</b> for purifying a metal carbonyl precursor. Although only one precursor collection plate <b>132</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>, any number and designs of precursor collection plates may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. The integrated system <b>102</b> contains a vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> for controlling the temperature of the precursor collection plate <b>132</b> through heating/cooling line <b>125</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, lower portion <b>111</b> of metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>, which contains the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> in precursor tray <b>112</b>, is physically separated from an upper portion <b>131</b> of metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>, which contains the precursor collection plate <b>132</b>, by an intermediate partition <b>110</b><i>c</i>. Further, the precursor collection plate <b>132</b> is pneumatically coupled to the precursor tray <b>112</b> by a valve <b>124</b> in intermediate partition <b>110</b><i>c </i>that allows for passing vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor through partition <b>110</b><i>c </i>during the purifying process and for isolating the impurity layer <b>114</b><i>a </i>in precursor tray <b>112</b> from the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>132</b><i>a </i>following the purifying process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, and with valve <b>124</b> in an open position, un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is vaporized by heating the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> to a predetermined vaporization temperature that enables vaporization of the metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b>, and the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor is condensed as a purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>132</b><i>a </i>on the precursor collection plate <b>132</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The precursor collection plate <b>132</b> is maintained at a condensation temperature that is lower than the vaporization temperature of metal carbonyl precursor <b>114</b> and lower than the temperature of the walls of the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b>, for example at least about 20° C. lower. The condensation temperature is maintained by the vaporization/condensation temperature control system <b>145</b> in order to adsorb and condense the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>132</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the purifying process, valve <b>124</b> is switched to a closed position, and the precursor collection plate <b>132</b> may be heated from the condensation temperature to a vaporization temperature to vaporize the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>132</b><i>a</i>. A process gas containing the vapor of the purified metal carbonyl precursor <b>132</b><i>a </i>formed by flowing a carrier gas containing CO from gas supply system <b>118</b> into the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> using the gas feed line <b>121</b>, and the process gas is delivered to the deposition system <b>150</b> to process a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In each of the embodiments shown and described, the metal precursor vaporization chamber <b>110</b> is depicted to receive the precursor <b>114</b> in the lower portion <b>111</b>, and the precursor collection plates <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are positioned above the lower portion <b>111</b>. It may be appreciated, however, that alternative orientations of the chamber <b>110</b>, precursor <b>114</b>, and plates <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are contemplated. For example, a precursor tray <b>112</b> may be mounted in an upper portion <b>131</b> of the chamber <b>110</b> and the precursor collection plate(s) <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> may be positioned below the precursor <b>114</b>. In another example, the precursor collection plate(s) <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> may be positioned in side-by-side relation to the precursor <b>114</b>. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the precursor collection plate(s) need only be spaced from the precursor <b>114</b>, in any manner, so as to enable partially reacted precursor and metal impurities <b>114</b><i>a </i>to remain in one position and the purified precursor <b>120</b><i>a </i>or <b>132</b><i>a </i>to condense in another position within the chamber <b>110</b>. Similarly, precursor collection plate <b>130</b> need only be spaced from precursor collection plate <b>120</b>, in any manner, so as to enable partially reacted precursor and metal impurities <b>120</b><i>b </i>to remain in one position and the further purified precursor <b>130</b><i>a </i>to condense in another position within the chamber <b>110</b>. Further, the delivery line <b>142</b> need not be coupled at the top of the chamber <b>110</b>, but rather, may be coupled at any desired location.</p>
