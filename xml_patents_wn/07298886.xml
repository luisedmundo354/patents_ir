<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to biological scaning systems for analysis of biological growth plates and detection of bacteria or other biological agents in food samples, laboratory samples, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Biological safety is a paramount concern in modem society. Testing for biological contamination in foods or other materials has become an important and often mandatory requirement for developers and distributors of food products. Biological testing is also used to identify bacteria or other agents in laboratory samples such as blood samples taken from medical patients, laboratory samples developed for experimental purposes, and other types of biological samples. Various techniques and devices can be utilized to improve biological testing and to streamline and standardize the biological testing process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wide variety of biological growth plates have been developed. As one example, biological growth plates have been developed by 3M Company (hereafter “3M”) of St. Paul, Minn. In particular, biological growth plates are sold by 3M under the trade name PETRIFILM plates. Biological growth plates can be utilized to facilitate the rapid growth and detection of bacteria or other biological agents commonly associated with food contamination, including, for example, aerobic bacteria, <i>E. coli</i>, coliform, enterobacteriaceae, yeast, mold, <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria, Campylobacter</i>, and the like. The use of PETRIFILM plates, or other growth media, can simplify bacterial testing of food samples.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Biological growth plates can be used to enumerate or identify the presence of bacteria so that corrective measures can be performed (in the case of food testing) or proper diagnosis can be made (in the case of medical use). In other applications, biological growth plates may be used to rapidly grow bacteria or other biological agents in laboratory samples, e.g., for experimental purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Biological scanning units refer to devices used to scan or count bacterial colonies, or the amount of a particular biological agent on a biological growth plate, or the like. For example, a food sample or laboratory sample can be placed on a biological growth plate, and then the plate can be inserted into an incubation chamber. After incubation, the biological growth plate can be placed into the biological scanning unit for automated detection and enumeration of bacterial growth. In this manner, biological scanning units automate the detection and enumeration of bacteria or other biological agents on a biological growth plate, and thereby improve the biological testing process by reducing human error.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, the invention is directed to techniques for counting biological agents on a biological growth plate or similar medium. To count biological agents, a biological growth plate is inserted into a biological scanning unit. Upon insertion of the biological growth plate, the biological scanning unit generates an image of the plate. Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either within the biological scanning unit or by an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. In accordance with the invention, a variety of counting rules are described that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention is directed to techniques for counting biological agents on a biological growth plate or similar medium. A variety of counting rules are described in greater detail below that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate. The counting rules are typically stored as computer-executable software instructions, and are executed by a processor in a biological scanning system. Alternatively, the rules may be implemented in hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or various hardware components. The various rules described herein may be applied individually, or in any combination depending on the growth medium being scanned. In any case, by applying one or more of the rules described herein, the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary biological scanning system <b>10</b> capable of implementing the counting rules described herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, biological scanning system <b>10</b> includes a scanning unit <b>12</b> having a drawer <b>14</b> that opens to receive a biological growth plate (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Drawer <b>14</b> moves the biological growth plate into scanning unit <b>12</b> for scanning and analysis. An imaging device and a processor reside within scanning unit <b>12</b>. When a biological growth plate is inserted into scanning unit <b>12</b> via drawer <b>14</b>, the imaging device generates one or more images of the growth plate. The images are then sent to the processor, which counts the number of biological agents on the growth medium via image analysis. In particular, the processor within scanning unit <b>12</b> invokes one or more counting rules, as described in greater detail below, that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Biological scanning system <b>10</b> also may include a display screen <b>16</b> disposed on scanning unit <b>12</b> to display the progress or results of analysis of the biological growth plate to a user. Alternatively or additionally, display screen <b>16</b> may present to a user an image of the growth plate scanned by scanning system <b>10</b>. The displayed image may be optically magnified or digitally scaled upward. A mounting platform <b>18</b> defines an ejection slot <b>20</b> through which the growth plate can be ejected following image capture by biological scanning system <b>10</b>. In other words, biological scanning system <b>10</b> may have a two-part design in which scanning unit <b>12</b> is mounted on mounting platform <b>18</b>. The two-part design is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for purposes of example, and is not intended to be required by or limiting of the inventions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Scanning unit <b>12</b> houses an imaging device for scanning the biological growth plate and generating an image. The imaging device may take the form of a line scanner or an area scanner, which ordinarily operates in combination with an illumination system to provide front and/or back illumination of the biological growth plate. In addition, scanning unit <b>12</b> may house processing hardware, software and/or firmware that performs analysis of the scanned image, e.g., in order to determine the number or amount of biological agents on the growth plate. For example, upon presentation of the biological growth plate via drawer <b>14</b>, the plate may be positioned adjacent an optical platen for scanning. Again, in accordance with the invention, various counting rules can be applied by a processor within scanning unit <b>12</b> in order to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When drawer <b>14</b> is opened following the scan of a growth plate, the growth plate may drop downward into the mounting platform <b>18</b> for ejection via ejection slot <b>20</b>. To that end, mounting platform <b>18</b> may house a conveyor that ejects the growth plate from scanning unit <b>12</b> via ejection slot <b>20</b>. In other words, after a biological growth plate is inserted into drawer <b>14</b>, moved into scanning unit <b>12</b>, and scanned, the biological growth plate drops downward into mounting platform <b>18</b>, where a horizontal conveyor, such as a moving belt, ejects the medium via slot <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of another biological scanning system <b>20</b> capable of implementing the counting rules described herein. Biological scanning system <b>20</b> comprises a scanning unit <b>21</b> coupled to an external computer <b>22</b> which performs imaging analysis of the images generated by scanning unit <b>21</b>. In other words, whereas system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) integrates a processor internally inside scanning unit <b>12</b>, system <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) makes use of a processor external to scanning unit <b>21</b>, e.g., in external computer <b>22</b>. For example, external computer <b>22</b> may include a microprocessor that executes software for image analysis of biological growth plate <b>24</b>. External computer <b>22</b> may comprise a personal computer (PC), desktop computer, laptop computer, handheld computer, workstation, or the like. For example, software programs can be loaded on external computer <b>22</b> to facilitate image analysis of images of biological growth plate <b>24</b> generated by biological scanning system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Scanning unit <b>21</b> is coupled to external computer <b>22</b> via interface <b>25</b>. Interface <b>25</b>, for example, may comprise a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a Universal Serial Bus 2 (USB2) interface, an IEEE 1394 FireWire interface, a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) interface, an Advance Technology Attachment (ATA) interface, a serial ATA interface, a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface, a conventional serial or parallel interface, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated, biological scanning system <b>20</b> is designed to receive a biological growth plate <b>24</b>. In particular, scanning unit <b>21</b> includes a housing <b>26</b> that defines an input slot <b>28</b> for receiving biological growth plate <b>24</b>. A guide mechanism <b>23</b> may be formed on housing <b>26</b> to aid insertion of biological growth plate <b>24</b> into scanning unit <b>21</b>. Scanning unit <b>21</b> also includes an ejection slot (not shown), through which growth plate <b>24</b> is ejected following imaging of growth plate <b>24</b>. Scanning unit <b>21</b>may also include other features, such as a display screen (not shown) to display the progress or results of analysis of the biological growth plate to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Scanning unit <b>21</b> houses an imaging device, such as a 2-dimensional monochromatic camera for generating one or more images of an inserted biological growth plate <b>24</b>. In addition, scanning unit <b>21</b> may house various illuminators for illuminating the front and back of biological growth plate <b>24</b> during imaging. The illuminators can illuminate biological growth plate <b>24</b> with one or more colors, and one or more images of growth plate <b>24</b> can be generated and then analyzed to determine bacteria counts on growth plate <b>24</b>. In particular scanning unit <b>21</b> communicates the images to external computer <b>22</b>, which includes a processor for performing image analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Growth plate <b>24</b> may include a growth area <b>27</b> where bacteria or other agents manifest on growth plate <b>24</b>. Growth area <b>27</b> may be a flat surface or a recessed well. A determination of whether a given sample being tested in growth plate <b>24</b> is acceptable, in terms of bacterial colony counts, may depend on the number of bacterial colonies per unit area. Accordingly, images generated by scanning unit <b>21</b> can be used to quantify the amount of bacterial colonies per unit area on plate <b>24</b>. The size of individual colonies may also be factored into the analysis, if desired. The surface of biological growth plate <b>24</b> in growth area <b>27</b> may contain one or more growth enhancing agents designed to facilitate the rapid growth of one or more types of bacteria or other biological agents. In some cases, biological growth plate <b>24</b> is incubated prior to insertion into scanning unit <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Growth plate <b>24</b> may also include indicia <b>29</b>, such as a bar code or other type of identification marking used to identify growth plate <b>24</b>. RFID tags, two-dimensional optically detectable codes, or the like, may also be used as indicia. In any case, indicia <b>29</b> may identify the type of bacteria or biological agent being grown and tested on growth plate <b>24</b>. Scanning unit <b>21</b> can be designed to draw growth plate <b>24</b> into scanning unit <b>21</b> to a first location and generate an image of indicia <b>29</b>, and then draw growth plate <b>24</b> to a second location and generate an image of growth area <b>27</b>. In this manner, images of indicia <b>29</b> and growth area <b>27</b> can be generated by biological scanning system <b>20</b>. Alternatively, a single image may capture both indicia <b>29</b> and the growth area <b>27</b>. In either case, the scanning of indicia <b>29</b> can facilitate identification of the type of plate being used so that one or more desirable counting rules can be applied in an automated fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">By way of example, growth plate <b>24</b> may comprise a biological growth plate sold by 3M under the trade name PETRIFILM plates. Growth plate <b>24</b> can be utilized to facilitate the rapid growth and detection of bacteria or other biological agents commonly associated with food contamination, including, for example, aerobic bacteria, <i>E. coli</i>, coliform, enterobacteriaceae, yeast, mold, <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria, Campylobacter</i>, or the like. Growth plates are generally one type of growth medium commonly used for biological growth and bacterial detection and enumeration. The invention, however, may also be applied with a wide variety of other types of growth media.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate, various aspects of the invention establish rules that can be applied during image processing. In other words, the rules described in greater detail below can form part of a counting algorithm executed in system <b>10</b> or system <b>20</b>. The different rules may be used individually or in any combination, depending on the type of growth medium being scanned and the problems that may be encountered. For example, some rules may be relevant for particular types of growth plates as outlined below. The order in which rules are applied may also affect the result. In any event, application of one or more of the counting rules can improve a biological scanning system such as system <b>10</b> or system <b>20</b> by improving the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a growth medium such as a growth plate or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a biological scanning system <b>30</b>, which may correspond to system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or system <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Biological scanning system <b>30</b> includes an imaging device <b>32</b> that generates one or more images of a growth medium and provides the images to processor <b>34</b>. Processor <b>34</b> is coupled to memory <b>36</b>. Memory <b>36</b> stores various processor-executable software instructions that facilitate image analysis of the images generated by imaging device <b>32</b>. In particular, memory <b>36</b> stores one or more counting rules <b>37</b> which are applied during image analysis to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate. Output device <b>38</b> receives the results determined by processor <b>34</b> and provides the results to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">By way of example, imaging device <b>32</b> may comprise a 2-dimensional monochromatic camera for generating one or more images of a biological growth plate. Various illuminators (not shown) may be used to illuminate the front and back of biological growth plate. For example, the illuminators can illuminate the biological growth plate with one or more colors, and one or more images of the growth plate can be generated by imaging device <b>32</b>. The images are provided to processor <b>34</b> and may also be stored in memory <b>36</b>. In any case, the images are analyzed by applying counting rules <b>37</b> in order to determine bacteria counts on the growth plate. The resolution of imaging device <b>32</b> may be approximately 155 pixels per centimeter. In that case, a one centimeter line in the image is 155 pixels long and each pixel is approximately 6.45 ×10EE-3 long.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Reducing the cost of imaging device <b>32</b> is desirable. Although high cost optical elements, such as high-quality lenses can improve imaging, such elements can drive up the cost of system <b>30</b> to exorbitant levels. One or more of counting rules <b>37</b> may provide an alternative mechanism for achieving improvements in system <b>30</b>. For example, one or more counting rules <b>37</b> may compensate for optical defects in imaging device <b>32</b>. Accordingly, in some cases, counting rules <b>37</b> can reduce the costs of system <b>30</b> by allowing lower cost optical elements to be used in imaging device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Processor <b>34</b> may comprise a general-purpose microprocessor that executes software stored in memory <b>36</b>. Alternatively, processor <b>34</b> may comprise an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other specifically designed processor. In any case, processor <b>34</b> executes various counting rules <b>37</b> to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Memory <b>36</b> is one example, of a computer readable medium that stores processor executable software instructions applied by processor <b>34</b>. By way of example, memory <b>36</b> may comprise random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, or the like. Counting rules <b>37</b> such as those described below, are stored in memory <b>36</b> and may form part of a larger software program used for image analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Output device <b>38</b> typically comprises a display screen used to communicate results to a user. However, output device <b>38</b> could also comprise other types of devices such as a printer or the like. Output device <b>38</b> may form part of a biological scanning unit, such as display <b>16</b> of scanning unit <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or may be external to the scanning unit, such as the display screen of external computer <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process of automated biological growth plate analysis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, processor <b>34</b> receives one or more images of a growth plate (<b>41</b>). Processor <b>34</b> invokes various software routines from memory <b>36</b> to count the biological agents on the growth plate (<b>42</b>). For example, bacterial colonies may be identified according to color differences, in which bacterial colonies manifest on the growth medium by changing color. The software executed by processor <b>34</b> can allow for identification of the biological growth area on the growth plate and automated counting of bacterial colonies based on color changes in the growth area where the colonies have grown during incubation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In accordance with the invention, processor <b>34</b> applies one or more rules to improve the accuracy of the count of biological agents on the growth medium (<b>43</b>). A variety of rules are described in the following description. The rules may be applied individually or various combinations of rules may be used, depending on the type of growth plate being analyzed. The rules may be individually invoked from memory <b>36</b> or may form sub-routines of a larger image analysis software program. The rules described below are labeled as rules <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. This notation, however, is provided to aid the discussion of the rules, and in no way implies an order of the application of the rules. The rules may be applied individually or various sets of the rules may be applied. If a set of rules are used, then the order in which the rules are applied may be selected based on the type of plate being scanned. The selected order for application of the rules may affect the end result.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating rule <b>1</b>. As illustrated, processor <b>34</b> invokes software stored in memory <b>36</b> to identify the color value of a growth plate (<b>71</b>). In particular, processor <b>34</b> may quantify the color of the growth plate as one or more numeral values that defines the shade of the plate. The shade, for example, may be characterized by 3 numbers defining red, green and blue values, or hue, saturation and intensity values. If one or more of the color values of the growth plate are outside a rule <b>1</b> range (<b>72</b>), e.g., if the shade of the plate is not within a range of shades established as acceptable, then that growth plate is flagged for additional review (<b>73</b>). For example, flagged growth plates may require technician review in order to determine if the color of the growth plate indicates a problem. In this manner, rule <b>1</b> automates the identification of potentially faulty growth plates based on the color of the plate. The rule <b>1</b> color range is generally specific to the type of growth plate used, and generally establishes a range of colors that indicate that the growth plate is acceptable. Shade values can be used to define the color range and color values with one or more numerical values.</p>

For some growth plates, colonies with gas indicate confirmed types of biological colonies that can be enumerated, whereas colonies without gas indicate a colony that may or may not be enumerated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">One problem with growth plates is that one colony may split and generally manifest as two or more distinct marks on the growth plate. In that case, the two or more distinct marks generally indicate the same colony for purposes of bacterial counts. However, automated systems may count each marking as a separate colony. This problem often becomes more prevalent with colonies that include gas because the gas may generate from within, above or below the perimeter of the colony, which can affect the colony and cause it to split.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In order to reduce this problem, rules <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B provide alternative techniques for identifying colonies that have likely split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. In general, when a growth plate includes a limited number of colonies and two or more colonies are very close together, it may be desirable to count the two or more colonies that are very close together as a single colony because of a high probability that the two colonies split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. The sets of colonies identified at <b>85</b>A, <b>85</b>B and <b>85</b>C, for example, may be likely candidates for application of such a rule.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating rule <b>2</b>A.

If the plate count, i.e., the initial number of agents identified on the plate is greater than a rule <b>2</b> threshold (no branch of <b>91</b>), then no change is made to the plate count. However, if the plate count is less than the rule <b>2</b> threshold (yes branch of <b>91</b>), then changes may occur. For example, the rule <b>2</b> threshold may be approximately 20 although this number could take any value for various implementations. In general, it is most desirable to invoke steps (<b>92</b>-<b>94</b>) when the number of initial counts is relatively small because incorrect counts have a more drastic affect on the percentage of counts when the number of total counts is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the plate count is less than the rule <b>2</b> threshold (yes branch of <b>91</b>), then processor <b>34</b> determines whether one colony is within a defined distance D<sub>2 </sub>of another colony (<b>92</b>).

The distance D<sub>2 </sub>may be defined in terms of absolute distance or in terms of pixels in the images. For example, the distance D<sub>2 </sub>may be defined as a width of approximately 18 pixels from center to center of two pixels.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other words, if two colonies are very close to one another on a growth plate that has relatively few colonies, then those two colonies are counted as a single colony because of a high probability that the two colonies split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">One problem with growth plate analysis is that imaging artifacts can cause irregularities in images of growth plates. If relatively low cost optical elements, such as low cost lenses, are used in the imaging device, this problem can be significant. On the other hand, however, it is desirable to control the costs in a biological scanning system and high cost optical elements can add considerable costs. Accordingly, a better option to using higher cost optical elements may be the development of image analysis rules and techniques that can identify and overcome problems associated with lower cost optical elements.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">One problem with growth plate analysis is that the growth plate may exhibit an uneven triggering(chemical reaction) of growth indicators. Statistically, it is expected that the colonies will be evenly distributed. If a much higher percentage of red colonies manifest in one area and a much higher percentage of blue colonies manifest in another area, a problem may be identified. In that case, the blue colonies may be counted as red colonies, e.g., where the red colonies identify a more general presence of bacterial growth and the blue colonies identify a more specific type of bacterial growth. With uneven distribution, the presence of blue colonies are less reliable as indicators of the specific type of bacterial growth, but would typically still indicate more general bacterial presence. Accordingly, in automated bacterial colony counting it may be desirable to count the blue colonies as red colonies if uneven distribution is identified, particularly in plates having relatively low bacterial counts.</p>

In particular, a variety of counting rules have been described that can be used in a biological scanning system to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Many of the techniques have been described as being software-implemented. In that case, a computer readable medium stores processor executable instructions that embody one or more of the rules described above. For example, the computer readable medium may comprise random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, or the like. The computer readable medium may also comprise a non-volatile memory such as a CD-ROM used to deliver the software to customers. Also, the computer readable medium may comprise an electromagnetic carrier wave, e.g., for delivering the software over a network such as the internet.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The same techniques, however, may also be implemented in hardware. Example hardware implementations include implementations within an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), specifically designed hardware components, or any combination thereof. In addition, one or more of the techniques described herein may be partially executed in hardware, software or firmware.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In any case, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, one or more of the rules described herein may be used with or without other rules and various subsets of the rules may be applied in any order, depending on the desired implementation. These and other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.</p>
