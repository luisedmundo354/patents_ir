<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a co-pending application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/135,569, entitled “HEAT DISSIPATION DEVICE”, which was filed on May 23, 2005 and the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a heat dissipation device, and more particularly to a heat sink for an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electronic device such as a central processing unit (CPU) generates heat during operation and temperature thereof will increase beyond its normally acceptable range unless the heat is removed effectively. The temperature increase results in instability and failure of operation of the electronic device. For ensuring the normal operation of the electronic device, heat dissipation is indispensable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, a heat sink is applied to the electronic device for dissipating heat generated thereby. With the continuing boom of integrated circuits technology, designs on heat sinks change quickly. However, vibration and noises are still the problems, which must be faced and resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A typical heat sink is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0052051. In this patent publication, a heat sink comprises a base for absorbing heat and a plurality of fins stacked together parallel to each other for dissipating heat. A heat pipe is attached to the base and extends through the fins. The heat sink draws the heat from a heat source by the base, then transfers it to the fins via the heat pipe, and dissipates it from the fins outwards to a surrounding environment. In order to maximize heat dissipation capability, the fins are made to have a larger size for larger heat dissipation area, and a small thickness so that a high fin density can be provided on the base thereby further increasing the heat dissipation area. On the other hand, to get a better heat-spreading in the fins, the heat pipe passes through a middle portion of the fins. Outer portions of the large fins which are far away from the middle portion, especially outer edges of the fins, are subjected to deflection when the heat sink is mounted with a fan providing a forced airflow through the fins, or when a system airflow passes through the fins. Shock or vibration, and noises are thereby generated. The vibration will be partly transferred to the base of the heat sink and even to the electronic device, adversely impacting a normal operation of the electronic device, such as stability or useful life thereof. The impact is even more considerable when a resonant vibration occurs. Adding heat pipes to the heat sink to strengthen connection between the base and the fins may be considered; however, this increases cost of the heat sink significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, an improved heat sink assembly which overcomes above problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, what is needed is to provide a heat sink with a consolidated fin configuration, which could minimizes the shock or vibration, and noise when an airflow passes through the fins of the heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A heat sink of an embodiment of the invention comprises a base for contacting the electronic device, a plurality of first fins stacked together parallel to each other, a heat pipe attached to the base and extending through the fins for transferring heat from the base to the fins. A plurality of second fins is formed on the base and supports the first fins. Four reinforcements are fixed on the base and extend upwardly from the base; the reinforcements join some of the first fins at four corners of the first fins, thereby reinforcing integrity of the first fins.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other advantages and novel features of the present invention will be drawn from the following detailed description of some embodiments of the present invention together with the attached drawings, in which:</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following detailed description of the embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that illustrate embodiments of the present invention and its practices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a heat sink in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The heat sink is for being mounted to a printed circuit board <b>40</b> to contact an electronic device, such as a CPU <b>50</b>, for heat dissipation of the CPU <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heat sink comprises a rectangular metal base <b>10</b>. The base <b>10</b> has a bottom surface (not visible) for contacting the CPU <b>50</b> and drawing heat therefrom, and a top surface (not labeled) opposite to the bottom surface, with a groove <b>12</b> defined therein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A U-shaped heat pipe <b>20</b> is attached to the base <b>10</b>. The heat pipe <b>20</b> comprises a horizontal evaporating portion <b>22</b> received in the groove <b>12</b> of the base <b>10</b> and fixed therein by stannum-soldering, and two parallel condensing portions <b>24</b> extending perpendicularly from opposite ends of the evaporating portion <b>22</b>. The condensing portions <b>24</b> extend away from the base <b>10</b> and pass through a plurality of first fins <b>30</b> which are stacked at uniform intervals and parallel to each other. The first fins <b>30</b> are horizontally extended when mounted to the base <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of the first fins <b>30</b> is rectangular and forms two pairs of bearing flanges <b>34</b> which are bent perpendicularly from two opposite edges of each first fin <b>30</b> and bear against an adjacent first fin <b>30</b>. The first fin <b>30</b> defines two holes <b>32</b> and a jointing flange (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> but not labeled) extends perpendicularly from each fin <b>30</b> at a circumference of each hole <b>32</b>. The condensing portions <b>24</b> of the heat pipe <b>20</b> extend through the holes <b>32</b> of the fins <b>30</b> and thermally contact the jointing flanges thereof (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bearing flanges <b>34</b> of each first fin <b>30</b> bear against an adjacent fin <b>30</b> so as to form a fin group in which the fins <b>30</b> are stacked in sequence. The fin group is located above the base <b>10</b> by engaging with the heat pipe <b>20</b>, and substantially parallel to the top surface of the base <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Considering heat-transferring performance of the heat pipe <b>20</b>, an arc-shaped transition section from the evaporating portion <b>22</b> to the condensing portion <b>24</b> is formed. It is preferable that the heat pipe <b>20</b> is not provided with fins at the transition section. So, a vacant space is therefore defined between the top surface of the base <b>10</b> and the first fin <b>30</b>, which is closest to the base <b>10</b>. A plurality of second fins <b>15</b> extends integrally and perpendicularly from the top surface of the base <b>10</b> towards the first fins <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the second fins <b>15</b> also can be manufactured separately and then mounted on the base <b>10</b>. Presence of the second fins <b>15</b> enables said vacant space to be utilized to further facilitate direct heat dissipation of the base <b>10</b>. The second fins <b>15</b> support the closest first fin <b>30</b> by soldering the closest first fin <b>30</b> and the second fins <b>15</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Two pairs of reinforcements, such as poles <b>16</b> or the like in the preferred embodiment, extend perpendicularly from the top surface of the base <b>10</b>. The poles <b>16</b> have the same structure and are positioned at four corners of the base <b>10</b>, respectively. Each pole <b>16</b> defines a plurality of grooves <b>17</b> spaced at uniform intervals for receiving some of the first fins <b>30</b> which are near the base <b>10</b>. The number of the first fins <b>30</b> engaging with the poles <b>16</b> depends on the length of the poles <b>16</b> and the distance between adjacent first fins <b>30</b>. The poles <b>16</b> can be constructed by extending integrally from the base <b>10</b> or the second fins <b>15</b>, or by mounting a pre-formed pole to the base <b>10</b>. And the grooves <b>17</b> defined in the poles <b>16</b> can be removed and a direct connection between the poles <b>16</b> and the first fins <b>30</b> can be established by soldering. The second fins <b>15</b> are vertically extended on the base <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a heat sink in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The heat sink is similar to the heat sink of the first embodiment except that a pole <b>16</b>′ without grooves extends perpendicularly from a top surface of a base <b>10</b>′ of the heat sink and through all first fins <b>30</b>′ which define apertures (not labeled) corresponding to the pole <b>16</b>′. The pole <b>16</b>′ spaced from and parallel to the condensing portions of the heat pipe <b>20</b>′. It is preferred that the pole <b>16</b>′ and the heat pipe <b>20</b>′ are disposed to form three supporting points for the first fins <b>30</b>′. The three supporting points are located at three points of a triangle, respectively. To strengthen connection between the pole <b>16</b>′ and the first fins <b>30</b>′, a linking flange <b>33</b>′ extends from an edge of the aperture of each fin <b>30</b>′ and joins with the pole <b>33</b>′ by soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the heat sinks above-described, the outer portions of the first fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′, which are far away from the points where the heat pipe <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>′ passes through the first fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′, are fixed by the poles <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′. Vibration and noise, generated when an airflow passes through the first fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′ will be decreased remarkably. Since the first fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′ are stacked and secured to each other in sequence to form a fin group in which each first fin <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′ is positioned, when at least one of the fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′ is attached fixedly to the pole <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′, the vibration and noise of the whole fins group can be reduced to some extent. The more the fins <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>′ attached to the pole <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′ are, the lower the vibration and the noise of the heat sinks have.</p>
