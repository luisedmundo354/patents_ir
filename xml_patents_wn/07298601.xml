<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to parallel computer power supply systems, and more particularly, to an over-voltage protection circuit and method for a parallel power supply system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computer systems typically utilize parallel power supply systems. A parallel power supply system generally comprises a plurality of power sources such as DC-DC converters or voltage regulators connected in parallel to provide current to a load comprising one or more processors, memory devices, disk drives, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing parallel power supplies employing PWM topologies allow “burst mode” which terminates switching on a properly functioning regulator macro in the presence of an over-voltage caused by a parallel regulator macro. This lack of switching is detectable and allows logic gates to discern which macro is the offending over-voltage producer (i.e., is actively switching), and correctly disable it. One example of such a circuit is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,278,597 entitled “Conditional Over-Voltage Protection for Redundant Phase-Shift Converters.”</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Parallel voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are a new power system topology. Existing VRM parallel topologies do not protect well and typically only terminate switching activity on a faulty phase. However, if the over-voltage condition is due to a shorted high-side switch in a non-insolated topology (as opposed to a control loop or reference fault), then simply terminating switching activity does not remove the over-voltage fault, which compromises the redundant purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain existing VRM parallel topologies make use of the well-defined “Intel Load Line” that droops more than 5 percent of nominal voltage at full load. By coordinating a sliding over-voltage threshold with load current, a VRM macro supporting load current would have a lower trigger threshold for an over-voltage trip and therefore be the first VRM of the parallel group to trip. VRMs not providing load (properly functioning in the presence of a over-voltage caused by a parallel macro) would have a higher trigger threshold and thus protect properly. This solution lacks two properties, however. First, light load conditions make the over-voltage thresholds identical for good and bad parallel VRMs, and secondly, for load line droop of certain technology, which can be 10× less than that of Intel requirements, the over-voltage trigger threshold is only fractions of a percent different between faulty VRMs and properly functioning VRMs, even at substantial load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a parallel power supply protection circuit is needed which can accurately isolate a particular voltage regulator module that is causing an over-voltage condition without causing a shut down of the entire parallel power system. The present invention meets this need.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through a protection circuit for a parallel power system having at least two parallel coupled voltage regulators. The protection circuit includes at least two isolation control circuits. Each isolation control circuit is coupled to a respective voltage regulator of the parallel power system, and includes a current sense circuit and a controller. The current sense circuit senses current polarity at an output of the respective voltage regulator, while the controller automatically isolates the respective voltage regulator when an over-voltage condition exists at an output of the parallel power system and a positive current polarity is sensed at the output of the respective voltage regulator. The at least two isolation control circuits of the protection circuit function to isolate only a voltage regulator having positive current outflow during the over-voltage condition.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a parallel power system is provided. This parallel power system includes at least two voltage regulators coupled in parallel, and at least two isolation control circuits. Each isolation control circuit is coupled to a respective voltage regulator of the parallel power system, and each circuit includes a current sense circuit and a controller. The current sense circuit senses current polarity at an output of the respective voltage regulator, while the controller automatically isolates the respective voltage regulator when an over-voltage condition exists at an output of the parallel power system and a positive current polarity is sensed at the output of the respective voltage regulator. Together, the at least two isolation control circuits of the protection circuit function to isolate only a voltage regulator having positive current outflow during the over-voltage condition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further aspect, a method of protecting a parallel power supply having at least two parallel coupled voltage regulators is provided. The method includes: providing a separate isolation control circuit for each respective voltage regulator of the at least two voltage regulators. Each isolation control circuit includes logic for: sensing current polarity at an output of the respective voltage regulator; and automatically controlling isolation of the respective voltage regulator when an over-voltage condition exists at an output of the parallel power system and a positive current polarity is sensed at the output of the respective voltage regulator, wherein only a voltage regulator having positive current outflow during the over-voltage condition is isolated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention relates to an over-voltage protection circuit for a parallel power system. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is disclosed in the context of a preferred embodiment. The present invention provides for an over-voltage protection circuit for a parallel power system. Through the use of a circuit or logic in accordance with the present invention, electronic devices powered by the system are protected against being damaged as the result of an over-voltage condition in one of the voltage regulator modules. Moreover, the over-voltage protection circuit in accordance with the present invention will not cause a shut down of the entire system should a voltage regulator experience an over-voltage condition. This results in a more stable and continuous operating environment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">More particularly, disclosed herein are techniques for detecting and isolating an over-voltage condition in any VRM topology, and particularly, one that employs multiple parallel VRM macros. For over-voltage protection in redundant, parallel VRM macros, a significant feature is the ability to detect just the over-voltage offender and to disable just that VRM macro. The difficulty lies with all macros reporting the same output voltage, how to determine which is the offending macro. As disclosed herein, output current polarity is employed to identify the offending macro. This is achieved by utilizing the already existing OR-ing FET at the output of each VRM macro. Further, provision is made for isolating a faulty VRM macro in a redundant multi-phase VRM design that allows continued operation in the remaining VRM macros in the presence of a shorted FET, or other voltage regulation loop fault, creating an over-voltage from the faulty VRM macro.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a typical parallel power supply configuration <b>100</b>. This configuration <b>100</b> includes an input voltage <b>112</b>, a fuse <b>114</b>, a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) <b>116</b>, two parallel coupled VRMs <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, a threshold voltage <b>122</b>, a comparator <b>123</b>, and a latch <b>124</b>. A problem arises in this configuration when one of the VRMs in parallel initiates an over-voltage (OV) condition. When one of the VRMs <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> goes OV, it turns on the SCR <b>116</b> which can blow the fuse <b>114</b> and cause the entire system to shut down. The system also lacks the ability to detect which VRM is creating the over-voltage condition. Further, noisy conditions produced by comparator <b>122</b> could cause the blowing of fuse <b>114</b>. Once this happens, the VRMs will be without input power and the system will be forced to shut down. For many applications, this is not a desirable outcome.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a circuit which can isolate a particular voltage regulator that is in over-voltage condition, and shut only that over-voltage regulator down. Also, the circuit should accomplish this without causing a shut down of the entire power system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a depiction of a power system <b>200</b> that includes a multi-phase voltage regulator module (VRM) <b>210</b> and a protection circuit in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The protection circuit combines an over-voltage detection circuit with a current sensing circuit for sensing positive or negative current flow from the VRM module. A VRM with positive current outflow is identified as a faulty VRM during an over-voltage condition. The synchronous rectifier design of today's VRMs ensures that all other properly functioning VRMs will be sinking current, thus making detection of the one or more faulty VRMs absolutely conclusive, even in the presence of zero system load currents. A further part of the implementation is a means to disconnect all power from the non-isolated VRM since a high-side switch short must also be protected from sustaining an output over-voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the protection circuit comprises an over-voltage and current sense controller <b>260</b>, which gates an isolation FET <b>230</b> at the input of multi-phase VRM <b>210</b>, and which senses the polarity across an OR-ing FET <b>230</b> located at the output of multi-phase VRM <b>210</b>. Operationally, an input bus <b>220</b>, such as a 12-volt input bus, powers VRM <b>210</b>, which although shown as a multi-phase VRM, could alternatively comprise a single-phase VRM. In normal operation, power from input bus <b>220</b> is applied across the input of VRM <b>210</b> since isolation FET <b>230</b> is gated ON. Output from VRM <b>210</b> is the desired voltage level, which can typically range from one volt to 12 volts, depending on the load <b>250</b> technology, which is shown in the drawing as a simple RC circuit. The OR-ing FET <b>240</b> at the output of VRM <b>210</b> is normally gated ON and principally exists in the circuit to sense for an output short in the VRM. This FET <b>240</b> protects against an output short to ground situation. In accordance with the present invention, however, FET <b>240</b> is also employed to facilitate sensing the direction of current flow at the output of VRM <b>210</b>. Controller <b>260</b> thus employs over-voltage detection, by comparison of the load voltage with a reference value (Vref), as well as a current-sense polarity determination at the output of VRM <b>210</b>. Depending on the values of these determinations, the controller may gate isolation FET OFF in order to isolate a faulty VRM, as explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts one example of a redundant, parallel power system employing multiple multi-phase VRMs <b>210</b> connected in parallel to supply an electronic load <b>250</b>, such as a processor module. This parallel power system implementation employs, by way of example, the same isolation circuitry embodiment as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with the over-voltage and current sense controls <b>260</b> shown depicted within the VRMs <b>210</b> as one example only. These controls <b>260</b> could alternatively reside external to the VRMs <b>210</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, each VRM <b>210</b> has a detection and isolation circuitry so that no single point of failure across the parallel power system exists.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a more detailed depiction of one hardware embodiment of the over-voltage and current sense controls <b>260</b> employed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 &amp; 3</figref>. As shown, in this embodiment, over-voltage detection is performed by a comparator <b>400</b> which compares the output voltage of the power system, i.e., the voltage at the load, with a threshold or reference voltage Vref. If the output voltage is greater than the reference voltage, then an over-voltage condition is detected. In an alternate embodiment, over-voltage detection could be a centrally implemented function for multiple isolation control circuits, with an appropriate over-voltage control signal being provided to each controller upon detection of the over-voltage condition, if such a single point of failure could be tolerated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A separate comparator <b>410</b> senses voltage polarity across the OR-ing FET <b>240</b>. If current flows out from the associated VRM (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 &amp; 3</figref>) this outflow is sensed by comparator <b>410</b> and an appropriate signal is provided to a latching NAND circuit <b>420</b>. If both the over-voltage condition exists, and current flows out from the associated VRM, then NAND circuit <b>420</b> gates OFF isolation FET <b>230</b>. This functioning is depicted in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A single phase of a multi-phase VRM typically combines a PWM controller, a control FET, a synchronous FET, and an output inductor, as is known in the art. Referring to the logic chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if one VRM control FET is shorted or maintained ON for a longer period than is required, then an over-voltage may arise <b>500</b>. The current polarity at the output of each VRM of a parallel power system is monitored to determine which VRM is sourcing current to the load <b>510</b>. Further, each protection circuit determines that an over-voltage condition exists, indicating that an over-voltage fault is present <b>520</b>. As a variation on this step, the over-voltage condition could be globally determined with a control signal being forwarded to each isolation circuit. A logical AND within each protection circuit determines whether both conditions exist, and if so, latches the associated isolation FET OFF at the input to the respective VRM <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To summarize, the protection scheme presented herein employs an output OR-ing FET in a detection technique for determining whether or not the associated VRM is supporting load current during an over-voltage condition. Since all VRMs see the same output voltage, and all detect the presence of an over-voltage condition when such a fault exists, determining whether or not the associated VRM is supporting load current indicates which VRM is faulty. The output OR-ing FET is already an essential part of a redundant solution since it is necessary to prevent a shorted low-side switch fault. The OR-ing FET drive is also designed for fast switching, and forward versus reverse current flow detection to support its purpose of low-side switch fault isolation. (A positive comparator <b>410</b> output represents current flowing out of the VRM.) Thus, current flow polarity sensing, when combined with over-voltage sensing, determines which is the faulty VRM to be isolated. A special VRM synchronous rectifier property is used. Properly functioning VRMs in the presence of an over-voltage will actually sink current. This makes current flow detection a very binary characteristic that is not related to system load current. Even at virtually zero system load, a faulty over-voltage producing VRM will be sourcing current into the properly working remaining VRMs that will be sinking current. The final part of the implementation is a means to disconnect all power from the non-isolated VRM, since a high-side switch short must also be protected from sustaining an output over-voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, through the use of a protection scheme in accordance with the present invention, the load is protected against being damaged as a result of an over-voltage condition in one or more the voltage regulator mododules. Moreover, over-voltage protection in accordance with the present invention isolates the voltage regulator module that is experiencing an over-voltage condition and shuts it down, without shutting down the entire system. This results in a more stable and continuous operating system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an enhancement, a micro-controller could be employed in place of the hardware controller embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In such a case, a current limiting electronic breaker could be used at the input to the associated voltage regulator.</p>
