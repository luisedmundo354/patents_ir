<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A process is provided to prepare production data for a print job. The production data includes an electronic document defined by a page description language (PDL). The electronic document is stored in a PDL image file, such as a Postscript file, a PDF file, or the like. A still image proxy, which may be a JPEG file, a GIF file, a PNG file, or the like, is created of the PDL image file. An image display of the still image proxy is electronically manipulated. In addition, production specifications may be appended to the image display of the still image proxy. Information about the manipulations and production specifications are recorded and subsequently used to revise the PDL image file so as to match the PDL image file to the manipulations made to the image display of the still image proxy and to match the production specifications appended to the image display of the still image proxy. The production specifications may also include print job instructions that are used for preparation of the print job, but which do not physically alter the PDL image file.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The printing industry is rapidly adopting automated workflow processes, including processes that allow customers to electronically submit documents for inclusion into print publications or to be printed. The Internet has accelerated this process by allowing users to submit electronic documents to a printing company web site or a publisher's web site, via a browser.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prepress refers to the production process before ink or toner goes on the paper. Electronic prepress refers to production methods involving desktop publishing, scanning of artwork or photos, film output or plate output from an imagesetter, or direct to print production. Automated workflow processes use electronic prepress. Preflight is an operation in electronic prepress wherein a supplied electronic file is evaluated to determine if all of the elements necessary to print from it are included and useable. In an automated workflow process, preflight is performed by a computer program that evaluates the file and advises of possible problems in a preflight report.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one conventional (prior art) preflight process performed by ColorQuick.com, L.L.C., Pennsauken, N.J., the preflight report indicates if the page size of the submitted document does not match the allocated space for the printed version of the document. For example, if a customer submits an electronic file of an advertisement that has a page size of 7 in×10 in, but the customer's publication advertisement size (i.e., the advertisement space that the customer has purchased) is 6.5 in×9.5 in, then the preflight report indicates that the file must be corrected and sent in again. Manual intervention is now required to address the problem. The publisher must inform the customer of the size problem and the customer must rework the advertisement. The reworked advertisement must be resubmitted and rerun through the preflight process. If the customer is not careful in resizing the advertisement, the reworked advertisement could be rejected as well.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The electronic document printing process used by commercial printers and service providers is rapidly moving towards using documents that are defined by a page description language, such as Adobe® PostScript® defined by .ps files, PDF (Portable Document Format, also from Adobe) defined by .pdf files, and PCL (Printer Control Language, an Hewlett-Packard format) defined by .pcl files. A page description language (PDL) is a computer language that defines how elements such as text and graphics appear on the printed page (i.e., the layout and contents of a printed page). PostScript is the industry-standard PDL. Detailed explanations of the Adobe PDL's and how they are used in a printing environment are provided in the following publications:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">“PDF for Prepress Workflow and Document Delivery,” Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., 1997, 8 pages.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">“Preparing Adobe® PDF files for high-resolution printing,” Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., 1998, 12 pages.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Many programming tools for image processing of PDL-defined images are complex and expensive. Special programs, such as Adobe Acrobat®, must be used to manipulate PDL-defined images. To promote proprietary formats, companies such as Adobe distribute free software that allows users to read the image files, but require a paid license for versions of the software that allow for manipulating the image files. Even if parties at both ends of a workflow process (e.g., a commercial printer and a customer) have access to read and edit versions of such software, the two parties can only view and edit the files within the designated format using the proprietary software.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, no convenient methods exist to visually and interactively append production specifications to PDL-defined images.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As the printing industry moves towards automating customer interactions, additional tools are needed so that customers can more easily interact with their printing jobs within an automated environment when changes must be made to their files. The present invention fulfills such a need.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A process is provided to prepare production data for a print job. In one embodiment of the present invention, the production data includes an electronic document defined by a page description language (PDL).

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">I. Overview of Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A first embodiment of the present invention provides an automated computer-implemented process for preparing production data for a print job. The production data includes an electronic document defined by a page description language (PDL). The electronic document is stored in a PDL image file, such as a Postscript file, a PDF file, or the like. In the process, a still image proxy is created of the PDL image file. An image display of the still image proxy is electronically manipulated. Information about the manipulations are recorded and subsequently used to revise the PDL image file so as to match the PDL image file to the manipulations made to the image display of the still image proxy. The still image proxy may be a JPEG file, a GIF file, a PNG file, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example of the first embodiment, the production data comprises a predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit. A static template is dynamically created that defines the predetermined area and the image display of the still image proxy is then displayed in association with the template. In this embodiment, the image display of the still image proxy is electronically manipulated in relation to the template and information about the manipulations is recorded in relation to the template. Furthermore, information about the manipulations is used to revise the PDL image file so as to match the PDL image file to the manipulations made to the image display of the still image proxy in relation to the template. The template may represent the predetermined area that the electronic document must fit in a layout of a physical printed document. The electronic document may be an advertisement and the template may be the area of purchased advertisement space. The manipulations may include a change in scaling percentage or alignment changes of the image display of the still image proxy in relation to the template.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The image display of the still image proxy may be inserted into a browser-compatible application program such as a Flash movie that allows for electronic manipulation of the image display of the still image proxy within a browser. All of the steps above may occur at a central site, except for the manipulation of the image display of the still image proxy which occurs at a remote site. A public network (such as the Internet), or a private network may be used to communicate the browser-inserted still image proxy from the central site to the remote site for manipulation at the remote site. The public or private network may then be used to communicate the information about the manipulations back to the central site for use in revising the PDL image file.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A second embodiment of the present invention provides a process for preparing production data for a print job. The production data includes an electronic document defined by a page description language (PDL). The electronic document is stored in a PDL image file. In the process, a still image proxy is created of the PDL image file. Production specifications are electronically appended to the image display of the still image proxy and information about the production specifications are recorded. The recorded information is then used to prepare production data for the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one example of the second embodiment, the production specifications are physical manipulations of stock used in the print job. The physical manipulations of the print job are appended to the image display of the still image proxy in the desired relation to the image display of the still image proxy. Information about the physical manipulations are recorded and subsequently used to prepare production data for the print job. One example of physical manipulations of stock include bindery specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A third embodiment of the present invention provides an automated computer-implemented process for viewing production data for a print job. The production data includes an electronic document defined by a page description language (PDL) and a predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit. The electronic document is stored in a PDL image file and has predefined physical dimensionals. In the process, a still image proxy of the PDL image file is created. Also, a static template is created that defines the predetermined area. The physical dimensions of the template are dynamically determined based on the area in which the electronic document must fit. The physical dimensions of the image display of the still image proxy are dynamically determined based on the relative size of the predefined physical dimensions of the PDL image file to the predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit. An image display of the still image proxy is displayed in association with the template and is then electronically manipulated. Information about the manipulations are recorded and subsequently used to revise the PDL image file so as to match the PDL image file to the manipulations made to the image display of the still image proxy. The still image proxy and the template may be inserted into a browser-compatible application program that allows for electronic manipulation of the image display of the still image proxy in relation to the template within a browser. The template is sized so as to appear as large as possible within the application program, regardless of the actual predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit. This provides for maximum viewability of the template and the image display of the still image proxy within the browser.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one example of the third embodiment, the template represents the predetermined area that the electronic document must fit in a layout of a physical printed document. The electronic document may be an advertisement and the template is the area of purchased advertisement space.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a display screen of a progress bar that appears during the file transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a preflight report for ad #613. The preflight report indicates that the page size of the document in the submitted file, 7.9982 in×10.8725 in does not match the allocated space for the printed version of the document (i.e., the advertisement space that the customer has purchased) which is 7.875 in×5.25 in. The customer is prompted with two options. One option is similar to the conventional ColorQuick preflight process described above which is to send a corrected file which requires manual intervention by the customer. Another option in accordance with the present invention is to select an automated process called QuickFit™. A QuickFit icon is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If the user selects QuickFit, no manual intervention is required to address the sizing problem. Instead, the customer manipulates the ad via a browser-based application, the manipulations are delivered back to the service bureau, and the service bureau uses automated software to revise the original image file based on the manipulations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart of the steps associated with one preferred embodiment of the present invention. The first step in the process is that a customer provides an image defined by a PDL to a web server of a service bureau, here, magSend (step <b>10</b>). In the illustrated example, the image is an advertisement-type document. The image file may be electronically uploaded to the service bureau or input via a transferable digital medium (e.g., a diskette). This step is conventional and thus is not described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A user interface is then created by the service bureau for subsequent manipulation of the original PDL-defined image (step <b>20</b>). More specifically, the PDL-defined image is converted into a still image proxy, such as a JPEG (.jpg) file, a GIF (.gif) file, or a PNG (.png) file, thereby creating a still image proxy representation of the original PDL image. In the present example, JPEG is used. This step is conventional and thus is not described in further detail. One suitable software program that converts Postscript files to bit-mapped formats such as JPEG is LEADTOOLS, available from LEAD Technologies, Inc., Charlotte, N.C. Other suitable conversion programs include GoScript®, available from LaserGo, Inc., San Diego, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The still image proxy (here, the JPEG image) is inserted into a browser-compatible program that allows a user to manipulate the JPEG image with respect to a dynamically generated, job parameter specific, static template (step <b>20</b>). The inserted JPEG image effectively becomes a “proxy” for the original PDL image. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the JPEG image is inserted into a Flash® Movie. A Flash movie may created using Macromedia Flash 5, available from Macromedia, Inc., San Francisco, Calif. The general process for dynamically inserting a JPEG image into a Flash Movie is well-known. The resultant Flash Movie shows the dynamically generated static template having the still image proxy inserted therein, or superimposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the dimensions of the static template and the dimensions of the image display of the still image proxy are determined based upon the relative dimensions of the original PDL image file and the predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit (which is the purchased ad space in this example). Thus, although the template is fixed or static after creation, its actual dimensions are dynamically determined based on the area in which the electronic document must fit, and the physical dimensions of the image display of the still image proxy are dynamically determined based on the relative size of the predefined physical dimensions of the PDL image file to the predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit. The template is created at run time. One goal of this process is to maximize the viewing area.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref> show a user interface presented at a browser for allowing the user to manipulate the image display of the still image proxy with respect to the static template (step <b>30</b>). This user interface was created via the Flash movie process described above. The user interface shows a template, the still image proxy, a scale modifier slider bar for enlargement/reduction, selection buttons to show or hide borders of the live area, trim area and bleed area, and function buttons (Reset, Preview, Cancel, Finish). The template alternatively provides three different borders for the live area, trim area and bleed. Only the live area is shown for a non-bleed ad.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During the manipulation in step <b>30</b>, no communication needs to occur with the web server that delivered the Flash Movie. However, the user's browser session remains active during the manipulations. The Flash Movie plug-in contains all of the necessary features to allow for the manipulations without needing to contact the web server. The still image proxy can be manipulated in any manner that the original PDL image file may manipulated. In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref>, two different manipulations can be performed, namely enlargement/reduction scaling of the entire image, and x-y coordinate transformations of the entire image with respect to the template. Any manipulations that can be performed on a PDF file can be performed on the still image proxy and the scope of the invention includes all such manipulations. Drag-and-drop mouse movements are used to reposition the still image proxy. The scale modifier slider bar is used to change the scale. The user makes such manipulations until the user is satisfied with the size and placement of the still image proxy with respect to the template borders. The manipulations are recorded by tracking the x and y coordinates for the center of the still image proxy relative to the center of the ad space, and the scale percentage relative to the original size of the still image proxy (step <b>50</b>). Depending upon the live area, trim area and bleed, the still image proxy may spill outside of these template borders. An important feature of the present invention is that this process allows the user to view exactly how the ad will appear within the purchased ad space, as well as to correct any obvious sizing or alignment errors. If the user cannot satisfactorily size and place the ad in the ad space, then the user immediately knows that the ad must be modified and knows exactly how the ad must be modified, all without needing to consult the publisher. Alternatively, the user may wish to reconsider the size of the purchased ad space.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the still image proxy as being relatively larger than the ad space. The relative size difference matches exactly the actual relative size difference between the actual page size of the document in the submitted file for ad #<b>613</b> (7.9982 in×10.8725 in) and the advertisement space that the customer has purchased (7.875 in×5.25 in). In one alternative embodiment of the present invention, the initial scale percentage is set so that the largest dimension of the ad fits exactly within the border of the ad space. In this example, the initial scale percentage would be about 51%, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the scaling capability of the Quick Fit process wherein the still image proxy is scaled to 135% of its actual size relative to the actual size of the ad space.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows the scaling capability wherein the still image proxy is scaled to 54% of its actual size relative to the actual size of the ad space. The scale percentage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> was selected so that all text falls within the live area. To keep text within the publisher's recommended guidelines, the final scale percentage should not be greater than this value.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an x-axis movement to the left and an additional scale reduction to 51%.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the ability to preview the results. In the preview mode, the previously transparent ad borders become opaque to simulate the effect of “trimming” the ad. After manipulating the size and displacement (x-axis and/or y-axis) of the ad, it may become apparent that the original PDL ad file and/or the ad space must be modified. In this example, no matter how much the ad is manipulated, the ad cannot be made to look proper within the ad space. However, the user interface effectively communicates exactly how either the ad or the ad space can be modified so that no more than submission of a corrected file or selection of a different ad space size will be necessary. In a large number of instances, however, the process may be used to properly fit the ad to the ad space with no further submissions of a corrected file or selections of different ad space sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As briefly discussed above, another feature of the present invention is that production specifications may be electronically appended to the image display of the still image proxy (step <b>40</b>). One type of production specification is a bindery specification, which may include operations such as perf, score, fold, collate, saddle stitch, emboss, deboss, and die-cut.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once a user is satisfied with how the image display of the still image proxy appears with respect to the template, the user selects the “Finish” button. Any physical manipulations and/or production specifications that are made to the original image display of the still image proxy are recorded by the Flash Movie and sent, via the browser, to the web server that delivered the Flash Movie (step <b>50</b>). The manipulations represent the net effect of changes made to each of the different types of manipulations. An example of physical manipulations made to an image in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref> may be: 10 pixel movement in x axis; 20 pixel movement in y axis; 10% increase in scale. If other types of manipulations are allowed (e.g., contrast, stretching, foreground or background color changes), then these manipulations are also sent back to the web server. Pixel movements are translated into an actual dimension value, such as inches, based on the scale of the template and the actual size of the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a display screen that appears as the information is being sent. Specifically, the x and y coordinates for the center of the still image proxy relative to the center of the ad space, and the scale percentage relative to the original size of the still image proxy are sent to the central server. These values are encoded using variables in a standard HTTP URL query string, as shown in the Address block.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The values that represent the physical image manipulations are used to modify the original predefined PDL image to match the physical modifications made to the still image proxy (step <b>60</b>). More specifically, the web server passes data to a production server. The production server uses the physical manipulations and/or production specifications to modify the original PDL-defined image in a manner identical to the modifications made to the still image proxy. This process is not a conversion of the still image proxy to a PDL image (here, a JPEG image to a Postscript file). Instead, it is the use of the recorded manipulations and appended production specifications to modify the original PDL image. This process, referred to herein as “Preflight Control: PDL Manipulations,” performs scaling, cropping and floating of the PDL image. Details of this process are set forth in the Appendix. The functions of the web server and the production server may be performed by separate servers or by a single server.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows another Preview display screen. In this example, the user has revised the original PDL image file to better fit the purchased ad space, electronically resubmitted the ad, and completed the Quick Fit process on the revised ad. In this example, the ad was scaled to 135% of its original size and is shown relative to the ad space.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a display screen of a preflight report for the revised ad. Manipulating the original PDL image can cause printability problems so a second preflight is performed and the report is displayed to the user. In the second preflight report, the final size of the PDL image file will always match the ad space dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The final step in the process is referred to herein as “Preflight Control: Final Manipulations.” In this step, crop marks are removed if they are not needed in the electronic ad file (i.e., the revised PDL image file). Removing crop marks too early may prevent the preflight software from determining the exact page size. By waiting until after the user-driven manipulations are done and preflighted, additional manipulations performed at this point do not affect the preflight report that the user sees.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a flowchart of some of the steps associated with one preferred embodiment of the preflight control PDL manipulations. The net effect of these steps is that the PDL file can be positioned relative to the job production specifications in its native format, thus best preserving overall image quality. Additional details of this process are set forth in the Appendix.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one alternative embodiment of the present invention, the scale of the static template may also be changed via the user interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref> so as to change the actual dimensions of the area in which the electronic document must fit. In the example wherein the static template is a purchased ad space, the permissible dimension changes must be pre-programmed in coordination with the publication that the ad will appear. In most instances, a publication has standard ad sizes, and thus the permissible dimension changes must fit one of the standard ad sizes. Thus, the selectable ad sizes should match the choices provided in the ad definition process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. In a tightly controlled sophisticated system, the permissible ad sizes may be further limited by the current availability of ad space in the publication.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17D</figref> further illustrate the dynamic sizing feature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows an example wherein the predetermined area in which the electronic document must fit (e.g., the purchased ad space) is 8 in×10 in, and the predefined physical dimensions of the PDL image file (e.g., the ad submitted by the customer) is also 8 in×10 in. In this example, the template and the still image proxy are the same size in the Flash Movie and the scale is automatically set to an initial value of 100%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows an example wherein the purchased ad space is still 8 in×10 in, but the ad submitted by the customer is 4 in×5 in. In this example, the template is the same size as the template in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the scale is again 100%, but the ad is shown as being 50% of the size of the template. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> shows an example wherein the purchased ad space is still 8 in×10 in, but the ad submitted by the customer is 9.6 in×12 in. In this example, the template is the same size as the template in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the scale is again initially set to 100%, but the ad is shown as being 120% of the size of the template. Thus, the dimensions of the user's submitted ad changes in relation to the dimensions of the purchased ad space. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the still image proxy is initially scaled to a value that allows its larger dimension to exactly match the corresponding dimension of the template. This feature is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>. The template and ad are the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, except that the scale is initially set to 83.3% so that the ad does not extend beyond the template border. To summarize the process, the template size is first set according to the purchased ad space, and then the ad is sized accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows one example of bindery data (bindery production specifications) being added to a still image proxy. In this example, the user added a three-hole punch, a full horizontal perf and a partial vertical perf. The location and type of bindery data is also communicated to the central server as part of the standard HTTP URL query string shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> so that the actual production data can include appropriate instructions to add the bindery data to the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows another example of production specifications that may be added to the still image proxy, other than bindery data. In this example, the dynamically generated, job parameter specific, static template is used for a two image process (two page layout). Two different still image proxies are shown, one for each page. The pages may be moved up and down relative to each other to ensure cross-page alignment. Any changes made from the initial display screen are communicated to the central server as part of the standard HTTP URL query string shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
