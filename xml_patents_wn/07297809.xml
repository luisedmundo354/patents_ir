<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention concerns a continuous method for preparing ethyl lactate by esterifying lactic acid with ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst which comprises reacting said lactic acid with ethanol in an initial ethanol/lactic acid mol ratio not less than 2.5, in the presence of a catalyst, at a reflux of the reaction medium of about 100° C. under absolute pressure ranging between 1.5 to 3 bars. Said method is characterized in that it comprises continuously extracting from the esterification reaction medium a near-azeotropic water/ethanol gas mixture: than dehydrating said gas mixture directly using molecular sieves, than recuperating from said dehydration an ethanol gas stream capable of being recycled to the esterification reaction medium and a flow consisting of water and ethanol which is subjected to distillation wherefrom is obtained water and an azeotropic water/ethanol mixture which is injected into the distillation column head of the gas mixture extracted from the esterification reaction medium; then in continuously extracting crude ethyl lactate which is subjected to purification wherefrom are obtained high purity ethyl lactate and heavy products.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethyl lactate having a purity of greater than 97% starting from lactic acid or from a lactic acid composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ethyl lactate can be used, alone or in combination with other solvents, as cleaning and degreasing agents, in a washing machine and in a nonaqueous medium, for solid surfaces, such as metal components, ceramics, glass or plastics, which have been contaminated by machining oils or greases and/or for their temporary protection.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It can also be used for the defluxing of printed circuits, which operation consists in removing the soldering flux.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The methods most widely used industrially for producing ethyl lactate consist of an esterification reaction generally catalyzed by acids, according to the reaction:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CO<sub>2</sub>H+EtOH⇄CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the implementation of this reaction is complicated due to the presence of a hydroxyl group on the lactic acid molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Esterification can thus take place between two lactic acid molecules and can then continue to give lactic acid oligomers, according to the following schemes:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="21.25mm" wi="84.58mm" file="US07297809-20071120-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the operating conditions generally used, the lactide (IV) is not formed. On the other hand, the oligomers (II), (III) and/or (V) have been detected for the good reason that, industrially, commercial lactic acid solutions are used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term “lactic acid composition” is understood now to mean any aqueous lactic acid solution, whatever its process of preparation and its characteristics, said solution having a highly variable lactic acid purity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Commercially available solutions comprising 50, 80, 87 or 90% of organic compounds may in particular be concerned, it being understood that such solutions are in fact mixtures of water, of monomers, of dimers and of higher oligomers of lactic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, in order to productively manufacture ethyl lactate (I), it is necessary not only to esterify the lactic acid monomer but also to depolycondense the oligomers of lactic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Otherwise, oligomers of ethyl lactate are obtained by esterification of the oligomers of lactic acid, according to the reaction:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CO<sub>2</sub>[CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>]<sub>n</sub>H+C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH→CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CO<sub>2</sub>[CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)C(O)]<sub>n</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O  (6)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Consequently, in order to minimize, indeed even eliminate, the formation of the oligomers of ethyl lactate originating from the reaction (6), it is necessary to use a large excess of ethanol and use is generally made of an ethanol/lactic acid molar ratio at least equal to 2.5.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, it should be noted that, during the purification of the crude ethyl lactate obtained by esterification of lactic acid with ethanol, a transesterification reaction between two ethyl lactate molecules can occur, according to the reaction:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">
<img id="EMI-C00003" he="19.05mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US07297809-20071120-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This transesterification reaction (7) is generally carried out in the presence of basic catalysts, of alkyl orthotitanates or of zirconium-based complexes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, it can also take place by heating during the purification of the ethyl lactate and, in order to prevent it, the purification is generally carried out under reduced pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the esterification of lactic acid to give ethyl lactate is rendered more complicated by:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">the presence of oligomers of lactic acid in the starting lactic acid compositions, which it is a matter of depolycondensing in order to obtain the lactic acid,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">the competition between the expected esterification (lactic acid, ethanol) and two esterifications which result in the formation of ethyl lactate oligomer (one esterification between lactic acid and ethyl lactate, another between ethanol and an oligomer of lactic acid).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">In addition, Applicants have found that it is possible to form a water/ethyl lactate binary azeotrope, thus complicating the removal of the water from the ethyl lactate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">It is therefore necessary to produce, during the esterification of lactic acid by ethanol, an ethyl lactate having a water content which is as low as possible in order to subject it to a purification consisting of a distillation under reduced pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Consequently, in order to remove the water formed according to the main reaction (1) and optionally according to the reactions (2) and (3) of the esterification reaction medium comprising a mixture of lactic acid, of ethanol, of ethyl lactate, of water and of oligomers, the simplest method is to use the water/ethanol azeotrope.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">However, this results in an ethanol/water mixture which cannot be directly recycled in the reaction medium and, consequently, results in an esterification process which is not very economic industrially.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">To achieve this, it is therefore necessary to carry out the separation of the water from the ethanol by a technique other than distillation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,639, the water is selectively removed from the reaction medium by conveying it through a pervaporation membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">However, it is expensive to operate in this way, this operation using a technology not employed to any great extent in the basic chemical industry.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0031">The present invention thus relates to a continuous process for the preparation of ethyl lactate (I) by esterification of lactic acid [or of a lactic acid composition] using ethanol, according to the reaction (1):

<br/>
which consists in reacting said lactic acid with ethanol according to an ethanol/lactic acid initial molar ratio at least equal to 2.5 and preferably ranging from 3 to 4, in the presence of a catalyst, at reflux of the reaction medium, which lies at approximately 100° C., and under an absolute pressure ranging from 1.5 to 3 bar and preferably ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 bar; said process being characterized in that a water/ethanol gas mixture close to the azeotrope is continuously extracted from the esterification reaction medium, in that this gas mixture is then dehydrated directly using molecular sieves, in that an ethanol gas stream, which can be recycled to the esterification reaction medium, and a stream composed of water and of ethanol are then recovered from said dehydration, which stream composed of water and of ethanol is subjected to a distillation, from which water and a water/ethanol azeotrope are obtained, which water/ethanol azeotrope is injected at the top of the column for the distillation of the gas mixture extracted from the esterification reaction medium, and in that crude ethyl lactate is then continuously extracted, which crude ethyl lactate is subjected to purification by fractional distillation under reduced pressure, from which an ethyl lactate of high purity and heavy products, which can optionally be recycled to the esterification reaction medium, are obtained.
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">According to the present invention, the dehydration of the gas mixture extracted from the reaction medium is carried out using the PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) technique, which consists in carrying out the selective adsorption of water by passing, at a pressure identical to that applied to the esterification reaction medium, the water/ethanol mixture close to the azeotrope in the gas form through a bed of molecular sieve (adsorption stage) and in then desorbing the water, adsorbed beforehand, by lowering the pressure below 300 mbar and preferably below 100 mbar (desorption stage).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">These two stages are carried out alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">According to the present invention, the anhydrous ethanol recovered in the adsorption stage is advantageously recycled in the esterification reaction medium, while the water-rich phase is subjected to distillation in order to recover pure water and a water/ethanol azeotrope, which is injected at the top of the column for the distillation of the water/ethanol gas mixture extracted from the reaction medium, thus providing reflux in said column, which is not equipped with a condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst which is soluble or insoluble in the esterification reaction medium.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Mention will be made, as examples of soluble catalysts which can be used according to the present invention, of 98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>or methanesulfonic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">Preferably, 98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">The catalyst according to the invention is used at molar contents ranging from 0.1% to 4% and preferably at contents ranging from 0.2% to 3%, with respect to the 100% lactic acid employed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">According to the present invention, it is possible to operate in a stirred reactor or using a “fixed bed” technology. In the latter case, solid catalysts, such as ion-exchange resins of the Amberlyst 15 type, will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The initial or start-up time for the esterification can vary to a large extent. It is generally at most equal to 12 hours and preferably between 5 and 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">The stream of the products exiting from the esterification reaction medium, comprising predominantly ethyl lactate and ethanol, along with traces of water and of heavy products (oligomers), is subjected to fractional distillation under reduced pressure according to the techniques normal to a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">An ethyl lactate with a purity at least equal to 99% is obtained as top product, and heavy products, which can be recycled in the esterification reaction medium, are obtained as distillation bottom product.</p>
