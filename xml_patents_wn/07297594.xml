<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a non-volatile semiconductor memory device and a method of manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a NAND-type flash memory, which includes a floating gate electrode and two or more gate oxide films having a different thickness in peripheral and cell sections.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, the development of a NAND-type flash memory has been made. The NAND-type flash memory is formed by gate pre-forming (or gate oxide film pre-forming) process. According to the gate pre-forming process, trench isolation is employed, and several gate oxide films having different thickness are separately formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the NAND-type flash memory, gate oxide films <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>a </i>on a silicon (Si) substrate <b>103</b> are different in their thickness between a cell/Vcc section <b>101</b> and a Vpp section <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. For this reason, a step (a) is formed in the upper surface of SiN films (stopper SiN films) <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>102</b><i>c </i>on gate electrodes <b>101</b><i>b </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>. For example, the step (a) is a factor of causing the following disadvantage in shallow-trench isolation (STI) formation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a difference is made in the thickness of SiN films when the upper surface of a buried insulator <b>104</b> is removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) using SiN films <b>101</b><i>c </i>and <b>102</b><i>c </i>as a stopper. More specifically, the SiN film <b>102</b><i>c </i>of the Vpp section <b>102</b> is thinner than the SiN film <b>101</b><i>c </i>of the cell/Vcc section <b>101</b>. The excess thickness reduction of the SiN film <b>102</b><i>c </i>is a factor of reducing the a height (h) to the gate oxide film <b>102</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the gate oxide film <b>102</b><i>a </i>is easily damaged by etching (e.g., wet etching) after CMP. The gate oxide film <b>102</b><i>a </i>being damaged is a factor in causing failure such as gate leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the NAND-type flash memory has a high-voltage row decoder circuit <b>111</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the row decoder circuit <b>111</b> is arranged in a peripheral region (corresponding to Vpp section <b>102</b>) adjacent to a cell array region (Cell Array) <b>110</b> corresponding to the cell/Vcc section <b>101</b>. Normally, the row decoder circuit <b>111</b> is formed using a gate oxide film for Vpp system (Vpp oxide film <b>102</b><i>a</i>). In other words, a high-voltage transistor exists in the row decoder circuit <b>111</b> of the NAND-type flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conversely, a Vcc oxide film <b>101</b><i>a </i>is used, in general, in the cell array region <b>110</b>, a guard ring <b>112</b> arranged between the cell array region <b>110</b> and the row decoder circuit <b>111</b> and a dummy AA pattern <b>113</b> near the row decoder circuit <b>111</b>. For this reason, when a film to make a buried insulator <b>104</b> is subjected to CMP in STI formation, the SiN film <b>102</b><i>c </i>of the row decoder circuit <b>111</b> is excessively reduced in thickness as compared with the SiN film <b>101</b><i>c</i>. This is a factor in causing the foregoing failure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the conventional case, it is possible to readily realize the NAND-type flash memory having several gate oxide films of different thicknesses according to the gate pre-forming process. However, the stopper SiN film of the row decoder circuit is greatly reduced in thickness by CMP in the STI formation. As a result, the gate oxide film under the stopper SiN film is easily damaged; for this reason, there is a problem that failure such as gate leakage occurs.</p>

In other words, the row decoder circuit <b>31</b> includes a high-voltage transistor (not shown) formed on the surface of the Si substrate <b>11</b>. The high-voltage transistor has a structure in which a poly gate electrode (second gate electrode film) <b>31</b><i>b </i>and a SiN film (second mask insulator) <b>31</b><i>c </i>are stacked on the Vpp gate oxide film <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The SiN film <b>31</b><i>c </i>functions as the stopper in CMP. The guard ring <b>41</b> is formed on each surface of well regions <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B and N-well (NW) <b>41</b>A. Each guard ring <b>41</b> has a structure in which a poly gate electrode (second gate electrode film) <b>41</b><i>b </i>and a SiN film (second mask insulator) <b>41</b><i>c </i>are stacked on the Vpp gate oxide film <b>41</b><i>a</i>. The SiN film <b>41</b><i>c </i>functions as the stopper in CMP. The dummy AA pattern <b>51</b> is formed on the surface of the Si substrate <b>11</b> adjacent to the row decoder circuit <b>31</b>. The dummy AA pattern <b>51</b> has a structure in which a poly gate electrode (second gate electrode film) <b>51</b><i>b </i>and a SiN film (second mask insulator film) <b>51</b><i>c </i>are stacked on the Vpp gate oxide film <b>51</b><i>a</i>. The SiN film <b>51</b><i>c </i>functions as the stopper in CMP.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An STI isolation region <b>12</b> burying insulator is formed between regions (<b>21</b> and <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> and <b>31</b>, <b>31</b> and <b>51</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Conventionally, the guard ring and dummy pattern in the periphery of the row decoder circuit have been formed using a Vcc oxide film. The guard ring and dummy pattern are formed in a high-breakdown-voltage oxide film region. Namely, the guard ring <b>41</b> and the dummy AA pattern <b>51</b> are formed using Vpp oxide films <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>a</i>, respectively. In this way, it is possible to offset the step (global step shown by “a” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) on the upper surface of the stopper SiN film <b>31</b><i>c </i>around the high-voltage transistor of the row decoder circuit <b>31</b>. As a result, the SiN film <b>31</b> is prevented from being excessively reduced in thickness, so that a sufficient height (h) to the Vpp oxide film <b>31</b><i>a </i>can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The structure described above is employed, and thereby, the following effect is obtained. It is possible to prevent only residual film thickness of the SiN film <b>31</b><i>c </i>from being greatly reduced between the guard ring <b>41</b> and the row decoder circuit <b>31</b> and between the row decoder circuit <b>31</b> and the dummy AA pattern <b>51</b>. Therefore, it is possible to solve the conventional problem of reducing a margin for CMP when gate pre-forming process is employed because the NAND-type flash memory has the high-voltage transistor in the row decoder section. As a result, the Vpp oxide film <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the row decoder circuit <b>31</b> is prevented from being easily damaged, and failure such as gate leakage is prevented.</p>
