<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to telecommunication, and more particularly to high density perceptual evaluation of sound quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Today, modern telecommunications systems often perform complex operations when transmitting signals through the telecommunications network. These operations generally have non-linear effects on the signal inputs. As a result, it is often not possible to model the effects of the network by simulating the additive affect of each component of the network. In particular, the affect of the network on speech is not easily derivable from studying the network's affect on a simple test signal such as a sine wave.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, voice communication signals generally are tested using voice generation and analyzing equipment in the form of a telecommunication testing system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing an exemplary prior art telecommunication testing configuration <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the telecommunication testing configuration <b>100</b> includes a system under test (SUT) <b>102</b>, such as a telecommunication system, in communication with a test system <b>104</b>. One technique for testing the SUT <b>102</b> for voice quality of service (QoS) is call generation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Call Generation is a testing mode in which the test system <b>104</b> creates telephone traffic by executing compiled call sequences (scripts). Typically, the test system <b>104</b> provides a maximal load on the SUT <b>102</b> to test the SUT <b>102</b>. In particular, the test system <b>104</b> places voice data <b>108</b> on the input channels of the SUT <b>102</b> and receives degraded output data <b>110</b> from the SUT <b>102</b> in real time. Once received, the degraded output data <b>110</b> is tested using a perceptual evaluation of sound quality (PESQ) unit <b>106</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a conventional PESQ unit <b>106</b>. The PESQ unit <b>106</b> receives degraded output data <b>110</b> from the SUT using a plurality of input channels. PESQ is calculated for each channel, not for a channels set, as it may be understood from the description. Once received, the PESQ unit <b>106</b> compares the degraded output data <b>110</b> to reference data to determine the perceptual evaluation of sound quality of the degraded output data <b>110</b>. This quality is represented by a number referred to as a PESQ result <b>200</b>. Generally, the PESQ result <b>200</b> is a number having a value between −0.5 and 4.5, which indicates the signal quality of the data returned from the SUT. Typically, a PESQ result value of 4.0-4.5 indicates high signal quality, while a PESQ result value bellow 2.0 indicates low signal quality.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In operation, the PESQ unit <b>106</b> should calculate the PESQ result prior to the end of a subsequent data frame, as illustrated next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates conventional exemplary frame data <b>300</b>. Generally, degraded data output from the SUT is divided into frames <b>300</b> of voice data, for example, 8-second frames of voice data. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates voice data divided into three 8-second frames <b>300</b>, the first frame F<b>1</b>, followed by the second frame F<b>2</b> and the third frame F<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In operation, the PESQ unit processes each frame F<b>1</b>-F<b>3</b> of the frame data <b>300</b> to determine the PESQ result for the particular frame. However, as mentioned above, each frame F<b>1</b>-F<b>3</b> should be fully processed before the end of the subsequent frame, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a frame processing sequencing during proper signal quality evaluation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, processing is started on the first frame F<b>1</b> at time t<sub>0 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, processing is started on the second frame F<b>2</b> at time t<sub>1 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>2</sub>, and processing is started on the third frame F<b>3</b> at time t<sub>2 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, for proper signal quality evaluation, frame F<b>1</b> should be processed prior to the end of frame F<b>2</b>. That is, the PESQ result for frame F<b>1</b> should be calculated prior to time t<sub>2</sub>, as shown by the PESQ F<b>1</b> result <b>302</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the PESQ result for frame F<b>2</b> should be calculated prior to time t<sub>3</sub>, as shown by the PESQ F<b>2</b> result <b>302</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, the test system can process the voice data in real-time. However, if this cannot be maintained, problems can occur during voice data processing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates an improper frame processing sequencing during delayed signal quality evaluation. As above, processing is started on the first frame F<b>1</b> at time t<sub>0 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, processing is started on the second frame F<b>2</b> at time t<sub>1 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>2</sub>, and processing is started on the third frame F<b>3</b> at time t<sub>2 </sub>and completed at time t<sub>3</sub>. However, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the PESQ F<b>1</b> result <b>302</b><i>a </i>for the first frame F<b>1</b> is not calculated until after the second frame F<b>2</b> has been processed. That is, the PESQ F<b>1</b> result <b>302</b><i>a </i>for the first frame F<b>1</b> is not calculated until after time t<sub>2</sub>. As a result, the test system will be unable to process the voice data in real-time and will experience problems because the voice data is entering the PESQ unit faster than the output of the unit is being generated. For example, if the PESQ result is not calculated before the subsequent frame is processed the PESQ unit will not evaluate some of incoming frames.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Process delays, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, can result from attempting to process too many voice data channels simultaneously. Thus, the speed of the test system defines the number of data channels the system can process simultaneously. For example, faster test systems can process more channels than slower test systems. Unfortunately, the prior art PESQ unit <b>106</b> is computationally slow, and as a result, prior art test systems are severely limited on the number of data channels that can be processed. Moreover, prior art PESQ units generally utilize floating point calculations, which can be exceedingly slow on PESQ DSPs that do not have co-processors to assist in floating point calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the foregoing, there is a need for systems and methods for high density telecommunication testing. The systems and methods should be capable of performing quality of service (QoS) testing on the SUT, and further, should support an increased number of simultaneous data channels without distorting the performance of the SUT.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention address these needs by providing a telecommunications testing system that utilizes a fixed point based perceptual evaluation of sound quality logic to increase computational speed. As a result, a telecommunications testing system of the embodiments of the present invention can support an increased number of simultaneous data channels. In one embodiment, a method is disclosed for testing a quality of communication data received from a SUT. The method includes storing reference test data comprising a plurality of data segments, and receiving degraded test data, which comprises a plurality of data segments, from the SUT. The data segments are located in the degraded test data matched to related data segments in the reference test data. Further, the data segments in the degraded test data are compared to the corresponding data segments in the reference test data using a fixed point operation. In one aspect, the degraded test data can be normalized prior to locating the data segments, for example, utilizing a fixed point Fourier transform. Also, a receive filter can be applied to the normalized test data utilizing a fixed point operation. Further, a perceptual evaluation signal quality (PESQ) result can be generated based on the comparison of the data segments in the degraded test data to corresponding data segments in the reference test data. The PESQ result optionally can be stored to a QoS data file.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A system for testing a quality of communication data received from a SUT is disclosed in a further embodiment of the present invention. The system includes an encoder that encodes reference test data. As above, the reference test data comprises a plurality of data segments. The system also includes a decoder that decodes degraded test data received from the SUT in real-time during testing of the SUT. As with the reference test data, the degraded test data comprises a plurality of data segments. Further included in the system is a fixed point based logic unit that compares the data segments in the degraded test data to corresponding data segments in the reference test data using a fixed point operation. In one aspect, the fixed point based logic locates data segments in the degraded test data and corresponds data segments in the degraded test data to related data segments in the reference test data.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An invention is disclosed for a telecommunications testing system that utilizes a fixed point based perceptual evaluation of sound quality logic to increase computational speed. As a result, a telecommunications testing system of the embodiments of the present invention can support an increased number of simultaneous data channels. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3C</figref> have been described above in terms of the prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing a telecommunication test system <b>400</b> having fixed point based PESQ logic, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The test system <b>400</b> includes an encoder <b>412</b> and a decoder <b>414</b>. In communication with both the encoder <b>412</b> and the decoder <b>414</b> is processing logic <b>416</b> that coordinates the process flow of the various system components. Further, fixed point PESQ logic <b>402</b> is included that determines the QoS of the SUT. Coupled to the encoder <b>412</b> is a data bank <b>408</b>, which is used to store the encoded speech data <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present invention preprocess test data prior to testing the SUT. In one embodiment, the encoder <b>412</b> receives a test data file <b>404</b>, which includes speech data that will be utilized as test data for the SUT. For example, the speech data can comprise a plurality of spoken sentences specifically selected to test various aspects of the SUT. To reduce the amount of data transmitted on the data channels, the speech data from the test data file <b>404</b> is compressed using the encoder <b>412</b>, which encodes the speech data into a format the SUT will expect to receive. The encoded speech data <b>410</b> is stored in the data bank <b>408</b> for later use during testing of the SUT.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During actual testing of the SUT, the stored encoded speech data <b>410</b> is transmitted to the SUT, which decodes and processes the speech data. The SUT then encodes the processed speech data using a codec and transmits the encoded speech data to the test system <b>400</b>. Once received, the test system decodes the speech data using the decoder <b>414</b> of the test system <b>400</b>. The test system <b>400</b> can then analyze the speech data using the fixed point PESQ logic <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be described in greater detail subsequently, the fixed point PESQ logic <b>402</b> compares the processed speech data to reference speech data, such as the test data file <b>404</b>. The fixed point PESQ logic <b>402</b> then generates PESQ result data based on the comparison and stores the PESQ result data in a QoS data file <b>406</b> for later use. The QoS data file <b>406</b> can be stored, for example, on mass storage and/or removable storage such as floppy disks, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, and/or DVDs. Optionally, the QoS data file <b>406</b> can be transmitted to other computer systems using a network, such as a local area network (LAN) and/or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As will be appreciated, a test system of the embodiments of the present invention can originate and terminate a call through a switch or similar telecommunication device. Moreover, the circuit type of the originating channel can be the same as or different from that of the terminating channel. That is, the encoder <b>304</b> can encode the speech data into one particular format, such as PCM, and the encoder <b>306</b> can be designed to receive and decode data encoded in a different format, such as ADPCM. As such, embodiments of the present invention can be utilized to create multiple telephone calls, answer calls, confirm that calls are correctly established, create and respond to unique tones, measure and display call statistics in real time, and generate calls on one circuit type and terminate calls on another circuit type.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing a method for generating PESQ result data using fixed point based PESQ computational logic, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Preprocess operations are performed in operation <b>502</b>. Preprocess can include generating reference test data, transmitting the reference test data to a SUT, receiving degraded speech data from the SUT, and other preprocess operations that will be apparent to those skilled in the art after a careful reading of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation <b>504</b>, signal normalization is performed. More specifically, the amplitude of the received signal is brought to a particular energy level. As discussed above, speech data is represented in the test system using a sequence of frames of speech data. The speech data itself comprises a plurality of values that represent the amplitude of a membrane during specific times during the data frame, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a pictorial representation of speech data showing amplitude values for an exemplary membrane <b>600</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, speech data represents the various amplitude values <b>602</b><i>a</i>-<b>602</b><i>b </i>for an exemplary membrane <b>600</b> during a frame of speech data. Specifically, the amplitude <b>602</b><i>a </i>is a measure of the distortion of the membrane <b>600</b> needed to reproduce a particular sound. Similarly, amplitude <b>602</b><i>b </i>is a measure of the distortion of the membrane <b>600</b> needed to reproduce a particular sound, however, amplitude <b>602</b><i>b </i>is in a direction opposite that of amplitude <b>602</b><i>a</i>. Generally, this amplitude is expressed as a 16-bit value, which can vary from about −2<sup>15 </sup>to about 2<sup>15</sup>−1. Thus, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the signal is normalized such that an average of the energy of the signal is a particular value. As a result, the speech data signal is brought a particular energy level for subsequent computation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation <b>506</b>, an IRS (Intermediate Reference System) filter is applied to the speech data. As is known, IRS stands for a typical phone receiver. Broadly speaking, the IRS filter operates as a receive filter for the speech data. As described above, during testing the test system transmits reference data to the SUT and receives degraded speech data from the SUT. However, the actual receiver utilized to receive the degraded data can introduce noise or changes into the speech data, which should not be viewed by the test system as further data degradation. The IRS filter simulates a telephone receiver and filters out low and high harmonics of the incoming signal. For instance, it is desired to compare reference and degraded data after it passes a receiver, and not before.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Speech segments then are located within the degraded speech data frame and the corresponding reference speech data frame, in operation <b>508</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary reference speech data frame <b>700</b> and a corresponding degraded speech data frame <b>700</b>′. The reference speech data frame <b>700</b> illustrates a frame having two speech segments, a first segment <b>702</b> followed by a second segment <b>704</b>. During operation <b>508</b>, the test system examines the reference speech data frame <b>700</b> to obtain the location of the first segment <b>702</b> and the second segment <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, the test system examines the degraded speech data frame <b>700</b>′. Because of delays and other transmission properties, the degraded speech data frame <b>700</b>′ may be slightly time shifted and/or broken with respect to the reference speech data frame <b>700</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the first and second degraded speech segments <b>702</b>′ and <b>704</b>′ are slightly delayed as compared to the first and second speech segments <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> in the reference speech data frame <b>700</b>. In addition, the first degraded segment <b>702</b>′ has been broken into two sub-segments <b>702</b><i>a</i>′ and <b>702</b><i>b</i>′, which correspond to sub-segments <b>702</b><i>a </i>and <b>702</b><i>b </i>of the reference speech data frame <b>700</b>. Hence, during operation <b>508</b>, the locations of the speech segments and sub-segments of the reference and degraded speech data frames are determined.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the speech segments from the degraded speech data frame are linked to corresponding speech segments from the reference speech data frame, in operation <b>510</b>. Since it is known that the degraded speech data frame is similar to the reference speech data frame, a correspondence of signal data is calculated in operation <b>510</b>. For example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the test system examines the degraded speech data sub-segment <b>702</b><i>b</i>′ and attempts to find corresponding speech sub-segment in the reference speech data frame <b>700</b>. In this case, the test system will correspond the degraded speech sub-segment <b>702</b><i>b</i>′ with the reference speech sub-segment <b>702</b><i>b</i>. In a similar manner, the test system will correspond the degraded speech sub-segment <b>702</b><i>a</i>′ with the reference speech sub-segment <b>702</b><i>a</i>, and the degraded speech segment <b>704</b>′ with the reference speech segment <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once a correspondence is found, the test system performs fixed-point based PESQ operations to generate the PESQ result, in operation <b>512</b>. More specifically, the test system compares corresponding speech segments to generate the PESQ result for the frame. Post process operations then are performed in operation <b>514</b>. Post process operations can include storing the PESQ result in a quality of service file, analyzing the quality of service file, and other post process operations that will apparent to those skilled in the art after a careful reading of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As mentioned above, embodiments of the present invention increase processing speed and efficiency by utilizing fixed point signal processing. Unlike floating point signal processing, fixed point signal processing does not require co-processors for processing efficiency. Further, fixed point signal processing can be performed much faster than floating point signal processing. In particular, embodiments of the present invention utilize a 32-bit fast Fourier transform to process degraded data. A Fourier transform decomposes or separates a waveform or function into sinusoids of different frequency which sum to the original waveform. It identifies or distinguishes the different frequency sinusoids and their respective amplitudes. For example, for sound files up to 8 sec. long, a Fourier transform for up to 8192 samples may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention may employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. Further, the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms, such as producing, identifying, determining, or comparing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Any of the operations described herein that form part of the invention are useful machine operations. The invention also relates to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may be a general purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular, various general purpose machines may be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required operations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data, which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include read-only memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, magnetic tapes, and other optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.</p>
