<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A robotic hand and arm where the fingers are driven by rotational motors with drums, and pulled with cables using rolling friction. The hand extends into a robotic arm through a wrist wherein the wrist is controlled by pneumatic cylinders. Each finger preferably is provided with four manufactured parts and a single pulley. The thumb is provided with three pulleys for independent distal movement. Cables wraps around or over pulleys, eliminating tight bends. A glove is provided about the robotic hand which provides a compressive, liquid resistant membrane.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a robotic or artificial arm and more particularly a robotic hand and fingers, lightweight and dexterous, having human like manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Robotic arms, hands and fingers have been in use and disclosed by others with the usual mechanics using metal, bearings, cables, and pulleys. The use of robotic hands in various applications is apparent today. The need for robotic arms and hands has been prevalent in areas such as prosthetics, space exploration or other work environments where a human hand is not possible or desired. In many work environments, or for the sheer realism, human like manipulation is needed for conducting tasks which require precision, for instance in grasping objects with the necessary strength and at the same having sufficient control and dexterity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most robotic hands have a plurality of digits, the little, ring, middle, index and thumb. Each finger is segmented into phalanges, where the tip is the distal phalange, followed by the middle (or medial) phalange, the proximal phalange and then the metacarpal at the knuckle. In constructing robotic hands with the detail, functionality and realism of human hands, the assembly can be highly complex and difficult to maintain. Servicing in turn is both difficult and often. In addition, certain assemblies result in a bulky design and also become too costly in both parts, manufacturing and as mentioned servicing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many robot hands have been disclosed as driven with pneumatics or electric motors. Other robot hands similar to such mechanisms are being developed by such entities as Utah/MIT, Stanford/JPL, Okada, Barrett, Bologna University, DLR German Aerospace Center, LMS, DIST Genova, Robonaut NASA, Tokyo and Karlsruhe University, Ultralight research center of Karlsruhe, Gifu University Japan. Others have incorporated tactile capacitive sensing, such as Pressure Profile Systems Inc. onto robot hands. However, none of these attempts have addressed or solved the issues of providing a robot hand and arm of a compact, inexpensive, light weight product having sufficient power and necessary control.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prior attempts discussed above have the disadvantages and problems associated with fingers being too complex and difficult to build. In addition, power and dexterity is insufficient and cost for manufacturing such devices is much too high. Forearms have been designed but are too bulky and large to work on a robot. Simplicity in the mechanism for the movement in the fingers of the robot hand is missing. In addition, the use of sliding friction leads to cable going slack and other associated problems such as jerky motions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need for a solution to such problems such that a robot arm is both efficient and easier to manufacture, having sufficient power and dexterity in movement in various directions and at the same time provide for realistic and humanly realistic movement. It is accordingly a principal object of the invention to provide for robot hand with the power, speed, dexterity, control and feedback of a human hand at a minimal cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An embodiment of the present invention is a robotic arm and in particular a robotic hand using no sliding friction except through a cable housing, but instead operates with rolling friction using cables. The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for the robotic hand wherein the drum drive, cable housings, rolling friction, one pulley, ligament distal phalange, are designed to work together.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One object of the present invention is to provide for a low cost and easily assemble robotic hand, for instance the preferred embodiment provides for only four manufactured parts for each finger of the robot hand. In the preferred embodiment, each finger employs one pulley, three pins, eight bearings and seven cables.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide for a cable housing that is compressible allowing for compliance at the finger tips and the cable housing prevents the fingers from moving as the wrist moves</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for removable fingers for servicing and providing bearings on the outside of the knuckle that allow the cables to pass through the center of the finger.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the preferred embodiment has no screw thread and no fasteners. An entire finger can be snapped together in the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the invention provides for limited parts and easy assemble; fingers for instance, only use one pulley; cables wrap around the pulleys eliminating the need for additional pulleys or tight bends; the thumb may use three pulleys for additional capabilities such as independent distal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention allows for the use of larger and stronger cables for greater grip strength of the hand.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another object of the present invention allows for a greater life of the cables in that the rolling friction allows for gentle bends of the cables and requires no tools to repair.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object is to provide for the use of a cable ligament between the distal and middle phalange, instead of a rod connection. The ligament bends through two different radii, which gives a bending ratio that is different between the middle and distal phalange.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention can be made entirely non metallic with Kevlar cables (or its equivalent), Torlon bearings (or its equivalent), and carbon pins.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the palm section of the present invention is shaped for holding tools in three positions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the present invention provides for the robotic hand to be driven by a glove over a human hand, or a hand held device that an operator can select specific grasps.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, an object of the present invention provides for sensitivity in touch through the use of capacitive sensors for measuring fingertip pressure, allowing for feedback to human driven manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another object of the present invention, the robotic hand is realistic in movement and provides various human-like range of motions, for example, providing for an arc position of the hand and other grasping positions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other embodiments of the present invention are further made apparent, in the remainder of the present document, to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The description above and below and the drawings of the present document focus on one or more currently preferred embodiments of the present invention and also describe some exemplary optional features and/or alternative embodiments. The description and drawings are for the purpose of illustration and not limitation. Those of ordinary skill in the art would recognize variations, modifications, and alternatives. Such variations, modifications, and alternatives are also within the scope of the present invention. Section titles are terse and are for convenience only.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is a robotic hand <b>1</b> having a plurality of articulated digits or fingers. In the preferred embodiment there are five digits, an index finger <b>4</b>, a middle finger <b>6</b>, ring finger <b>8</b>, a little finger <b>10</b> and a thumb <b>12</b>. Each finger and thumb further comprises a plurality of phalanges. The index finger <b>4</b> comprises a metacarpal phalange <b>30</b>, connected to a proximal phalange <b>40</b>, connected to a middle phalange <b>50</b>, connected to a distal phalange <b>60</b>. The little finger <b>10</b> comprises the same set of phalanges, a metacarpal <b>35</b>, proximal <b>45</b>, middle <b>55</b> and distal <b>65</b>. The thumb <b>12</b> also comprises the same set of phalanges, a metacarpal <b>110</b>, proximal <b>115</b>, middle <b>120</b> and distal <b>125</b>. The preferred embodiment further comprises a palm <b>15</b> integrally connected to each of the plurality of digits wherein each digit is removable from the palm section <b>15</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the palm section <b>15</b> is one piece. A system of air cylinders <b>18</b> (i.e. pneumatic cylinders), drums <b>20</b>, and rotational motors <b>22</b> (for instance servo motors), located in the robotic arm <b>2</b>, controls the hand <b>1</b> movement. A plurality of cables per each digit are run through respective compressible cable housings <b>25</b> and connected throughout the digits over at least a single pulley per digit and provides movement to the various phalanges of each digit. The cables do not slide across any surface except the cable housing. In particular, since the cables roll along the surface of the joints in the digits and/or over the pulley, friction in the digits is minimized. The cables only slide across a liner, preferably a Teflon liner, in the cable housing <b>25</b>. The cable housings <b>25</b> which run across the wrist <b>27</b> joint allow a constant length of cable and a compliant springy action at the fingertips. The cable length does not vary as the drums <b>20</b> rotate, keeping a constant tension on the cable. The compressible cable housing <b>25</b> allows the wrist <b>27</b> to move without affecting the position of the digits. The wrist <b>27</b> is pivotally connected to the palm <b>15</b> through a plurality of wrist bearings. The two pivot axes of the wrist <b>27</b> are in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a single digit, the index digit <b>4</b> of a robotic hand of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated in an exploded diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention. The metacarpal phalange <b>30</b> of the finger is integrally connected to the palm <b>15</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The index digit <b>4</b> comprises a plurality of phalanges which are the segments between the joints/knuckles which further comprise a plurality of bearings and a plurality of shafts or pins, to hold the digit together. In the preferred embodiment, the digit <b>4</b> comprises a metacarpal <b>30</b>; a proximal phalange <b>40</b> connected to the metacarpal <b>30</b> via a shaft <b>70</b>; a middle (or medial) phalange <b>50</b> connected to the proximal phalange <b>40</b> via shaft <b>70</b>; and a distal phalange <b>60</b> connected to the middle phalange <b>50</b> via a shaft <b>70</b>. Each shaft is held together on each phalange by way of providing bearings <b>75</b>, <b>77</b> around each shaft <b>70</b>. Each phalange pivots about the shaft <b>70</b>, assisted by bearings <b>75</b>, <b>77</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, distal phalange <b>60</b> is connected to middle phalange <b>50</b> by bearings <b>75</b> provided at each end of a shaft <b>70</b> through an aperture of a distal knuckle <b>62</b> integral of distal phalange <b>60</b> that is formed to engage middle phalange <b>50</b>. Middle phalange <b>50</b> is connected to proximal phalange <b>40</b> by bearings <b>75</b> provided at each end of a shaft <b>70</b> through an aperture of a middle knuckle <b>52</b> integral of middle phalange <b>50</b> that is formed to engage proximal phalange <b>40</b>. Proximal phalange <b>40</b> is connected to metacarpal <b>30</b> by bearings <b>77</b> at each end of a shaft <b>70</b> through an aperture of a proximal knuckle <b>42</b> integral of proximal phalange <b>40</b> that is formed to engage metacarpal <b>30</b>. Between bearings <b>77</b>, pulley <b>80</b> is provided in proximal knuckle <b>42</b>. The metacarpal <b>30</b> comprises side bearings <b>79</b> and truncated shafts <b>32</b> for engaging with palm section <b>15</b>, such that the side bearings <b>79</b> snap upon the corresponding prong of the palm <b>15</b>. The side bearings <b>79</b> and truncated shafts <b>32</b> snap into palm <b>15</b>, allowing for ease in removal of any digit when necessary for servicing or adjustments and allows for a plurality of cables to pass through the palm <b>15</b> into each digit. Therefore, each finger or digit is conveniently removable.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An embodiment of the finger <b>4</b> assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where the finger phalanges are shown assembled and in the bent position but disconnected from palm section <b>15</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the assemble finger <b>4</b> where each of the metacarpal <b>30</b>, proximal phalange <b>40</b>, middle phalange <b>50</b>, and distal phalange <b>60</b> are connected as an integral finger <b>4</b>. Palm section <b>15</b> is shown to illustrate the inner structure of the palm section <b>15</b> for connection with truncated shafts <b>32</b> of metacarpal <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, further illustrates palm section <b>15</b> and the connection to truncated shafts <b>32</b> of metacarpal <b>30</b>, and defines openings for the respective cables to move through.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a top view of a digit such as index finger <b>4</b>, illustrated in a bent or constricted position at the middle knuckle <b>52</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional side view of finger <b>4</b> along the positional line taken on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each phalange pivots about its respective shaft and knuckle. The plurality of shafts <b>70</b> are preferably comprised of steel but may be comprised of any similar or suitable material. A plurality of cables is provided throughout each digit, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, cables <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> are provided for movement of the middle phalange <b>50</b> and distal phalange <b>60</b>. In essence, cables <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> are a single continuous cable, in which cable <b>91</b> extends from distal phalange <b>60</b> around drum <b>20</b> located in arm <b>2</b> and wraps around pulley <b>80</b> as cable <b>92</b>, to extend to the middle phalange <b>50</b>, around the underside of the diameter of middle knuckle <b>52</b>. For purposes of clarity cables <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, are described as separate cables moving the phalanges in different directions. Cables <b>91</b>, <b>92</b>, powered by the rotational motor <b>22</b>, moved by drum <b>20</b> and routed through proximal knuckle <b>42</b> over pulley <b>80</b>, controls movement of the distal and middle phalanges of the finger using rolling friction for control. The cables do not slide across any surface except the cable housing <b>25</b>. Pulley <b>80</b> may comprise of a plastic or metal or other suitable material. In a preferred embodiment, fingers <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>10</b> each comprise seven cables; and thumb <b>12</b> comprise eight cables. Having seven cables per finger and eight cables for the thumb, allows for sixteen degrees of freedom in the hand.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates how cable <b>91</b> is pulled around drum <b>20</b>, and about the topside of the pulley <b>80</b> and about the topside of the diameter of middle knuckle <b>52</b>. When engaged, cable <b>91</b> pulls the middle phalange <b>50</b> and distal phalange <b>60</b> in the upward direction (as shown by the dotted image) through rolling friction. Cable <b>92</b> is wrapped around pulley <b>80</b>, crossing on the underside of pulley <b>80</b>, and extending around the diameter of middle knuckle <b>52</b>; a reversal of the pull causes middle phalange <b>50</b> to move in the downward direction. At both points of contact with the pulley and middle knuckle <b>52</b>, cable <b>92</b> moves middle phalange <b>50</b> with rolling friction. Cable <b>92</b> pulls middle phalange <b>50</b> in the downward direction, by wrapping about pulley <b>80</b>, which prevents rubbing on the metacarpal <b>30</b> when moved in the down position. Cables <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> and all of the plurality of cables used throughout the hand <b>1</b> wrapped around or about a pulley such that no sliding friction occurs, and the movement uses rolling friction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a top view of a digit such as index finger <b>4</b>, illustrated in a bent or constricted position at the middle knuckle <b>52</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional side view of finger <b>4</b> along the positional line taken on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> demonstrates the location of cable <b>93</b> extending from the proximal phalange <b>40</b>, over the diameter of middle knuckle <b>52</b> and underneath the diameter of distal knuckle <b>62</b>. Cable <b>93</b> is the ligament cable, which when engaged, pulls distal phalange <b>60</b> in a downward direction using rolling friction. When cable <b>92</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, pulls down the middle phalange <b>50</b>, cable <b>93</b> pulls distal phalange <b>60</b> downward as a function of the diameters of the middle knuckle <b>52</b> and the distal knuckle <b>62</b>. The ligament bends through two different radii, which gives a bending ratio that is different between the middle phalange <b>50</b> and the distal phalange <b>60</b>. For instance, the middle phalange <b>50</b> may bend 90 degrees and the distal phalange <b>60</b> will only bend 60 degrees similar to a real finger. In the preferred embodiment, the cables have a large bend radii of no smaller than approximately half the diameter of the finger. Such a large bend radii allows the use of larger and stronger cables for greater grip strength. In addition, there is no backward bends of the cables which ensures for greater life of the cables.</p>

The finger <b>4</b> is shown bent down at the proximal knuckle between the metacarpal <b>30</b> and proximal <b>40</b> phalanges. Drum <b>20</b> and rotational motor <b>22</b> drive cables <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> that pass through the palm <b>15</b> and rotate finger <b>4</b> downward at the proximal knuckle <b>42</b>. Cable <b>94</b> is wrapped about the top side of the diameter of the proximal knuckle <b>42</b>, and using rolling friction to control proximal phalange <b>40</b> pulls proximal phalange <b>40</b> in the upward direction. Cable <b>95</b> is wrapped about the underside of the diameter of the proximal knuckle <b>42</b>, and using rolling friction to control proximal phalange <b>40</b> pulls proximal phalange <b>40</b> in the downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> cable <b>96</b> is connected to one side of metacarpal phalange <b>30</b> of finger <b>4</b>, wrapped about drum <b>20</b>, and extended to the opposing side of metacarpal phalange <b>30</b>, as cable <b>97</b>. Through the rotation of drum <b>10</b> by rotational motor <b>22</b> a range of sideways movement for the entire finger assembly <b>4</b> is achieved by the push or pull cables <b>96</b> and <b>97</b>. As cable <b>96</b> is pulled in a clockwise direction, finger <b>4</b> moves accordingly. As cable <b>97</b> is pulled in a counter clockwise direction, finger <b>4</b> moves accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> show the distal phalange <b>125</b> of the thumb <b>12</b> assembly comprising a plurality of capacitive plate pressure sensors <b>100</b> and a spongy insulative pad <b>102</b> coming into contact with a hard object <b>108</b> shown in dotted outline, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the capacitor plates <b>100</b> located on the distal phalange <b>125</b> but can be applied anywhere on the digit for measuring pressure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the pressure sensors <b>100</b> measure the capacitance between a painted metallic surface on the phalange <b>125</b> and a metallic foil lined outer layer on the phalange. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pressure sensors <b>100</b> measure the capacity between a painted metallic surface on the phalanges and a metallic foil lined glove (not shown). An embodiment of the present invention further comprises a plurality of coaxial cables which prevent cross talk and having a voltage that is non-linear due to a set of bumps or friction material (not shown) located on the outside of the phalanges and the compressive nature of the closed cell foam in the glove. The frictional material also reduces slippage between the finger and the glove.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described, the capacitive pressure sensors or capacitor plates <b>100</b> on the finger tips such as distal phalange <b>125</b>, provide a non-linear voltage such that when a finger contacts an object <b>108</b>, there is a sensitive range for delicate work and a coarse range for gripping large objects. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, distal phalange <b>125</b> makes contact with a hard object <b>108</b>. In the preferred embodiment, this is accomplished through the use of a specific thickness of closed cell foam in the glove and carefully designed bumps on the finger tips. The bumps allow for gripping on the glove and controlling the capacitive sensor response. A grounded metal foil lined glove being one side of the capacitive sensor, and the other side being metal painted phalanges with attached wires, makes the assembly more robust than individual sensors. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>13</b>, the attached capacitor's electrical wire <b>104</b> or wires, run through wire routing guides inside the finger assembly and is connected to the capacitor plate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As discussed, in the preferred embodiment, there is only one pulley <b>80</b> per digit <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>. The pulley and cable combination gives a torque multiplication at the metacarpal <b>30</b> joint increasing the grip strength of the hand <b>1</b>. A cable (such as cable <b>91</b>) that runs from the distal phalange <b>60</b> to the middle phalange <b>50</b> reduces the need for two extra cables per digit.</p>

In this embodiment, a left hand <b>1</b> is shown comprising a plurality of articulated digits or fingers. In the preferred embodiment there are five digits, the little finger <b>10</b>, ring finger <b>8</b>, middle finger <b>6</b>, index finger <b>4</b>, and thumb <b>12</b>. The preferred embodiment further comprises a palm <b>15</b> of one piece, integrally connected to each of the plurality of digits wherein each digit is removable from the palm <b>15</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the side view of the hand <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The hand <b>1</b> illustrates the human like grasping capabilities made possible by the finger assemblies connected to palm <b>15</b> for gripping a variety of objects of different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This embodiment can be viewed utilizing a different grip arrangement as shown in the bottom view of the robotic hand <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Again, a left hand <b>1</b> is shown grasping a cylindrical object <b>160</b>, in a tighter fashion than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The bottom view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> with the object's <b>160</b> left side facing up. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is an inverted side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, and slightly rotated, showing the arrangement of the fingers in a grasping position.

A plurality of cables per each digit in the hand are run through the compressible cable housing <b>25</b> and connected throughout the digits over a plurality of pulleys, connected to various parts of each digit. The cables do not slide across any surface except the cable housing <b>25</b>, but rather roll across/over the surfaces from the radii of the knuckles and/or pulley(s), thereby minimizing friction in the digits. The cable housings <b>25</b> across the wrist <b>27</b> joint allow a constant length of cable and a compliant springy action at the fingertips. In addition, the cable housing <b>25</b> allows the wrist <b>27</b> to independently move from the position of the digits. The compressible cable housing prevents the digits from moving as the wrist <b>27</b> moves. The cables are driven with the drums <b>20</b> and the cable length does not vary as the drums <b>20</b> rotate, providing for constant tension on the cables.</p>

A plurality of cameras <b>165</b> are provided throughout the hand <b>1</b> and arm <b>2</b> and may be positioned at various points on the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The embodiments of the present inventions exhibit a simplified structure to other attempts in providing for a lightweight, controlled, dexterous, efficient, easy to manufacture, and powerful robot hands and arms. The embodiments of the present invention incorporate the use of rolling friction in joints of the fingers, allowing a cable to roll across the joint instead of slide across, thus diminishing friction. Since the cables wrap around the pulleys instead of over, the need for additional pulleys or tights bends is eliminated. The preferred embodiment incorporates maintaining a constant cable length to prevent the cable from going slack. Each of the fingers within a hand is removable and comprises truncated shafts <b>32</b> molded or pressed into the metacarpal phalanges to retain the side bearings <b>79</b> for ease of maintenance. Such structural connection allows room for the cables to enter a palm section of the hand without a shaft obstructing the way. The fingers and each phalange are preferably manufactured from a molding process or other equivalent process used in the industry. The material used can be plastics, metals or polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or other similar materials.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the present embodiment, the bearings are also retained, but since the force on the bearings is always in the same direction, the bearings are able to snap into the palm section and the cable tension keeps the fingers in place. When the cable tension is eased, or the cables removed, the finger is removed for maintenance or replacement. Such structure allows the fingers to be built or repaired separately and then installed on the palm. In addition, after loosening one end of each cable, no screw threads or fasteners are required and repair can be accomplished without the use of tools. The cable housing was carefully selected to provide the correct amount of spring force without collapsing under the force of the cable. The compliance of the housing allows the fingers to pick up delicate objects without breaking them. The cable housing is made from an extension spring and a compression spring (or equivalent compliant materials) in series with a PTFE (Teflon) liner to minimize friction on the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Other embodiments of the present invention include the use of remotely driven mechanisms. Prosthetics can be incorporated to use the hand and arm embodiments of the present invention and which can further be extended to other robotic extremities.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Throughout the description and drawings, example embodiments are given with reference to specific configurations. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention can be embodied in other specific forms. Those of ordinary skill in the art would be able to practice such other embodiments without undue experimentation. The scope of the present invention, for the purpose of the present patent document, is not limited merely to the specific example embodiments of the foregoing description, but rather is indicated by the appended claims. All changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents within the claims are intended to be considered as being embraced within the spirit and scope of the claims.</p>
