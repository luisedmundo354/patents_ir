<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures, and, more particularly, to a retrofit kit and method of retrofitting for surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures are installed to provide general lighting of large indoor spaces. It should be understood that the description of the fixtures as ‘surface mount’ type fixtures is intended to distinguish the fixtures from ‘recessed’ type fixtures. Thus, the invention taught herein will apply to all ‘surface mount’ type fluorescent strip light fixtures, including stem and pendant mounted suspended variations as well as those fixtures mounted directly to a ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, such strip fixtures include a channel in the form of an inverted trough, with the channel being attached to the ceiling. Lamp holders (sockets) are attached to the channel. A ballast is attached within the channel and wiring attaches the ballast to the lamp holders. Power is supplied to the ballast by wiring brought into the channel through the top or end of the channel. A ballast cover is used to close the open face of the channel so that the ballast and wiring are enclosed. Linear fluorescent lamps are then placed in the lamp holders for operation of the fixture. The lamps are left bare and exposed for providing light to the space. Because of their low cost and utilitarian use, the surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture is the best selling light fixture of all time. Thus, as used herein, surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures shall be understood to include all fixtures having this basic configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typical uses include retail stores, such a grocery, drug, and department stores, where the fixtures are commonly mounted in continuous rows. The fixtures are also used in warehouses.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the introduction of the fluorescent lamp at the 1939 World Fair, fluorescent lighting technology has greatly advanced. Particularly in response to the energy crisis of the 1970's and the National Energy Policy Act of 1992, lamp and ballast manufacturers have developed fluorescent lamp-ballast systems with improved efficiencies. For example, electronic ballasts are now capable of more efficient operation than older technology magnetic ballasts. Additionally, the newer, energy saving fluorescent lamps have special lamp holder and/or ballast requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are a large number of fixtures in the market that use obsolete technology. Consumers desire to reduce their utility costs, and the newer technology can save 25%, or better, in such costs. However, for existing installations, implementation of the newer technology means either replacing the individual fixture components (ballast, lamp holders, wiring, and lamps) or replacing the fixtures all together. Both processes are time consuming and labor intensive, requiring 30 minutes or so for each fixture retrofit or replacement. Further, the retrofit process requires closing down sections of a store during the construction, increasing the impact of the time and effort required to retrofit or replace the old fixtures. Thus, there is a need for a retrofit kit and method for surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures that can be installed with a minimum of time and labor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, current retrofit or replacement options for old fixtures requires disposal of the old ballast, lamp holders, wiring, and lamps, or the entire fixture all together, creating disposal costs and other issues. For instance, many old ballasts contain hazardous materials and require disposal treatment as such. Thus, there is a further need for a retrofit kit and method for surface mount fluorescent strip light fixtures that minimizes the disposal issues of the retrofit process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a retrofit kit and method of retrofitting existing fluorescent strip light fixtures with a replacement lamp-ballast system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a kit and a method for retrofitting an existing fluorescent strip light fixture that can be installed with a minimum of time and labor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is even a further object of the present invention to provide a retrofit kit for an existing fluorescent strip light fixture that minimizes the disposal issues of the retrofit process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an existing surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture <b>10</b> has an existing strip channel <b>12</b> in the form of an inverted trough, with the existing channel <b>12</b> being attached to a ceiling <b>14</b>. As mentioned earlier, surface mount type fluorescent strip fixtures may also be suspended from a ceiling by a stem or other pendant type suspension system, and it should be understood that the principles taught herein will apply equally to any surface mount type fluorescent strip fixture whether it is suspended or mounted directly to a ceiling. The existing channel <b>12</b> has a width, w, as shown, which is typically around 4-⅛ inches to 4-¼ inches. The existing fixture <b>10</b> has lamp holders <b>16</b> which are commonly attached to a saddle piece <b>18</b>, which is, in turn, suspended between the walls of the existing channel <b>12</b>. The existing fixture also has a ballast <b>20</b>, which is contained within the existing channel <b>12</b>. Power is supplied to the ballast by power supply leads <b>22</b> brought into the channel <b>12</b>, and the ballast <b>20</b>, in turn, provides power to the lamp holders <b>16</b> by existing lamp holder wiring <b>24</b>. A ballast cover <b>26</b> covers the open face of the existing channel <b>12</b> to enclose the ballast <b>20</b>, power wiring <b>22</b> and lamp holder wiring <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preparation of the existing strip fixture <b>10</b> for retrofitting with the retrofit kit and method of the present invention includes: disconnecting power to the existing strip fixture <b>10</b>; removing the existing lamps (already removed from the existing fixture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); and removing the ballast cover <b>26</b>. The existing lamps and the ballast cover <b>26</b> will be the only components of the existing strip fixture <b>10</b> which require disposal in the retrofit process according to the instant invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture retrofit kit of the present invention is comprised of two mounting brackets <b>28</b> and a retrofit channel <b>30</b>. The brackets <b>28</b> attach to the existing strip channel <b>12</b>. The retrofit channel <b>30</b> hangs from the brackets <b>28</b> and wraps around the remaining components of the existing fixture <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each mounting bracket <b>28</b> has a horizontal arm <b>32</b>, a depending leg <b>34</b>, and an upturned hook section <b>36</b>. The horizontal arm <b>32</b> has a first end <b>38</b> and a second end <b>40</b> and a length, <b>1</b>, which is longer than the width, w, of the existing channel <b>12</b>. The depending leg <b>34</b> extends downward from the first end <b>38</b> of the horizontal arm <b>32</b> and conforms generally to the shape of the channel <b>12</b>. The upturned hook section <b>36</b> extends upward and outward from the bottom end of the depending leg <b>34</b>, forming a hook-like structure therewith. The depending leg <b>34</b> contains a fastener hole <b>42</b>. Preferably, the mounting brackets are made of a heavy gauge (16 gauge or 18 gauge) galvanized steel for strength.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The retrofit channel <b>30</b> has the form of a non-inverted trough, generally, having a first side wall <b>44</b>, a bottom wall <b>46</b>, and a second side wall <b>48</b> (shown only partially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As mentioned earlier, the retrofit channel <b>30</b> is proportioned to wrap around the existing fixture <b>10</b>, including the existing channel <b>12</b>, lamp holders <b>16</b>, and ballast <b>20</b> without the need to remove or dispose of those components. The first side wall <b>44</b> of the retrofit channel <b>30</b> has an upper end <b>50</b> with slots <b>52</b> formed therein. The slots <b>52</b> are each configured to receive the upturned hook section <b>36</b> of the mounting brackets <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, multiple slots are formed along the upper end <b>50</b> of the first side wall <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the mounting brackets <b>28</b> are installed to the existing channel <b>12</b> by slipping each bracket <b>28</b> between the ceiling and the existing channel <b>12</b> so that the upturned hook section <b>36</b> lines up with a slot <b>52</b> in the retrofit channel <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A template may be utilized for this alignment, or the installer may simply use a ruler or other measuring device to make the alignment. Should the selected position for installation of a bracket <b>28</b> be obstructed by a fastener connecting the existing channel <b>12</b> to the ceiling, or a boss on top of the existing channel <b>12</b>, an alternate location may be easily selected by relocating the mounting bracket <b>28</b> to an alternate location free of obstructions that lines up with an alternate slot <b>52</b>. Should the existing fixture <b>10</b> have a suspended mounting arrangement, the mounting brackets can just be laid on top of the existing channel <b>12</b>. Should the existing channel <b>12</b> be mounted so close to the ceiling that the mounting brackets <b>28</b> will not fit in the space between the existing channel <b>12</b> and the ceiling, the bracket may be driven through the space with a hammer. Following positioning of the mounting brackets <b>28</b> on top of the existing channel <b>12</b>, small pilot holes may be created in the existing channel <b>12</b> in alignment with the fastener holes <b>42</b> in the depending legs <b>34</b> of each mounting bracket <b>28</b>. Thus, the mounting brackets <b>28</b> may be fastened to the existing channel <b>12</b> with fasteners, such as screws <b>54</b> through the fastener holes <b>42</b> and the pilot holes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon fastening of the mounting brackets <b>28</b> to the existing channel <b>12</b>, the retrofit channel <b>30</b> may be hung by the slots <b>52</b> on the upturned hook sections <b>36</b> of the mounting brackets <b>28</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a retrofit ballast <b>56</b> and retrofit lamp holders <b>58</b> are attached to the retrofit channel <b>30</b>, and are connected by retrofit lamp holder wiring <b>60</b>. The design of the retrofit kit and method of retrofitting of the present invention enables attachment of the retrofit ballast <b>56</b> and lamp holders <b>58</b>, and the connection of the retrofit lamp holder wiring <b>60</b> to be performed during the manufacturing of the kit at the factory. Thus, the installer of the kit at the retrofit site does not have to devote time or labor to these tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the retrofit ballast <b>56</b> has power leads <b>62</b> and the retrofit kit has a ground lead <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The next step in installation of the retrofit kit is to disconnect the power supply leads <b>22</b> from the existing ballast <b>20</b> and connect the power supply leads <b>22</b> to the retrofit ballast power leads <b>62</b>. Additionally, the retrofit kit ground lead <b>64</b> should be connected to a through feed ground wire or other ground wire in the existing fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mounting bracket upturned hook section <b>36</b> and retrofit channel slots <b>52</b> create a hinge that allows the retrofit channel <b>30</b> to hang from the mounting brackets <b>28</b> in a position such that interior portion of the retrofit channel <b>30</b> is accessible to the installer for making the described electrical connections, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further facilitating access to the installer for making the electrical connections, the retrofit channel second side wall <b>48</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, can be fabricated as having a door section <b>66</b> and a lower section <b>68</b>. In the embodiment shown, the door section <b>66</b> is hinged to the lower section <b>68</b> through the use of a plurality of T-slots <b>70</b> along the upper end of the lower section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and mating hooks (not shown) formed along the lower edge of the door section <b>66</b>. This hinged arrangement of the door section <b>66</b> and lower section <b>68</b> of the second side wall <b>48</b> enables the door section <b>66</b> to be opened for easier access to the interior portion of the retrofit channel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be observed that the door section <b>66</b> has been removed from the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> in order to more clearly show the component details of those views. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> show only the lower section <b>68</b> of the second side wall <b>48</b> of the retrofit channel <b>30</b>. However, it should be understood that the second side wall <b>48</b> of the embodiment shown includes both the lower section <b>68</b> and the door section <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Returning now to the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is seen that the top portion of the door section <b>66</b> has an outwardly turned flange <b>72</b>. Thus, after the wiring connections are completed, the retrofit kit may be swung up such that the door section flange <b>72</b> seats against the underside of the mounting bracket second ends <b>40</b> (only one mounting bracket <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the underside of each mounting bracket second end <b>40</b> has a thumb latch <b>74</b> rotatably attached thereto by a rivet <b>76</b>. Thus, the thumb latch <b>74</b> of each mounting bracket second end <b>40</b> may be rotated out of the way of the door section flange <b>72</b> so that it may seat against the underside of each mounting bracket second end <b>40</b>. Then, the thumb latch <b>74</b> of each mounting bracket second end <b>40</b> may be rotated so that it engages the under side of the door section flange <b>72</b>, thereby holding the door section <b>66</b>, and the retrofit channel <b>30</b> in place, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the retrofit kit may include end caps <b>78</b> which are configured to close the ends of the retrofitted fluorescent strip light fixture, or the ends of a row of retrofitted fixtures. The end caps <b>78</b> may be attached to the assembly by any convenient means.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Continuing with the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is seen that the wrap around arrangement of the retrofit channel <b>30</b> and the existing channel <b>12</b> and existing lamp holders <b>16</b> creates a chamber <b>80</b> for the retrofit ballast <b>56</b> and associated wiring (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) without requiring the removal of the existing ballast <b>20</b> (and the associated disposal issues) and associated wiring (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wrap around arrangement allows the retrofit channel bottom wall <b>46</b> to be wider than the existing channel <b>12</b>. Thus, on the embodiment shown, the bottom wall may have a flat portion <b>82</b> in the middle and angled portions <b>84</b> on either side of the flat portion. This allows improved optical performance in the two-lamp configuration shown. Additionally, this allows one-lamp and three-lamp versions of the retrofit kit to be produced by installation of lamp holders and a lamp on the flat portion <b>82</b> of the bottom wall <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the embodiment of the invention shown also has a fastener hole <b>86</b> located in the thumb latch. Each mounting bracket second end <b>40</b> further has a fastener hole <b>88</b> positioned to be in alignment with the thumb latch fastener hole <b>86</b> when the thumb latch <b>74</b> is rotated into engagement with the door section flange <b>72</b>. Additionally, fastener holes <b>90</b> are located at positions in the door section flange <b>72</b> corresponding to the slots <b>52</b> in the first side wall <b>44</b> such that the fastener holes <b>90</b> will be in alignment with the thumb latch fastener hole <b>86</b> and the mounting bracket second end fastener hole <b>88</b>. Thus, a fastener <b>92</b>, such as a screw, may be fastened through thumb latch fastener hole <b>86</b>, flange fastener hole <b>90</b> and mounting bracket second end fastener hole <b>88</b> to secure the thumb latch <b>74</b> in place and to establish electrical ground continuity between the respective components.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the embodiment of the invention shown also has a groove <b>94</b> positioned along the upper end <b>50</b> of the retrofit channel first side wall <b>44</b> such that the slots <b>52</b> are located at the bottom of the groove <b>94</b>. This configuration enables the installer to more easily position each mounting bracket upturned hook section <b>36</b> in a first side wall slot <b>52</b> for hanging the retrofit channel <b>30</b> from the mounting brackets <b>28</b>. Additionally, this configuration allows the first side wall groove <b>94</b> to seat against the existing channel <b>12</b> in order to meet code requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The material of the retrofit channel <b>30</b> of the embodiment shown and described is code gauge steel (26 gauge to 16 gauge). However, it should be noted that the retrofit channel <b>30</b> does not require the attachment of conduit thereto, allowing selection of a thinner gauge material to meet code requirements and providing for savings in material costs. The retrofit channel may be formed on a press break, roll formed, or formed by any other suitable method.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown an existing surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture <b>10</b> and another embodiment of the retrofit kit. This embodiment of the retrofit kit can be placed on the existing surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture <b>10</b> previously described. Preparation of the existing strip fixture <b>10</b> for retrofitting with the retrofit kit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref> and method includes: disconnecting power to the existing strip fixture <b>10</b>; removing the existing lamps (already removed from the existing fixture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>); and removing the ballast cover <b>26</b>. The existing lamps and the ballast cover <b>26</b> will be the only components of the existing strip fixture <b>10</b> which require disposal in the retrofit process according to the instant invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, the embodiment of the surface mount fluorescent strip light fixture retrofit kit (i.e., assembly or unit) is comprised of a plurality of generally C-shaped mounting brackets <b>228</b>, preferably two, and a retrofit channel <b>230</b>. The brackets <b>228</b> attach to the interior side or underside of the existing strip channel <b>12</b>. The retrofit channel <b>230</b> hangs from the brackets <b>228</b> and wraps around the remaining components of the existing fixture <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each mounting bracket <b>228</b> has a horizontal arm (or central span) <b>232</b>, first and second depending legs <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b </i>on either side of the horizontal arm <b>232</b>, and first and second upturned hook section <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>which bend upwards around the bottom edge of the existing channel <b>12</b>. Since the mounting brackets <b>228</b> attach to the bottom of the existing channel <b>12</b>, the invention will function regardless of the depth of the channel. The horizontal arm <b>232</b> has a first end <b>239</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>239</b><i>b </i>and a length, L, which is slightly shorter than the width, w, of the existing channel <b>12</b>. The depending legs <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b </i>extend downward from the first end <b>239</b><i>a </i>and the second end <b>239</b><i>b </i>of the horizontal arm <b>232</b>. The upturned hook sections <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>extend upward and outward from the bottom end of the depending legs <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b</i>, forming hook-like structures therewith. The depending legs <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b </i>each have a fastener hole <b>242</b>. Preferably, the mounting brackets <b>228</b> are made of a heavy gauge (16 gauge or 18 gauge) galvanized steel for strength.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The retrofit channel <b>230</b>, shown more clearly in FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>, is flexible and has the form of a non-inverted trough, generally, having a first side wall <b>245</b><i>a</i>, a bottom side (or wall) <b>246</b>, and second side wall <b>245</b><i>b</i>. The retrofit channel <b>230</b> is proportioned to wrap around the existing fixture <b>10</b>, including the existing channel <b>12</b>, lamp holders <b>16</b>, and ballast <b>20</b>, without the need to remove or dispose of those components. First and second opposing side walls <b>245</b><i>a</i>, <b>245</b><i>b </i>of the retrofit channel <b>230</b> have upper ends <b>250</b><i>a</i>, <b>250</b><i>b</i>, each with an inwardly and downwardly curved lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b </i>formed therein. Each lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b </i>is configured to fit within the upturned hook sections <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>of the mounting brackets <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mounting brackets <b>228</b> are installed into the existing channel <b>12</b> by slipping each bracket <b>228</b> up into the existing channel <b>12</b> so that the upturned hook sections <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>grasp around and underneath the edges of the existing channel <b>12</b>. Should the selected position for installation of a bracket <b>228</b> be obstructed for some reason, an alternate location may be easily selected by relocating the mounting bracket <b>228</b> to an alternate location free of obstructions along the existing channel <b>12</b>. The mounting brackets <b>228</b> are positioned in the exact same way, regardless of the mounting structure of the existing fixture <b>10</b>. Following positioning of the mounting brackets <b>228</b> within the existing channel <b>12</b>, small pilot holes may be created in the existing channel <b>12</b> in alignment with the faster holes <b>242</b> in the depending legs <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b </i>of each mounting bracket <b>228</b>. Thus, the mounting brackets <b>228</b> may be fastened to the existing channel <b>12</b> with fasteners, such as teks screws <b>254</b>, through the fastener holes <b>242</b> and the pilot holes. The fastener holes <b>242</b> and self drilling screws such as the teks screws <b>254</b> allow the facilitate the drilling of the screw through the existing channel <b>12</b> and help thread into the heavier gauge material of the mounting bracket <b>228</b>. More specifically, the teks screws <b>254</b> are drilled through the fastener holes <b>242</b>, which act as a guide and the guide allows the installer to drive the teks screw <b>254</b>, drill the hole in the existing channel <b>12</b>, and then make contact with the fastener hole <b>242</b> on the opposite side of the mounting bracket <b>228</b>, and causes the mounting bracket <b>228</b> to pinch the existing channel <b>12</b> together with the mounting bracket <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Upon fastening of the mounting brackets <b>228</b> to the existing channel <b>12</b>, the retrofit channel <b>230</b> may be hung by either of the inwardly and downwardly curved lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b</i>, each of which is configured to fit within the upturned hook sections <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>of the mounting brackets <b>282</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a retrofit ballast <b>256</b> and retrofit lamp holders <b>258</b> are attached to the interior and exterior, respectively, of the retrofit channel <b>230</b>, and are connected by retrofit lamp holder wiring <b>260</b>. The design of the retrofit kit and method of retrofitting of the present invention enables attachment of the retrofit ballast <b>256</b> and lamp holders <b>258</b>, and the connection of the retrofit lamp holder wiring <b>260</b> to be performed during the manufacturing of the kit at the factory. Thus, the installer of the kit at the retrofit site does not have to devote time and labor to these tasks. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the retrofit ballast <b>256</b> has power leads <b>262</b> and the retrofit kit has a ground lead <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The next step in installation of the retrofit kit is to disconnect the power supply leads <b>22</b> from the existing ballast <b>20</b> and connect the power supply leads <b>22</b> to the retrofit ballast power leads <b>262</b>. Additionally, the retrofit kit ground lead <b>264</b> should be connected to a through feed ground wire or other ground wire in the existing fixture <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The mounting bracket upturned hook sections <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b </i>and retrofit channel lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b </i>create a hinge that allows the retrofit channel <b>230</b> to hang from the mounting brackets <b>228</b> in a position such that the interior portion of the retrofit channel <b>230</b> is accessible to the installer for making the described electrical connections, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>. The center of gravity of the retrofit channel <b>230</b> causes the unit to be open to the installer allowing easy access to the power leads <b>262</b> and ground leads <b>264</b>. After the wiring connections have been completed, the retrofit channel <b>230</b> may be swung up (as shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) such that the inwardly and downwardly curved lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b </i>locks into the mounting bracket upturned hook section <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b</i>. The side walls <b>245</b><i>a</i>, <b>245</b><i>b </i>are outwardly flexible, allowing an outward flex over the mounting brackets <b>228</b> so that the curved lip <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>b </i>can lock into the hook section <b>236</b><i>a</i>, <b>236</b><i>b</i>. Note that it is feasible that either side <b>245</b><i>a</i>, <b>245</b><i>b </i>of the channel <b>230</b> could be positioned first.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">This embodiment may also include end caps <b>78</b> (not shown with respect to this embodiment) such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which are configured to close the ends of the retrofitted fluorescent light fixture, or the ends of a row of retrofitted fixtures. The end caps <b>78</b> may be attached to the assembly by any convenient means.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, it is seen that the wrap around arrangement of the retrofit channel <b>230</b> and the existing channel <b>12</b> and existing lamp holders <b>16</b> creates a chamber <b>280</b> for the retrofit ballast <b>256</b> and associated wiring without requiring the removal of the existing ballast <b>20</b> (and the associated disposal issues) and associated wiring (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the wrap around arrangement allows the retrofit channel bottom wall <b>246</b> to be wider than the existing channel <b>12</b>.
