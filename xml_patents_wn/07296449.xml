<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for shaping an aerosol container (<b>10</b>) to a desired body contour. A container body (<b>12</b>) is formed into a cylindrical shape and installed into a mold (<b>30</b>) whose inner surface defines the desired body contour. A bladder (<b>74</b>) is fitted onto a tool (<b>50</b>) insertable into an open end (M) of the container body. Once the tool is inserted, the bladder is inflated with a hydraulic fluid. Pressurizing the bladder forces the bladder against a sidewall of the body forcing the body outwardly and deforming it against the inside of the mold. After the container body is shaped, the bladder is de-pressurized and the tool withdrawn leaving the container with a defined body contour. The hydraulic fluid with which the bladder is pressurized is, at all times, contained within the bladder and does not contact the container sidewall so no subsequent drying of the container is required after the shaping process is complete.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to shaped metal containers and the like, and more particularly, to hydraulic shaping of such cans.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aerosol containers are used to store a fluid or fluent material under pressure and to release the material, as a spray, foam, or gel when a valve is activated. The containers are formed from flat sheets of material which are first cut into rectangular shapes. The resulting blanks are then formed into a cylinder which is open at one end. The container is then filled with the material to be dispensed by the container. A valve assembly is attached to the upper, open end of the container. The contents of the container are subsequently released through a dispensing valve operable by the user of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current manufacturing processes for aerosol containers have certain drawbacks. A major one is that during fabrication, as the can is being shaped so to have a desired external contour, fluid used in the shaping process comes into contact with the inside of the can. This necessitates a subsequent drying step after can forming is complete so the fluid does not, over time, corrode the sidewall of the can and cause it to deteriorate or fail. The drying operation is performed by heating the container to a temperature sufficient to dry off any fluid adhering to the container after the shaping operation. While this is not a particularly complicated process, it does add manufacturing time and cost to the container.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a method of shaping aerosol containers. A method of the invention uses a hydraulic shaping technique in which hydraulic fluids do not come into direct contact with the container thereby eliminating a subsequent drying step in the manufacturing process. Use of this “dry” process thereby reduces the number of manufacturing steps required to produce a can, decreases production time, increases the throughput of containers, and decreases manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the invention, a blank is formed into a cylindrical can body shape, and a dome shaped base is crimped to the bottom of the body. The partially assembled can is now directed to a shaping station where it is installed between a pair of mold halves which define the final contour of the body. A bladder is mounted onto a tool and lowered into the container through an open, mouth end of the container. When the bottom of the tool is seated against the base of the container, a hydraulic fluid is injected into the bladder causing the bladder to expand outwardly against the sidewall of the body. Continued pressurization of the bladder causes continued expansion of the bladder and forces the container sidewall against the inner face of the mold. The pressure causes the container sidewall to distort into the contour shape defined by the inner surface of the mold. Once the container fully conforms to the desired shape, the fluid is evacuated from the container leaving the container body conformed to the desired shape determined by the mold. The tool is then withdrawn. During the forming process, no fluid contacts an interior surface of the container thereby eliminating the need for a subsequent drying operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following detailed description illustrates the invention by way of example and not by way of limitation. This description will clearly enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives and uses of the invention, including what I presently believe is the best mode of carrying out the invention. As various changes could be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to the drawings, a container such as aerosol dispensing container is indicated generally <b>10</b>. The container comprises a body <b>12</b> initially formed from a blank, as is well-known in the art, and a dome shaped base <b>14</b> to which the lower end of the can body is crimped, again as is well-known in the art. Container body <b>12</b> is generally cylindrically shaped and initially open at both ends.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The container is a shaped container. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a central portion of the body has a decreased diameter section <b>16</b>. As described hereinafter, the can body is shaped during a portion of the manufacturing process. The particular shaping shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is exemplary only, and those skilled in the art will understand that other desired shapes can be realized in accordance with the present invention. A valve assembly <b>20</b> is attached to the top, open mouth end of the container. The container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a 3-piece container. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the can shaping process described herein can also be used with 2-piece containers without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Once a desired container body contour has been decided upon, a mold <b>30</b> is made to produce the contour during the manufacturing process. Mold <b>30</b> is a multi-piece mold comprising mold halves <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and a mold base <b>32</b>. When the three pieces of the mold are brought together, they create a cavity C. Further, mold <b>30</b> is fabricated as a multi-cavity mold. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, mold <b>30</b> is shown to be a four-cavity mold. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the mold could have more, or fewer, cavities without departing from the scope of the invention. Each mold half <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is mounted on a movable plate <b>36</b> (only mold half <b>30</b><i>a </i>being shown mounted to a plate <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The plates are, in turn, installed on rods <b>38</b> (three of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) for reciprocal movement toward and away from each other. The inner surface <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the respective mold halves are formed to produce a desired contour of container <b>12</b> as is described hereinafter. As shown in the drawings, the respective mold halves each have identically formed inner surfaces so to form the contour shape shown for container <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, a container with a reduced center section <b>16</b> intermediate upper and lower sections of a greater diameter. Again, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the shape shown in the drawings is exemplary only and that other contours could be realized by mold <b>30</b> within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">During the manufacturing process, a blank (not shown) is formed into a cylindrical body shape such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A dome shaped base <b>14</b> is then crimped to the bottom of container body <b>12</b>. The partially assembled can is now transported to a shaping station where the container is positioned between the mold haves such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As indicated by the arrows, once container <b>10</b> is in place, the two mold halves <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>are moved together to encircle the container. At the same time, mold base <b>32</b> is moved upwardly into position to seat against the bottom of dome shaped container base <b>14</b>. The upper dome shaped support surface <b>42</b> of base <b>32</b> is contoured to approximate the dome shape of base <b>14</b>. Finally, a tool <b>50</b> is lowered into container <b>10</b> from above the container.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tool <b>50</b> includes upper and lower tool members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> respectively. Each member is circular in plan and has a central bore <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> respectively for mounting the member on a threaded shaft <b>60</b>. The diameter of each member is less than that of the diameter of the mouth formed in the partially assembled container <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This allows the tool to be readily inserted into container <b>10</b> through its mouth M.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The position of lower member <b>54</b> is fixed on the lower end of shaft <b>60</b>, while the position of upper member <b>52</b> is adjustable. This allows tool <b>50</b> to be used with different size molds for containers of different lengths. Once the members are installed on shaft <b>60</b>, they are locked in place on the shaft using nuts <b>62</b>. The upper end of shaft <b>60</b> is adapted for connection to a mechanism <b>180</b> by which the tool is lowered into, and raised from, container <b>10</b> in a timed sequence controlled by a controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A sleeve <b>64</b> is sized to be mounted between upper and lower tool members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Each tool member has an inwardly extending shoulder <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> respectively, whose width corresponds to the thickness of sleeve <b>64</b>. Accordingly, the upper and lower ends of the sleeve are seated on the respective shoulders with each end of the sleeve fitting over a reduced diameter shank portion <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> of the respective tool members.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An inflatable bladder <b>74</b> is stretched over the outside of sleeve <b>64</b>. The upper and lower ends of the bladder are over fitted over the top and bottom portions of the sleeve and extend along the inner surface of the sleeve a short distance. The sleeve/bladder assembly is sealed at each end by respective pairs of O-ring seals <b>76</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>and <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. The sleeve further has a series of spaced openings <b>80</b> formed therein for a hydraulic fluid pumped into the space defined by the sleeve and the upper and lower tool members to push against bladder <b>74</b> and force it outwardly against a sidewall of container body <b>12</b>. The number and locations of the openings shown in the drawings are illustrative only.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bladder is inflated by a hydraulic fluid pumped into the tool to pressurize the bladder. The fluid used for this purpose is a food grade type fluid which is pumped into the bladder and evacuated from the bladder using a pumping means <b>190</b> controlled by controller <b>200</b>. Tool member <b>52</b> has a vertical bore <b>82</b> extending from the bottom of the tool member upwardly into the member. Bore <b>82</b> extends parallel to bore <b>56</b>. A horizontal bore <b>84</b> extends inwardly into member <b>52</b> and intersects bore <b>82</b> at the upper end of the bore. A nipple <b>86</b> is fitted into bore <b>84</b> and connects to one end of a pressure hose <b>88</b> the other end of which connects to pumping means <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the sequence of operations for performing the “dry” shaping process of the invention first includes partially completed container <b>10</b> being transported to a manufacturing station where mold <b>30</b> and tool <b>50</b> are located. At this station, the mold halves <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>are brought together about the container body (as indicated by the arrows), and mold base <b>32</b> is elevated to contact and support the base of the container (as also indicated by an arrow). Simultaneously, tool <b>50</b> is lowered by mechanism <b>180</b> (as indicated by the arrow) into mouth M of the container until the bottom of lower tool member <b>54</b> contacts the bottom of the container. The resulting configuration is as now shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it will be noted that the sidewall of container body <b>12</b> contacts the inner surface of the mold halves throughout the center section <b>16</b> of the container body, but that the mold is formed so that its upper and lower segments are spaced away from the upper and lower sections of the container body. At this time, bladder <b>74</b> is unpressurized. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is illustrative only, and that, depending upon the can shape desired, various sections of a container, will be in contact with, or spaced away from, the mold surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, controller <b>200</b> activates pumping means <b>190</b> to pump fluid into tool <b>50</b> to inflate the bladder. As the bladder is inflated, it expands uniformly outwardly pressing against the sidewall of container body <b>12</b> and pushing it outwardly against the inside surface of mold <b>30</b>. The upper and lower sections of the container body expand outwardly due to the force of the expanding bladder, but center section <b>16</b> of the body is constrained by the mold surface and cannot expand. The deformation of the upper and lower sections of body <b>12</b> against the mold create the desired container contour defined by mold <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the bladder has been pressurized to a level sufficient that it expands enough to compress the container sidewall against the inside surface of mold <b>30</b>, controller <b>200</b> activates the pumping means to evacuate the hydraulic fluid from tool <b>50</b>, deflating the bladder so it draws inwardly against sleeve <b>64</b>. However, body <b>12</b> of container <b>10</b> remains in its deformed position</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, once bladder <b>74</b> is depressurized, controller <b>200</b> operates mechanism <b>180</b> to withdraw tool <b>50</b> out of the mouth of the container. Mold halves <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>now separate (as indicated by the arrows), and mold base <b>32</b> is withdrawn from the bottom of the container. Container <b>10</b> now has the desired body contour defined by the mold with upper and lower body sections which are greater in diameter than center section <b>16</b> of the container body. It is important to note that during the shaping operation, the hydraulic fluid with which bladder <b>74</b> is inflated is contained within the bladder at all times. None of the fluid comes into contact with the container sidewall, at any time, so no subsequent drying of the container is now required once the shaping process is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the shaping step, the container is moved to a new station where valve <b>20</b> is connected to the mouth of the container by crimping, for example. Finally, the container is filled with fluent material dispensed by the container.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects and advantages of the present invention have been achieved and other advantageous results have been obtained.</p>
