The disclosures of each of the referenced applications are specifically incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical components, including fiber optic cables, connectors, transmitters, receivers, switches, routers and all other types of optical components have become the backbone of the modern telecommunication infrastructure. Due to their extremely low error rate and wide bandwidth, optical communication systems have supported an explosion in the growth of data communication systems, such as the Internet. With the Internet in its infancy, it is expected that the reliance on optical components and systems will only increase as the Internet becomes more closely intertwined with mainstream business and consumer applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although the technology associated with optical communication systems and components has greatly advanced over the last decade and the use of such technology has accelerated, the technology associated with testing optical communication systems and components has greatly lagged.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bit error rate (BER) measurements are a standard tool in verifying the performance of any digital optical communication system. Nevertheless, such tests remain an underutilized resource in understanding and diagnosing issues with such systems; particularly with respect to the receive-side optical front end. There are many contributing factors to this situation; chief among them are a lack of hardware and software resources, the time consuming nature of such measurements, and a lack of appreciation and understanding of the information content such measurements can provide.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is well known, the BER is given by the ratio of incorrectly identified bits to the total number of bits processed. In optical systems, BER tests are most commonly associated with determining the sensitively of the optical receiver. Clearly, if the input optical power decreases enough, the receiver will begin generating errors. Receiver sensitivity is the input optical power required for a particular BER. Sensitivity is typically measured in dBm where:</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, 0 dBm corresponds to 1 mW. The result depends strongly on the measurement conditions including the quality of the transmitter, the amount of input optical noise, the BER required, the data rate and the data being transmitted. A typical measurement might involve a high quality transmitter, no added input noise, a well-defined pseudorandom bit sequence and a required BER of 1×10<sup>−10</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For a network designer, sensitivity is often regarded as the most important figure of merit for a receiver since it suggests a minimum input operating power for the device. A designer would ordinarily plan to operate the receiver with an input power high enough above the quoted sensitivity such that the expected error rate will not impact the reliability of the link. But how high above the sensitivity power level the receiver should be operated at is one of the fundamental questions that careful BER measurements can answer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to the current state of technology for optical testing equipment, testing an optical component at many small increments of optical power over the full operating range is not realistic. To wit, via current practices, in order to perform these measurements, it is often necessary for a technician first to set the optical power of the test equipment to the desired optical power (which is an iterative process), and then must separately measure the number of errors at that optical power. Since the number of errors exhibited by optical equipment is extremely low, (i.e., 1×10<sup>−9 </sup>or less), it would necessitate a technician to continually attend to the testing equipment over a series of hours or days.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Known testing regimens avoid the problem of lengthy test procedures by requiring a technician to measure the BER over a few discrete levels of optical power. These results are then extrapolated throughout the entire operating range of the optical component to arrive at the behavior of the component over the entire operating range of the component. Extrapolating the results in such a manner increases the risk that the true behavior exhibited by the optical component at levels of power between the measured discrete levels will be missed. This can lead to later errors in the technical specifications for the particular component.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is needed is a simple and effective system and method for testing optical components.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The optical testing unit <b>100</b> of the exemplary embodiment is optimized by including a common control bus <b>184</b> and a common power bus <b>182</b>, which is coupled to a central power supply <b>180</b>. Each active component <b>150</b>-<b>160</b> within the optical testing unit is coupled to both the control bus <b>184</b>, via a control (C) interconnection, and to the power bus <b>182</b> via a power (P) interconnection. This permits the elimination of redundant power supplies and power feeds to each separate component, permits a single control bus to control all of the components <b>150</b>-<b>160</b>, and eliminates all redundant user interfaces with each optical component.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A single control unit <b>158</b> is useful in the automated measurement and testing of the DUT <b>105</b>. Beneficially, having a single control unit <b>158</b> providing selective control of each optical component <b>150</b>-<b>156</b> greatly simplifies the testing procedure. For example, having a single control unit <b>158</b> also permits calibration of the entire optical testing unit from a common point of control. This and other benefits will become clearer as the present description continues.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Illustratively, all of the optical components <b>150</b>-<b>156</b> are fixed in a rigid spatial relationship. Also the optical cables <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>190</b>, <b>194</b>, <b>196</b> are also rigidly fixed to prevent an inadvertent degradation or complete separation of an interconnection between optical components.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the exemplary embodiments described herein, each of the optical components <b>150</b>-<b>156</b> may also include one or more optical interfaces. For example, the optical transmitter <b>150</b> may include an optical output <b>70</b>. The optical attenuator <b>152</b> may include an optical input <b>72</b> and also an optical output <b>74</b>. The optical power monitor <b>154</b> may include an optical input <b>76</b>, and the optical receiver <b>156</b> may include an optical input <b>78</b>. The optical splitter <b>192</b> may include an optical input <b>93</b> and two optical outputs <b>95</b>, <b>97</b>. The housing <b>104</b> may include an optical output port <b>198</b> and an optical input port <b>199</b>. Illustratively, the optical output port <b>198</b> is coupled with the input of the DUT <b>205</b> and the optical input port <b>199</b> is coupled with the output of the DUT <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control unit <b>158</b> may be configured to control the various components of the optical testing unit <b>100</b> in order to affect different types of measuring and testing. In accordance with a first embodiment described presently, the control unit usefully enables BER testing; and in a second embodiment described herein, the control unit usefully enables sensitivity testing and measurements. As can be appreciated, the types of measurements and testing techniques controlled by the control unit <b>158</b> disclosed via the exemplary embodiments are intended to be illustrative and not limit the scope of the invention. It is thus noted that the control unit <b>158</b> may be configured to affect (via interaction with various components of the optical testing unit <b>100</b>) the traffic being generated (protocol, binary sequence, etc.), the traffic rate (i.e., bit rate), and the optical power (expressed in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, average optical power and Optical Modulation Amplitude). Using facilities within the optical testing unit <b>100</b>, the control unit <b>158</b> can also examine the signal coming from the DUT and determine the BER either by considering the traffic bit by bit or by examining any coding scheme embedded within the traffic which provides indications that transmission errors have occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the control unit <b>158</b> according to an exemplary embodiment is shown in greater detail. The control unit <b>158</b> illustratively includes a microprocessor <b>210</b>, an input/output (I/O) buffer <b>212</b>, and an associated memory <b>214</b>. Microprocessor <b>210</b> should of course be able to control various hardware and obtain data therefrom. The memory <b>214</b> permits storage of a plurality of individual software modules, predetermined component test parameters and any other information which is required to be stored by the control unit <b>158</b>. For example, the memory <b>214</b> includes a calibration module <b>216</b> and a test module <b>218</b>. The memory <b>214</b> may also include spare capacity or may be expanded by adding additional memory capacity for future modules <b>220</b>. Although these modules <b>216</b>-<b>220</b> have been shown and described as separate components for ease of explanation in the present embodiment, it is noted that this is merely illustrative. To wit, these modules are resident in software and the software may be stored, and the memory <b>214</b> partitioned, as desired by the technician. Calibration module <b>216</b> provides for the calibration of optical test unit <b>100</b> as a system, as opposed to each individual element <b>150</b>-<b>156</b>. Test module <b>218</b> is a conglomeration of individual software algorithms that control the hardware within optical testing unit <b>100</b>, record bit error rate data, analyze that data and display results of the analysis. The procedures affected by modules <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> will be discussed in detail later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Illustratively, data buses <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> affect the flow of data between the microprocessor <b>210</b>; the memory <b>214</b> and the I/O buffer <b>212</b>. Another data bus <b>228</b> facilitates the flow of data between the I/O buffer <b>212</b> and the control bus <b>184</b>. Alternatively, the data bus <b>228</b> may be deleted and the I/O buffer <b>212</b> be coupled directly to the control bus <b>184</b>. Although the microprocessor <b>158</b> is illustrated herein as including an I/O buffer <b>212</b>, in an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the control unit <b>158</b> provides for direct access to the memory <b>214</b> such that the I/O buffer <b>212</b> is not required. Of course, any accessing of the memory <b>214</b> in that embodiment may be monitored and/or controlled by the microprocessor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The process implemented by the individual modules will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a calibration procedure <b>300</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. This calibration procedure is useful in realizing BER measurements of the present exemplary embodiment. There is a need to be able to calibrate the optical testing unit <b>100</b> via either internal or external means. It is preferable that it is calibrated as a system and not as individual units, such as the optical transmitter <b>150</b> and the optical receiver <b>156</b>. By calibrating it as a system, optical testing unit <b>100</b> is more accurately reliable than a system made up of individually calibrated stand-alone components.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is noted that similar calibration procedures with subject specific variations may be used to calibrate optical testing unit <b>100</b> to realize differing measurements and tests. Additionally, it is noted that the control unit <b>158</b> can directly control external instrumentation to measure aspects of the transmitted or received signal to allow calibration of the optical testing unit <b>100</b>. Alternatively, measurements can be made completely independent of the control unit <b>158</b> (either manually or under the control of an external computer) and subsequently communicated to the control unit <b>158</b> to affect the calibration of the optical testing unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is noted that in order to calibrate optical testing unit <b>100</b>, an external optical jumper (not shown) may be placed between the optical output port <b>198</b> and the optical input port <b>199</b>. This completes the optical path between the optical transmitter <b>150</b> and the optical receiver <b>156</b>. Alternatively, an internal optical switch <b>197</b> may be provided to switch the output of the optical attenuator <b>152</b> to the input of the optical receiver <b>156</b>. Illustratively, optical switch <b>197</b> is automatically controlled by the control unit <b>158</b> when the calibration procedure <b>300</b> is implemented. Alternatively, the optical switch <b>197</b> could be manually operated. Use of the optical switch <b>197</b> is beneficial since it eliminates the need for a technician to install an external optical jumper and eliminates any degradation problems caused by a damaged external optical jumper.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The calibration procedure <b>300</b> begins with the control unit <b>158</b> retrieving pre-stored optical transmitter calibration parameters from memory (step <b>302</b>). The calibration parameters may be either predefined values stored in memory by a technician; may be factory settings for the optical components <b>150</b>-<b>160</b>; may be the results of prior calibration tests; or may be a combination thereof. The control unit <b>158</b> then energizes all of the optical components (step <b>304</b>); and, after a predetermined duration, which permits the electronic components therein to reach steady state, the control unit <b>158</b> measures the operating parameters, which comprise the optical output power and the internal BER (step <b>306</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The control unit <b>158</b> then compares the calibration parameters to the measured operating parameters (step <b>308</b>). If the operating parameters are within a predefined range of the calibration parameters, the control unit <b>158</b> stores the positive test results (step <b>310</b>). If the operating parameters are not within the predetermined range of the calibration parameters, the system has failed the calibration procedure <b>300</b> and the control unit <b>158</b> stores this failure <b>312</b>. Preferably, as the control unit <b>158</b> receives the test results, whether pass or fail, the control unit <b>158</b> provides an output to the graphical user interface <b>160</b> to keep the technician apprised of the results of the procedure (steps <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>). If the system has failed, control unit <b>158</b> may (in conjunction with steps <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> or in an additional step, not shown) adjust various aspects of optical testing unit <b>100</b>, store any necessary information in memory <b>116</b>, and may restart the calibration procedure at an appropriate step, such as step <b>306</b>. This may be repeated until the system has passed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is noted that the steps <b>302</b>-<b>316</b> set forth in the calibration procedure <b>300</b> need not necessarily occur in the order set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; and that other calibration sequences may be followed, which may include the same number of steps, or more or fewer steps. For example, step <b>302</b> may occur between steps <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. Those of skill in the art would clearly recognize that there is flexibility in the ordering of some of these steps. Additionally, step <b>304</b>, which relates to the energizing of the optical components, may be performed by the technician upon powering up the equipment. Moreover, steps <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> may be eliminated, whereby the results of the calibration procedure <b>300</b> are not stored. These alternative calibration sequences are merely illustrative, and other sequences may be followed in keeping with the present exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the calibration procedure <b>300</b> has been successfully completed, the optical testing unit <b>100</b> is ready to test an optical component. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in order to implement the test procedure <b>400</b>, the microprocessor <b>210</b> accesses the test module <b>218</b>. The test procedure <b>400</b> is shown in greater detail in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is noted that the test procedure <b>400</b> may be fully automated, whereby the technician initiates the process (e.g., pushes a ‘start button’) and permits the control unit <b>158</b> to fully carry out the test procedure <b>400</b>. Alternatively, the test procedure <b>400</b> may be selectively automated, whereby the technician may set certain parameters for the system to test. For example, the technician may set specific power levels for the system to test and may also set a specific number of errors, or range of uncertainty, at each power level. In any event, the present exemplary embodiment is implemented via the illustrative test procedure <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The test procedure <b>400</b> begins by the technician's initiating the procedure (step <b>402</b>). This can be as simple as the technician's pushing a “start test” button on the graphical user interface <b>160</b>, or by the technician's setting forth all of the individual testing parameters and pushing a “start test” button. The optical transmitter <b>150</b> is energized to transmit generally at a desired power level (step <b>404</b>). Since the optical transmitter <b>150</b> is unable to fine-tune its output power level, additional steps <b>406</b>-<b>410</b> using the optical power monitor <b>154</b> and the optical attenuator <b>152</b> to iteratively fine-tune the output power level are desirable. The optical power monitor <b>154</b> measures the output of the optical transmitter <b>150</b> (step <b>406</b>) and determines whether the output power level is at the desired power level (step <b>408</b>). If the output power level is not at the desired power level, the optical attenuator <b>152</b> is tuned to attenuate the output of the optical transmitter <b>150</b> as appropriate in order to more closely achieve the desired power level (step <b>410</b>). The optical testing unit then uses the optical power monitor <b>154</b> to again measure the output of the optical transmitter <b>150</b> (step <b>406</b>). Steps <b>406</b>-<b>410</b> are repeated until the output power level is at the desired power level.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the desired power level has been achieved, the optical receiver <b>156</b> measures the number of bit errors at that specific power level (step <b>412</b>). This step is performed until the “completion criteria” is met. The completion criteria may be a particular duration, a particular number of bit errors received, or attaining a particular uncertainty.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Regardless of which criteria is used to determine whether the testing is complete at that power level (step <b>414</b>), the optical testing unit iteratively and continuously repeats steps <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> until the testing is complete for that particular power level. Once the testing is complete at the particular power level, the optical testing unit determines whether the testing for all power levels desired to be tested has been completed (step <b>416</b>). If not, the optical testing unit adjusts the power level to the new desired power level (step <b>418</b>) and the entire process (steps <b>406</b>-<b>416</b>) is repeated until the testing at all power levels has been completed. The results are then output to the graphical user interface <b>160</b> (step <b>420</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The testing procedure <b>400</b> has many advantages over prior testing methods. First, because it is automated, optical testing unit <b>100</b> may operate autonomously without a technician having to perform all the functions manually. This saved time and effort.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another advantage is that there are fewer uncertainties with testing procedure <b>400</b> than with the prior methods. The fact that the optical testing unit <b>100</b> is a single system having rigidly fixed internal components and optical cables yields less uncertainties with testing results than a group of individual stand-alone components. This is so because the true accuracy of the group of individual stand-alone components is unrealized because of all the loose interconnections.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another advantage is that the test can proceed faster than individual stand-alone components automated with an external PC because all the components <b>150</b>-<b>156</b> are directly under the control of the control unit <b>158</b> and are built into optical testing unit <b>100</b> to work together.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Yet another advantage is that mathematical models of how BER should behave as a function of optical degradations can be stored in memory <b>214</b> and can be displayed to graphical user interface <b>160</b> in a meaningful way if desired. Optical testing unit <b>100</b> is specifically built to measure BER as a function of various optical degradations.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned previously, another exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to measurement and testing of sensitivity of optical components. The optical testing unit <b>100</b> of the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used to affect this type of measurement and testing. Accordingly, the common details of the various elements are not repeated in the interest of brevity. It is noted that a significant difference between the exemplary embodiments drawn to BER measurement and testing, and sensitivity measurement and testing lies in the substance and characteristics of the control unit <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, control unit <b>158</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment is shown. Control unit <b>158</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The control unit <b>158</b> includes a microprocessor <b>210</b>, an input/output (I/O) buffer <b>212</b>, and an associated memory <b>254</b>. The memory <b>254</b>, like memory <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, permits storage of all of the individual software modules, predetermined standard success criteria (optional) and any other information, which is required to be stored by the control unit <b>158</b>. For example, the memory <b>254</b> includes a sensitivity test module <b>256</b> and standard success criteria <b>258</b>. The memory <b>254</b> may also include enough room for future modules <b>220</b>. Again, although these modules <b>256</b>-<b>258</b> and <b>220</b> have been graphically illustrated as separate components for ease of explanation in the present application, it should be recognized by those of skill in the art that these modules are resident in software and the software may be stored, and the memory <b>254</b> partitioned, as desired by the technician. Memory <b>254</b> may additionally contain any modules shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and memory <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may contain any modules shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Additionally, it is noted that, as described above, bit error rate measurements are inherent in sensitivity testing and thus, sensitivity test module <b>256</b> may be comprised of parts or all of test module <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The sensitivity module <b>256</b> adjusts the traffic type and rate, adjusts the overall quality of the optical signal, and examines the traffic returning from the DUT to verify that it can recover information from it. It then varies the quality of the optical signal (the optical power of the signal) in controlled steps for a period of time controlled by the algorithm. Then for each step, the algorithm measures (or infers) the BER using assets within the optical testing device <b>100</b> and chooses whether or not to make any additional steps and the details of each of these steps. Throughout the data recording process, the algorithm analyzes the data. The algorithm also produces a graphical display of the measurement in progress and the results which may included whether or not the DUT passes requirements input by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As with the previously described exemplary embodiment, several data buses <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> facilitate the flow of data between the microprocessor <b>210</b>, the memory <b>254</b> and the I/O buffer <b>212</b>. Another data bus <b>228</b> facilitates the flow of data between the I/O buffer <b>212</b> and the control bus <b>184</b>. Alternatively, the data bus <b>228</b> may be deleted and the I/O buffer <b>212</b> be coupled directly to the control bus <b>184</b>. Although the microprocessor <b>158</b> is illustrated herein as including an I/O buffer <b>212</b>, in an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the control unit <b>158</b> provides for direct access to the memory <b>254</b> such that the I/O buffer <b>212</b> is not required. Of course, any accessing of the memory <b>214</b> in that embodiment will be monitored and/or controlled by the microprocessor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The process implemented by the sensitivity test module <b>256</b> will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It is noted that all of the optical components <b>150</b>-<b>158</b> have been energized for a predetermined duration, which permits the electronic components therein to reach steady state. It should be noted that the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> may be fully automated, whereby the technician initiates the process by pushing a button, which permits the control unit to fully carry out the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b>. In this embodiment, the control unit <b>158</b> will select a default error rate and a default “error range” within which the sensitivity must be measured. Alternatively, the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> may be selectively automated, whereby the technician may set certain parameters for the optical testing unit to implement the test. For example, the technician may set specific power levels for the optical testing unit to test and may also set a specific error range within which the sensitivity must be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In any event, the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> begins by the technician initiating the procedure (step <b>602</b>). This can be as simple the technician pressing a “start button” on the graphical user interface <b>160</b>, or by the technician setting forth all of the individual testing parameters and pushing a “start test” button. The microprocessor <b>210</b> retrieves the desired bit error rate from memory (step <b>604</b>), whether the desired BER is a default BER or a BER that has been previously input by the technician. The control unit <b>158</b> controls the optical transmitter <b>150</b> to transmit at an initial power level (step <b>606</b>). This may be a parameter set by the technician, or a predefined default parameter. Alternatively, the control unit <b>158</b> may selectively control the optical attenuator <b>152</b> to increase or decrease the amount of optical attenuation in order to output a desired optical power level. The optical power monitor <b>154</b> measures the output of the optical transmitter <b>150</b> (step <b>608</b>) and the optical receiver measures the number of bit errors at that transmitted power lever (step <b>610</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is noted that the actual measured power level need not to be exactly the same as the desired power level. In this regard, it is useful to ensure that the optical testing unit accurately measures the number of errors at the current power level. The relationship between the actual power level and the number of errors measured at that actual power level is important. Because the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> is an iterative process of a finite number of iterations that seeks to determine an optical power level at which a certain bit error rate has been achieved, the individual power level measurements which are made in order to ultimately achieve the sensitivity are merely indicators of whether the optical power level should be increased or decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the optical receiver <b>156</b> measures the number of bit errors at that power level (step <b>610</b>). The control unit <b>158</b> then compares the desired BER to measured BER (step <b>612</b>). If it has been determined that the measured bit error rate is equal to the desired bit error rate (step <b>614</b>), the sensitivity of the DUT has been found and the control unit <b>158</b> stores the current power level in memory <b>254</b> and/or outputs the current power level to the graphical user interface <b>160</b> as the sensitivity value (step <b>622</b>). The sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> is then terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the measured BER is not equal to the desired BER, the control unit <b>158</b> then determines whether the measured BER is greater than the desired BER (step <b>616</b>). If so, the optical power level is increased (step <b>620</b>) and steps <b>608</b>-<b>614</b> are repeated. If the measured BER is not greater than the desired BER, the control unit <b>158</b> decreases the optical power level (step <b>618</b>) and then steps <b>608</b>-<b>614</b> are repeated. Although not shown, if desired, sensitivity procedure <b>600</b> can display sensitivity measurements in progress to graphical user interface <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> provides a simple and effective method for automatically measuring the sensitivity of an optical component.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to determining the sensitivity of an optical component, the optical testing unit of the present exemplary embodiment may also be used to determine whether a measured sensitivity meets or exceeds nationally or internationally recognized optical standards. This provides the technician with an additional tool for comparing the particular component to objective norms. Usefully, the “success criteria” such as the sensitivity and the desired BER are previously stored in memory <b>254</b>, such as in standard success criteria module <b>258</b>. The criteria may be downloaded into the memory <b>254</b> via a plurality of different methods, which will not be described in detail. Such methods may include providing external control port <b>101</b>, (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which permits LAN interconnectivity and/or connectivity to the World Wide Web. Other interfaces such as a CD drive, floppy disk drive or other information storage and/or input/output devices may be used to provide a set of success criteria for each standard.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once the success criteria are stored in memory, the procedure for comparing the sensitivity of the optical component to standard success criteria may be implemented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> as it will be hereinafter referred to is shown in the flow diagram on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It should be noted that as with the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b>, the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> may be fully automated, whereby it is automatically begun following the completion of the sensitivity procedure <b>600</b> or initiated by the technician simply pushing a button, and the control unit <b>158</b> fully carries out the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> against all known standards (e.g., those standards stored in memory <b>254</b>). Alternatively, the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> may be selectively automated, whereby the technician may input the identification for one or more standards against which the sensitivity should be compared to and only those selected standards are compared to the measured sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> begins by the technician initiating the procedure (step <b>702</b>). As mentioned above, this can occur automatically upon completion of the sensitivity procedure, can be as simple as the technician pushing a “start button” on the graphical user interface <b>160</b>, or can start by the technician setting forth all of the standards against which the sensitivity will be tested and pushing an appropriate “start button”. The control unit <b>158</b> retrieves the standard success criteria from memory <b>254</b> (step <b>704</b>). The control unit <b>158</b> then compares the success criteria for a standard to the measured sensitivity and desired BER (step <b>706</b>). The optical testing unit then determines whether the sensitivity and desired BER meet or exceed the success criteria (step <b>708</b>) for that standard. If so, the control unit <b>158</b> stores the positive test result in memory <b>254</b> (step <b>710</b>), or optionally output the result to the graphical user interface <b>160</b> (step <b>712</b>), or both.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, if the sensitivity and the desired BER do not meet or exceed the success criteria for that standard, the control unit <b>158</b> stores test failure results in memory <b>254</b> (step <b>714</b>) and optionally outputs the test failure result to the graphical user interface <b>160</b> (step <b>716</b>). The control unit <b>158</b> then determines whether there are more standard success criteria against which the DUT's sensitivity should be compared (step <b>718</b>). If so, the control unit <b>158</b> advances the comparison to the next set of success criteria (step <b>720</b>) and continuously repeats steps <b>708</b>-<b>718</b>. After all of the comparisons are complete, the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> is then terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> provides a tremendously powerful tool for the technician by specifically outputting which standards the optical DUT has passed and which it has failed. Via the output control interface (<b>101</b>) the optical testing unit can also provide an output such that a “sticker” or success report may be printed out and kept with each optical component under tests. This further enhances the ease of use of the optical testing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is noted that the steps set forth in the sensitivity test procedure <b>600</b> and the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> may vary from the order set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, respectively. For example, step <b>604</b> may occur after step <b>606</b>. Those of skill in the art would clearly recognize that there is flexibility in the ordering of some of these steps. Additionally, some steps, (such as steps <b>714</b> and <b>710</b>) may be foregone, whereby the results of the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b> are not needed to be stored. These and other variations of the illustrative processes will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the graphical user interface <b>160</b> is shown in greater detail. Preferably, the graphical user interface <b>160</b> comprises a touch-sensitive screen <b>130</b> which will change depending upon the graphical buttons <b>132</b>-<b>140</b> which are selected. Alternatively, the graphical user interface <b>160</b> may comprise a CRT screen and associated mouse (not shown) for selecting the different options on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In order to make the optical testing unit as user friendly as possible, the bottom portion of the screen <b>130</b> preferably includes a discrete selection option (i.e., hereinbefore “button”) for each of the transmitter <b>132</b>, the receiver <b>134</b>, the attenuator <b>136</b>, the power monitor <b>138</b>, and a separate button for the calibration procedure <b>140</b> and the test procedure <b>142</b>. Of course, those of skill in the art should realize that more or fewer buttons <b>132</b>-<b>142</b> (such as buttons for the sensitivity procedure <b>600</b> and the standard comparison procedure <b>700</b>) or hardwired buttons, may be provided as desired by the user in order to implement or control certain functions that are commonly used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In operation, one of the buttons, <b>132</b>-<b>142</b> is selected, for example, the test button <b>142</b> as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to initiate the desired function. This will implement the test procedure <b>400</b> as hereinbefore described. The test results as output in steps <b>412</b>, <b>416</b> may also be displayed on the screen <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The invention being thus described, it would be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways by one of ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. Such variations are not regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
