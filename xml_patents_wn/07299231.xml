<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to server systems, and more particularly to the subsetting of a cluster of server systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many techniques exist to “cluster” systems of servers for databases, web applications, etc., where the group of server systems is treated as a single entity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional group of server systems representing a single entity. A plurality of server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>is configured as a single group <b>101</b>. From the perspective of a client <b>102</b>, the group <b>101</b> of servers constitutes a single database or entity. When the client <b>102</b> wants to connect to one of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>of the group <b>101</b>, any of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>are candidates for the client connection.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Occasionally, users of such systems wish to be able to automatically target a subset of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>so that only those server systems are affected by a particular set of client application requests. In one conventional solution, the client <b>102</b> requests a TCP/IP address for the server systems in the subset from a domain name server (DNS) (not shown). The DNS would be set up with lists that provide the server system TCP/IP addresses for a particular name, through which the subset of server systems can be accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, this solution has several drawbacks. First, for a typical DNS, the TCP/IP addresses of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>are given out to the client <b>102</b> in a round-robin manner without regard to whether or not the particular server system at the address is available and/or the server system has the capability to handle the client application's request. Second, once connected to the particular server system, the connection remains with that server system until a request to disconnect is received, without regard to whether or not the server system had the capacity to continue processing the client application's requests. This solution assumes that the client <b>102</b> disregards any server capacity feedback mechanisms. Third, if the client <b>102</b> did utilize the server capacity feedback mechanisms for workload balancing, the only information being returned from the server system would be capacity information for the group <b>101</b> as a whole, not just the subset of server systems. Eventually, requests would be sent to all server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>in the group <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another solution, each server system of a subset would be defined with a unique “target” name that would be different from the name of the group <b>101</b>, and probably have different TCP/IP access port numbers as well. This would permit the server feedback mechanisms to only report on the server systems of the subset. However, when a client application wants to access any or all of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>of the group <b>101</b>, since there is no longer a common name for all of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n</i>, there is no way for the client application to be able to get to any and all of the server systems <b>103</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>103</b>.<i>n </i>in the group <b>101</b>, unless the client application itself manages this aspect of the connection. In addition, any one server system can only participate in one and only one subset.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In both solutions, the sharing of data between the server systems in the group <b>101</b> is always a requirement whether a subset of the group of servers or the group as a whole is to be accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved method and system of subsetting a group of server systems. This improved method and system should allow for a subset of server systems to be targeted by a client application, while preserving the direct data sharing capabilities between the subset of server systems and the remaining server systems of the group. In addition, the improved method should allow for load balancing and/or fault protection within a subset of server systems. The present invention addresses such a need.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides an improved method and system of subsetting a group of server systems. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To more particularly describe the features of the present invention, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> in conjunction with the discussion below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a subsetting of a group of server systems in accordance with the present invention. A plurality of server systems <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>203</b>.<b>6</b> is configured as being part of a group or cluster <b>201</b>, with a group name and a group port. Although six server systems are illustrated, any number of server systems can be used. In addition to being defined as a part of the group <b>201</b>, each server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>203</b>.<b>6</b> can also be defined as part of one or more subsets, with each subset having a subset name and a subset port. For example, assume that the server systems <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>203</b>.<b>6</b> are defined as part of the group <b>201</b> named “group1” with port “9000”. In addition, servers systems <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>203</b>.<b>2</b> are defined as being part of a first subset <b>204</b> named “appgroup2” with port “9010”. The same is true for servers systems <b>203</b>.<b>5</b> and <b>203</b>.<b>6</b>, which are defined as being part of a second subset <b>205</b> named “appgroup3” with port “9020”, as well as being part of “group1” <b>201</b>. In this manner, server systems can be targeted via its subset name and subset port, while also accessible via the common name and port for the group <b>201</b>. Work can be targeted to certain subsetted server systems, while the direct sharing of data between the server systems <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>203</b>.<b>6</b> of the group <b>201</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of the activation of subsetting a group of server systems in accordance with the present invention. First, a server system is configured with a group name and a group port, and with a subset name and a subset port, via step <b>301</b>. Next, the server system is started, via step <b>302</b>. The server system reads its configuration, via step <b>303</b>. It then registers with a system routing facility or table (not shown) as being part of the group name and the group port, via step <b>304</b>. The server system also registers with the system routing facility or table as part of the subset name and the subset port, via step <b>305</b>. The server system then listens for connections on both the group port and the subset port, via step <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, the server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> is configured with the group name “group1” and the group port “9000”, and with the subset name “appgroup2” and a subset port “9010”, via step <b>301</b>. When the server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> is started, via step <b>302</b>, it reads its configuration, via step <b>303</b>. The server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> then registers with the system routing facility or table as part of the “group1” group <b>201</b> with port “9000”, via step <b>304</b>. The server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> also registers with the system routing facility or table as part of the “appgroup2” subset <b>204</b> with port “9010”, via step <b>305</b>. Once registered, the server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> listens for connections on ports 9000 and 9010, via step <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Once the group and its subsets are activated, a client application can connect to any of the server systems <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>-<b>203</b>.<b>6</b> as part of the group <b>201</b>, or target a connection to a server system as part of a subset. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of establishing an initial connection with a server system of a subset in a group of server systems in accordance with the present invention. First, the client <b>202</b> obtains the IP addresses for the system servers of the subset, via step <b>401</b>. For example, a domain name server (DNS) (not shown) can be used to maintain these IP addresses. The client <b>202</b> then sends a request to connect to the subset port at the IP addresses, via step <b>402</b>. When the client <b>202</b> receives a connect reply from one of the server systems, via step <b>403</b>, it requests from the server system a list of server systems in the subset, via step <b>404</b>. In this embodiment, the server system to which the client <b>202</b> is connected asks for this list from the system routing facility or table, and replies to the client <b>202</b> with the list, via step <b>405</b>. Future connections between the client application and the subset will then be obtained using this server system list, via step <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, assume that client <b>202</b> wishes to send a request for an application whose work is to be performed by the “appgroup2” subset <b>204</b>. The client <b>202</b> first obtains the IP addresses for the system servers of the “appgroup2” subset <b>204</b>, via step <b>401</b>. Assume that here, the DNS maintains these IP addresses, and that the IP address for server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> is “IP1”, and the IP address for server system <b>203</b>.<b>2</b> is “IP2”. “IP1” and “IP2” are th returned to the client <b>202</b> from the DNS. The client <b>202</b> then sends a request to connect to port “9010” at “IP1” or “IP2”. If the client <b>202</b> does not receive a connect reply from “IP1”(or “IP2”), it sends the request to “IP2” (or “IP1”). Assume that the client <b>202</b> receives a connect reply from “IP1”, via step <b>403</b>, connecting it to the server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b>. The client <b>202</b> then requests from server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> a list of server systems in the subset <b>204</b>, via step <b>404</b>. The server system <b>203</b>.<b>1</b> returns to the client <b>202</b> a list that contains itself and server system <b>203</b>.<b>2</b>, via step <b>405</b>. Future connections between the client <b>202</b> and the subset <b>204</b> will use this server list, via step <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For another example, assume that client <b>202</b> wishes to send a request for an application whose work is to be performed by the “appgroup3” subset <b>205</b>. The client <b>202</b> first obtains the IP addresses for the system servers of the “appgroup3” subset <b>205</b>, via step <b>401</b>. Assume that here, the DNS maintains these IP addresses, and that the IP address for server system <b>203</b>.<b>5</b> is “IP5”, and the IP address for server system <b>203</b>.<b>6</b> is “IP6”. “IP5” and “IP6” are thus returned to the client <b>202</b> from the DNS. The client <b>202</b> then sends a request to connect to port “9020” at “IP5” or “IP6”. If the client <b>202</b> does not receive a connect reply from “IP5” (or “IP6”), it sends the request to “IP6” (or “IP5”). Assume that the clie <b>202</b> receives a connect reply from “IP6”, via step <b>403</b>, connecting it to the server system <b>203</b>.<b>6</b>. The client <b>202</b> then requests from server system <b>203</b>.<b>6</b> a list of server systems in the subset <b>205</b>, via step <b>404</b>. The server system <b>203</b>.<b>6</b> returns to the client <b>202</b> a list that contains itself and server system <b>203</b>.<b>5</b>, via step <b>405</b>. Future connections between the client <b>202</b> and the subset <b>205</b> will use this server list, via step <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although the above embodiment is described with a DNS, other means of routing the connection is possible. For example, if the group <b>201</b> has one IP address, a distributing router can be used to route the connection request to a particular subset of server systems based on the targeted port.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the infrastructure of the group <b>201</b> supports workload balancing/routing, this feature is available for the subsets <b>204</b>-<b>205</b> as well. When a server system is activated, it registers itself with the workload balancer/router using the group name, as well as each subset name to which the server system is configured. When the server system is being accessed via its group name and port, it will request from the workload balancer/router the current list of server systems that are active in the group. If the server system is being accessed via one of its subset names and ports, then the server system will request from the workload balancer/router the current list of server systems that are active in the subset. This information is formatted and returned to the client <b>202</b>. This information can also be server weighted so that the client <b>202</b>, if made to use such information, can decide to which of the server systems future work is routed. Each time a client requests a new connection, or a reuse of a connection with a new user, an updated server list is returned.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When server systems leave the group, either through reconfiguration of the group or from failure, the information that was registered with the group workload balancer/router and/or request distributor for the server system is deregistered. In the case of abnormal server failures, the failing server system information is removed from the workload balancer/router and/or request distributor. Since the client has the information for available server systems, it can route work to the remaining server systems in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An improved method and system of subsetting a group of server systems has been disclosed. The method and system configures a server system with a group name and a group port, and with a subset name and a subset port of at least one subset of the server systems in the group. The server system, when activated, reads its configuration and registers with a system routing entity as being part of the group name and the port, and as being part of the subset name and the subset port. In this manner, server systems can be targeted via its subset name and subset port, while also accessible via the common name and port for the group. Work can be targeted to certain subsetted server systems, while direct data sharing between the server systems of the group is maintained. In addition, if the group includes a workload balancer, the server system also registers with the workload balancer using the group name and the subset name. Workload balancing is thus provided for the subset as well as the group.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
