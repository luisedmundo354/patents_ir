<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an expansion structure of memory module slots, and more particularly, to an expansion structure of memory module slots that is capable of assembling more memory modules onto a motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A central processing unit (CPU) of a computer host takes a random access memory (RAM) as a data storage area. Computing results and program instructions of the CPU are all stored in the RAM, and the data stored in the storage area is available once it is required by executing a program.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, the computer host has more and more powerful functions, and accordingly, the requirement for the calculation function is increasingly high, and thus, more RAMs are demanded. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a side view of a memory module being plugged in a motherboard, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic isometric view of the memory module. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a north bridge chip <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of memory module slots <b>22</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the north bridge chip <b>21</b><i>a </i>are disposed on a motherboard <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Memory modules <b>50</b><i>a </i>may be plugged in the memory module slots <b>22</b><i>a </i>by golden fingers. Each of the memory modules <b>50</b><i>a </i>further includes a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>51</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of memories <b>52</b><i>a</i>, and the memories <b>52</b><i>a </i>are respectively disposed on two end surfaces of the PCB <b>51</b><i>a</i>. The north bridge chip <b>21</b><i>a </i>is mainly used to control the signal transmission between the CPU and the memory modules <b>50</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, under the current situation of increasing data processing speed and increasing large data quantity for being processed, the capacity of the corresponding memory modules also becomes higher, and meanwhile, more memory module slots are required for more memory modules to be plugged in. However, the memory module slots are directly disposed on the surface of the motherboard, and thus, if more memory modules are intended to be assembled, more memory module slots have to be disposed on the surface of the motherboard, and thereby occupying more area of the motherboard. Under the limited assembling area of the motherboard, the assembling of other electronic elements is affected. On the other hand, the area of the motherboard must be enlarged to accommodate more memory module slots, which, however, causes an increase in the volume of the computer host, and thereby running against the trend for the computer host to become light in weight and small in size.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the prior art, to increase the capacity of the memory modules, the number of the memory module slots disposed on the surface of the motherboard must be increased, thereby occupying more area of the motherboard. In view of the aforementioned problem, the present invention is directed to providing an expansion structure of memory module slots, which expands the capacity of the memory modules without occupying more assembling area of the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The expansion structure of memory module slots provided by the present invention is applicable for a motherboard having a plurality of first memory module slots. The expansion structure of memory module slots comprises a circuit switch board and a substrate. Two ends of the circuit switch board are respectively formed into a first connecting terminal and a second connecting terminal that are conducted to each other, wherein the first connecting terminal is electrically connected to one of the first memory module slots. At least one second memory module slot is disposed on one side of the substrate, and a plurality of third memory module slots is disposed on the other side of the substrate, wherein the third memory module slots are electrically connected to the second memory module slot, and the second connecting terminal of the circuit switch board is electrically connected to the second memory module slot, such that a plurality of memory modules is respectively connected to each of the third memory module slots, and then electrically connected to the first memory module slots via the circuit switch board, thereby performing signal transmission with the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The expansion structure of memory module slots provided by the present invention has the efficacies as follows. The memory modules are expanded within a limited space without occupying more assembling area of the motherboard, which not only significantly reduces the surface area of the motherboard occupied by the memory modules, but also makes full use of the memory modules. The memory modules are stacked on the motherboard through the circuit switch board and the substrate, so the memory modules may be expanded upon a user's requirements. Furthermore, besides functioning as a holder for the substrate, the circuit switch board may also be used as a connecting channel between the motherboard and the substrate, without requiring additional connectors, and thereby reducing the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

In the following specific embodiments of the present invention, the dual in-line memory modules (DIMM) are taken as a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic isometric view of an embodiment of the present invention without a memory expansion card, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic isometric view of the embodiment of the present invention with the memory expansion card, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic side view of the embodiment of the present invention with the memory expansion card. The expansion structure of memory module slots is applicable for a motherboard <b>20</b> and includes a circuit switch board <b>30</b> and a substrate <b>40</b>. Furthermore, the motherboard <b>20</b> is disposed with a CPU, a north bridge chip <b>21</b>, and other electronic components. A plurality of first memory module slots <b>22</b> is disposed adjacent to the north bridge chip <b>21</b>, wherein fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> are plugged in the first memory module slots <b>22</b> by golden fingers. Each of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> further includes a circuit board <b>51</b>, a plurality of memories <b>52</b>, and an advanced memory buffer (AMB) <b>53</b>, wherein the memories <b>52</b> are respectively disposed on the two side surfaces of the circuit board <b>51</b>, and the advanced memory buffer (AMB) <b>53</b> is also disposed on one end surface of the circuit board <b>51</b>.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The circuit switch board <b>30</b> is a PCB with a signal transmission line, and the two ends of the circuit switch board <b>30</b> are formed into a first connecting terminal <b>31</b> and a second connecting terminal <b>32</b> that are conducted to each other, wherein the first connecting terminal <b>31</b> is plugged in one of the first memory module slots <b>22</b> on the motherboard <b>20</b>, and the second connecting terminal <b>32</b> is extended away from the motherboard <b>20</b> to support the substrate <b>40</b>, thereby making the substrate <b>40</b> be electrically conducted with the motherboard <b>20</b>. The number of the circuit switch boards <b>30</b> is mainly as small as possible, as long as the circuit switch boards <b>30</b> firmly support the substrate <b>40</b> on the motherboard <b>20</b>, and thereby preventing the substrate <b>40</b> from falling down. In this embodiment, the number of the circuit switch boards <b>30</b> is two, but it is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one second memory module slot <b>42</b> is disposed on one side of the substrate <b>40</b>, and a plurality of third memory module slots <b>43</b> is disposed on the other side of the substrate <b>40</b> and electrically connected to the second memory module slot, wherein the second memory module slot <b>42</b> on the substrate <b>40</b> is corresponding to the second connecting terminal <b>32</b> of the circuit switch board <b>30</b>, thereby being electrically connected to the second connecting terminal of the circuit switch board <b>30</b>, and each of the third memory module slots <b>43</b> is provided for each of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> to be plugged in by golden fingers. Herein, the number of the second memory module slots <b>42</b> is two, but which is not limited to this, and each of the second memory module slots <b>42</b> is corresponding to a set of the third memory module slots <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic top view of the circuit switch boards being plugged in the first memory module slots, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic top view of the circuit switch boards being plugged in the third memory module slots, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view of the signal transmission between the north bridge chip and each of the fully buffered DIMMs through a bus. According to the aforementioned means, during an assembling process, the first connecting terminal <b>31</b> of the circuit switch board <b>30</b> is plugged in one of the first memory module slots <b>22</b> of the motherboard <b>20</b> to serve as a holder for the substrate <b>40</b>. Then, the second memory module slot <b>42</b> of the substrate <b>40</b> is aligned with the second connecting terminal <b>32</b> of the circuit switch board <b>30</b>, and makes the second connecting terminal <b>32</b> be plugged in, and thus, they are electrically connected with each other. Therefore, the substrate <b>40</b> and the motherboard <b>20</b> are parallel to each other and spaced apart by a spacing distance. In this manner, the substrate <b>40</b> is supported and stacked above the first memory module slots <b>22</b> of the motherboard <b>20</b>. The first memory module slots <b>22</b> and the third memory module slots <b>43</b> are provided for an operator to plug the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> therein. Herein, there are eight fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> in this embodiment, which are divided into four sets according to positions, namely, the first set C<b>1</b>, the second set C<b>2</b>, the third set C<b>3</b>, and the fourth set C<b>4</b>, wherein two sets C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> are plugged in the first memory module slots <b>22</b>, and two sets C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> are plugged in the third memory module slots <b>43</b>, but the numbers are not limited that. The operator plugs the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> in the first memory module slots <b>22</b> and the third memory module slots <b>43</b> by golden fingers depending upon the required number of fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In practical application, the north bridge chip <b>21</b> transmits a signal to the sets C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and C<b>4</b> through the bus <b>60</b>, i.e., all the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> plugged in the first memory module slots <b>22</b> and the third memory module slots <b>43</b> can receive the signal. However, due to different positions of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b>, the signal transmission paths are also different, wherein the paths between the bus <b>60</b> and the sets C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> merely pass through the motherboard <b>20</b>, whereas the paths between the bus <b>60</b> and the sets C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> pass through the motherboard <b>20</b> and then reach the third memory module slots <b>43</b> through two circuit switch boards <b>30</b> respectively. Therefore, the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> plugged in the third memory module slots <b>43</b> is capable of transmitting data and signals with the north bridge chip <b>21</b> on the motherboard <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that, the height of the circuit switch board <b>30</b> should be determined in consideration of the space arrangement within the computer host. For example, when the first connecting terminal <b>31</b> and the second connecting terminal <b>32</b> of the circuit switch board <b>30</b> are plugged in one of the first memory module slots <b>22</b> and the second memory module slot <b>42</b>, the spacing distance between the substrate <b>40</b> and the motherboard <b>20</b> must be larger than the height of the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> after being plugged in the first memory module slots <b>22</b>, so as to prevent the substrate <b>40</b> from pressing and impacting the fully buffered DIMMs <b>50</b> plugged in the first memory module slots <b>22</b> and then causing damage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a similar way, according to the above assembling steps, another substrate may be stacked above the substrate <b>40</b> in a direction away from the motherboard <b>20</b>, so as to satisfy the operator's requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To sum up, in the present invention, the capacity of the memory modules is enlarged by means of stacking upwards. If the capacity of the memory modules is insufficient or to cater to the operator's requirements, another substrate is mounted on an area of the motherboard disposed with the memory modules through the circuit switch board, so as to accommodate more memory modules. In this manner, more memory module slots may be disposed on the motherboard, without adding additional assembling area, and the memory module slots are disposed in such a way that they occupy less area of the motherboard, thereby greatly reducing the occupied area of the motherboard. Furthermore, the operator only needs to plug the two ends of the circuit switch board into the original memory module slots, so as to electrically connect the substrate to the motherboard, and thereby transmitting data therebetween, without requiring other connectors, and thus the cost is saved. Furthermore, under the circumstance of the limited usable area of the motherboard, the process of expanding the memory modules towards above the motherboard also achieves an optimal effect of the memory modules.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>
