<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters find use in the preparation of various polymer blends which comprise polymers which are generally regarded as immiscible with one another, for example polyesters and polyolefins (EP 0 496 116 A1, EP 0 499 717 A1). EP 0 519 642 describes the use of a copolymer of unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters in a polymeric blend consisting of polyphenylene ether and polyester. These copolymers based on unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters enable compatibility between these two polymer types.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters are prepared according to previously described processes by first cyclizing glycerol with an orthoester (see reaction 1) and reacting the resulting hydroxy orthoester with acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride in the presence of a base to give the target compound (see reaction 2). 4-Acryloyloxymethyl-2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane ((2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl acrylate, MMDA) can, for example, be prepared in this way when the substituent R of the acid chloride is a hydrogen atom.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It has been found that, surprisingly, the reaction of unsaturated carboxylic acids, for example acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, with glycidol and subsequent addition of an orthoester can afford the desired unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters, without the isolation and workup of the intermediate. The process according to the present invention has the advantage over known processes that the carboxylic acid used as a reactant, for example acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, is less expensive than the corresponding acid chloride, for example acryloyl chloride or methacryloyl chloride. A further advantage of this process according to this invention is that the two process stages can be carried out in one and the same reactor without workup of the intermediates. Previously described processes are generally carried out in methylene chloride, reaction 1 being carried out in high dilution. In contrast, the process according to the present invention can be carried out without the presence of a solvent; in particular, the process according to the present invention can be carried out without the presence of halogenated compounds, for example methylene chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a process for preparing unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters, which comprises, in a first process stage, reacting an unsaturated carboxylic acid with glycidol and subsequently, in a second process stage, adding an orthoester to the reaction mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The process according to the invention for preparing unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters features, in a first process stage, reaction of an unsaturated carboxylic acid with glycidol and subsequently, in a second process stage, addition of an orthoester to the reaction mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the context of this invention, unsaturated, cyclic orthoesters are understood to mean compounds of the structure 1</p>

The pressure includes all values and subvalues therebetween, especially including 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">The catalyst used in the second process stage of the process according to the present invention may be an acidic or a salt-type catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">The catalyst used in the second process stage of the process according to the present invention may be an acidic catalyst, especially Brønsted or Lewis acids, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, HCl, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, HCOOH, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, oxalic acid, Al(halogen)<sub>3</sub>, B(halogen)<sub>3</sub>, TiCl<sub>4</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>3</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The acidic catalyst used in the second process stage is preferably p-toluenesulfonic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">In a particular embodiment of the process according to the invention, a salt-type catalyst is used in the second process stage, especially salts of NH<sub>3</sub>, or primary, secondary or tertiary amines. The salt-type catalysts used here are preferably NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NEt<sub>3</sub>HCl or NBu<sub>3</sub>HCl.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">In a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, it is possible in the second process stage to use ion exchangers, especially ion exchangers of the AMBERLYST® type or of the LEWATIT® type. It is likewise possible in the second process stage to use catalysts based on polymer-bound acids, for example MARLON® AS3.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">In a particular embodiment of the process according to the invention, different catalysts are used for the two process stages; in this context, particular preference is given to using a basic catalyst, especially triethylamine, in the first process stage, and an acidic catalyst, especially p-toluenesulfonic acid, in the second process stage. In the process according to the invention, it is, however, also possible to use one and the same catalyst for both process stages, so that it is possible to dispense with an additional catalyst addition in the second process stage. For this purpose, preference is given to using an acidic or a salt-type catalyst for both process stages.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">The two process stages of the process according to the present invention may be carried out in the same reactor without workup of intermediates being necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">Both the first and second process stage of the process according to the present invention may be carried out continuously or batchwise.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">In the process according to the invention, preference is given to initially charging the unsaturated carboxylic acid and to adding the further reactants gradually, especially to adding them dropwise, for example the glycidol in the first process stage or the orthoesters of the structure 3 in the second process stage. The reactants may be added dropwise over several hours.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">When the glycidol serves as a solvent or suspension medium for the unsaturated carboxylic acid, the dropwise addition in the first process stage may be partly or entirely dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">After the second process stage, the reaction mixture may be freed of low boilers present in the reaction mixture by means of a distillation. Subsequently, the product can be purified by means of a vacuum distillation.</p>
