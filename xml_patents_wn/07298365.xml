<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to flexible electronic paper. More specifically, the present invention relates to an information device using a plurality of sheets of electronic paper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the recent advances made towards an information society, a larger volume of text information, image information, and audio information needs to be handled. A variety of information devices that efficiently handle such information have been developed and are commercially available. One of such information devices is an information device called an electronic book. The electronic book is capable of storing and displaying a sufficiently large volume of information as to be physically difficult to store in the form of a traditional book with sheets of paper bound.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical electronic book includes a display unit employing a flat panel display, such as a liquid crystal display, and an information holding unit. However, such an electronic book has the limitation that a large amount of page information must be made available on a single display. Thus, the development of easier-to-use information devices or new interfaces has advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A user interface having an additional function of detecting the contact pressure, contact area, contact point, and so forth of a finger touching the display unit of an information device for page updating has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-163193 discloses an information device in which it is determined whether or not page scrolling has been input based on a finger touch and the finger movement direction on a display unit such as a liquid crystal display and, if it is determined that page scrolling has been input, the image information being output on the display unit is updated to the image information on the previous or following page.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, flexible electronic paper has attracted attention as a new device intended to realize electronic books that provide the feeling of traditional paper bound books. The main goal in the development of electronic paper is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(1) anytime, anywhere readability and writability;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) flexibility in updating text and images;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(3) a viewing screen that causes less visual strain to the human eye (human-eye-friendly screen);</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(4) a thin and light body for portability (flexible handling); and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(5) long-term image holding without power.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The development of devices for implementing such flexible electronic paper having the features described above has advanced remarkably.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,064 discloses a system including a removable, flexible, induced field activated display sheet with a memory function, a housing having the function of creating appropriate induced fields for activating the sheet to produce an image, and a processor connected to the display sheet for sending image data.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A plurality of sheets of the flexible electronic paper described above are bound into an information device, hereinafter referred to as a flexible electronic book. By giving the feeling of a paper-based book, the flexible electronic book provides better usability than such an electronic book that includes a single flat panel display. However, such a flexible electronic book having a limited number of sheets of flexible electronic paper also requires an interface that allows a large volume of information to be displayed on a limited viewing area. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-287729 shows a user interface using an acceleration sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Due to the foregoing problems, there is a need for a flexible electronic book having a plurality of sheets of flexible electronic paper with improved usability in which, particularly, pages can be scrolled as naturally as possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an aspect of the present invention, an information device includes: a flexible display unit capable of displaying information having page information in units of pages; a detection unit that detects at least one of a bending direction, an amount of bending, and a duration that the display unit is bent; and a scroll determination unit that determines whether or not page scrolling has been input based on the detected at least one of the bending direction, the amount of bending, and the duration that the display unit is bent, and that updates the information output on the display unit when it is determined that page scrolling has been input.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a speed at which the information is updated in the information device may be based on the amount of bending.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the duration of the bending may be a duration of time for which the amount of bending exceeds a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it may be determined that page scrolling has not been input when the bending direction is opposite a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the information may be reversely updated on the display unit when the bending direction is opposite a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the detection unit may be provided at each of two portions of the display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the detection unit may include a piezoelectric device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, the detection unit may include a piezoelectric polymer. The piezoelectric polymer may be polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing, in the simplest manner, an information device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The information device includes a display <b>11</b>, a memory <b>12</b> for information management, a detection unit (sensor) <b>13</b> that detects input information from a user, and a controller <b>14</b> for controlling these components. The display <b>11</b> may be a flexible electronic paper display. Specific examples of the display <b>11</b> include a microcapsule electrophoretic display device, a twisting ball device, a dual-frequency-driving liquid crystal device, a liquid crystal/organic light-sensor display device, a toner display, and so on. A flexible material, such as polymer, is suitable for the display device. Either electronic paper capable of single-sided display or double-sided display is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sensor <b>13</b> has the function of detecting the amount of bending of the flexible electronic paper, the duration of the bending, and so forth, which are input by a user to the flexible electronic paper. The sensor <b>13</b> may also detect the bending direction, that is, inward or outward bending, in addition to the amount of bending and the duration of the bending.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A piezoelectric device is suitable for converting the bending detected by the sensor <b>13</b> into an electrical signal. In view of placing such a pressure device on high-flexibility electronic paper, a piezoelectric polymer may be suitably employed. The following are the advantages of piezoelectric polymer:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">highly flexible and less damaging;</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">responsive to stress; and</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">available in large areas.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows flexible electronic paper having a piezoelectric device. A matrix of pixels (not shown) for displaying information in units of pages is formed on a display screen of the electronic paper. On the opposite surface, i.e., the back, piezoelectric sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are placed on the lower and upper left portions (the lower and upper right portions as viewed from the display screen), respectively. In the electronic paper, the piezoelectric sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> may be located in any area on either the front or back of the paper. In order to allow a user to more naturally turn over a sheet of paper, the piezoelectric sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are preferably located at the corners of a sheet of rectangular paper.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, according to the present invention, a flexible electronic book having a plurality of sheets of flexible electronic paper with improved usability in which pages can be scrolled naturally can be realized.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) material, which is a piezoelectric polymer, is processed by an extruder into sheet form, and is then reduced to a thickness of 50 □m by stretching. This stretched film undergoes a process called poling, and it is then used as a pressure sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The base material of the electronic paper is PET (polyethylene terephthalate) of 300 □m thickness. An ITO (indium-tin oxide) electrode is formed over the PET base material as a transparent electrode, and black and white toner particles are filled between the two layers, thereby producing toner-display electronic paper capable of black-and-white display. The pressure sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are placed at the corners on the back (non-display portion) of the toner display. Such electronic paper equipped with a pressure sensor is capable of single-sided display. A required number of sheets of such electronic paper, for example, <b>10</b> sheets of electronic paper, are bound into an electronic book by, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, connecting a display portion (paper portion) <b>32</b> to a file portion <b>31</b>. The file portion <b>31</b> houses the controller <b>14</b> and the memory <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The display portion <b>32</b> having pages displays information sent from the controller <b>14</b> in units of pages. The memory <b>12</b> of the file portion <b>31</b> generally contains information corresponding to ten pages or more, of which a given page and the following nine pages are displayed. Alternatively, a given page and several previous and following pages may be displayed. Like a traditional book, the page number is shown on each page in the upper or lower margin or in any of the four corners.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a state where information having page information is shown on the electronic book, when the lower-right sensor <b>21</b> on the top page of the display portion <b>32</b> (the paper portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) bends, a voltage corresponding to the bending direction and the amount of bending is generated in the sensor <b>21</b> and is then sent to the controller <b>14</b>. As will be described in further detail below, the controller <b>14</b> determines whether or not the generated voltage is equal to a predetermined voltage or more. If it is equal to the predetermined voltage or more, the controller <b>14</b> measures the duration of the bending. When the measured duration is over a predetermined value, the controller <b>14</b> determines that page scrolling has been input. The controller <b>14</b> further determines the page updating speed based on the voltage value, and the display <b>11</b> is updated at this speed. This allows the page information to be scrolled forward.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, it may be determined whether or not page scrolling has been input based on only the amount of bending or only the duration of the bending. Moreover, when a page is bent in the direction opposite to the direction of turning a page of a standard book, it may be determined that page scrolling has not been input.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If page numbers are shown in the same position as the sensor <b>21</b>, the next page appears when the sensor <b>21</b> portion is bent, thus allowing the user to continuously scroll the pages up to the desired page while visually checking the page numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A user can scroll the page information in the opposite direction by bending the sensor <b>22</b> portion. Alternatively, the page information can be scrolled in the opposite direction when a negative voltage is generated by reversely bending a sensor portion.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When each sensor portion is bent with a small bending curvature, a small value of voltage is generated, resulting in slow scrolling. On the other hand, when the bending curvature is large, a large value of voltage is generated, resulting in fast scrolling. Accordingly, a flexible electronic book having a user interface that provides realistic feeling can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a condition where the electronic book <b>30</b> has been opened. Like a traditional book, the page number is shown on each page in the upper or lower margin or in any of the four corners.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are arranged on each of the pages of a plurality of pages (e.g., each of ten pages) of electronic paper <b>10</b>. When it is opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, only the sensors of the electronic paper <b>101</b> which a user can directly see are validated. For example, each electronic paper generates a signal indicating whether the page is surface or back, and the controller <b>14</b> may determine, based on the number of the signals indicating the surface page, which page is currently visible. The operation of rewriting is only applied to the electronic paper that is currently visible.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When a user curves the sensor <b>21</b> in the lower right of the top page of the display portion <b>32</b> in the condition where the electronic book <b>30</b> shows information with page information, a voltage corresponding to the direction and quantity of the curve is generated in the sensor <b>21</b> and transferred to the controller <b>14</b>. The controller <b>14</b> determines whether the voltage is equal to or greater than a predetermined value. In the case that the voltage is equal to or greater than the predetermined value, the controller <b>14</b> counts a continuous time that the voltage has been equal to or greater than the predetermined value. When the counted continuous time elapses over a predetermined time, the controller <b>14</b> determines that an instruction of a page increment has been entered. Further, the controller <b>14</b> calculates a speed of page update in accordance with the value of the detected voltage, and updates, in accordance with the calculated speed, information to be displayed on the display portion <b>32</b>. Thereby, page information can be scrolled to an order direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The operations are described in detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a sensor output <b>54</b>, output signals <b>81</b> and <b>84</b> from first and second comparators, a page increment signal <b>83</b> at a normal speed and a page increment signal <b>86</b> at a high speed in the cases where it is changed from an initial condition <b>50</b> with no curve to a condition <b>51</b> with a slight curve, and/or to a condition <b>52</b> with further more curve, and/or to a condition <b>53</b> returned to the initial condition. The horizontal axis is time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram showing an internal structure of the controller <b>14</b>. The controller <b>14</b> receives signals <b>71</b> from each of the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> on each of the pages of the electronic papers <b>10</b>, and includes an input buffer <b>72</b> outputting the signals from the validated sensors, the first and second comparators <b>73</b> and <b>74</b>, first and second counters <b>75</b> and <b>76</b>, first and second determination units <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> for determining page increment, and a display control unit <b>79</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A voltage output <b>80</b> of the validated sensor output from the input buffer <b>72</b> is input to the first comparator <b>73</b> and compared to a comparison value V1 (100 mV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In the case where the curve (bending of the electronic page) exceeds a predetermined value, the sensor output <b>80</b> becomes larger than 100 mV, and thereby the output <b>81</b> of the first comparator <b>73</b> is changed from L (low) to H (high) and the signal is transferred to the first counter <b>75</b>. At that time, the counter <b>75</b> starts to count and outputs a count value, i.e., a continuous time of the curved condition, to the first page increment determination unit <b>77</b>. The page increment determination unit <b>77</b> generates a pulse <b>831</b> as a page increment signal <b>83</b> when the counter output <b>82</b> becomes a predetermined value (e.g., 1 sec.) and sends the pulse <b>831</b> to the display control unit <b>79</b>. The display control unit <b>79</b> increments, based on the pulse <b>831</b>, a page to be displayed, reads information of a new page from the memory <b>12</b>, sends the page information to the display <b>11</b> and causes the display <b>11</b> to display the information of the new page.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the case where the curved condition of the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> has been maintained, the counter <b>75</b> further keeps the counting operation. When a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 0.5 sec.) elapses after the initial page increment signal is generated, a next pulse <b>832</b> for a next page increment is generated, and thereby the display <b>11</b> is further updated. Then, pulses <b>833</b>, <b>834</b> and so on are sequentially generated and the displayed page is updated in increments of 0.5 sec. elapsed time.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Based on the operation as described above, a user can see that a page is updated in the 0.5 sec. increments after he/she initially curves the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and maintains the curve.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the operations as described above, in the case where the user curves the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> a greater amount (e.g., curve <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the sensor output <b>80</b> becomes larger than a second comparison value (200 mV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In this case, the output <b>84</b> from the second comparator <b>74</b> is changed from L (low) to H (high), and a continuous time of the curve condition is counted by the second counter <b>76</b> and output as a count output <b>85</b>. When a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 1.5 sec.) elapses, it is determined as the high speed page increment, and a pulse <b>861</b> for a high speed increment signal <b>86</b> is transferred to the display control unit <b>79</b>. When the display control unit <b>79</b> receives the pulse <b>861</b>, the page increment signals <b>83</b> are ignored and the high speed page increment signal is prioritized. Then, the display control unit <b>79</b> reads page information incremented with <b>10</b> pages from the memory <b>12</b> and sends the read page information to the display <b>11</b>. Thereby the display <b>11</b> updates and displays the page incremented with the <b>10</b> pages. Then, the <b>10</b> pages increment is sequentially conducted based on pulses <b>862</b> and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The high speed page increment may be modified as divided to three or more conditions with three or more comparison values and thereby provided an intermediate speed page increment operation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The user stops maintaining the curve condition of the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and returns the sensors <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> to the normal condition <b>53</b> when the target page is displayed. Thereby the sensor output <b>80</b> becomes below the comparison value, and the comparators outputs <b>81</b> and <b>84</b> are returned to L. The counters <b>75</b> and <b>76</b> are reset and the outputs are stopped. Because a pulse for page increment is not further generated, the displayed page information is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The determination for page increment may be based on only the quantity of the curve or the continuous time of the curve condition. Further, in the case where the electronic paper is curved to a reverse direction to a normal page increment of the traditional book, it may be arranged so as not to be determined as a page increment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case where the page number is displayed in the same position as the sensor <b>21</b>, the user can see the page number of a next page when to curve the sensor <b>21</b> and the user can continue the scrolling operation by seeing the page number until the page number reaches the target page number.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, it may be arranged so as to scroll the page information in a reverse direction by curving the sensor <b>22</b>, or may be arranged so as to scroll the page information in a reverse direction based on a negative voltage generated by curving the sensors to a reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the above embodiments, the generated voltage by each sensor becomes low when to make the curvature of the sensor small, and thereby the page information is slowly scrolled. On the other hand, the generated voltage by each sensor becomes high when to make the curvature of the sensor large, and thereby the page information is quickly scrolled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the case where a user actually turns over the electronic paper and opens another electronic paper to look at another page of information, the sensor <b>21</b> or <b>22</b> is, also, curved. It, however, is distinguished from the page increment operation of the present embodiment as described above because the time required for the actual page turn over operation is less than 1 sec. In other words, the comparison time value for the initial page increment (1 sec. in the above description) is set to a longer time than the time required for the actual page turn over.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the electronic paper <b>101</b> is later opened to a second page, the left page is the back of the previous electronic paper <b>102</b>. In the case where the electronic paper can display page information on the back side of the paper, it is displayed of information of a page previous to the page to be displayed on the surface of the electronic paper <b>101</b> (right side).</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows electronic paper constituting a display of an information device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A manufacturing method for the electronic paper shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A pressure sensor formed of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sheet is produced in a similar manner to that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The base material of the electronic paper is PET (polyethylene terephthalate) of 300 □m thickness. An ITO electrode is formed over the PET base material as a transparent electrode, and a polymer-dispersed double-frequency liquid crystal is sandwiched between the two layers, thereby producing liquid-crystal-display electronic paper capable of black-and-white display. Then, two sheets of the electronic paper are bonded with each other so that the back sides face each other with such pressure sensors as described above therebetween, thereby producing electronic paper capable of double-sided display. The pressure sensors are positioned at the comers, as indicated by reference numerals <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. A certain number of sheets of such electronic paper, for example, 20 sheets of electronic paper, are bound into an electronic book by connecting a display portion <b>11</b> to a file portion <b>31</b> that houses a sensor <b>13</b> and a controller <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the sensor <b>41</b> portion is bent in a state where display of information having page information is spread across double pages of the electronic book, the page information can be scrolled forward. In this case, when the sensor <b>42</b> portion is bent, the page information can be scrolled backward. The scrolling speed can increase by continuously bending each sensor portion, and the pages can thus be efficiently updated. Accordingly, a flexible electronic book having a user interface that provides realistic feeling can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
