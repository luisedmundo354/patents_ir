<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to paperboard cartons for use in packaging articles and, more particularly, relates to a dispensing carton with at least one opening for dispensing articles from within the carton.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cartons are useful for allowing consumers to purchase, transport and store a desired quantity of articles such as soft drinks. For the convenience of the consumer, some cartons have dispensers which allow the articles to be removed one at a time while continuing to encase the remaining articles. A portion of the carton is torn out to form an opening from which articles may be dispensed. There are typically multiple rows of articles, one above the other, carried within the carton. Once the endmost article is removed from the carton through the dispenser, another article moves forward.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are also larger cartons for multiple tiers of articles, one alongside the other, while each tier has multiple rows of articles, one above the other. These larger cartons are commonly referred to as double stacked cartons.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although there are multiple types of cartons available, there is not a simple dispenser configuration that may be easily incorporated into most types of cartons as well as permit most types of articles to be easily dispensed. Therefore, there is a need for an improved dispenser that facilitates easy access to the endmost article within many types of cartons. The improved dispenser must be adaptable for use with double stack cartons.</p>

In some embodiments, the cartons <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are for dispensing articles such as beverage cans or bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally described, the cartons <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are formed from a foldable sheet material such as a paperboard. Carton <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is formed from a paperboard blank <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The blank <b>16</b> includes at least four primary panels for forming the carton <b>10</b>. The panels of the blank <b>16</b> are a bottom wall <b>18</b>, a first side wall <b>20</b>, a second side wall <b>22</b>, and a top wall <b>24</b>.

Bottom end flaps <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are folded upwardly along fold lines <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and are secured to the outside surfaces of end flaps <b>56</b>,<b>58</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cartons illustrated in the drawings are adapted to hold a group of similarly dimensioned cylindrical articles such as bottles. The articles in the carton <b>10</b> are preferably oriented in a side-by-side parallel fashion and in an upright manner, rather than disposed horizontally on their sides. The first and second side walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are disposed alongside the sides of the articles while the bottom of the articles rest on the bottom wall <b>18</b> of the carton <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the carton <b>10</b> of the present invention includes a removable portion <b>86</b> defined by endless tear line <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d</i>. The vertical size of the removable portion <b>86</b>, preferably, is no less than half the size of the vertical size of the carton. Stated differently, the opening defined in the carton <b>10</b>, once the removable portion <b>86</b> is removed, preferably has a vertical length that is at least a half of the height of the carton <b>10</b>, but less than the height of the carton <b>10</b>. The blank <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> best illustrates the endless tear line <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d</i>. The endless tear line <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d </i>is endless in that line portions <b>88</b><i>c</i>, <b>88</b><i>a</i>, <b>88</b><i>b </i>and <b>88</b><i>d </i>are connected one to the next to form a single continuous tear line in the blank <b>16</b> and that portion <b>88</b><i>c </i>extends and reaches the free/distal end of portion <b>88</b><i>d </i>when the carton <b>10</b> is erected. The endless tear line <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d </i>may be a line of severance or any other weakened line that facilitates separation along the length of the tear line <b>88</b>. It is contemplated that the tear line includes, but is not limited to, a perforation, a line of short slits, a line of half cut, a combination of slits and score lines, or the equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A first portion <b>88</b><i>a </i>of the endless tear line <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d </i>is formed in the top wall <b>24</b> and extends between an end edge of the top wall <b>24</b> and a side edge of the top wall <b>24</b> corresponding with the fold lines <b>38</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively.
