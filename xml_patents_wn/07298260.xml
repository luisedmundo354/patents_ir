<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable to this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to security systems and more specifically it relates to a tesla coil security system for proactively and effectively deterring unauthorized individuals from entering an opening in a non-lethal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Security systems have been in use for years (e.g. home security systems, vehicle security systems). A conventional security system is typically merely “reactive” in the sense that it is not activated until after an unauthorized entry has occurred through an opening (e.g. door, window). In other words, criminals and other unauthorized individuals are typically not deterred from entering or attempting to enter an opening in a building, vehicle and the like with conventional security systems. Common reactive responses from conventional security systems is an audible alarm (e.g. siren, warning voice), a visual alarm (e.g. flashing light), and/or an alarm signal transmitted to a security center or government authorities (e.g. police).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While conventional security systems may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for proactively and effectively deterring unauthorized individuals from entering an opening in a non-lethal manner. Conventional alarm systems are merely “reactive” to an unauthorized entry through an opening and are not typically “proactive” in deterring unauthorized entry into a location.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In these respects, the tesla coil security system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of proactively and effectively deterring unauthorized individuals from entering an opening in a non-lethal manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of security systems now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new tesla coil security system construction wherein the same can be utilized for proactively and effectively deterring unauthorized individuals from entering an opening in a non-lethal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new tesla coil security system that has many of the advantages of the security systems mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new tesla coil security system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art security systems, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a tesla coil, a length of wire electrically connected to the tesla coil for surrounding an opening to be protected, and a plurality of charge dissipaters electrically extending from the wire for facilitating the discharge of electrical charge thereby creating an electrical visual effect for deterring entry through the opening. A control unit is in communication with the tesla coil for controlling the operation of the tesla coil and a sensor is in communication with the control unit for determining the presence of an individual, whereby detection by the sensor of the presence of an individual causes the tesla coil to be activated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and that will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of the description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A primary object of the present invention is to provide a tesla coil security system that will overcome the shortcomings of the prior art devices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A second object is to provide a tesla coil security system for proactively and effectively deterring unauthorized individuals from entering an opening in a non-lethal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object is to provide a tesla coil security system that does not utilize lethal force to deter unauthorized entry into a location.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An additional object is to provide a tesla coil security system that creates a visual effect surrounding an opening to be protected from unauthorized entry that deters unauthorized individuals from attempting to pass through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further object is to provide a tesla coil security system that may be utilized about various types of openings such as but not limited to doors, windows, passages, hallways and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object is to provide a tesla coil security system that may be utilized upon various objects and structures such as but not limited to buildings, homes, vehicles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become obvious to the reader and it is intended that these objects and advantages are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To the accomplishment of the above and related objects, this invention may be embodied in the form illustrated in the accompanying drawings, attention being called to the fact, however, that the drawings are illustrative only, and that changes may be made in the specific construction illustrated and described within the scope of the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">A. Overview</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> illustrate a tesla coil security system <b>10</b>, which comprises a tesla coil <b>20</b>, a length of wire <b>30</b> electrically connected to the tesla coil <b>20</b> for surrounding an opening <b>12</b> to be protected, and a plurality of charge dissipaters <b>32</b> electrically extending from the wire <b>30</b> for facilitating the discharge of electrical charge thereby creating an electrical visual effect for deterring entry through the opening <b>12</b>. A control unit <b>40</b> is in communication with the tesla coil <b>20</b> for controlling the operation of the tesla coil <b>20</b> and a sensor <b>50</b> is in communication with the control unit <b>40</b> for determining the presence of an individual, whereby detection by the sensor <b>50</b> of the presence of an individual causes the tesla coil <b>20</b> to be activated.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">B. Tesla Coil</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> illustrate the usage of a tesla coil <b>20</b> to generate the electrical charge that is electrically transferred through the wire <b>30</b> and the charge dissipaters <b>32</b>. The tesla coil <b>20</b> may be comprised of any conventional tesla coil <b>20</b> or any other device capable of generating a similar electrical charge.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">C. Length of Wire</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> of the drawings, a length of wire <b>30</b> is electrically connected to an electrical connector <b>22</b> of the tesla coil <b>20</b>. The length of wire <b>30</b> preferably substantially surrounds an opening <b>12</b> to be protected (e.g. a doorway, a window, a hallway or a passage of a building structure; doorway and/or window of a vehicle). The length of wire <b>30</b> may be comprised of various materials such as but not limited to copper.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref> of the drawings, the length of wire <b>30</b> is preferably formed into a closed loop and/or an open loop structure about the perimeter of the opening <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> of the drawings. The loop may have various shapes capable of deterring unauthorized entry through the opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> of the drawings, a plurality of charge dissipaters <b>32</b> electrically extend from the length of wire <b>30</b> for facilitating the discharge of electrical charge thereby creating an electrical visual effect similar to a tesla coil <b>20</b> for deterring entry through the opening <b>12</b>. The plurality of charge dissipaters <b>32</b> preferably extend inwardly from the length of wire <b>30</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> of the drawings. The charge dissipaters <b>32</b> preferably have a relatively shorter length with the distal end portion extended away from the wire <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">D. Control Unit</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A control unit <b>40</b> may be in communication with the tesla coil <b>20</b> for controlling the operation of the tesla coil <b>20</b>. The control unit <b>40</b> may be comprised of any electrical device capable of controlling the electrical power and functions of the tesla coil <b>20</b> (e.g. computer). The control unit <b>40</b> is also electrically connected to a power source <b>16</b> (e.g. wall outlet) for receiving electrical power to be provided to the tesla coil <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the tesla coil <b>20</b> could be electrically connected directly to the power source <b>16</b>. In addition, a manual switch may be utilized to control the power to and operation of the tesla coil <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">E. Sensor</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A sensor <b>50</b> is preferably in communication with the control unit <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> of the drawings. The sensor <b>50</b> is for determining the presence of an individual, whereby detection by the sensor <b>50</b> of the presence of an individual causes the tesla coil <b>20</b> to be activated by the control unit <b>40</b> to deter the individual from attempting to enter through the opening <b>12</b>. The sensor <b>50</b> may be comprised of various detection devices such as but not limited to a motion detecting device.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">F. Installation of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The tesla coil <b>20</b>, control unit <b>40</b>, length of wire <b>30</b> and at least one sensor <b>50</b> are provided to the location of installation (e.g. building, vehicle). The length of wire <b>30</b> is preferably attached about a perimeter of the opening <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref> of the drawings. The length of wire <b>30</b> is further electrically connected to the tesla coil <b>20</b> and the tesla coil <b>20</b> is electrically connected to the control unit <b>40</b>. Finally, the sensor <b>50</b> is either electrically connected to the control unit <b>40</b> or connected via a remote communication system (e.g. wireless).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">G. Operation of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In operation, the present invention may be operated manually or automatically. If the invention is operated manually, the user merely manually activates the tesla coil <b>20</b> to provide an electrical visual effect within the looped length of wire <b>30</b> that may be comprised of a closed loop or an open loop. If the invention is operated automatically, the sensor <b>50</b> determines the presence of an individual (e.g. via detected movement, body temperature, pressure) and communicates to the control unit <b>40</b> that an individual is near the opening <b>12</b> thereby activating the tesla coil <b>20</b>. During automatic operation of the present invention, after the individual leaves the control unit <b>40</b> automatically turns off the tesla coil <b>20</b> either immediately or after a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the tesla coil <b>20</b> is activated (either manually or automatically), an electrical charge is created within the tesla coil <b>20</b> that is transferred to the length of wire <b>30</b>. The electrical charge is then transferred to the charge dissipaters <b>32</b> which dissipate the electrical charge into the air across the opening <b>12</b> thereby creating an electrical visual effect that deters entry by an unauthorized individual. The electrical charge dissipation is similar to that created by a tesla coil <b>20</b> and will not injure an individual or animals while simultaneously deterring entry through the opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">What has been described and illustrated herein is a preferred embodiment of the invention along with some of its variations. The terms, descriptions and figures used herein are set forth by way of illustration only and are not meant as limitations. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, which is intended to be defined by the following claims (and their equivalents) in which all terms are meant in their broadest reasonable sense unless otherwise indicated.
