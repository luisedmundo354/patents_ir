<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to novelty grills, and in particular to a grille that is in the form of a football field.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Grilling outdoors is one of the most popular means of cooking in the United States. Especially during warm months, and even during the cold months of football season, many people can be seen grilling, such as those who engage in “tailgating” at a sporting event such as a football game. Additionally, Americans have a passion for sporting events, enjoy novelty sports items, and enjoy decorating items with a sports motif.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Design Pat. No. D425,367 directed towards an ornamental design of a barbeque grille shaped like a football, with shelves on either side of the football, which resemble half of a football field.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,209,533 is directed towards a smoker chamber and a firebox. The smoker chamber defines a smoker interior, which is adapted for receiving food items for smoking, and includes an opening for providing access to the smoker interior. The firebox engages in fluid communication with the smoker interior so that smoke produced within the firebox can flow into the smoker interior for smoking the food items placed therein. Preferably, the firebox is sized and shaped so that it is insertable through the opening and into the smoker interior. In embodiments so configured, the firebox may be placed within the smoker interior, such as during shipping of the smoker grill, thereby allowing components of the grill to be stored and shipped in a container that is smaller than could otherwise be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,599 is directed towards a self-contained cooker and grill having quadrilateral doors with a separate cooking grate attached to each door. Closure of all doors provides a conventional barbecue type cooker or smoker with a full sized grate and a common area for support of solid fuels. The multiple door cooker allows the operator to vary cooking times and heating of four different cooking surfaces. Each door can be opened independently allowing the operator to access the immediate cooking surface without disrupting the remaining cooking surfaces. An upper grate is provided in a fixed, movable, or rotational arrangement for adaptation to various cooking requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Patent Application No. 20020134368 is directed towards a barbeque grill capable of being conveniently transported to remote outdoor locations, which is shaped to resemble the design of a toolbox.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need, however, for a football field grille that can satisfy the novelty desire of America's sports fans which closely resembles a football field having goalposts as vents. None of the above prior art references satisfy this need. It would therefore be advantageous if a football field grille existed that when closed, included the additional novelty of having the smoke from the grill travel through mock goalposts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a football field grille for use by fans.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a football field grille for use by fans having a firebox; a retractable lid mounted on the firebox, capable of retracting from a first closed position to a second open position; a hollow goalpost, having a first end and a second end, the first end of the goalpost mounted on the retractable lid, and the second end of the hollow goalpost in fluid communication with the firebox when the retractable lid is in the first closed position; and at least one support leg, mounted to the firebox to engage a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a football field grille for use by fans having a firebox; a retractable lid mounted on the firebox, having a first half and a second half, capable of retracting from a first closed position to a second open position; a first set of hinges having first ends and second ends, and a second set of hinges having first ends and second ends, wherein the first ends of the first set of hinges are pivotally attached to the firebox and the second ends of the first set of hinges are pivotally attached to the first half of the retractable lid, and the first ends of the second set of hinges are pivotally attached to the firebox and the second ends of the second set of hinges are pivotally attached to the second half of the retractable lid; a hollow goalpost, having a first end and a second end, the first end of the goalpost mounted on the retractable lid, and the second end of the hollow goalpost in fluid communication with the firebox when the retractable lid is in the first closed position; a grate for cooking food on, wherein the grate is exposed when the retractable lid is in the second open position; a bracket having a first end and a second end, wherein the first end of the bracket is removably mounted on the firebox and the second end of the bracket is adapted to secure the football field grille to an object; and a support leg, mounted to the firebox to engage a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a first aspect of the present, a novel football field grille is provided. The football field grille includes a firebox; a retractable lid mounted on the firebox, capable of retracting from a first closed position to a second open position; a hollow goalpost, having a first end and a second end, the first end of the goalpost mounted on the retractable lid, and the second end of the hollow goalpost in fluid communication with the firebox when the retractable lid is in the first closed position; and at least one support leg, mounted to the firebox to engage a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a novel football field grille is provided. The novel football field grill includes a firebox; a retractable lid mounted on the firebox, having a first half and a second half, capable of retracting from a first closed position to a second open position; a first set of hinges having first ends and second ends, and a second set of hinges having first ends and second ends, wherein the first ends of the first set of hinges are pivotally attached to the firebox and the second ends of the first set of hinges are pivotally attached to the first half of the retractable lid, and the first ends of the second set of hinges are pivotally attached to the firebox and the second ends of the second set of hinges are pivotally attached to the second half of the retractable lid; a hollow goalpost, having a first end and a second end, the first end of the goalpost mounted on the retractable lid, and the second end of the hollow goalpost in fluid communication with the firebox when the retractable lid is in the first closed position; a grate for cooking food on, wherein the grate is exposed when the retractable lid is in the second open position; a bracket having a first end and a second end, wherein the first end of the bracket is removably mounted on the firebox and the second end of the bracket is adapted to secure the football field grille to an object; and a support leg, mounted to the firebox to engage a surface.</p>
