<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a reception method, reception apparatus and wireless transmission system when adaptive modulation/demodulation is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are conventional communication systems which select a wireless transmission system according to traffic of each service area, propagation environment and required service content. As conventional wireless communication systems that select this wireless transmission system, there are a low-speed adaptive modulation scheme which takes into consideration traffic, propagation environment, desired transmission speed, etc., when a channel is assigned to each user (communication terminal apparatus) and a high-speed adaptive modulation scheme which adapts its modulation scheme within the assigned range according to instantaneous variations in a propagation path to improve transmission quality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The low-speed adaptive modulation scheme is basically intended to reduce concentration of traffic of communication systems and at the same time assign transmission bands which will meet requests from users (communication terminal apparatuses) to the greatest possible extent by providing specified quality.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, the high-speed adaptive modulation scheme is intended to monitor instantaneous C/Ic (power ratio of a desired signal to an interference signal: carrier to co-channel power ratio) and instantaneous delay spread and at the same time realize high throughput with high transmission quality by selecting an optimum number of modulation multi-values and symbol rate within the assigned band.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Communication systems using these schemes are easily adaptable to implementation of a large-capacity system, buffering of load on communication systems in response to dynamic variations of traffic and handling of services for media with different transmission speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, as modulation schemes that can be switched in a communication system, there are QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying), 16QAM (16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and 64QAM, etc. In these modulation schemes, frequency utilization efficiency increases from QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM in that order, but with the increase of frequency utilization efficiency, an inter-signal distance also decreases in that order, which makes the system vulnerable to noise.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an adaptive modulation scheme that adaptively switches between these modulation schemes, selects, for example, a modulation index (number of modulation multi-values) based on its average CNR, and can thereby select an optimum modulation scheme according to its propagation path environment (e.g., see the Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. HEI 11-275164, p 6, FIG. 2).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional reception apparatus of a system that demodulates waveform distortion due to fading through adaptive equalization processing. Here, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)-based communication system will be shown and suppose that known signal patterns (training signals) used for synchronization acquisition and transmission path estimation are inserted in processing units (burst, etc.) of a received signal. However, suppose information on a modulation index is not included in the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a reception apparatus <b>1</b> performs reception processing on the received signal at a wireless section <b>2</b> and then supplies this to an A/D (analog/digital) conversion section <b>3</b>. The analog/digital conversion section <b>3</b> converts the received signal supplied from the wireless section <b>2</b> to a digital signal and then supplies it to a reception level measuring section <b>4</b>, a transmission path estimation section <b>5</b>, a synchronization section <b>6</b> and a demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The reception level measuring section <b>4</b> measures intensity of the digital received signal (RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) signal level) supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>3</b> and thereby performs gain control on the wireless section <b>2</b>. The transmission path estimation section <b>5</b> performs transmission path estimation based on the digital received signal supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>3</b> and then supplies the result to a switching section <b>7</b>. Furthermore, the synchronization section <b>6</b> performs coherent detection based on the digital received signal to acquire synchronization with the transmission path estimation section <b>5</b> and demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>10</b> supplies the digital received signal supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>3</b> to demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. The demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> each demodulate a portion of the received signal (which is a training signal in a burst and portion modulated in the same way as for transmission data (data channel)) according to different demodulation schemes. For example, the demodulation estimation section <b>11</b> QPSK-demodulates the received signal, the demodulation estimation section <b>12</b> 16QAM-demodulates the received signal and the demodulation estimation section <b>13</b> 64QAM-demodulates the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, the demodulation estimation section <b>11</b> supplies the result of demodulation according to the assigned demodulation scheme to a likelihood calculation section <b>14</b>, the demodulation estimation section <b>12</b> supplies the result of demodulation according to the assigned demodulation scheme to a likelihood calculation section <b>15</b> and the demodulation estimation section <b>13</b> supplies the result of demodulation according to the assigned demodulation scheme to a likelihood calculation section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The likelihood calculation section <b>14</b> uses a training signal supplied from a training signal generation section <b>17</b> as an expected value and calculates a mean square error between the expected value and received signal as likelihood. On the other hand, the likelihood calculation section <b>15</b> uses a training signal supplied from a training signal generation section <b>18</b> as an expected value and calculates a mean square error between the expected value and received signal as likelihood. Furthermore, the likelihood calculation section <b>16</b> uses a training signal supplied from a training signal generation section <b>19</b> as an expected value and calculates a mean square error between the expected value and received signal as likelihood.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Training signals supplied from the training signal generation sections <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are the same training signals included in their respective received signals and the likelihood calculation sections <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> calculate likelihood values using these training signals as expected values, and can thereby estimate which demodulation scheme is the most likely one, that is, estimate the demodulation schemes of the received signals according to which modulation was carried out on the transmitting side. This estimation processing is carried out by a demodulation scheme decision section <b>20</b> which has received the likelihood calculation results from the likelihood calculation sections <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The result decided by the demodulation scheme decision section <b>20</b> is supplied to the switching sections <b>7</b> and <b>24</b> as a demodulation scheme selection signal. The switching section <b>7</b> selects any one of a plurality of equalization/demodulation sections <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> provided beforehand according to expected demodulation schemes based on the demodulation scheme selection signal supplied from the demodulation scheme decision section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">That is, the equalization/demodulation section <b>21</b> is designed to demodulate the received signal using the same demodulation scheme as that used for demodulation at the demodulation estimation section <b>11</b>, the equalization/demodulation section <b>22</b> is designed to demodulate the received signal using the same demodulation scheme as that used for demodulation at the demodulation estimation section <b>12</b> and the equalization/demodulation section <b>23</b> is designed to demodulate the received signal using the same demodulation scheme as that used for demodulation at the demodulation estimation section <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the demodulation scheme decision section <b>20</b> selects the equalization/demodulation section capable of obtaining the most likely demodulation result based on the result of likelihood calculations from among the equalization/demodulation sections <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> based on the demodulated signals supplied from the demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, and can thereby select the demodulation scheme corresponding to the demodulation scheme estimated to be the same as the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side and demodulate the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The signals demodulated by the equalization/demodulation sections <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> are supplied to an error correction section <b>25</b> through a switching section <b>24</b>, subjected to forward error correction processing and then supplied to a reception quality measuring section <b>26</b>. The reception quality measuring section <b>26</b> measures reception quality of decoded data supplied from the error correction section <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, the reception apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a demodulation section (demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>) for each of a plurality of demodulation schemes corresponding to a plurality of demodulation schemes expected as the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side, estimates the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side based on the respective results of demodulation processing on the received signal through these demodulation sections, carries out demodulation processing according to this estimation result, and can thereby estimate the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side through the reception apparatus <b>1</b> without sending any signal indicating the modulation scheme from the transmitting apparatus side.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, the conventional reception apparatus <b>1</b> has a problem that as a method of estimating the demodulation scheme of a received signal, providing a plurality of demodulation sections (demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>) corresponding to the estimated demodulation schemes for the demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>10</b> and carrying out demodulation processing corresponding to the expected demodulation schemes at the demodulation estimation sections <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> will increase the amount of processing and also increase power consumption.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference now to the attached drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a base station apparatus <b>100</b> including a transmission apparatus in a wireless transmission system according to an embodiment of the present invention. This base station apparatus <b>100</b> has a configuration of a receiver in a system of demodulating waveform distortion due to fading through adaptive equalization processing. Here, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) communication system will be shown and suppose known signal patterns (training signals) used for acquisition of synchronization and estimation of a transmission path are inserted in processing units (burst, etc.) of a received signal. However, suppose information on a modulation index is not included in the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This base station apparatus <b>100</b> receives a signal through an antenna <b>104</b> and receives this signal at a wireless section <b>111</b> through a duplexer <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wireless section <b>111</b> converts the received signal of a wireless frequency band to a low frequency, supplies it to a transmission path estimation section <b>112</b> and estimates a transmission path here. The output signal of the transmission path estimation section <b>112</b> is supplied to a demodulation section <b>113</b> and subjected to demodulation processing. The result of the demodulation processing is supplied to a reception quality measuring section <b>114</b> where reception quality such as BER (Bit Error Rate) is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the base station apparatus <b>100</b> receives a transmission signal at an adaptive modulation section <b>101</b> where a modulation scheme is adaptively determined according to channel quality. In this case, the adaptive modulation section <b>101</b> receives a reception level of the received signal from the wireless section <b>111</b> and at the same time receives measurement results of BER, etc., from a reception quality measuring section <b>114</b>, estimates channel quality from at least one of them and selects a modulation scheme based on the estimation result.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, there are modulation schemes such as QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying) modulation, 16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulation or 64QAM modulation and one of them is selected according to channel quality. The adaptive modulation section <b>101</b> modulates the transmission signal according to the selected modulation scheme and supplies this to the wireless section <b>102</b>. The wireless section <b>102</b> converts the modulated transmission signal to a wireless frequency band and transmits this through the duplexer <b>103</b> and antenna <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a reception apparatus (wireless terminal apparatus) <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Here, a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) communication system will be shown and suppose that known signal patterns (training signals) used for synchronization acquisition and transmission path estimation are inserted in processing units (burst, etc.) of a received signal. However, suppose information on a modulation index is not included in the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a reception apparatus <b>200</b> carries out reception processing on a received signal at a wireless section <b>202</b> and then supplies it to an A/D (analog/digital) conversion section <b>203</b>. After converting the received signal supplied from the wireless section <b>202</b> to a digital signal, the A/D conversion section <b>203</b> supplies it to a reception level measuring section <b>204</b>, a transmission path estimation section <b>205</b>, a synchronization section <b>206</b> and a demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reception level measuring section <b>204</b> measures intensity of the digital received signal (RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) signal level) supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>203</b> and thereby performs gain control on the wireless section <b>202</b>. The transmission path estimation section <b>205</b> performs transmission path estimation based on the digital received signal supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>203</b> and then supplies the result to a switching section <b>207</b>. Furthermore, the synchronization section <b>206</b> performs coherent detection based on the digital received signal to acquire synchronization with the transmission path estimation section <b>205</b> and demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b> supplies the digital received signal supplied from the A/D conversion section <b>203</b> to a demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>. The demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> selects a demodulation scheme based on a control signal that specifies the current processing scheme which is supplied from a priority processing decision section <b>231</b> of the control section <b>230</b> and demodulates a portion of the received signal (which is a training signal in a burst and portion modulated in the same way as for transmission data (data channel)). For example, the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> demodulates the received signal according to the demodulation scheme specified by a control signal supplied from the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> out of QPSK demodulation, 16QAM demodulation and 64QAM demodulation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> supplies the result of demodulation according to the assigned modulation scheme to a likelihood calculation section <b>213</b>. The likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> uses a training signal supplied from a training signal generation section <b>214</b> as an expected value and calculates a mean square error between the expected value and received signal as likelihood.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The training signal supplied from the training signal generation section <b>214</b> is the same training signal included in the received signal and the likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> calculates likelihood using this training signal as an expected value and thereby determines likelihood of the demodulated signal demodulated at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The likelihood calculated at the likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> is supplied to the demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> and compared with a threshold supplied from a threshold generation section <b>232</b> of the control section <b>230</b>. Based on this comparison result, if the likelihood supplied from the likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> is equal to or greater than the threshold supplied from the threshold generation section <b>232</b>, the modulation demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> decides that the demodulation scheme (modulation index) at the modulation demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> at this time corresponds to the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side and supplies a modulation demodulation scheme selection signal for selecting the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme to the switching sections <b>207</b> and <b>224</b>. In this way, the switching sections <b>207</b> and <b>224</b> select the equalization/demodulation section <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> or <b>223</b> corresponding to the modulation demodulation scheme specified by the modulation demodulation scheme selection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In contrast, when the likelihood calculated at the likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> as the decision result at the demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> falls below the threshold supplied from the threshold generation section <b>232</b>, this result is supplied to the control section <b>230</b>. Upon receipt of the result showing that the value falls below this threshold, the control section <b>230</b> selects another demodulation scheme preset at the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> instead of the demodulation scheme selected at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> at this time and the-demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> controls so that the received signal is subjected to demodulation processing according to the demodulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The control section <b>230</b> predetermines priority when selecting other demodulation schemes (modulation indices) at the priority processing decision section <b>231</b>. In this embodiment, three demodulation schemes provided as equalization/demodulation sections <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>223</b>, are set as the demodulation schemes to be selected and these demodulation schemes are provided with priority beforehand and the demodulation scheme of the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> to be determined next is selected according to the priority.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The communication system including this reception apparatus <b>200</b> has logical channels of received signals such as synchronization channel, control channel, speech channel and data channel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the channels except the data channel are assigned predetermined modulation schemes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, according to the example of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, modulation scheme A is assigned to the synchronization channel, modulation scheme A is assigned to the control channel and modulation scheme B is assigned to the speech channel. Therefore, the transmitting apparatus side of this communication system is designed to carry out modulation according to a modulation scheme assigned beforehand for these channels and the reception apparatus <b>200</b> which receives this transmission signal demodulates the respective channels (synchronization channel, control channel and speech channel) corresponding to these predetermined modulation schemes (modulation indices).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Therefore, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> can predict the modulation scheme of the burst (slot, frame, etc.) to be received next based on a predetermined operation sequence (in the receiving order of synchronization channel, control channel and speech channel) for the synchronization channel, control channel and speech channel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, for the data channel, the transmitting apparatus side is designed to select an optimal modulation scheme from a plurality of modulation schemes provided beforehand according to the channel condition (reception power, error rate, S/N ratio, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart showing a decision processing procedure for deciding priority of the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> for the synchronization channel, control channel and speech channel to which the modulation schemes described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are assigned based on the sequence control by the reception apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the sequence control by the reception apparatus <b>200</b> consists of synchronization acquisition (step ST<b>101</b>) by the synchronization section <b>206</b>, channel connection (step ST<b>102</b>), control information reception (step ST<b>103</b>), speech reception (step ST<b>104</b>), control information reception (step ST<b>105</b>) and data reception (step ST<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The terminal operation sequence control section <b>235</b> of the reception apparatus <b>200</b> decides priority demodulation processing at the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> based on the information on this sequence control. That is, when synchronization acquisition in step ST<b>101</b> is carried out as the terminal operation sequence control in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides the demodulation scheme (modulation index) at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> in response to this synchronization acquisition processing. As this demodulation scheme, the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme A of the synchronization channel is selected as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (step ST<b>111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, when the terminal operation sequence control is shifted to the channel connection processing in step ST<b>102</b>, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> selects the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme A of the synchronization channel according to the channel connection processing (step ST<b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the terminal operation sequence control is shifted to the control information reception processing in step ST<b>103</b>, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> selects the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme A of the control channel (step ST<b>113</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Since the modulation scheme A is predetermined as the modulation scheme of the synchronization channel and control channel up to this point, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> sets the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme A as the demodulation scheme at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>. Then, when the terminal operation sequence control is shifted to step ST<b>104</b>, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> selects the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme B of the speech channel (step ST<b>114</b>). This causes the demodulation scheme at the modulation estimation section <b>212</b> to be set to the demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme B of the speech channel.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the terminal operation sequence control is shifted to control information reception processing in step ST<b>105</b>, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> selects a modulation index (demodulation scheme) corresponding to the modulation scheme A of the control channel (step ST<b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Thus, in steps ST<b>101</b> to ST<b>105</b> and steps ST<b>111</b> to ST<b>115</b> shown in the example of the terminal operation sequence control, a demodulation scheme at the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> is selected based on the predetermined modulation scheme in the communication system. In contrast, when the terminal operation sequence control is shifted to step ST<b>106</b>, data reception processing for which no unique modulation scheme is predetermined is started.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this data reception processing, the transmitting apparatus side selects and sends a modulation scheme which is most suitable for the channel condition at that time from a plurality of modulation schemes provided beforehand according to the channel condition as described above. When the data sent from the transmission apparatus is received in this way, the demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b> of the reception apparatus <b>200</b> estimates and decides the modulation scheme according to which the data has been modulated from the plurality of demodulation schemes provided beforehand and selects the demodulation scheme (modulation index) corresponding to the most likely modulation scheme. In this case, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> sets demodulation schemes for the plurality of provided demodulation schemes in a predetermined order in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> and carries out demodulation, calculation of likelihood and decision on the demodulation scheme according to the respective demodulation schemes (step ST<b>116</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">This allows the demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b> to estimate the modulation scheme of the data channel of the received signal only using one set of the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>, likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> and demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">By the way, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart showing the estimation processing procedure of the demodulation scheme which is the processing in step ST<b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the control section <b>230</b> of the reception apparatus <b>200</b> decides priority order of demodulation schemes at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> in step ST<b>201</b> first, that is, decides which demodulation scheme should be set as the processing of high priority. In the case of this embodiment, suppose priority of each demodulation scheme is predetermined as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The control section <b>230</b> moves on to step ST<b>202</b> and sets a threshold A corresponding to the demodulation scheme A determined in above described step ST<b>201</b>. Therefore, the demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> decides likelihood supplied from the likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> based on the threshold A set in this step ST<b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the setting of priority order, that is, the setting of the demodulation scheme A and the setting of the threshold A according to the demodulation scheme A are completed in this way, the demodulation scheme estimation decision section <b>210</b> moves on to the next step ST<b>203</b>, inputs the received signal to the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>, and further calculates likelihood in step ST<b>204</b> based on the demodulation result at the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, the likelihood calculated in step ST<b>204</b> is compared with the threshold A by the demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> in step ST<b>205</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this way, by estimating the modulation schemes on the transmitting apparatus side one by one according to the procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and by only providing one set of the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>, likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> and demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b>, it is possible to estimate the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side and decide the demodulation scheme (modulation index) corresponding thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Because the transmitting apparatus side decides a modulation scheme (modulation index) according to the channel condition, when the reception apparatus <b>200</b> estimates the data channel demodulation scheme according to the procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> decides the priority order of demodulation schemes (demodulation schemes A, B and C) to be set in the demodulation estimation section based on reception quality such as BER (Bit Error Rate) at the reception apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">That is, this embodiment provides modulation schemes (demodulation schemes) provided beforehand for setting in descending order of modulation indices, that is, modulation scheme A, modulation scheme B and modulation scheme C (demodulation scheme A, demodulation scheme B and demodulation scheme C) in that order. Since higher channel quality (reception quality) is required as the modulation index increases, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> estimates the priority order of modulation schemes on the transmitting apparatus side (that is, demodulation schemes at the reception apparatus <b>200</b>) based on the previous reception quality, and can thereby increase the probability that the estimation result will match the actual modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In order to decide the priority order of demodulation schemes using such a method, this embodiment is designed to store the table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in a predetermined storage section (not shown) and decide the priority order of demodulation schemes to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time based on the previous demodulation scheme decision result and the previous reception quality.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">That is, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> measures BER (Bit Error Rate) from decoded data at the reception quality measuring section <b>226</b> and supplies this measurement result to the control section <b>230</b>. The priority processing decision section <b>231</b> of the control section <b>230</b> decides the priority order of demodulation schemes to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time based on the reception quality supplied from the reception quality measuring section <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">This decision method will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The priority processing decision section <b>231</b> stores the demodulation scheme (that is, the estimation result of modulation schemes on the transmitting apparatus side) previously set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> and decides the priority order of the demodulation scheme (that is, the modulation scheme to be estimated on the transmitting apparatus side of the received signal this time) to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time based on this previously stored demodulation scheme and the previous reception quality supplied from the reception quality measuring section <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, when the previously estimated modulation scheme (demodulation scheme set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>) is the modulation scheme B (demodulation scheme B) and the previous reception quality is “good”, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides that the modulation index in the burst this time is the demodulation scheme C which is a modulation index one stage higher than the previously estimated modulation index and sets the priority order of demodulation schemes to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time as demodulation scheme C, demodulation scheme B and demodulation scheme A in that order. Thus, when the previous reception quality is good, since the modulation scheme decided on the transmitting apparatus side based on the channel quality this time can be decided with the highest probability to be the modulation scheme C requiring higher channel quality than the previous modulation scheme B, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides the demodulation scheme C corresponding to this modulation scheme C as the demodulation scheme with the highest priority and decides the remaining demodulation schemes in descending order of modulation indices as the priority order. When the previous reception quality is good, this causes demodulation schemes to be decided as the priority order from the one whose modulation index is one stage lower than the previous modulation index in descending order, which makes it possible to find the demodulation scheme that matches the actual modulation scheme according to the channel condition more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">On the contrary, the previously estimated modulation scheme (demodulation scheme set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>) is the modulation scheme B (demodulation scheme B) and its previous reception quality is “bad”, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides that the modulation index in the burst this time is the demodulation scheme A whose modulation index is one stage lower than the previously estimated modulation index and sets the priority order of demodulation schemes to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time as demodulation scheme A, demodulation scheme B and demodulation scheme C in that order. In this way, when the previous reception quality is bad, since the modulation scheme determined based on the channel quality on the transmitting apparatus side this time can be decided with the highest probability to be the modulation scheme A requiring channel quality lower than the previous modulation scheme B, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides that the demodulation scheme A corresponding to this modulation scheme A to be the demodulation scheme with the highest priority and decides the remaining demodulation schemes in descending order of modulation indices as the priority order. In this way, when the previous reception quality is bad, the demodulation schemes from the one whose modulation index is one stage lower than the previous modulation index in ascending order of modulation indices are decided as the priority order and it is thereby possible to find the demodulation scheme that matches the actual modulation scheme according to the channel condition more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method of deciding the priority order of demodulation schemes set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> is not limited to the method of deciding the priority order based on the previously estimated demodulation scheme and previous BER, but it is also possible to decide the priority order based on the received signal level this time as the reception quality.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this case, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> supplies the reception level (RSSI: Received Signal Strength Indicator) this time measured at the reception level measuring section <b>204</b> to the control section <b>230</b> and the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> of the control section <b>230</b> can decide the priority order of the demodulation scheme to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> based on this supplied reception level and the previously estimated demodulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">This decision method will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The priority processing decision section <b>231</b> stores the demodulation scheme previously set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> (that is, estimation result according to the modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side) and decides the priority order of demodulation schemes to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time (that is, the modulation scheme estimated on the transmitting apparatus side of the received signal this time) based on this stored previous demodulation scheme and the reception level this time supplied from the reception level measuring section <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, when the previously estimated modulation scheme (demodulation scheme set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>) is the modulation scheme B (demodulation scheme B) and the reception level this time is higher, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides that the modulation index in the burst this time is the demodulation scheme C whose modulation index is one stage higher than the previously estimated modulation index and sets the priority order of the demodulation scheme to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time as demodulation scheme C, demodulation scheme B and demodulation scheme A in that order. In this way, when the reception level this time is higher, since the modulation scheme decided on the transmitting apparatus side based on the channel quality can be decided with the highest probability to be the modulation scheme C for which higher channel quality than that of the previous modulation scheme B is required, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> determines the demodulation scheme C corresponding to this modulation scheme C as the demodulation scheme with the highest priority and then decides the remaining demodulation schemes in descending order of modulation indices as the priority order. This makes it possible to decide the demodulation scheme this time based on the reception level this time and thereby find the demodulation scheme that matches the actual modulation scheme according to the channel condition more quickly and more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">On the contrary, when the previously estimated modulation scheme (demodulation scheme set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>) is the modulation scheme B (demodulation scheme B) and the reception quality this time is lower, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> decides that the modulation index in the burst this time is the demodulation scheme A whose modulation index is one stage lower than the previously estimated modulation index and sets the priority of the demodulation scheme to be set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b> this time as demodulation scheme A, demodulation scheme B and demodulation scheme C in that order. In this way, when the reception level this time is lower, since the modulation scheme decided on the transmitting apparatus side based on the channel quality can be decided with the highest probability to be the modulation scheme A for which lower channel quality than that of the previous modulation scheme B is required, the priority processing decision section <b>231</b> determines the demodulation scheme A corresponding to this modulation scheme A as the demodulation scheme with the highest priority and then decides the remaining demodulation schemes in ascending order of modulation indices as the priority order. This makes it possible to decide the demodulation scheme this time based on the reception level this time and thereby find the demodulation scheme that matches the actual modulation scheme according to the channel condition more quickly and more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The above described embodiment has described the case where the previous BER or reception level this time is used, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be adapted so as to use BER this time or previous reception level. Furthermore, it is possible to use not only BER but also an SN ratio, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, the method of updating threshold A, B or C in the procedure for the estimation processing of the demodulation scheme described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> will be explained. The threshold to be compared with likelihood at the threshold demodulation scheme control section <b>215</b> is updated at the threshold generation section <b>232</b> for each modulation index.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The threshold generation section <b>232</b> decides a threshold based on the reception quality (BER, etc.) supplied from the reception quality measuring section <b>226</b> or the reception level supplied from the reception level measuring section <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The threshold generation section <b>232</b> prestores a table indicating the relationship between reception quality and a threshold and generates a threshold with reference to this table based on the supplied reception quality. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph created based on the table indicating the correspondence between thresholds and reception levels used to generate thresholds at the threshold generation section <b>232</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the reception quality (channel quality) of the threshold generation section <b>232</b> deteriorates, its threshold also becomes smaller. That is, when the reception quality is bad, the likelihood value becomes smaller compared to the case with high reception quality, no matter what modulation scheme is estimated, and therefore when the reception quality is bad, it is necessary to reduce a threshold with respect to the likelihood of the demodulation scheme set in the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>. By doing so, it is possible to prevent the decision rate in step ST<b>205</b>, step ST<b>209</b> and step ST<b>213</b> in the procedure for estimation processing of the demodulation scheme shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> from deteriorating and reduce the probability that processing will be carried out as far as a comparison of likelihood in the final step ST<b>216</b>. This can reduce the amount of processing in the estimation processing of a demodulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between a threshold and reception quality. When the reception level is used, it is likewise possible to prestore a table indicating the relationship between a threshold and reception level shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in the threshold generation section <b>232</b>, generate a threshold using the reception level supplied from the reception level measuring section <b>204</b> and this table and thereby reduce the amount of processing in the estimation processing of the demodulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above described configuration, when a modulation scheme on the transmitting apparatus side is estimated, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> uses a set of the demodulation estimation section <b>212</b>, likelihood calculation section <b>213</b> and demodulation scheme decision section <b>215</b> to set demodulation schemes corresponding to a plurality of modulation schemes one by one and carries out estimation processing on the modulation schemes one by one. Compared to the conventional case where sets of circuits corresponding in number to modulation schemes to be estimated are provided, this allows the same estimation processing to be carried out on a substantially smaller hardware scale.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Then, by deciding priority order of the modulation schemes (demodulation schemes to be set in the modulation estimation section <b>212</b>) based on the previously estimated demodulation scheme and previous reception quality (or reception level this time) during the estimation processing of the modulation scheme, it is possible to estimate demodulation schemes in descending order of probability. This eliminates the need to estimate all demodulation schemes to be estimated (without carrying out all the estimation processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and thereby increases the probability that results of estimation of demodulation schemes will be obtained more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Furthermore, when modulation schemes are estimated, it is possible to improve the decision accuracy by updating thresholds to be compared to likelihood for each demodulation scheme based on the reception quality or reception level. Improving the decision accuracy eliminates the need to estimate all demodulation schemes to be estimated (without carrying out all the estimation processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and thereby increases the probability that results of estimation of demodulation schemes will be obtained more quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, the reception apparatus <b>200</b> of this embodiment can suppress the amount of processing and power consumption of estimation processing to a maximum of approximately half that in the case of two modulation schemes (can further suppress in the case of three modulation schemes) when compared to the conventional apparatus while maintaining the decision accuracy of modulation schemes. Furthermore, carrying out processing in order of predicted modulation schemes makes it possible to share hardware which is independent of modulation schemes and thereby reduce the circuit scale.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The above described embodiments apply the present invention to a TDMA-based wireless transmission system, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be applied to wireless transmission systems based on other systems.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the present invention adds priority order to demodulation schemes to be candidates for estimation processing of modulation schemes, carries out estimation processing on demodulation schemes in descending order of priority and confirms the demodulation scheme of the received signal when predetermined likelihood is obtained, and can thereby estimate the demodulation scheme of a received signal more easily and with a substantially smaller configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, and various variations and modifications may be possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
