<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The objectives of the present invention are achieving TFTs having a small off current and TFT structures optimal for the driving conditions of a pixel portion and driver circuits, and providing a technique of making the differently structured TFTs without increasing the number of manufacturing steps and the production costs. A semiconductor device has a semiconductor layer, a gate insulating film on the semiconductor layer, and a gate electrode on the gate insulating film. The semiconductor layer contains a channel forming region, a region containing a first concentration impurity element, a region containing a second concentration impurity element, and a region containing a third concentration impurity element. The gate electrode is formed by laminating an electrode (A) and an electrode (B). One edge portion of the electrode (A) overlaps with the region containing the second concentration impurity element, through the gate insulating film, and another edge portion of the electrode (A) overlaps with the channel forming region, through the gate insulating film.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device using a semiconductor film having a crystalline structure, and to a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. More specifically, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a thin film transistor (TFT) containing an active layer having a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region from a semiconductor film having a crystalline structure, and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Liquid crystal display devices have widened the marketplace with their advantages of low electric power consumption and space conservation, and have finally reached the point of substituting for CRTs as televisions used daily in households. As such, bright display at high definition equal to or better than that of CRTs, and a price comparable to that of CRTs, are sought for liquid crystal display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Demanded of TFTs formed in pixel portions of liquid crystal display devices in general use as displays (display devices) is mainly a low off current (electric current flowing when the TFTs are in an off operation state). Even a slight leak of the off current in an off operation state of the TFT invites a reduction in contrast and in image quality. There has been a problem with TFTs containing active layers having a crystalline structure, which are recently used more and more due to their high field effect mobility, in that the off current becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An LDD (lightly doped drain) structure is known as a technique of suppressing the off current. In Japanese patent #3072655 (structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), a structure is disclosed in which a first transistor and a second transistor are connected in series, sandwiching a low concentration impurity region (double gate structure having a low concentration impurity region sandwiched by channel forming regions).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The demand for making liquid crystal display devices have higher definition is met by increasing the number of pixels, and the demand for higher brightness is met by increasing the aperture ratio. Screen size is determined by standards, and therefore it is necessary to increase the number of pixels within a limited pixel surface area. This means that the pixel size must be shrunk, and that a technique for further increasing the aperture ratio must be achieved while reducing the pixel size. There are limitations on making the wiring width narrower for increase of the aperture ratio, considering problems such as a rise of the wiring resistance. Thus, making the size of switching TFTs within the pixels smaller can be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the size of storage capacitors can be made smaller provided that the off current of the switching TFTs of the pixels can be made smaller. Therefore, it is very important to make TFTs having a low off current in order to additionally increase the aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the characteristics required by the circuits used on the same substrate are different. It is necessary to make TFTs having different structures depending upon which circuit they are used for. TFTs are manufactured by lamination while performing steps for etching semiconductor films, insulating films, and conductive films into predetermined shapes using photomasks. Therefore, if the TFT structure is optimized according to the requirements of the pixel portion or each driver circuit, then the number of photomasks simply increases, the manufacturing processes become complex, and the number of process steps inevitably increases. Further, TFTs having a sufficiently low off current cannot be manufactured even if small TFTs are manufactured in order to increase the aperture ratio in the pixel portion, and the reliability drops. It is not easy to manufacture the desired display device (semiconductor device).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the aim of solving these problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a TFT having a low off current at a small pixel size (small TFT size), and to provide a technique for achieving optimal TFT structures for the driving conditions of a pixel portion and driver circuits by using a small number of photomasks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, an object of the present invention is to provide a technique of making different TFTs, having a low off current and having TFT structures optimal for the driving conditions of a pixel portion and driver circuits, without increasing the number of manufacturing processes or the production costs.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, according to the present invention, the above-mentioned semiconductor device is characterized in that: the region containing the first concentration impurity element contains the n-type impurity element at a concentration of 1×10<sup>15 </sup>to 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>; the region containing the second concentration impurity element contains the n-type impurity element at a concentration of 1×10<sup>17 </sup>to 1×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>; and the region containing the third concentration impurity element contains the n-type impurity element at a concentration of 1×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, according to the present invention, the above-mentioned semiconductor device is characterized in that: the electrode (A) is: a conductive film made from an element selected from the group consisting of W, Mo, Ta, and Ti; a conductive film made from a chemical compound having one of the elements as its main constituent; or a conductive film made from an alloy having one of the elements as its main constituent.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The semiconductor device disclosed by the present invention has a region which contains a second concentration impurity element and which overlaps with a gate electrode through a gate insulating film, and an impurity region which contains a first concentration impurity element and which does not overlap with the gate electrode. The region containing the second concentration impurity element has an impurity region (Loff region) which contains the first concentration impurity element and which does not overlap with the gate electrode. By possessing this Loff region, the width of the energy barrier of PN junctions formed within the semiconductor layer becomes broader, the electric field strength added to the PN junction portions becomes weaker, and the off current can be reduced. Further, by having the impurity region (Lov region) which contains the second concentration of the impurity and which overlaps with the gate electrode through the gate insulating film, this becomes a structure in which on current degradation is prevented.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The structure of a TFT of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and the results of measuring the electrical characteristics of the TFT of the present invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The TFT has a semiconductor layer on an insulating surface, a gate insulating film on the semiconductor layer, and a gate electrode on the gate insulating film. The semiconductor layer contains a channel forming region <b>13</b>, an n-type impurity region <b>14</b> containing a first concentration impurity element which imparts n-type conductivity (hereafter referred to as n-type impurity element), an n-type impurity region <b>12</b> containing a second concentration of the n-type impurity element, and n-type impurity regions <b>11</b> and <b>15</b> containing a third concentration of the n-type impurity element. The gate electrode has a first gate electrode <b>16</b> and a second gate electrode <b>17</b>. The first gate electrode and the second gate electrode are composed of electrodes (A) <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>a</i>, and electrodes (B) <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, respectively. One edge portions of the electrodes (A) <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>a </i>overlap with the n-type impurity region <b>12</b> containing the second concentration of the n-type impurity element, through the gate insulating film. Another edge portions of the electrodes (A) <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>a </i>overlap with the channel forming region, through the gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the n-type impurity region <b>11</b> containing the third concentration of the n-type impurity element is disposed between: the n-type impurity region <b>12</b> which contains the second concentration of the n-type impurity element and which overlaps with the electrode (A) <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the first gate electrode; and the n-type impurity region which contains the second concentration of the n-type impurity element and which overlaps with the electrode (A) <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the second gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that the n-type impurity region <b>14</b> containing the first concentration of the n-type impurity element has a concentration of 1×10<sup>15 </sup>to 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of the n-type impurity element. Further, the n-type impurity region <b>12</b> containing the second concentration of the n-type impurity element has a concentration of 1×10<sup>17 </sup>to 1×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of the n-type impurity element. The n-type impurity regions <b>11</b> and <b>15</b>, containing the third concentration of the n-type impurity element, have concentrations of 1×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>of the n-type impurity element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, in this specification, the n-type impurity region containing the first concentration of the n-type impurity element is an LDD (lightly doped drain) region containing the n-type impurity element at a low concentration, and this region is referred to as an Loff region (where “off” indicates “offset”) because it is a region that does not overlap with the gate electrode. The n-type impurity region <b>12</b> containing the second concentration of the n-type impurity element is referred to as an Lov region (where “ov” indicates “overlap”) because it overlaps with the electrode (A) through the gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Note that the applicants of the present invention manufactured TFTs which, as disclosed by Japanese Patent #3072655, have a double gate structure (a first gate electrode <b>25</b> and a second gate electrode <b>26</b>) in which: a first channel forming region and a second channel forming region, n-type impurity regions <b>21</b> and <b>23</b> containing the second concentration of the n-type impurity element, and an n-type impurity region <b>24</b> containing the third concentration of the n-type impurity element are contained in a semiconductor layer; and in addition, an n-type impurity region (internal L) <b>21</b> containing the second concentration of the n-type impurity element is formed between the first channel forming region and the second channel forming region. A schematic diagram of the TFT structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and the results of measuring the electrical characteristics of the TFTs are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Comparing the behavior in the off region of the TFT of the present invention with that of the TFT disclosed by the above patent, it can be seen that both display almost the same type of behavior (the off current increases by a little in accordance with a shift of a gate voltage in the negative direction). However, when investigating the on current at the time of VG=10 V and 20 V, for example, the TFT of the present invention was found to have an on current of 1×10<sup>−4 </sup>A and 6×10<sup>−3 </sup>A, respectively. The TFT structure disclosed by the above patent was found to have an on current of 3×10<sup>−4 </sup>A and 8×10<sup>−3 </sup>A at the time of VG=10 V and 20 V, respectively. Comparing the behavior in the on region, it can be seen that a higher on current can be obtained in the TFT of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Unless the conventional technique TFT of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> is 3 μm larger than the size of the semiconductor layer of the TFT disclosed by the present invention, the TFT having similar behavior in the off region cannot be obtained. Further, the on current is a parameter for easily evaluating reliability, and the on current obtained by the TFT disclosed by the present invention is larger than the on current obtained with the TFT structure disclosed by the aforementioned patent. This is thought to be because the Loff region and the Lov region are formed in the TFT disclosed by the present invention. TFTs having a small off current can thus be obtained even if the size of the semiconductor layer is small.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the present invention, both the problem of having to make the pixel size smaller due to an increased number of pixels for high image quality, and the problem of having to achieve a high aperture ratio for higher brightness, can thus be resolved at the same time.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment Mode 2 </heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electrical characteristics of TFTs manufactured by setting the size between a plurality of gate electrodes (two gate electrodes in Embodiment Mode 2) equal to 2 μm, for multi-gate TFTs having the TFT structure disclosed by the present invention (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and for those having the TFT structure already disclosed by a conventional technique (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), are compared in Embodiment Mode 2.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Measurements were performed with the gate voltage VG varied from −20 to 20 V, and the source voltage VS=0 V. The results of measuring the current (on current) at the following two points: (1) the drain voltage VD=1 V and VG=10 V; and (2) the drain voltage VD=14 V and VG=10 V, and the results of measuring the current (off current) at the following two points: (3) VD=1 V and VG=−17.5 V; and (4) VD=14 V and VG=−4.5 V, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14D</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The on current at the measurement points (1) and (2) is higher with the structure of the present invention compared to the conventional structure. This is thought to be because a region exists in which the low concentration impurity region (LDD region) overlaps with the gate electrode, through the gate insulating film, and therefore the on current is higher.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The off current at the measurement points (3) and (4) is lower with the structure of the present invention compared to the conventional structure. Therefore the surface area occupied by a storage capacitor can be made smaller by the amount that the leak current becomes lower, provided that the very low off current TFT is used as a pixel switching element. Thus, the aperture ratio in a pixel portion can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is thus understood that better electrical characteristics (on current and off current) can be obtained with TFTs having the structure disclosed by the present invention when the electrical characteristics of two TFTs having different structures and the same size are compared to each other.</p>

The crystalline semiconductor film <b>102</b> is formed by using a known crystallization method after forming an amorphous semiconductor film on the first insulating film. In Embodiment 1, a 50 nm thick amorphous silicon film is formed, light from an excimer laser is condensed into a linear shape by an optical system, and this light is irradiated onto the amorphous silicon film, performing crystallization. The power density of the laser light is set to 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the linear shape laser light having a thickness of 500 μm is irradiated over the entire surface of the amorphous silicon film while overlapping at a 90 to 98% ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A high field effect mobility can be obtained by using the semiconductor film having good crystallinity obtained by the method disclosed in Embodiment 3 as an active layer, and a TFT having high reliability can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">There are no particular limitations placed on the material of a substrate <b>701</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, but preferably a material such as barium borosilicate glass, aluminum borosilicate glass, or quartz can be used. A first silicon oxynitride film <b>702</b> manufactured by plasma CVD from SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O with a thickness of 50 nm, and a second silicon oxynitride film <b>703</b> manufactured from SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O with a thickness of 100 mm, are formed on the surface of the substrate <b>701</b> as base insulating films. The base insulating films are formed so that alkaline metals contained in the glass substrate do not diffuse within semiconductor films formed on the substrate, and it is possible to omit the base insulating films if quartz is used for the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A semiconductor material having silicon as its main constituent is used for a semiconductor film <b>704</b> having an amorphous structure formed on the base insulating film. A film such as an amorphous silicon film or an amorphous silicon germanium film is typically applied, and formed having a thickness of 10 to 100 nm by plasma CVD, reduced pressure CVD, or sputtering. The concentration of impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen contained in the amorphous semiconductor film <b>704</b> may be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>in order to obtain good crystals. These impurities become primary factors hindering crystallization of the amorphous semiconductor, and further, cause the density of capture centers and recrystallization centers to increase. It is therefore preferable to use very high purity material gasses, and also to use a CVD apparatus corresponding to an extremely high vacuum, in which the inside of the reaction chamber has undergone mirror surface processing (field polishing processing), and which is prepared with an oil free vacuum evacuation system.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A metallic element that has a catalytic action for promoting crystallization is then added to the surface of the amorphous semiconductor film <b>704</b>. One element, or a plurality of elements, selected from the group consisting of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), gold (Au) and the like can be used as the metallic element that has a catalytic action for promoting crystallization of the semiconductor film. Nickel is typically used, and a catalyst containing layer <b>705</b> is formed by applying a nickel acetate salt solution, containing from 1 to 100 ppm nickel by weight, using a spinner. In this case, an extremely thin oxidized film may be formed from an ozone containing aqueous solution as a surface preparation of the amorphous structure semiconductor film <b>704</b> in order to increase the wetting of the liquid. A clean surface is formed after etching the oxide film using a mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen peroxide, and an extremely thin oxide film is formed once again by processing with an ozone containing aqueous solution. The surface of semiconductor films such as silicon is initially hydrophobic, and therefore a uniform application of the nickel acetate salt solution can be achieved by forming the oxide film.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The catalyst containing layer <b>705</b> is of course not limited to this type of method, and may also be formed using sputtering, evaporation, plasma processing, and the like. Furthermore, the catalyst containing layer <b>705</b> may also be formed before forming the amorphous structure semiconductor film <b>704</b>, that is the catalyst containing layer <b>705</b> may be formed on the base insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Heat treatment is performed for crystallization while maintaining the state in which the amorphous structure semiconductor film <b>704</b> and the catalytic element containing layer <b>705</b> are in contact. A furnace annealing method using an electric oven, or a rapid thermal annealing (hereafter referred to as RTA) method using a heat source such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp is employed as the heat treatment method. Considering productivity, RTA can be thought of a preferable method to be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A heat treatment lamp light source is turned on for 1 to 60 seconds, preferably for 30 to 60 seconds, and this is repeated between 1 and 10 times, preferably between 2 and 6 times, when performing the RTA method. The intensity of light emitted from the lamp light source may be arbitrarily set, but it is preferable to set the intensity such that the semiconductor film is instantaneously heated to between 600 and 1000° C., preferably from 650 to 750° C. Even with this high temperature, the semiconductor film is only heated instantaneously, and therefore the substrate <b>100</b> itself does not distort and change in shape. The amorphous semiconductor film can thus be crystallized, and a semiconductor film <b>706</b> having a crystalline structure can thus be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Crystallization by this type of process was first achieved by forming the catalytic containing layer.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If furnace annealing is used as another method of crystallization, then heating is performed at 500° C. for on the order of 1 hour as a preprocess to heat treatment in order to release hydrogen contained in the amorphous structure semiconductor film <b>704</b>. Heat treatment is then performed within a nitrogen atmosphere using an electric furnace at a temperature of 550 to 600° C., preferably at 580° C. for four hours, crystallizing the amorphous structure silicon film <b>704</b>. The crystalline structure silicon film <b>706</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, irradiation of laser light to the crystalline structure silicon film <b>706</b> is effective for increasing the crystallinity (the proportion of crystal components in the entire volume of the film) and for repairing defects remaining within crystal grains. Excimer laser light having a wavelength equal to or less than 400 nm, and the second harmonic and the third harmonic of a YAG laser may be used. Whichever laser is employed, pulse laser light having a repetition frequency of approximately 10 to 1000 Hz is used, and the laser light is condensed by an optical system so as to have a power density of 100 to 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Laser processing may then be performed on the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> while using an overlap ratio of 90 to 95%.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The catalytic element (nickel here) remains in the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> thus obtained. The distribution is not uniform throughout the film, but the catalytic element with a concentration that exceeds 1×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>in average remains in the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b>. It is of course possible to form various types of semiconductor elements, such as TFTs, in this state, but the catalytic element is removed by gettering in accordance with the process shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">First, a thin barrier layer <b>707</b> is formed in the surface of the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.

Further, chemical oxide can also be similarly formed by processing with an aqueous solution in which acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or nitric acid is mixed with hydrogen peroxide. Plasma processing within an oxygen atmosphere, or oxidation processing by generating ozone due to the irradiation of ultraviolet light within an oxygen containing atmosphere may also be performed as other methods of forming the barrier layer. In addition, a thin oxide film formed by heating at a temperature of 200 to 350° C. using a clean oven may also be used as the barrier layer. Alternatively, an oxide film having a thickness on the order of 1 to 5 nm may also be deposited as the barrier layer by using a method such as plasma CVD, sputtering, or evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A semiconductor film <b>708</b> is then formed having a thickness of 25 to 250 nm on the barrier layer by plasma CVD or sputtering. Typically, an amorphous silicon film containing from 0.01 to 20 atomic % of argon is formed by sputtering using argon. The semiconductor film <b>708</b> is later removed, and therefore it is preferable to use a low density film in order to increase its selectivity with the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> during etching. Gettering sites can be formed if an inert gas element is added within the amorphous silicon film, and an inert gas element is similarly placed throughout the film.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">One element, or a plurality of elements, chosen from the group consisting of helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe) are used as the inert gas element. The inert gas element is used as an ion source in order to form gettering sites in the present invention, and the inert gas element is injected into the semiconductor film by ion doping or ion injection. There are two reasons for injecting the ions of the inert gas element. One is that dangling bonds are formed by injection, imparting distortion to the semiconductor film, and the other reason is that the ions are injected within the semiconductor film lattice, also imparting distortion. Injection of the inert gas ions can satisfy both the reasons at the same time, but in particular, remarkable results can be obtained due to the latter reason when using elements having a larger atomic size than silicon, such as argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">It becomes necessary to perform heat treatment afterward in order to achieve gettering with certainty. Furnace annealing or RTA is performed for the heat treatment. When furnace annealing is used, heat treatment is performed for 0.5 to 12 hours at a temperature of 450 to 600° C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. Further, if RTA is used, a heating lamp light source is turned on for 1 to 60 seconds, preferably from 30 to 60 seconds, and this is repeated between 1 and 10 times, preferably between 2 and 6 times. The intensity of the light emitted from the lamp light source may be arbitrarily set, but processing is performed such that the semiconductor film is heated instantaneously to a temperature of 600 to 1000° C., preferably to a temperature between 700 and 750° C.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">During gettering, the catalytic elements in regions to be gettered (capture sites) are released by thermal energy, and then move to the gettering sites by diffusion. Gettering therefore depends on the processing temperature, and the time needed for gettering to proceed becomes shorter as the processing temperature becomes higher. As shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, there is a distance on the order of the thickness of the semiconductor film in the movement direction for the catalytic elements, and therefore gettering can be accomplished in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Note that the semiconductor film <b>708</b> containing the inert gas elements at a concentration equal to or greater than 1×10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, is not crystallized by this heat treatment. This is thought to be because the inert gas elements are not released again and remain within the film in the above stated processing temperature range, thus inhibiting crystallization of the semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Thereafter, the amorphous semiconductor film <b>708</b> is then selectively etched and removed. Dry etching by ClF<sub>3 </sub>not using plasma, and wet etching by an alkaline solution such as an aqueous solution containing hydrazine or tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (chemical formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>NOH) can be used as etching methods. The barrier layer <b>707</b> functions as an etching stopper at this time. Further, the barrier layer <b>707</b> may be removed later by using hydrofluoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A semiconductor film <b>710</b> having a crystalline structure and in which the concentration of the catalytic element is lowered to be equal to, or less than, 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, can thus be obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>. The crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>710</b> thus formed is one in which thin rod shape or thin flattened rod shape crystals are formed due to the catalytic element action, and crystal growth is such that there is a specific directionality present in each of the crystals when viewed macroscopically. The crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>710</b> manufactured in Embodiment 3 can be applied to the semiconductor films shown in Embodiment 1 or 2.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Another method of gettering the catalytic elements remaining in the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> obtained in Embodiment 3 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>. A silicon oxide film as a mask is formed having a thickness of 150 nm on the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b>, and a resist mask <b>712</b> is formed. A mask insulating film <b>711</b> is next obtained by etching the silicon oxide film. A noble gas element, or a noble gas element and phosphorous, or just phosphorous is then injected into the crystalline semiconductor film <b>706</b> by ion doping, forming gettering sites <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Heat treatment is then performed by furnace annealing within a nitrogen atmosphere at 450 to 600° C. for 0.5 to 12 hours, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The catalytic element remaining in the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> can thus be moved to the gettering sites <b>713</b> and concentrated.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>710</b> can then be obtained by removing the mask insulating film <b>711</b> and the gettering sites by etching. The crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>710</b> manufactured by Embodiment 4 can be applied to the semiconductor films shown by Embodiments 1 and 2.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 5</heading>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A 1 to 10 nm thick silicon nitride film can also be used as the base insulating film formed on the substrate <b>701</b> in Embodiment 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a state in which the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b>, the barrier layer <b>707</b>, the semiconductor film <b>708</b>, and the semiconductor film <b>709</b> into which a noble gas element is added have been manufactured by processes similar to those of Embodiment 3, using such a silicon nitride film as a base insulating film <b>720</b>, after which gettering has been performed by heat treatment. A catalytic element such as nickel has a quality of being captured by oxygen or in the vicinity of oxygen. The catalytic element can therefore be moved easily from the crystalline structure semiconductor film <b>706</b> to the semiconductor film <b>708</b>, or to the semiconductor film <b>709</b> to which the inert gas element has been added, by forming the base insulating film from a silicon nitride film. The semiconductor films can be applied to the semiconductor films shown in Embodiments 1 and 2.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment 6</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A case of using a semiconductor film (typically silicon), obtained by heat treatment at a high temperature, in a semiconductor layer containing a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region is explained in Embodiment 6. (The semiconductor film is hereafter referred to as a high temperature polysilicon film.)</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">An amorphous semiconductor film is formed on a quartz substrate having high heat resistivity by using PECVD. Heat treatment is performed next for 24 hours at a temperature of 600° C. using a furnace, forming a crystalline semiconductor film. Note that a silicon oxide film is formed on the semiconductor film surface during this crystallization process, but this does not pose any problems because the silicon oxide film is an extremely thin film that can be removed by a process such as etching.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The oxide film formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film is removed next, and then heat treatment for forming a gate insulating film is performed. The crystalline semiconductor film is heat treated at a temperature of 900 to 1050° C., and an oxide film is formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film. This silicon oxide film is used as the gate insulating film. A silicon oxide film may then be formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film by performing heat treatment of the crystalline semiconductor film such that the final film thickness of the crystalline semiconductor film becomes 30 to 50 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The semiconductor film thus obtained by high temperature heat treatment has good crystallinity and a high electric field effect mobility. TFTs having superior characteristics can be achieved by using the semiconductor film in a semiconductor layer containing a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region. In addition, a semiconductor device having high reliability can be realized by using the TFTs in circuits. It is possible to combine Embodiment 6 with Embodiments 1 and 2.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Embodiment 7</heading>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">An example of a process of manufacturing a light emitting device is explained in Embodiment 7 using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an example showing the structure of an active matrix drive light emitting device. An n-channel TFT <b>652</b> and a p-channel TFT <b>653</b> of a drive circuit portion, and a switching TFT <b>654</b> and an electric current control TFT <b>655</b> of a pixel portion <b>651</b> shown here are manufactured by processes similar to those of Embodiment 1 according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A first interlayer insulating film <b>618</b> made from silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride is formed on gate electrodes <b>608</b> to <b>611</b>, and is used as a protective film. In addition, a second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b> made from an organic resin material such as polyimide or acrylic is formed as a leveling film.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The circuit structure of the driver circuit portion <b>650</b> differs between a gate signal line driver circuit and a data signal line driver circuit, but this is omitted here. Wirings <b>612</b> and <b>613</b> are connected to the n-channel TFT <b>652</b> and to the p-channel TFT <b>653</b>, and circuits such as shift registers, latch circuits, and buffer circuits are formed by using those TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the pixel portion <b>651</b>, a data wiring <b>614</b> is connected to a source side of the switching TFT <b>654</b>, and a drain side wiring <b>615</b> is connected to the gate electrode <b>611</b> of the electric current control TFT <b>655</b>. Further, a source side of the electric current control TFT <b>655</b> is connected to an electric power source supply wiring <b>617</b>, and a drain side electrode <b>616</b> is connected to an anode of a light emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A first interlayer insulating film <b>618</b> is then formed, and a second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b> is formed next. An inorganic insulating material may be formed having an average film thickness from 1.0 to 2.0 μm as the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b>. A silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film may be formed as an inorganic resin film using a known sputtering method or plasma CVD method. In addition, the inorganic resin film may be formed by plasma CVD using SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O as raw material gasses if a silicon oxynitride film is used, with film deposition conditions of a pressure of 0.3 torr, a substrate temperature of 400° C., an RF output of 100 W, and raw material gas flow rates of 4 sccm and 400 sccm for SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Further, an SOG film may also be used as the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b>. In addition, the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b> may also be manufactured using an organic insulating film such as acrylic.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Note that it is preferable to polish and level the surface of the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b>, by using a technique referred to as CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) for cases in which the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b> is manufactured using an inorganic insulating film. CMP is a method in which a surface of a workpiece to be polished is taken as a standard, and chemical and mechanical leveling is performed on the surface. In general, a polishing cloth or a polishing pad (hereafter referred to as a pad in this specification) is attached to a platen or a polishing plate. The platen or polishing plate, and the piece to be polished, are then each rotated or oscillated while a slurry is supplied between the workpiece and the polishing pad. Processing of the surface of a polishing agent is thus performed by a compound chemical and mechanical action. Note that polishing is performed such that the average film thickness of the second interlayer insulating film <b>619</b> is set on the order of 1.0 to 2.0 μm after the leveling process by CMP is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A third insulating film <b>620</b> and a fourth insulating film <b>621</b> are then formed. The fourth insulating film <b>621</b> made from silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride fulfills a role of protecting the semiconductor film that is the main structural element of the TFT from contamination by alkaline metals or organic substances contained within an organic compound layer <b>624</b>, as well as protecting the organic compound layer <b>624</b> from degradation due to oxygen and moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">A transparent conductive film having a thickness of 80 to 120 nm is formed next on the fourth insulating film <b>621</b>, and an anode <b>622</b> is formed by etching. Note that an indium tin oxide (ITO) film or a transparent conductive film in which indium oxide is mixed with 2 to 20% zinc oxide (ZnO), is used as a transparent electrode in Embodiment 7.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In order to form a barrier layer <b>623</b> which covers edge portions of the anode <b>622</b>, a film of a material such as resist, polyimide, polyamide, acrylic, BCB (benzocyclobutene), or silicon oxide is formed. Provided that the barrier layer has insulating properties, both organic and inorganic materials may be used. Note that if a photosensitive acrylic is used to form the barrier layer, it is preferable to perform heat treatment at a temperature of 180 to 350° C. after etching a film of the photosensitive acrylic. Furthermore, it is preferable to perform heat treatment at a temperature of 180 to 350° C. and then to perform etching, forming the barrier layer <b>623</b>, if the barrier layer is formed using a non-photosensitive acrylic film. The barrier layer may be formed by a method such as CVD if a silicon oxide film is used.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">An organic compound layer <b>624</b> and a cathode <b>625</b> are then formed by evaporation on the anode <b>622</b> and the barrier layer <b>623</b>. Note that although an MgAg electrode is used as the cathode of the light emitting elements in Embodiment 7, other known materials may also be used. In addition, the organic compound layer <b>624</b> may be formed by combining and laminating a plurality of layers, such as a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, an electron transporting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a buffer layer, in addition to a light emitting layer. The detailed structure of the organic compound layer <b>624</b> may be arbitrarily determined.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">An organic light emitting element <b>626</b> composed of the anode <b>622</b>, the organic compound layer <b>624</b>, and the cathode <b>625</b> is thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A fifth insulating film <b>627</b> is then formed of an insulating film such as a DLC film. A light emitting device in which the barrier layer has a tapered shape can thus be manufactured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The semiconductor device of the present invention, capable of achieving both a low leak current and a high on current, in which the TFT size is reduced, can be particularly effective when applied to a light emitting device in which a switching TFT and an electric current control TFT, at least two TFTs are formed within one pixel, and a reduction in the aperture ratio (lower brightness, lower light emission efficiency) is a problem.</p>
