<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-211290 filed in Japan on Jul. 21, 2005, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a three-phase brushless motor driving device which can immediately and stably start without a rotor position sensor and a motor driving method at the time of start.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a brushless motor, in order to apply a stable torque to a rotor by selecting an appropriate winding of a stator to apply a current thereto, information of a relative position of electrical angle of the rotor with respect to the stator is needed. Various kinds of rotor position sensors to find the relative position of the electrical angle of the rotor with respect to the stator are used. Meanwhile, a sensorless driving technique which does not need the rotor position sensor has been developed in view of reliability or costs or environment resistance. According to such sensorless driving technique, it is well known that the rotor position is detected by reading a counter electromotive voltage generated in a stator phase winding while the rotor is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the counter electromotive voltage is not generated when the rotor is stopped, the rotor position cannot be detected by the above method when the rotor is stopped. Thus, various kinds of methods of detecting the rotor position when the rotor is stopped have been proposed. For example, there is disclosed a method of detecting a rotor position from a stator phase which is sequentially selected and generates the highest amplitude of a current which flows when a rotor position search pulse is applied, as shown in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2547778. Furthermore, there is disclosed a method of finding a rotor position based on a result in which a polarity of a difference in response signal is sequentially detected by selecting a stator phase and applying a rotor position search pulse thereto in forward and backward directions as shown in Japanese Patent Publication No. 8-13196.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, according to the method in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 2547778, there is a problem in accuracy in finding the peak value of the pulse current which flow when the rotor position search pulse is applied. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, since a difference in pulse current peak value depending on the rotor position is small in the phase, it is necessary that variation in electric and magnetic characteristics that the stator and the rotor originally contain has to be small in the phase as a precondition. Therefore, the method is not suitable for an inexpensive motor in which characteristics with respect to each phase are not managed well. In addition, in case of a motor in which an inductance of a winding is low to attain high-speed characteristics, a pulse current is increased by itself, a current value to obtain the difference in pulse current peak value becomes high by itself. In addition, according to the method in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 8-13196, it is necessary to find the difference in response signal between positive and negative polarities of the rotor position search pulse signal, so that a table is needed to refer to a polarity combination of the response signal difference every phase. Thus, in order to implement the above method, an arithmetic processing ability is needed, which is not suitable for a case where controllability by a motor only is required or a case of an inexpensive motor driving system.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A motor driving method of a rotor position sensorless multiphase motor driving device including: a rotor; a plurality of phase windings; a common terminal to which one terminal of terminals at both ends of each winding is star connected; a plurality of a set of an upper-side drive transistor and a lower-side drive transistor connected to the other terminal of the winding; and a commutation control unit for turning on the pair of upper-side drive transistor or the lower-side drive transistor. The method includes:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">selecting two terminals from the terminals other than the common terminal of the windings when the rotor is started and applying a search pulse between the selected two terminals to search a rotor position;</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">detecting the rotor position based on a response signal generated between the terminal which was not selected and the common terminal at the search pulse applying step; and</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">applying a start rotation pulse based on the detected rotor position.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, in a case where the rotor position is detected at the rotor position detecting step, the start rotation pulse applying step may be performed and the first round may be completed, and then, the second round including the search pulse applying step, the rotor position detecting step and the start rotation pulse applying step to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, at the search pulse applying step in the Nth round (N is an integer of 2 or more), the same search pulse as the previous search pulse by which the rotor position was detected in the (N−1)th round may be applied as the first search pulse to the two terminals selected when the previous search pulse by which the rotor position was detected was applied in the N−1)th round.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, in a case where the first search pulse is applied at the search pulse applying step in the second round and the rotor position is not detected at the rotor position detecting step, a search pulse which can detect a position to which the rotor is rotated from a position which was detected at the rotor position detecting step in the first round by 60 electrical degrees may be applied as the second search pulse at the search pulse applying step.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, in a case where a predetermined condition to switch a mode from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is not satisfied, when a rotation speed, which is estimated from an interval of the rotor generated in the start mode, exceeds a predetermined value, while all phases are turned off for a predetermined time, a torque command profile estimated from an interval between counter electromotive voltage zero crosses of at least one phase and a counter electromotive voltage detecting period may be provided to switch the mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a case where a predetermined condition to switch a mode from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is not satisfied, a current peak level of the search pulse may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a case where a predetermined condition to switch a mode from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is not satisfied, either one of a search pulse applying period or a search pulse PWM applying period may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, the rotor position may be determined by comparing the response signal in response to the search pulse with a predetermined threshold value at the rotor position detecting step. The threshold value may be set at the rotor position detecting step.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a case where the rotor position is not detected at the rotor position detecting step, the threshold value may be changed and steps of the rotor position search pulse applying step may be repeated. In addition, the changed threshold value may be stored.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the driving method may further include a kick pulse applying step of applying, when it is determined that the rotor position is positioned at a dead point in a case where the rotor position is not detected at the rotor position detecting step, a predetermined number of kick pulses to shift the rotor position from the dead point, in which the steps of the rotor position search pulse applying step may be repeated again after the kick pulse applying step.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The predetermined number of kick pulses applied at the kick pulse applying step may include two kinds of pulses which are out of phase by about 90 degrees with each other. Alternatively, the predetermined number of kick pulses may include two or three kinds of pulses which are out of phase by about 60 or 120 degrees with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the start rotation pulse may include a PWM pulse which is sequential for a predetermined period to control a current peak value at a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The rotor position search pulse may include a PWM pulse which is sequential for a predetermined period to control a current peak value at a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, the rotor position may be determined at the rotor position detecting step based on either one of a response signal while a current is increasing or a response signal while a current is decreasing or both of them.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a case where the predetermined number of rotations of the rotor is detected in the start mode, the mode may be switched from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode. Alternatively, in a case where it is detected that the rotation speed based on an interval of the rotation of 60 electrical degrees of the rotor reaches a predetermined value in the start mode, the mode may be switched from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, the first energized profile in the counter electromotive voltage mode may be controlled, according to the interval of the predetermined number of the rotations of 60 electrical degrees of the rotor in the start mode.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A comparison result of the response signal when the rotor position search pulse current reaches a predetermined value may be used in determining the rotor position at the rotor position detecting step.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Still furthermore, in a case where a response signal based on a neutral point potential with respect to the rotor position search pulse is greater than a predetermined positive threshold value or the response signal is smaller than a predetermined negative threshold value, the rotor position may be determined at the rotor position detecting step.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When it is confirmed that the rotor is rotated to the next period of 60 electrical degrees in the start mode, a counter electromotive voltage zero cross of a predetermined phase winding to be generated in a middle of the period of 60 electrical degrees is to be detected just after the mode is switched from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, the rotor position search pulse may be applied up to four times only at the rotor position search pulse applying step in the first round. Alternatively, the rotor position search pulse may be applied up to six times only at the rotor position search pulse applying step in the first round.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Two specified phases may be detection phases which are used to detect the response signal in order at the rotor position search pulse applying step. One specified phase and one unspecified phase other than the specified phase may be detection phases which are used to detect the response signal in order at the rotor position search pulse applying step.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Still furthermore, at the rotor position search pulse applying step, when a first detection phase of the two detection phases to detect the response signal is selected, a first rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the first detection phase in a first polarity, and then, when a second detection phase is selected, a second rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the second detection phase in the first polarity, and then, when the second detection phase is selected, a third rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the second detection phase in a second polarity opposite to the first polarity, and then, when the first detection phase is selected, a fourth rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the first detection phase in the second polarity opposite to the first polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, instead of the above, the first detection phase may be selected and a third rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the first detection phase in a second polarity opposite to the first polarity and then the second detection phase may be selected and a fourth rotor position search pulse may be applied between two phases other than the second detection phase in the second polarity opposite to the first polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Regarding a phase which is common among the first couple of phases other than the first detection phase selected when the first rotor position search pulse is applied and the second couple of phases other than the second detection phase selected when the second rotor position search pulse is applied at the rotor position search pulse applying step, in a case where it is a current source when the first rotor position search pulse is applied, it may be a current sink when the second rotor position search pulse is applied, and in a case where it is the current sink when the first rotor position search pulse is applied, it may be the current source when the second rotor position search pulse is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A peak value of the rotor position search pulse current may be controlled by an inputted torque command at the rotor position search pulse applying step.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A peak value of the start rotation pulse current may be controlled by an inputted torque command at the start rotation pulse applying step.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As a result of the rotor position searching step, the start rotation pulse applying step of applying the start rotation pulse also may serve as the rotor position search pulse applying step in the next round.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The start rotation pulse may include a sequential PWM drive pulse for a predetermined period to control the current peak value at a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the motor driving device and the motor driving method of the present invention, the response signal with respect to the applied rotor position search pulse is compared with the predetermined threshold value to determine the rotor position. In this case, there is a case where the rotor position can be immediately determined at a certain rate. Therefore, when the rotor position can be determined, the start rotation pulse current which starts the rotor can be immediately applied between the appropriate phase to be energized. Namely, according to the present invention, the start torque signal can be applied without a step of selecting all predetermined phases and then determining the rotor position. Therefore, the start period until the mode is switched from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode can be shortened and the start speed can be improved. In addition, since the response signal from the rotor position search pulse which is in a predetermined range is monitored, the quality of the response signal is excellent, so that the rotor position can be correctly determined. Furthermore, the above control can be implemented at low cost.</p>

In addition, the phase comparison control block <b>17</b> includes a terminal line selection block <b>27</b>, a first commutation control comparator <b>28</b>, a second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> and a comparator threshold value setter <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">This motor driving device operates in a start mode when a rotation speed is an extremely low at the time of start of the motor <b>9</b>, for example, and operates in a counter electromotive voltage feedback mode which is well known in this field when a counter electromotive voltage generated by rotor rotation can be stably detected and its commutation can be controlled. The commutation control block <b>26</b> and the phase comparison control block <b>17</b> operate in collaboration with each other. Based on this, a description will be made of an operation of the motor driving device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">First, a description will be made of torque control of the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode. In this mode, the rotor position search pulse command generator <b>31</b> and the start pulse command generator <b>32</b> are not used. When the component torque generation block <b>22</b> receives the external command signal <b>21</b>, it generates a plurality of component torque command signals corresponding to combinations of timings and on-states of the drive transistors <b>3</b> to <b>8</b> from the commutation control block <b>26</b>. The PWM on-pulse generation block <b>24</b> applies a PWM on-timing to the phase selected in the commutation control block <b>26</b>. When the torque comparison block <b>23</b> receives phase information in the on-state from the commutation control block <b>26</b>, it compares an output of the amplifier <b>19</b> with a signal selected from the plurality of component torque command signals, or selects one result from a plurality of compared results between the output of the amplifier <b>19</b> and component torque command signals and it generates a PWM off-pulse when the output of the current detection amplifier <b>19</b> becomes greater than the component torque command signal. When the PWM on-pulse and the PWM off-pulse are inputted to the latch block <b>25</b>, a pulse width of the phase selected by the commutation control block <b>26</b> is controlled. In addition, the details of the above method is disclosed in the patent document (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-174789), in which a current can be controlled even when a current flows in all three phase windings. In a case of energization at 120 degrees, the component torque generation block <b>22</b> is not necessary, and it is noted that a thin arrow in which one signal is transmitted is appropriate instead of a thick arrow in which a plurality of signals are transmitted in parallel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, a description will be made of energized phase control in the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode. As described above, this method is well known in this field. The commutation control block <b>26</b> controls the energization so that while a polarity of the counter electromotive voltage of a certain winding of the three phase windings is expected to be changed, the current of that winding may become zero. In the winding in which a current is zero, a time-varying component of the current becomes also zero after a short time, while the counter electromotive voltage is generated between both terminals of the winding, that is, between the U-phase terminal line <b>13</b> and the neutral point terminal line (common terminal) <b>16</b>, or between the V-phase terminal line <b>14</b> and the neutral point terminal line <b>16</b>, or between the W-phase terminal line <b>15</b> and the neutral point terminal (common terminal) line <b>16</b> by an interaction between the winding and a magnetic flux of the rotating rotor, then, a rotor position can be correctly recognized by detecting the timing of the polarity change of the counter electromotive voltage (zero cross timing). In this counter electromotive voltage feedback mode, the comparator threshold value setter <b>30</b> sets some amount of offset when both first commutation control comparator <b>28</b> and second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> or either one of them compares differential input signals. This offset varies the outputs of the comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> according to whether a potential difference between the differential input signals reaches a predetermined value or not. In other words, this offset serves as a threshold value with respect to the differential input signals of the comparator and prevents the zero cross timing from being affected by chattering. When the zero cross timing of the potential difference of the winding in which a current and its time variation are zero is selected through the terminal line selection block <b>27</b> and it is fed back to the commutation control block <b>26</b> through the first and second commutation control comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b>, the commutation control block <b>26</b> can sequentially control the correct commutation timing. In addition, when to prevent the chattering is a purpose, a latch circuit may only have to be provided in the commutation control block <b>26</b> without having to provide the offset (threshold value). In this case, the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> and the comparator threshold value setter <b>30</b> are not needed. In addition, when both first commutation control comparator <b>28</b> and second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> or either one of them is previously prepared for each phase winding, the terminal line selection block <b>27</b> is not needed. When the terminal line selection block <b>27</b> is provided, the comparator can be used in both start mode and counter electromotive voltage feedback mode.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, a description will be made of the start mode. When the rotor is just after started and it exists in the extremely low rotation region, the operation is performed in the start mode. In the start mode, a step of applying a search pulse and a step of searching a rotor position and a step of applying a torque current pulse to a suitable stator to apply a start rotation torque to the rotor whose position is determined are repeated for acceleration. In the start mode, the commutation control block <b>26</b> selects two terminals from the U-phase terminal, the V-phase terminal and the W-phase terminal of the three phase windings and applies the rotor position search pulse to those terminals. A description will be made of a response signal when the rotor position search pulse is applied with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> hereinafter. In addition, the horizontal axis designates an electrical angle in which the rotor is locked when a stationary current is applied from the U-phase terminal to the V-phase terminal at 150 degrees. The same applies to descriptions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing a relation between the electrical angle of the previously provided rotor position and the response voltage when the search pulse is applied between the U-phase winding and the V-phase winding. A curved line <b>41</b> showing the relation between the electrical angle of the rotor position and the response voltage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is provided as follows.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0103">(a) First, the rotor is set at a position whose electrical angle is varied by predetermined electrical degrees.</li>

    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0105">(c) Then, a response voltage generated between the W-phase terminal line <b>15</b> of the W-phase winding having a zero current and the neutral point terminal line <b>16</b> is measured and it is provided as the response voltage corresponding to the electrical angle of the set rotor position.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0106">(d) Then, the electrical angle of the rotor position is varied by predetermined degrees in the above operation (a), and the above operations (b) and (c) are repeated. Thus, the variations in response voltage corresponding to the electrical degrees of the rotor positions can be provided as the curved line <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In addition, although the variations in response voltage corresponding to the electrical degrees of the rotor positions is shown as the curved line <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is provided by connecting points of the response voltages provided at the predetermined electrical degrees in practice as described above.</li>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, according to the curved line <b>41</b> showing the relation between the electrical degrees of the rotor position and the response voltage, although an absolute value of the response voltage is increased at around 120 electrical degrees (region <b>46</b>) and 180 electrical degrees (region <b>45</b>), the response voltage is hardly detected in other regions. Thus, it can be seen that the rotor position can be specified, based on the measured response voltage, when it is positioned at around 120 electrical degrees or 180 electrical degrees. However, since the electrical degree of the rotor position does not always correspond one-on-one with the response voltage, the rotor position has to be specified only at the response voltage having a predetermined absolute value or more. Thus, a positive threshold value <b>43</b> and a negative threshold value <b>44</b> are set previously, then, it is determined that the rotor position is at around 180 electrical degrees when the response voltage is the positive threshold value <b>43</b> or more (H level signal), and it is determined that the rotor position is at around 120 electrical degrees when the response voltage is the negative threshold value <b>44</b> or less (L level signal).</p>

Thus, it can be seen that the rotor position can be specified, based on the measured response voltage, when it is positioned at around 0 electrical degrees or 300 electrical degrees. In this case also, similar to the above curved line <b>41</b>, the rotor position has to be specified only at the response voltage having a predetermined absolute value or more. Here, the same positive threshold value <b>43</b> and the same negative threshold value <b>44</b> as those of the above curved line <b>41</b> are set.

<p id="p-0116" num="0155">Thus, the description has been made of the case where the rotor position is detected by applying six kinds of rotor position search pulses including the application polarities, and the rotor position can be determined with high precision from the response signal level by applying the six kinds of rotor position search pulses in general.

<p id="p-0119" num="0162">The phases to which the start rotation pulse is applied when the rotor position is at 0 electrical degree, 120 electrical degrees, 180 electrical degrees and 300 electrical degrees have been already described. When it is determined that the electrical angle of the rotor position is at around 60 degrees, a preferable start rotation torque can be applied by turning on the drive transistor <b>3</b> and the drive transistor <b>7</b>. Meanwhile, when it is determined that the electrical degree of the rotor position is at around 240 degrees, a preferable start rotation torque can be applied by turning on the drive transistor <b>4</b> and the drive transistor <b>6</b>. According to this method, when the first response result from the first rotor position search pulse is such that the output of the comparator <b>28</b> is the H level signal or the output of the comparator <b>29</b> is L level signal, the rotor position can be immediately determined without waiting for the response of the rotor position search pulse applied between the other windings. Thus, since unnecessary search pulse application which does not contribute to the rotor start torque can be omitted, and the predetermined start pulse is applied, prompt start acceleration can be implemented in total.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0164">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, at a first step DS<b>1</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse to search the rotor position, the pulses are applied three times. More specifically, at the step DS<b>1</b>, the rotor position search pulse is applied from the U-phase winding <b>10</b> to the V-phase winding <b>11</b> first, it is applied from the V-phase winding <b>11</b> to the U-phase winding <b>10</b> secondly and it is applied from the V-phase winding <b>11</b> to the W-phase winding <b>12</b> thirdly. Although the rotor position could not be searched by the first and second application of the rotor position search pulse, the output of the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> becomes the L level signal (state N) at the third application of the rotor position search pulse, so that it is determined that the rotor position is at 240 degrees. The rotor position search pulse condition at the time is stored and the drive transistors <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on to apply the appropriate torque to the rotor and the start rotation pulse is applied at a step SP<b>1</b> for applying the start rotation pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0165">At a second step DS<b>2</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the search pulse under the same condition as that stored last time is applied. Since the rotation speed is low at the time of start in general, a frequency of generation of the rotor rotation to the next period of 60 electrical degrees is sufficiently smaller than the number of rotor position searches. Thus, since the L level signal (state N) can be immediately provided as the output of the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> at the step DS<b>2</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse, the same rotor position as the last one can be determined to be at 240 electrical degrees. The search pulse condition at this time is stored and the drive transistors <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on to apply a proper torque to the rotor, and the start rotation pulse is applied at step SP<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0166">Similarly, the rotor position search pulses are applied at third and fourth steps DS<b>3</b> and DS<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, so that the drive transistors <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on based on the determination results of the rotor positions, so that the start rotation pulses are applied at third and fourth steps SP<b>3</b> and SP<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0167">At a fifth step DS<b>5</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the rotor position search pulses are applied two times. As the first rotor position search pulse application, although the same rotor position search pulse as that used at the step DS<b>4</b> and stored last time is applied, the L level signal cannot be provided as the output of the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b>. Thus, as the second rotor position search pulse application, the drive transistors <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on so that the rotor can be searched at 300 degrees which is rotated from 240 degrees of the rotor position detected last time by 60 degrees. In this case, the current is applied from the V-phase winding <b>11</b> to the U-phase winding <b>10</b>. At this time, the output of the first commutation control comparator <b>28</b> becomes the H level signal (state P), and the rotor position is determined to be at 300 degrees. The search pulse condition at this time is stored and the drive transistors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on to apply a proper torque to the rotor and the start rotation pulse is applied at a step SP<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0168">At sixth and seventh steps DS<b>6</b> and DS<b>7</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the same search pulse as the rotor position search pulse secondly applied at the step DS<b>5</b> is applied and the rotor position is determined to be at 300 electrical degrees. Thus, the same start rotation pulse as that at the step SP<b>5</b> is applied at sixth and seventh start rotation pulse applying steps SP<b>6</b> and SP<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0169">At an eighth step DS<b>8</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the rotor position search pulse is applied two times in result. As the first rotor position search pulse application, although the same rotor position search pulse as that used at the step DS<b>7</b> and stored last time is applied, the H level signal cannot be provided as the output of the first commutation control comparator <b>28</b>. Thus, as the second rotor position search pulse application, the drive transistors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are turned on so that the rotor can be searched at 360 degrees, that is, 0 degree which is rotated from 300 degrees of the rotor position detected last time by 60 degrees. In this case, the current is applied from the W-phase winding <b>12</b> to the U-phase winding <b>10</b>. At this time, the output of the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b> becomes the L level signal (state N), and the rotor position is determined to be at 0 degree. The search pulse condition at this time is stored and the drive transistors <b>5</b> and <b>7</b> are turned on to apply a proper torque to the rotor and the start rotation pulse is applied at a start rotation pulse applying step SP<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0170">At ninth step DS<b>9</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the same search pulse as the rotor position search pulse secondly applied at the step DS<b>8</b> is applied and the rotor position is determined to be at 300 electrical degree. Thus, the same start rotation pulse as that at the step SP<b>8</b> is applied at a ninth start rotation pulse applying step SP<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0171">At a tenth step DS<b>10</b> for applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, the rotor position search pulses are applied two times in result. As the first rotor position search pulse application, although the same rotor position search pulse as that used at the step DS<b>9</b> and stored last time is applied, the L level signal cannot be provided as the output of the second commutation control comparator <b>29</b>. Thus, as the second rotor position search pulse application, the drive transistors <b>5</b> and <b>7</b> are turned on so that the rotor can be searched at around 60 degrees which is rotated from 0 degree of the rotor position detected last time by 60 degrees. In this case, the current is applied from the W-phase winding <b>12</b> to the V-phase winding <b>11</b>. At this time, the output of the first commutation control comparator <b>28</b> becomes the H level signal (state P), and the rotor position is determined to be at around 60 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0172">Here, the first rotation of the rotor by 60 electrical degrees from the first rotor position search pulse applying step DS<b>1</b> is confirmed at the fifth rotor position search pulse applying step DS<b>5</b>, the second rotation of the rotor by 60 electrical degrees is confirmed at the eighth rotor position search pulse applying step DS<b>8</b>, and finally the third rotation of the rotor by 60 electrical degrees is confirmed at the tenth rotor position search pulse applying step DS<b>10</b>. When it is determined that the rotation start can be started well after three rotations of the rotor by 60 electrical degrees, a normal acceleration torque is applied thereafter, so that the counter electromotive voltage can be used as a method of detecting the rotor position. As shown in a current waveform AP<b>1</b>, the drive transistors <b>3</b> and <b>7</b> are turned on to control the current with PWM. Since the rotor is rotated afterwards, the motor can be driven by detecting the rotor position using the well-known counter electromotive voltage as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0173">In addition, although it is determined that the rotation has been started after the three times of rotations of the rotor by 60 electrical degrees in the above case, the number of times may be other than three. In addition, it may be determined that the rotation has normally started when a rotation speed obtained from the interval of the rotation by 60 electrical degrees in the start rotation pulse current reaches a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0174">In addition, when the acceleration torque is applied just after the mode is changed from the start mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode, a current zero period for forming its profile and detecting the zero cross of the counter electromotive voltage is provided at a timing in which the zero cross of the counter electromotive voltage is previously estimated from the motor rotation frequency of each 60 electrical degrees in the start mode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, a zero cross after the AP<b>1</b> is to be detected. When a region of 60 electrical degrees is determined as the rotor position, the zero cross in which the counter electromotive voltage of the W-phase winding is changed from positive to negative is detected at a center timing in the region of 60 electrical degrees, for example. In a case where the predetermined zero cross is not generated when the zero cross detecting period is started, the zero cross at 60 electrical degrees is detected when it is generated. In other words, in the case where the counter electromotive voltage of the W-phase winding is positive when the counter electromotive voltage detecting period is started, the zero cross detecting period is continued until the predetermined zero cross is generated. Then, when the predetermined zero cross is generated, it is determined that the zero cross is generated. In a case where it is determined that the predetermined zero cross is already generated when the counter electromotive voltage zero cross detecting period is started based on the polarity of the counter electromotive voltage signal, the zero cross generation is detected at a point when the counter electromotive voltage zero cross detecting period is started. Namely, in the case where the counter electromotive voltage of the W-phase winding is already negative when the detecting period is started, the zero cross is detected immediately at that point.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0175">The zero cross detection of the counter electromotive voltage will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing a timing for detecting the counter electromotive voltage zero cross, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref> show current profiles when the rotor position just after the mode is changed to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is at timings <b>69</b> and <b>70</b>, respectively. The horizontal axis in the drawing designates a rotor position or a time. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, any one of the six kinds of periods of 60 electrical degrees shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a period <b>61</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a center angle position <b>62</b>, a start position <b>63</b> and an end position <b>64</b> of the period <b>61</b> of 60 electrical degrees are provided. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, phase advance components <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>65</b><i>b </i>of the counter electromotive voltage zero cross detecting period are shown, and sections <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b </i>which are extended until the counter electromotive voltage zero cross is generated are shown. Furthermore, start timings <b>67</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>b </i>and end timings <b>68</b><i>a </i>and <b>68</b><i>b </i>during the period of the counter electromotive voltage zero cross detection are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0176">It is necessary to form a zero current section to detect the counter electromotive voltage every phase in a sensorless drive. A predetermined period in the zero current section is set to the zero cross detecting period and the zero cross detecting period is started at the timings <b>67</b><i>a </i>or <b>67</b><i>b </i>which is advanced by the periods <b>65</b><i>a </i>or <b>65</b><i>b</i>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, from the next expected counter electromotive voltage zero cross timings in view of the period which was recognized as the previous period of 60 electrical degrees. Thus, when the expected cycle is long, that is, when the expected rotation speed is low, the phase is gradually advanced and the expected value is gradually corrected. Meanwhile, when the expected cycle is short, that is, when the expected rotation speed is high, since the counter electromotive voltage zero cross is awaited in the phase as described above, the phase is delayed in result and the correct counter electromotive voltage zero cross is generated at the timings <b>68</b><i>a </i>and <b>68</b><i>b</i>, so that the expected timing is corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0177">In general, the number of start rotation pulses during the period of 60 electrical degrees in the start mode just before switched to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is sufficiently great, so that the rotor position just after changed into the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is positioned at an earlier stage of the period of 60 electrical degrees, that is, at the timing <b>69</b>, for example. At this time, the current profile is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. When previous rotor position information is provided, a U-phase current <b>83</b><i>a </i>rises in a relatively steep manner, a V-phase current <b>84</b><i>a </i>falls in a relatively steep manner, and a W-phase current <b>85</b><i>a </i>rises in a relatively gentle manner. Then, the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>a </i>starts to fall at a relatively gentle slope. Here, the low rate of change of the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>a </i>or the W-phase current <b>85</b><i>a </i>provides a gently sloped current which is effective in reducing motor vibration and noise. Before long, the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>a </i>becomes zero and just after a short-time of the zero current section in which the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>a </i>is stabilized at zero, the zero cross detecting period for detecting the zero cross when the counter electromotive voltage of the U phase is changed from positive to negative is started. Then, when the zero cross is detected at the timing <b>62</b>, the U-phase current starts to fall at the relatively gentle slope in the negative direction. As described above, the counter electromotive voltage zero cross which is generated just after the mode is changed to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode can be detected by detecting the counter electromotive voltage zero cross which is generated in the center timing <b>62</b> during the period of 60 electrical degrees, so that the zero cross detecting period may be set at the position near the timing <b>62</b> after the period of about 30 electrical degrees. In this case, the zero cross detecting period is continued until the zero cross is detected and the zero cross timing can be correctly detected.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0178">Meanwhile, the current profile is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> when the number of start rotation pulses during the period of 60 electrical degrees in the start mode just before the mode is switched to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is small and the rotor position just after the mode is changed to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is positioned at a final stage during the period of 60 electrical degrees, that is, at the timing <b>70</b>, for example. When previous rotor position information is provided, a U-phase current <b>83</b><i>b </i>rises in a relatively steep manner, a V-phase current <b>84</b><i>b </i>falls in a relatively steep manner, and a W-phase current <b>85</b><i>b </i>rises in a relatively gentle manner. Then, the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>b </i>starts to fall at a relatively gentle slope. Here, the low rate of change of the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>b </i>or the W-phase current <b>85</b><i>b </i>provides a gently sloped current which is effective in reducing motor vibration and noise. Before long, the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>b </i>becomes zero and just after a short-time of the zero current section in which the U-phase current <b>83</b><i>b </i>is stabilized at zero, the zero cross detecting period for detecting the zero cross when the counter electromotive voltage of the U phase is changed from positive to negative is started. In this case, since the counter electromotive voltage zero cross has been already generated at the timing <b>62</b>, although it seems that the zero cross should be detected at the middle timing during the next period of 60 electrical degrees, when the number of start rotation pulses during the shift of 60 electrical degrees in the start mode is sufficiently great, the zero cross detecting period is continued for a period corresponding to a period of 90 electrical degrees, so that the torque is lowered. Therefore, even when the rotor position just after the mode is switched to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is at the timing <b>70</b>, it is preferable that the counter electromotive voltage zero cross is detected during this period of 60 electrical degrees. In this case, since the counter electromotive voltage zero cross has been already generated at the timing and the polarity is not changed until the period corresponding to the period of 180 electrical degrees, it is found that the counter electromotive voltage zero cross has been already generated at the timing <b>62</b> from its polarity and then the zero cross is immediately determined at the counter electromotive voltage zero cross detection start timing <b>67</b><i>b </i>and then forms the next profile of 60 electrical degrees. In addition, in this case, the torque is not lowered. As described above, since the expected cycle information can be shortened by the period <b>65</b><i>b</i>, the correct zero cross timing can be detected before long.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0179">A description will be made of the phase comparison control block <b>17</b> hereinafter. The phase comparison control block <b>17</b> includes circuit constitutions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref>, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C. When the rotor position search pulse for the regions <b>71</b> to <b>78</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be applied, the rotor position search pulse for the regions <b>79</b> to <b>82</b> may not be provided. Therefore, since the V-phase terminal in which the search pulse current is always flowing is not used as the response signal detection terminal, the U-phase terminal and the W-phase terminal are connected to the comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> through the terminal line selection block <b>27</b>, to determine the rotor position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. In addition, in the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode, the threshold values of the comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are set to zero or the absolute values thereof are set to be small and while the comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are connected to the U-phase terminal and the W-phase terminal, a comparator <b>99</b> which is used only in the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is connected to the V-phase terminal.

<p id="p-0137" num="0180">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the terminal line selection block <b>27</b> is not used and each phase has specific two comparators to which response signals with respect to the rotor position search pulse application are inputted, that is, comparators <b>28</b>U, <b>28</b>V, <b>28</b>W, <b>29</b>U, <b>29</b>V and <b>29</b>W are provided.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0139" num="0182">A motor driving method according to a second embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that it uses a response signal value provided by an inductive action when a current of a rotor position search pulse has a predetermined value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view showing characteristics of a response signal generated between a W-phase terminal line <b>15</b> having a current of zero and a neutral point terminal line <b>16</b> with respect to the rotor position when a rotor position search pulse is applied from a U-phase winding terminal to a V-phase winding terminal in two cases having different current levels of the rotor position search pulse. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a curved line <b>51</b> designates the characteristics of the response signal when the rotor position search pulse current is high and the response signal characteristics <b>51</b> includes a main peak <b>52</b>, a main bottom <b>53</b>, a sub peak <b>54</b> and a sub bottom <b>55</b>. In addition, a curved line <b>56</b> designates the characteristics of the response signal when the rotor position search pulse current is relatively low and the response signal characteristics <b>56</b> includes a main peak <b>57</b>, a main bottom <b>58</b>, a sub peak <b>59</b> and a sub bottom <b>60</b>. From this result, since the sub peak <b>54</b> and the sub bottom <b>55</b> in the case where the rotor position search pulse is set high are smaller than the sub peak <b>59</b> and the sub bottom <b>60</b> in the case where the rotor position search pulse is set low, lower limit margins of absolute values of a positive threshold value <b>43</b> and a negative threshold value <b>44</b> can be sufficiently provided. Therefore, when a predetermined rotor position search pulse current value is controlled well in the above rotor position detection, the sub peak and sub bottom of the response voltage signal configuration generated on both ends of the winding having a current of zero are reduced in size, so that the rotor position can be more correctly determined. That is, according to a method of applying the rotor position search pulse in general, although a predetermined voltage is applied between the winding terminals for a predetermined time when the selected high-potential drive transistor and low-potential drive transistor are turned on, it is as follows in this embodiment based on the result in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0183">The rotor position search pulse command generator <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> sets the threshold value current value of the rotor position search pulse to determine the timing for reading out the response signal. The commutation control block <b>26</b> in the start mode turns PWM on the drive transistor selected for rotor position search pulse application with a pulse from the PWM on pulse generation block <b>24</b>.

When the rotor position search pulse current value reaches a predetermined value Ith, the outputs of the comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are inputted to the commutation control block <b>26</b> at this timing <b>86</b> and the rotor position search pulse current is turned PWM off.

</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0191">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is not necessary to apply the search pulses in all of the above patterns. Since four detectable rotor positions are not overlapped with each other in the regions <b>71</b> to <b>74</b>, the regions <b>75</b> to <b>78</b>, or the regions <b>79</b> to <b>82</b>, they are efficiently selected. Therefore, it is preferable that one is selected from the above three kinds of combinations and used for the first search pulse application and when the rotor position cannot be determined by the first search pulse, it is used for the second search pulse application in the first round of searching the rotor position. When the rotor position cannot be determined by the second search pulse, another search pulse is used for the third search pulse application and when the rotor position cannot be determined by the third search pulse application, it is used for the fourth search pulse application. However, as described above, in and after the second round of the step of searching the rotor position, as the first search pulse, the same search pulse by which the rotor position could be determined finally in the first round of the rotor position search is used and when the rotor position cannot be determined by the first search pulse, as the second search pulse, the search pulse which can determine the rotor position when the rotor is rotated 60 electrical degrees is used.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0192">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the regions <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> in which the rotor position can be detected by applying the rotor position search pulse current from the U-phase winding to V-phase winding, the regions <b>75</b> and <b>76</b> in which the rotor position can be detected by applying the rotor position search pulse current from the V-phase winding to W-phase winding, the regions <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> in which the rotor position can be detected by applying the rotor position search pulse current from the W-phase winding to U-phase winding, are hardly overlapped with each other. Therefore, even when two kinds of search pulse currents of those are applied two times, about the same rotor position detection probability can be provided as in the case where the rotor position search pulse current is applied between one pair of terminals in the forward and reverse directions as described above. Then, as the third search pulse current application for detecting the rotor position, the current pulse is applied between the phases of the one of the above two kinds in the reverse direction and as the fourth current application, the current pulse is applied between the phases of the other of the above two kinds in the reverse direction, so that the entire rotor position can be covered. Namely, as shown in the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, for example, when the rotor position search pulse current is applied from the U-phase winding to the V-phase winding, and then from the V-phase winding to the W-phase winding, and then from the V-phase winding to U-phase winding and finally from W-phase winding to V-phase winding, the rotor position can be detected in early stage. In addition, even when this order is partially changed such that the rotor position search pulse current is applied from the U-phase winding to the V-phase winding, and then from the V-phase winding to the W-phase winding, and then from the W-phase winding to V-phase winding and finally from V-phase winding to U-phase winding, the rotor position can be detected. In this case, the V phase is a source in the first rotor position search pulse current application and it is a sink in the second rotor position search pulse current application. When the V phase is the source also in the second search pulse current application, the regions of the electrical angle in which the rotor position can be detected in the first and second current applications are regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, so that they are overlapped and the rotor position is not likely to be detected in early stage.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0194">A motor driving method according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention is characterized in an applying method of a start rotation pulse. A start rotation pulse is applied between a phase to be energized based on the result of the rotor position determination. A method of applying the start rotation pulse will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. According to the above description, the rotor position search pulse and the start rotation pulse include a pulse <b>91</b> and a pulse <b>92</b>, respectively as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. However, a period in which the start rotation pulse especially is applied is elongated and an excessive current rise is caused in some cases, which becomes a problem in reliability. Thus, according to the motor driving method in this embodiment, it is characterized in that a pulse <b>94</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is PWM driven. According to the PWM pulse, when it reaches a current peak value based on the torque command value from the start pulse command generator <b>32</b>, it is turned PWM off and then turned PWM on after a predetermined time, so that its current level can be kept constant and reliability is maintained. The rotor position search pulse may be also PWM controlled in a current value as shown by a pulse <b>93</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, so that the rotor position can be prevented from being erroneously detected.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0195">In addition, although the description has been made based on the response signal when the search pulse current is on the increase, a description will be made of a fact that the rotor position can be detected when the search pulse current is on the decrease also. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a view showing characteristics of the response signal of the search pulse with respect to the electrical degrees of the rotor position like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The horizontal axis designates the electrical angle of the rotor position and the vertical axis designates the response signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the case where a rotor position search pulse current is applied from a U-phase winding to a V-phase winding, in which reference numeral <b>41</b> designates the response signal which appears in a W-phase winding to which a current is not applied when the pulse current is on the increase and reference numeral <b>41</b>* designates the response signal which appears in the W-phase winding to which a current is not applied when the pulse current is on the decrease. Since the response signal is detected as a product of an inductance and a current variation, the response signals <b>41</b> and <b>41</b>* which appear when the rotor is in the same position have opposite polarity. That is, when threshold values of the response signals <b>41</b> and <b>41</b>* are set, one is set to a positive value and the other is set to a negative value. For example, according to the pulse <b>93</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the response signal having the opposite polarity can be detected during a period from PWM off to PWM on. That is, when it is assumed that the rotor position search pulse is applied from the V-phase terminal to the W-phase terminal while the rotor position is at 240 degrees in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, as the response signal of the U-phase winding <b>10</b>, although it has been described that the output of the comparator <b>29</b> is the L level signal during a period <b>95</b>, since the output of the comparator <b>28</b> is the H level signal during a period <b>96</b>, this may be used.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0196">A motor driving method according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention is characterized in setting a threshold value to be compared with a response signal in searching a rotor position. Since an appropriate threshold value level range to be compared with the response signal is varied depending on the motor, it is necessary to set the threshold value to the appropriate value depending on the motor. When the threshold value is too high, an angular range of each of the regions <b>45</b> to <b>48</b> of the rotor position which can be detected shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example is narrowed, so that undetectable range (determination dead point) of the rotor position is generated. Meanwhile, when the threshold value is too low, a sub peak or a sub bottom could be erroneously determined as a main peak or a main bottom. Thus, according to the motor driving method in the fifth embodiment, an absolute value of the initial threshold value is set high. Even when the six kinds of rotor position search pulses shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are applied, in a case where the outputs of comparators <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> are neither the H level signal nor L level signal, that is, in a case where the rotor position cannot be determined, the threshold value is to be self-adjusted. For example, after the absolute value of the threshold value is adjusted, the rotor position is searched again. Thus, when the dead point is recognized, it can be removed. The self-adjusted threshold value level is updated. When a nonvolatile memory is incorporated inside, the modulated threshold value is stored inside, so that the rotor position can be immediately searched for the future. The step of updating the threshold value level can be put in a path <b>97</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and a path <b>98</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>

Furthermore, in a case where rotor position detection precision is not improved by varying the threshold value, a step of shifting to a synchronous start mode in which the operation is synchronously started, and a step of switching the mode to the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode based on the rotor position information provided by detecting the counter electromotive voltage provided by motor rotation are added.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0150" num="0208">A motor driving method according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a rotor is displaced by applying a kick pulse when the rotor position cannot be determined by the predetermined rotor position determination. Since the dead point in the rotor position determination is rare in the entire electrical angle, according to this motor driving method, when the rotor position cannot be determined by the predetermined rotor position determination, the rotor is slightly displaced from the present position by the predetermined kick pulse applied. Thus, since the rotor is shifted from the dead point, the rotor position can be determined. The kick pulse includes a plurality of pulses including at least one pulse to which torque having a predetermined value or more is applied. For example, in a case where two kinds of pulses which are out of phase by 90 degrees with each other are applied, when it is assumed that maximum torque is 1, at least 0.71 of torque can be applied. As another case, in a case where three kinds of pulses which are out of phase by 60 or 120 degrees with each other are applied, when it is assumed that the maximum torque is 1, at least 0.87 of torque can be applied. Furthermore, as another case, in a case where two kinds of pulses which are out of phase by 60 or 120 degrees with each other are applied, when it is assumed that the maximum torque is 1, at least 0.50 of torque can be applied. In the above cases, the combination of the pulses which are out of phase by 60 or 120 degrees with each other can be implemented by applying a current pulse to any two terminals selected from the three phase winding terminals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, the pulses which are out of phase by 90 degrees with each other can be implemented by applying the current pulse to any two terminals selected from the three phase winding terminals first and applying the current pulse between the two terminals bundled together and a remaining terminal secondly. This kick pulse applying step may be put in the path <b>97</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> or the path <b>98</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0151" num="0209">A motor driving method according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a start mode is shifted to a counter electromotive voltage feedback mode by estimating a rotation speed. A description has been made of the case where the rotor is sequentially rotated by 60 electrical degrees in the start mode in general in the above embodiments. This is implemented when a motor load is normal and a modified start rotation torque is applied thereto. In addition to the case of the normal load, in order to adapt a case where a load is light, the rotor rotation speed is to be increased in the same start rotation pulse, so that the rotor is rotated 120 degrees or 180 degrees in a breath and the condition to confirm the rotor rotation of 60 electrical degrees cannot be satisfied, which could cause non-smooth acceleration. In this case, the cycle of the rotor rotation for 60 electrical degrees is measured and when it is detected that an expected rotation speed has a predetermined value or more, then, it is found that the rotor rotation speed is high. In this case, all phases are turned off for a predetermined period and a zero cross interval of at least one phase or zero cross intervals of the plurality of phases are measured, so that the rotation speed can be correctly estimated. Based on the estimated rotation speed, a torque command profile and a counter electromotive voltage detecting period are set and then the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode is implemented. Thus, the motor can be started and accelerated stably not only in the case the load is normal but also in the case the load is light.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0210">In addition, when the load is light similarly, in a case where smooth acceleration is not provided in the start mode, since a rotation torque is generated in a search pulse in some cases, the start rotation torque can be prevented from being generated in the search pulse by reducing its current value and its continuing time or its width. In addition, it is effective that the current value and the continuing time or the width of the start rotation pulse is reduced to prevent the rotor from being rotated 120 degrees or 180 degrees so that the rotor rotation confirming condition of 60 electrical degrees can be satisfied. These can be implemented by controlling the current value of the start rotation pulse as described in the fourth embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0211">A motor driving method according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a step of applying a start rotation pulse is combined with a step of applying a rotor position search pulse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref> show an example of a schematic timing chart in which the step of applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> is rationalized. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref>, the horizontal axis designates a time, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C designate a U-phase winding current, a V-phase winding current and a W-phase winding current in the vertical axes, respectively, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref> designates an output result of a comparator <b>28</b> or a comparator <b>29</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref> designates a determined result of a rotor position. According to the motor driving method in the eighth embodiment, a first step SD<b>1</b> of applying the start rotation pulse, in which the start rotation pulse current is applied from the V-phase terminal to the U-phase terminal is combined with a second step of applying the rotor position search pulse. Since the response signal from the W phase is small at the start rotation pulse applying steps SD<b>1</b> to SD<b>3</b>, although it is considered that the rotor position is at a position corresponding to 60 electrical degrees, a position corresponding to 120 electrical degrees, a position corresponding to 180 electrical degrees, or a position corresponding to 240 electrical degrees, it is determined that the rotor is not rotated and still positioned at 240 electrical degrees. According to this rotor position determining method, although detectable electrical angle is not precisely provided, it can be correctly performed according to the condition that the rotor is rotated every predetermined electrical degrees by the start rotation pulse applied one time.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0212">The response signal from the W phase becomes a positive threshold value or more at a fourth start rotation pulse applying step SD<b>4</b>, and it is determined that the rotor is rotated 60 electrical degrees to be at a position of 300 degrees and a current is applied from the W-phase terminal to a U-phase terminal at a fifth start rotation pulse applying step SD<b>5</b>. Although it is considered that the rotor position is at a position corresponding to 120 electrical degrees, a position corresponding to 180 electrical degrees, a position corresponding to 240 electrical degrees, or a position corresponding to 300 electrical degrees at the steps SD<b>5</b> and SD<b>6</b>, it is determined that the rotor is not rotated and still positioned at 300 electrical degrees, similar to the determination at the start rotation pulse applying steps SD<b>1</b> to SD<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0213">The response signal from the V phase becomes the negative threshold value or less at a seventh start rotation pulse applying step SD<b>7</b> and it is determined that the rotor is rotated 60 electrical degrees to be at 0 electrical degree.

    <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0216">(b) It is determined whether the response signal of the winding terminal of the phase to which the start rotation pulse current is not applied is out of the threshold value (that is, state 0 which is neither H level signal nor L level signal) or not at step S<b>62</b>. When the response signal is the same as previous one (NO: state P or state N), it is determined that the rotor is positioned during the same period of 60 electrical degrees as before at step S<b>63</b>. Then, the operation returns to the step S<b>61</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0217">(c) Meanwhile, when it is determined that the response signal is state 0 (YES) at the step S<b>62</b>, it is determined that the rotor is rotated to the next period of 60 electrical degrees at step S<b>64</b> and it is determined whether the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode switching condition is satisfied or not at step S<b>65</b>. When the counter electromotive voltage feedback mode switching condition is satisfied, the process is completed. Then, the operation is performed in the well-known counter electromotive voltage feedback mode. Meanwhile, when the switching condition is not satisfied, the operation returns to the step S<b>61</b>.</li>

<p id="p-0158" num="0219">A motor driving method according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a PWM drive pulse whose peak current value is controlled is applied at a start rotation pulse applying step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11E</figref> shows an example of a timing chart showing the start rotation pulse applying step in the motor driving method according to the ninth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11</figref> E show the example in which the step of applying the rotor position search pulse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> are rationalized like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref>.

According to the ninth embodiment, an arrow of a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> designates an increase section of the absolute value of the pulse current. When the response signal generated in the increase section at the start rotation pulse applying step SD<b>11</b> is the positive threshold value or more, it means that the rotor is positioned at 300 electrical degrees. Similarly, when the response signals generated in the increase sections at the start rotation pulse applying steps SD<b>12</b> and SD<b>13</b> are the negative threshold value or lower and the positive threshold value or more, it means that the rotor is positioned at 0 electrical degrees and at 60 electrical degrees, respectively.

Similarly, when the response signals generated in the decrease sections at the start rotation pulse applying steps SD<b>12</b> and SD<b>13</b> are the positive threshold value or more and the negative threshold value or less, it means that the rotor is positioned at 0 electrical degrees and at 60 electrical degrees, respectively. In addition, either one of the response signal generated in the increase period of the pulse current or the response signal generated in the decrease period thereof may be used or both of them may be used to determine the rotor position. According to the motor driving method in the ninth embodiment of the present invention, the pulse current which applies the torque to start the rotation is sequential, so that acceleration at the time of start can be further improved as compared with the eighth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref>.</p>
