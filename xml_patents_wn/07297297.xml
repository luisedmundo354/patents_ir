<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The present invention relates to polymeric compounds with nonlinear optical properties, and more particularly, to organic dye molecular materials and nonlinear optical polymer compounds containing chromophores.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Recently, the development of high-speed, high-capacity data transmission devices has increased the need for materials that exhibit nonlinear optical properties and research in this field is being actively performed (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1999, 38, 8-33). These nonlinear optical materials are roughly categorized into inorganic materials such as LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, KHP, quartz and the like, which have been widely used, and organic materials which become more interesting in the field in recent years along with semiconductor materials. Organic materials are advantageous over inorganic materials in terms of their synthesis and processing procedures and that their physical properties including the processing temperature, refractive index, nonlinear optical coefficient, absorption wavelength and the like can be adjusted according to the requirements. This is the reason why research on the organic material becomes increasing in the field (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,496,899 and 6,229,047).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Organic materials are classified into crystalline molecules and polymeric substances based on their structure. In the early stage of research, many researchers in a variety of fields were very interested in the crystalline molecule due to its large optical coefficient. However, the crystalline molecule is limited by its unstable nature and difficulties in the crystal growing and processing. To address these limitations, approaches to dispersing organic molecules in polymeric media to develop new materials have been actively made in recent years (Chem. Mater. 1999, 11, 1966-1968). The molecular mobility in a polymeric medium reduces thermal stability and molecular aggregation causes significant optical losses, thereby limiting use of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Meanwhile, to develop materials with desirable processing properties of polymers by incorporating nonlinear organic molecules into polymers is greatly acceptable. Nonlinear polymers are classified into main chains and side chains depending on the way of molecular coupling. Recently, highly ordered macromolecules coupled to be chemically stable, called dendrimer, have been developed and many approaches have been made to increase their applications (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,659,010, 5,496,899, and 6,001,958).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In another aspect of research, some researchers are involved in developing new materials based on covalently-bonded film formation technique improved from the Languir-Blodegette (LB) film formation technique. Although it is difficult to obtain a thin film having an appropriate thickness for use with this method, the resulting thin film has a structure highly ordered to give a very large nonlinear coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">For main chain polymers, nonlinear molecular chromophores are directly used as molecules to be polymerized so that the synthesis of the main chain polymer is difficult and the resulting polymer has poor three-dimensional orientation efficiency during a poling process. For side chain polymers, chromophores are grafted to the core as side chains. In this case, although it is difficult to chemically react the polymer, the selection of core polymer is flexible and a variety of chromophores can be incorporated. The ordered arrangement of chromophores on the polymer chain as its side chains is also advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Dendrimers are sterically highly symmetric and exhibit different characteristics according to their functional end groups incorporated. Also, appropriate designing of a dendrimer molecular structure can separate individual chromophores. When excess chromophores over a predetermined amount are incorporated into a polymeric material, aggregation occurs due to chromophore-chromophore electrostatic interactions, thereby resulting in a low nonlinearity and optical scattering loss due to micro domain. Recent studies evidently show that these problems can be eliminated by using dendrimers (Appl. Phys. Lett. 2000, 77(24), 3881-3883).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Basically, the development of highly nonlinear materials needs highly nonlinear dye molecules. According to recent research results, a nonlinear molecule needs a structure capable of partial electron polarization and a large dipolar moment to provide a large nonlinearity. It is advantageous that the nonlinear molecule has strong electron donor and electron acceptor end groups. In addition, the nonlinear molecule should be extended by conjugated double or triple bonds to allow the electrons, i.e., the π-electrons, present between the end groups to move freely. It has been also founded that the nonlinearity effect is increased when such conjugated linkages are stably present on the same plane. Some materials with extended π-linkages to increase their nonlinearity have been reported. As the number of π-linkages increases, the visible light absorption region of the material where electron transition absorption occurs is gradually shifted to a long-wavelength region. This directly affects on the optical loss by absorption, thereby limiting its use as an optical device material (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 472-473; Chem. Mater. 1999, 11, 1966-1968). As an example, a wavelength converter or an optical amplifier is often used as a light source of a wavelength of about 600-800 nm. Thus, it is necessary to develop materials that are transparent in this wavelength range for the optical communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Meanwhile, the nonlinearity is directly proportional to the chromophore density in a unit volume. As described above, a high chromophore density over a predetermined range results in a reduced nonlinearly. Therefore, there is a need to increase the chromophore density in a polymeric material without this adverse effect.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0038">The synthesis path of a first embodiment of an organic dye molecular material according to the present invention is illustrated in Scheme (1) as follows. In Scheme (1), reactions to couple an organic chromophore D using benzene derivative are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">In Scheme (1), the organic dye molecular material includes the organic chromophore D reacting with and coupled to the 3- and 5-phenolic hydroxyl (—OH) groups of the benzene ring. In forming this structure, an aliphatic hydroxyl group is introduced to allow easy incorporation of the organic chromophore D into the polymer. In particular, an aliphatic alcohol compound (I) is first synthesized using dihydroxybenzoic acid by esterification, a compound (III) having the alcoholic hydroxyl group selectively protected as the acetate group is synthesized via two reaction steps, and an ether-bonded compound (IV) is synthesized using triphenylphosphine (PPh<sub>3</sub>) and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) known by the Mitsunobu reaction. Then, the protected hydroxyl group is recovered by deprotection reaction to afford a compound (V).</p>

The organic chromophore D incorporated into the optical polymeric compound having the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is AIDC having the structure (A-2) of formula (3), where R and R′ are CH<sub>3</sub>, X<sub>2 </sub>is CN, and n=2. As described above, an organic dye molecular material of formula (1) above was synthesized from the organic chromophore D having the structure (A-2) and coupled to a polyimide main chain to give an optical polymer compound (PEI-DAIDC). Then, this optical polymer compound was used to form the sample of Example 7.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">For comparison in the optical characteristic determination, a control sample was formed in the same manner as in Example 7 except that an optical polymeric compound (PEI-AIDC) synthesized by coupling the organic chromophore having the structure (A-2) to a polyimide main chain, as described with reference to Scheme (3), was used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">For the sample of Example 7 according to the present invention and the control sample, a variety of polymeric compounds were synthesized by varying the amount of the organic chromophore D being incorporated into each polymeric compound, and the EO coefficients of the polymeric compounds were measured for variations in organic chromophore content. As a result, the EO coefficient was obviously increased with increased amount of the organic chromophore D. In comparing the polymeric compounds PEI-AIDC (control sample) and PEI-DAIDC (present invention), PEI-DAIDC exhibits better nonlinearity than PEI-AIDC at the same organic chromophore contents. It is obvious from this result that the structure of the organic dye molecular material according to the present invention advantageously affects the optical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">The organic dye molecular material according to the present invention is derived from the coupling of existing organic chromophores to benzene or carbazole derivatives. Also, the optical polymeric compound according to the present invention includes polyimide repeating units to which the organic dye molecular material according to the present invention is coupled. In the structure of the optical polymeric compound according to the present invention, the organic dye molecular material is chemically stably coupled to the polymer main chain. Therefore, the molecular aggregation caused by electrostatic interactions between dye molecules does not occur at high dye densities, which meets the optical material requirements. In addition, the drawback of dendrimers can be improved by substitution of dendrimer-structured molecules into polymers. By adjusting the number of side chains as the organic dye molecular material according to the present invention, physical properties of the resulting optical polymeric compound can be varied so that devices with desired properties can be easily manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">In the optical polymeric compound according to the present invention, a variety of dye molecules, which are well known in the art, are arranged to be spatially efficient to give a high nonlinearity. The optical polymeric compound according to the present invention can absorb a short wavelength of light without having a long π-electron covalent bond length and thus it exhibits a higher nonlinearity than the conventional optical polymeric compound with directly dye-substituted side chains, at similar dye contents. The structure of the organic dye molecular material according to the present invention is advantageous for optical characteristic improvements.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">By adjusting the hydrocarbon chain length of the organic dye molecular material being coupled into an optical polymeric compound according to the present invention, the glass transition temperature of the optical polymeric compound that is an important consideration in the manufacture of optical devices can be controlled. The optical polymeric compound according to the present invention is suitable for use in the manufacture of an easy-to-manufacture device with excellent physical and chemical stabilities as well as nonlinear optical effects.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
