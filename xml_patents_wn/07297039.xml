<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus having an image forming means and a spacer in an envelope, the spacer maintaining a space in the envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Two types of electron emitting elements are known, a hot cathode element and a cold cathode element. As the cold cathode element, a surface conduction type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as a surface conduction type emitting element), a field emission type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as FE type element), a metal/insulating layer/metal type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as MIM type element) or the like are known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The surface conduction type emitting element is described, for example, in “Radio Eng. Electron Phys.” by M. I. Elinson, 10, 1290, (1965) and other examples to be later described are known.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The surface conduction type emitting element utilizes the phenomenon that electrons are emitted when current is flowed through a thin film having a small area formed on a substrate in parallel to the film surface. Surface conduction type emitting elements heretofore reported include an element using an SnO<sub>2 </sub>thin film by Elinson or others, an element using an Au thin film (“Thin Solid Films” by G. Dittmer, 9, 317 (1972), an element using an In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SnO<sub>2 </sub>thin film (“IEEE Trans. ED Conf.”, by M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, 519 (1975)), an element using a carbon thin film (“Vacuum”, by Hisashi ARAKI, et. al., Vol. 26, No. 1, 22 (1983)), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A typical example of the structure of a surface conduction type emitting element proposed by M. Hartwell is shown in the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, reference numeral <b>3001</b> represents a substrate, and reference numeral <b>3004</b> represents a conductive thin film made of sputtered metal oxide. The conductive thin film <b>3004</b> is of an H-character shape. The conductive thin film <b>2004</b> is subject to an electric energization process called an electric energization forming process to be described later, to thereby form an electron emission area <b>3005</b>. A distance L is 0.5 to 1 mm, and a width W is 0.1 mm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, although the electron emission area <b>3005</b> is schematically shown as a rectangle at the center of the conductive thin film <b>3004</b> for the purpose of simplicity, this does not reflect the actual shape and position of the electron emission area, with high fidelity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electron emission area <b>3005</b> of the element proposed by M. Hartwell or other elements described above are generally formed by making the conductive thin film <b>3004</b> be subject to an electric energization process called an electric energization forming process in order to allow electrons to emit. With the electric energization, a constant d.c. voltage or a d.c. voltage rising at a very slow rate, e.g., at 1 V/min, is applied across opposite ends of the conductive film <b>3004</b> to locally destroy, deform or decompose the conductive thin film <b>3004</b> and form the electron emission area having an electrically high resistance. Cracks are formed in the conductive thin film <b>3004</b> locally destroyed, deformed or decomposed. If a proper voltage is applied to the conductive thin film <b>3004</b> after this electric energization, electrons are emitted from an area near the cracks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the FE type element, those elements are known which are described, for example, in “Field emission”, Advance in Electron Physics, by W. P. Dyke and W. W. Dolan, 8, 89 (1956) or in “Physical properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones”, J. Appl. Phys. by C. A. Spindt, 47, 5248 (1976).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A typical example of the structure of an FE type element proposed by C. A. Spindt is shown in the cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, reference numeral <b>3010</b> represents a substrate, reference numeral <b>3011</b> represents an emitter layer made of conductive material, reference numeral <b>3012</b> represents an emitter cone, reference numeral <b>3013</b> represents an insulating layer, and reference numeral <b>3014</b> represents a gate electrode <b>3014</b>. Electrons are emitted from the tip of the emitter cone <b>3012</b> of this element through an electric field emission by applying a proper voltage between the emitter cone <b>3012</b> and gate electrode <b>3014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Instead of the lamination structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the FE type element having a different structure is also known in which an emitter and a gate electrode are formed on a substrate generally in parallel to the substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As an example of the MIM type element, an element described in “Operation of tunnel-emission Devices”, by C. A Mead, J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961) and other elements are known. A typical example of the structure of an MIM type element is shown in the cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, reference numeral <b>3020</b> represents a substrate, reference numeral <b>3021</b> represents a lower electrode made of metal, reference numeral <b>3022</b> represents a thin insulating layer of about 100 angstroms in thickness, and reference numeral <b>3023</b> represents an upper electrode made of metal and having a thickness of about 80 to 360 angstroms. Electrons are emitted from the surface of the upper electrode <b>3023</b> of the MIM type element by applying a proper voltage between the upper electrode <b>3023</b> and lower electrode <b>3021</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cold cathode elements described above can emit electrons at a temperature lower than the hot cathode element, and does not require a heater. Therefore, the structure is more simple than the hot cathode element and a fine element can be manufactured. Even if a number of elements are formed on a substrate at a high density, a problem of thermal melting of a substrate is not likely to occur. Although a response speed of a hot cathode element is low because of heating the heater, a response speed of a cold cathode element is high.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">From the above reasons, applications of cold cathode elements have been studied vigorously.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, since a surface conduction type emitting element among cold cathode elements is simple in structure and easy to manufacture, it has the advantage that a number of elements can be formed in a large area. As disclosed in JP-A-64-31332 by the same assignee as the present assignee, a method of driving a number of elements has been studied. As the applications of surface conduction type emitting elements, an image forming apparatus for an image display device, an image recording device, a charge beam source, and the like have been studied.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As the application to an image display apparatus, an image display apparatus utilizing a combination of surface conduction type emitting elements and a fluorescent member which emits light upon application of an electron beam, has been studied as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,883, JP-A-2-257551, JP-A-4-28137 by the same assignee as the present assignee. An image display apparatus utilizing a combination of surface conduction type emitting elements and a fluorescent member is expected to have more excellent characteristics than a conventional image display apparatus of other types. For example, as compared to a recently prevailing liquid crystal display apparatus, the image display apparatus of this type does not require back light because of self light emission and has a broad angle of view.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A method of driving a number of FE type elements is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,895 by the same assignee as the present assignee. An example of the application of FE type elements to an image display apparatus is a flat panel type display apparatus reported by R. Meyer in “Recent Development on Microtips Display st LETI”, Tech. Digest of 4th int. Vacuum Microelectronics Conf., Nagahama, pp. 6-9 (1991).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example of the application of a number of MIM type elements to an image-display apparatus is disclosed in JP-A-3-55738 by the same assignee as the present assignee.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Of image forming apparatuses utilizing the above-described electron emitting elements, a flat panel type display apparatus having a thin depth requires less space and is light in weight. Therefore, the flat panel type display apparatus has drawn attention as a substitute for a CRT type display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a perspective view showing an example of a display panel portion of a flat panel type image display apparatus. A portion of the panel is broken in order to shown the internal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, reference numeral <b>3115</b> represents a rear plate, reference numeral <b>3116</b> represents a side wall, and reference numeral <b>3117</b> represents a face plate. The rear plate <b>3115</b>, side wall <b>3116</b> and face plate <b>3117</b> constitute an envelope (air-tight envelope) which maintains the inside of the display panel vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A substrate <b>3111</b> is fixed to the rear plate <b>3115</b>. N×M cold cathode elements <b>3112</b> are formed on the substrate. N and M are positive integers of 2 or larger and are properly set in accordance with a target number of display pixels. The N×M cold cathode elements <b>3112</b> are wired as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> by M row direction wiring lines <b>3113</b> and N column direction wiring lines <b>3114</b>. A structure made of the substrate <b>3111</b>, cold cathode elements <b>3112</b>, row direction wiring lines <b>3113</b>, and column direction wiring lines <b>3114</b> is called a multi electron beam source. At each cross area of the row direction wiring line <b>3113</b> and column direction wiring line <b>3114</b>, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed between the lines to provide electrical insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A fluorescent film <b>3118</b> made of fluorescent material is formed on the bottom surface of the face place <b>3117</b>. The fluorescent materials of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors of three primary colors are divisionally coated to form the fluorescent film <b>3118</b>. Black color material (not shown) is coated between the color fluorescent materials of the fluorescent film <b>3118</b>. A metal back <b>3119</b> made of Al or the like is formed on the fluorescent film <b>3110</b> on the side of the rear plate <b>3115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm, Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn, and Hv are electrical connection terminals of an air-tight structure for electrically connecting the display panel to an unrepresented electric circuit. Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm are electrically connected to the row direction wiring lines <b>3113</b> of the multi electron beam source, Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn are electrically connected to the column direction wiring lines <b>3114</b> of the multi electron beam source, and Hv is electrically connected to the metal back <b>3119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The inside of the air-tight envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr. As the display area of the image display apparatus becomes large, a pressure difference between the inside of the air-tight envelope and the outside thereof becomes large. It is therefore necessary to provide means for preventing the rear plate <b>3115</b> and face plate <b>3117</b> from being deformed or destroyed. If the rear plate <b>3115</b> and face plate <b>3117</b> are made thick, not only the weight of the image display apparatus increases, but also an image distortion increases when viewed obliquely and a parallax may occur. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, structural support members (called a spacer or rib) <b>3120</b> made of relatively thin glass plates are mounted in order to be resistant to the atmospheric pressure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The invention provides a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus having an envelope made of members inclusive of a first substrate and a second substrate disposed at a space being set therebetween, and image forming means disposed in the envelope, the method comprising the steps of: forming spacers to be disposed in the envelope to maintain the space and disposing the spacers in the envelope. The spacer of this invention may be either an insulating spacer or a conductive spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The image forming apparatus of this invention may include a liquid crystal display panel, a plasma display panel, an electron beam display panel and the like. These image forming apparatus each have in its envelope the image forming means and the spacers for maintaining the space in the envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, the image forming means of an electron beam display panel may include electron emitting elements and an image forming member for forming image when electrons are applied from the electron emitting elements. The image forming member may include an acceleration electrode for accelerating electrons and a fluorescent member which emits light when electrons are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The envelope of an electron beam display panel may be made of first and second substrates disposed at the space being set therebetween, the first substrate being formed with electron emitting elements and the second substrate being formed with the image forming member.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to a first aspect of a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape, and then these spacers are disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the base spacer member is not abutted upon the first or second substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted upon the first or second substrate. The cut surface of the spacer base member is likely to form cracks and broken pieces. Therefore, it is effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function that the non-cut surface is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface is used as an abut surface. It is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to a second aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, similar to the first aspect, a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape. In this case, in the second aspect, a groove is formed in advance at the cut position of the spacer base member, and the spacer base member is cut along this groove to form the spacer having the desired shape. This groove may be formed intermittently or continuously along the cut position. It is however preferable as will be later described that the groove is formed continuously in order to reduce cracks and broken pieces on the cut surface as many as possible. Next, in the second aspect, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. Since the groove is formed in advance in the spacer base member and this member is cut along the groove, cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible. It is therefore more effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function that the cut surface with the groove is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface without the groove is used as an abut surface. Also in this aspect, it is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Further in this aspect, it is more effective, from the viewpoint of that cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible, that the groove is formed on both surfaces of the spacer base member along the cut position if the spacer base member is of a plate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The spacer to be disposed in the envelope of the image forming apparatus of this invention may be formed with a conductive film on the surface thereof as will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, a conductive film <b>206</b> is formed on opposite end portions of a spacer <b>203</b> near at the abut portions of the spacer <b>203</b> upon first and second substrates <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> constituting the envelope. The conductive film <b>206</b> may be formed on the end portion of the spacer <b>203</b> on the side of either the first substrate <b>201</b> or second substrate <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The conductive film <b>206</b> defines the potential at the end portion of the spacer <b>203</b> and applied with a predetermined potential. For example, the conductive film <b>206</b> on the side of the first substrate <b>201</b> is electrically connected to a wiring electrode of the electron emitting elements on the first substrate, whereas the conductive film <b>206</b> on the side of the second substrate <b>202</b> is electrically connected to the acceleration electrode on the second substrate <b>202</b>. The conductive films disposed on the opposite end portions of the spacer can therefore stabilize the trajectory of electrons emitted from the electron emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, a conductive film <b>207</b> is formed on the surface of a spacer <b>204</b>. This conductive film <b>207</b> is preferably a relatively high resistance film as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">This conductive film <b>207</b> is electrically connected to a conductor on a first substrate <b>201</b> and to a conductor on a second substrate <b>202</b>. For example; the conductive film <b>207</b> on the side of the first substrate <b>201</b> is electrically connected to the electron emitting elements on the first substrate <b>201</b>, whereas the conductive film <b>207</b> on the side of the second substrate <b>202</b> is electrically connected to the acceleration electrode on the second substrate <b>202</b>. The conductive film <b>207</b> therefore allows the surface of the spacer <b>204</b> to flow a small current to thereby remove charges accumulated on the spacer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>, a conductive film <b>207</b> is formed on the surface of a spacer <b>205</b> and another conductive film <b>206</b> is formed on the opposite end portions of the spacer <b>205</b>. The conductive film <b>206</b> has the function similar to that of the conductive film shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, and the conductive film <b>207</b> has the function similar to that of the conductive film shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref> and has a resistance higher than that of the conductive film <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The spacer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref> has the advantages that charges accumulated on the spacer surface are removed and that the trajectory of electrons emitted from the electron emitting element can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The following methods of the invention are used when a spacer with a conductive film formed thereon is disposed in the envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to a third aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, a conductive film is formed on the surfaces of a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope. Thereafter, the spacer base member with the conductive film is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape. The work efficiency can therefore be improved more than the case wherein the conductive film is formed after the spacer base member is cut. Next, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is not abutted on the first or second substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted on the first or second substrate. As described earlier, this is because of an effectiveness from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function. Furthermore, since the conductive film is likely to be peeled off from the spacer base member, the electrical connection of the conductive film can be improved if the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted on the first or second substrate rather than the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. It is more preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to a fourth aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, similar to the second aspect, a groove is formed in advance at the cut position of a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope. In this aspect, the conductive film is formed at least on this groove. Thereafter, the spacer base member is cut along the groove to form a spacer having a desired shape. This groove may be formed intermittently or continuously along the cut position. It is however preferable as will be later described that the groove is formed continuously in order to reduce cracks and broken pieces on the cut surface as many as possible and suppress peel-off of the conductive film as much as possible. It is more preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Next, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. The groove is formed in advance in the spacer base member and the conductive film is formed at least on this groove, and thereafter, the spacer base member is cut along the groove. Therefore, cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible and peel-off of the conductive film can be suppressed as much as possible. It is therefore more effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function and the electrical connection of the conductive film that the cut surface with the groove is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface without the groove is used as an abut surface. Also in this aspect, it is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Further in this aspect, it is more effective, from the viewpoint of that cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible and that peel-off of the conductive film can be suppressed as much as possible, that the groove is formed on both surfaces of the spacer base member along the cut position if the spacer base member is of a plate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Also in this aspect, the groove is preferably formed to have a tapered shape. If the groove has the tapered shape, the contact area between the conductive film and the conductor on the substrate becomes large by a pressure imparted when the space is abutted upon the substrate. Therefore, the electrical connection can be improved. This tapered shape is particularly effective if an abut member itself of the spacer is made of flexible material at least at a producing step or if the spacer is abutted via flexible conductive member such as conductive adhesive at least at the producing step.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Of the first to fourth aspects described above, particularly the first and third aspects of the invention are preferable from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function, electrical connection and work efficiency, because the cut surface of the spacer is not abutted upon the substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted upon the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The image forming apparatus and its manufacture method will be described more specifically in the following with reference to preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a perspective view of a display panel of an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention, a portion of the panel being broken in order to show the internal structure thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, reference numeral <b>1015</b> represents a rear plate, reference numeral <b>1016</b> represents a side wall, and reference numeral <b>1017</b> represents a face plate. The rear plate <b>1015</b>, side wall <b>1016</b> and face plate <b>1017</b> constitute an air-tight envelope which maintains the inside of the display panel vacuum. In assembling the display panel, a connection area between respective components is required to be hermetically adhered in order to provide the connection area with sufficient strength and air-tightness. Such hermetical adhesion was achieved by coating the connection area with, for example, frit glass, and baking the glass in the atmospheric air or in a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes or longer at 400 to 500° C. A method of evacuating the inside of the air-tight envelope will be later described. The inside of the air-tight envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr. In order to prevent the air-tight envelope from being destroyed by the atmospheric pressed or unexpected impacts, spacers <b>1020</b> are used as an atmospheric pressure resistant structure.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A substrate <b>1011</b> is fixed to the rear plate <b>1015</b>. N×M cold cathode elements <b>1012</b> are formed on the substrate. N and M are positive integers of 2 or larger and are properly set in accordance with a target number of display pixels. If the display apparatus is used for a high definition TV, it is preferable to set N=300 and M=1000. The N×M cold cathode elements <b>1012</b> are wired in a simple matrix form by M row direction wiring lines <b>1013</b> and N column direction wiring lines <b>1014</b>. A structure made of the substrate <b>1011</b>, cold cathode elements <b>1012</b>, row direction wiring lines <b>1013</b>, and column direction wiring lines <b>1014</b> is called a multi electron beam source.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The material and shape of a cold cathode element of the multi electron beam source used by the image display apparatus, and its manufacture method, are not limited so long as an electron beam source has cold cathode elements wired in a simple matrix form. Therefore, cold cathode elements such as surface conduction type emitting elements, FE type elements, and MIM type elements may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, the structure of the multi electron beam source having surface conduction type elements (to be later describe) as cold cathode elements wired in a simple matrix form will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a plan view of a multi-electron beam source used by the display panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. On a substrate <b>1011</b>, surface conduction type emitting elements similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref> to be described later are disposed and wired in a simple matrix form by row direction wiring electrodes <b>1003</b> and column direction wiring electrodes <b>1004</b>. At each cross area of the row direction wiring electrode <b>1003</b> and column direction wiring electrode <b>1004</b>, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed between the electrodes to provide electrical insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a cross sectional view taken along line <b>21</b>-<b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The multi electron beam source having the above-described structure was manufactured by forming the row direction wiring electrodes <b>1003</b>, column direction wiring electrodes <b>1004</b>, electrode insulating layer (not shown), element electrodes and a conductive thin film of each surface conduction type emitting element, and thereafter supplying a power to each element via the row and column direction wiring electrodes <b>1003</b> and <b>1004</b> to perform an electric energization forming process (to be later described) and an electric energization activation process (to be later described).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this embodiment, although the substrate <b>1011</b> of the multi electron beam source is fixed to the rear plate <b>1015</b> of the air-tight envelope, if the substrate <b>1011</b> of the multi electron beam source has a sufficient strength, the substrate <b>1011</b> itself of the multi electron beam source may be used directly as the rear plate of the air[tight envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A fluorescent film <b>1018</b> made of fluorescent material is formed on the bottom surface of the face place <b>1017</b>. Since the apparatus of the embodiment is a color display apparatus, the fluorescent materials of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors of three primary colors are divisionally coated to form the fluorescent film <b>1018</b>. The fluorescent material of each color is coated, for example, in stripe shapes such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, and black color conductive material <b>1010</b> is coated between fluorescent material stripes. An object of the black color conductive material <b>1010</b> is to prevent a display color shift even if there is some displacement of a radiation position of an electron beam, to prevent external light reflection to thereby avoid a lower display contrast, to prevent charge-up of the fluorescent film to be caused by electron beams, and for other purposes. Although the black color conductive material <b>1010</b> has black lead as its main composition, other materials may also be used if the above-described objects can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The coating of fluorescent materials of three primary colors is not limited only to the stripe layout shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A metal back <b>1019</b> well known in the CRT technical field is formed on the fluorescent film <b>1018</b> on the side of the rear plate. An object of the metal back <b>1019</b> is to improve a light use efficiency by mirror-reflecting a portion of light emitted from the fluorescent film <b>1018</b>, to protect the fluorescent film <b>1018</b> from negative ion impacts, to use it as an electrode for applying an electron beam acceleration voltage, to use it as a conductive path of electrons which excited the fluorescent film <b>1018</b>, and for other purposes.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, reference numerals correspond to those used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. A spacer <b>1020</b> is a spacer formed by the method of the third embodiment to be described later. The spacer <b>1020</b> is made of an insulating member <b>1</b>, a first conductive film (hereinafter called a high resistance film) <b>11</b> and a second conductive film (hereinafter called a low resistance film or an intermediate layer) <b>21</b>. The high resistance film <b>11</b> is formed on the surface of the insulating member <b>1</b> in order to prevent charge accumulation. The low resistance film <b>21</b> has a resistance lower than the high resistance film <b>11</b>. The row resistance film <b>21</b> is formed on abut surfaces <b>3</b> on the inner side (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) of the face plate <b>1017</b> and the surface (such as row or column direction wiring lead <b>1013</b> or <b>1014</b>) of a substrate <b>1011</b> and on the upper and lower side surface <b>5</b> of the high resistance film <b>11</b>. Spacers are disposed as many as necessary for achieving the objects of spacer at a necessary pitch. Each spacer is fixed by adhesion members <b>1041</b> between the inside of the face plate and the surface of the substrate <b>1011</b>. The high resistance film <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the inner side (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) of the face plate <b>1017</b> and the surface (such as row or column direction wiring lead <b>1013</b> or <b>1014</b>) of the substrate <b>1011</b> via the low resistance film <b>21</b> and connection member <b>1041</b>. In this embodiment, the spacer <b>1020</b> is of a thin plate shape, and is disposed in parallel to the row direction wiring line <b>1013</b> and electrically connected to the wiring line <b>1013</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The spacer <b>1020</b> is required to provide an insulation resistant to a high voltage applied between the row and column direction wiring leads <b>1013</b> and <b>1014</b> on the substrate <b>1011</b> and the metal back <b>1019</b> on the bottom surface of the face plate <b>1017</b>, and also to provide a conductivity capable of preventing charge accumulation on the surface of the spacer <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The insulating member <b>1</b> of the spacer <b>1020</b> may be made of quartz glass, glass having a reduced amount of impurities such as Na, soda-lime glass, ceramic such as alumina. The insulating member <b>1</b> preferably has a thermal expansion coefficient nearly equal to that of the air-tight envelope and substrate <b>1011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Current flows in the high resistance film <b>11</b> of the spacer <b>1020</b>, the current having a value of an acceleration voltage Va applied to the high potential side face plate <b>1017</b> (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) divided by the resistance value Rs of the high resistance film <b>21</b> serving as a charge prevention film. The resistance value Rs of the spacer is therefore set to a proper value from the standpoint of charge prevention and consumption power. From the standpoint of charge prevention, the surface resistance R/□ is preferably set to 10<sup>12 </sup>Ω or smaller. In order to achieve the sufficient charge prevention effect, the surface resistance of 10<sup>11 </sup>Ω or smaller is more preferable. Although the lower limit of the surface resistance is dependent upon the spacer shape and a voltage applied across the spacer, it is preferably set to 10<sup>5 </sup>Ω or larger.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The thickness t of the charge prevention film formed on the insulating member <b>1</b> is preferably set in a range from 10 nm to 1 μm. A thin film of 10 nm or thinner is generally formed in an island shape and the resistance thereof is unstable and the reproductivity thereof is poor, although they depend on a surface energy of the material, tight contactness to the substrate, and a substrate temperature. If the film thickness is 1 μm or thicker, a film stress becomes large, a possibility of film peel-off becomes high, and the film forming time becomes long which results in poor productivity. It is therefore preferable to set the film thickness to 50 to 500 nm. The surface resistance R/□ is ρ/t. From the preferable range of R/□ and t described above, the specific resistance ρ is preferably set to 0.1 Ωcm to 10<sup>8 </sup>Ωcm. In order to realize a more preferable range of the surface resistance and film thickness, the specific resistance ρ is more preferably set to 10<sup>2 </sup>Ωcm to 10<sup>6 </sup>Ωcm.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The temperature of the spacer rises while current flows in the charge prevention film or while the display apparatus generates heat during its operation. If the resistance temperature coefficient of the charge prevention film is negative, the resistance value lowers as the temperature rises so that the current flowing in the spacer increases to further raise the temperature. The current increases until it exceeds the limit value. The resistance temperature coefficient allowing such current runaway has empirically a negative value whose absolute value is 1% or higher. It is therefore desired that the resistance temperature coefficient of the charge prevention film is smaller than −1%.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The material of the high resistance film <b>11</b> having the charge prevention performance may be metal oxide. Of the metal oxide, oxide of chrome, nickel or copper is preferable. The reason for this is that these oxides have a relatively small secondary electron emission efficiency and even if electrons emitted from the cold cathode element <b>1012</b> collide with the spacer <b>1020</b>, the spacer is hard to be charged. In addition to the metal oxide, carbon is a preferable material because of its small secondary electron emission efficiency. Amorphous carbon in particular has a high resistance value so that the resistance of the spacer is easy to be controlled to be set to a desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Other preferable materials of the high resistance film <b>11</b> having the charge prevention performance are nitride of aluminum and transition metal because a broad range of the resistance value from good conductor to insulator can be controlled by adjusting the component of transition metal. Other materials to be later described with reference to a process of manufacturing a display apparatus are also preferable because these materials have a small resistance change and are stable and also the resistance temperature coefficient is less than −1% and the materials can be used easily in practice. Such transition material may be Ti, Cr, Ta or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A nitride film is deposited on the insulating member by thin film forming methods such as sputtering, reactive sputtering in a nitrogen atmosphere, electron beam vapor deposition, ion plating, and ion assist vapor deposition. A metal oxide film may be formed by similar thin film forming methods. In this case, oxygen gas is used in place of nitrogen gas. The metal oxide film may be formed by CVD or alkoxide coating. A carbon film may be formed by vapor deposition, sputtering, CVD, or plasma CVD. If amorphous carbon is formed, an atmosphere containing hydrogen is used and hydrocarbon gas is used as a source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The low resistance films <b>21</b> of the spacer <b>1020</b> are provided in order to electrically connect the high resistance film <b>11</b> to the high potential side face plate (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) and to the low potential side substrate <b>1011</b> (such as wiring lead <b>1013</b>, <b>1014</b>). The low resistance film <b>21</b> is also called an intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) where applicable in the following description. The intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) provides a plurality of functions described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">(1) The Intermediate Films Electrically Connect the High Resistance Film <b>11</b> to the Face Plate <b>1017</b> and Substrate <b>1011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As already described, the high resistance film is provided in order to prevent the surface of the spacer <b>1020</b> from being charged. If the high resistance film <b>11</b> is connected directly or via the connection members <b>1041</b> to the face plate (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) and substrate <b>1011</b> (such as wiring lead <b>1013</b>, <b>1014</b>), a connection interface has a large contact resistance and charges accumulated on the spacer surface may become difficult to be removed quickly. In order to avoid this, the abut surface <b>3</b> and side surfaces <b>5</b> of the spacer <b>1020</b> in contact with the face plate <b>1017</b>, substrate <b>1011</b> and connection members <b>1041</b> are formed with the low resistance intermediate layers.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">(2) The Intermediate Films make Uniform a Potential Distribution of the High Resistance Film <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element <b>1012</b> form an electron trajectory which matches the potential distribution formed between the face plate <b>1017</b> and substrate <b>1011</b>. In order to prevent the electron trajectory from being disturbed near at the spacer <b>1020</b>, it is necessary to control the potential distribution of the high resistance film <b>11</b> in the whole area thereof. If the high resistance film <b>11</b> is connected directly or via the connection members <b>1041</b> to the face plate (such as metal back <b>1019</b>) and substrate <b>1011</b> (such as wiring lead <b>1013</b>, <b>1014</b>), the potential distribution is disturbed by the contact resistances at the connection interfaces so that the potential distribution of the high resistance film <b>11</b> may be displaced from the desired pattern. In order to avoid this, the spacer end portions (abut surface <b>3</b> and side surfaces <b>5</b>) in contact with the face plate <b>1017</b>, substrate <b>1011</b> and connection members <b>1041</b> are formed with the low resistance intermediate layers, and a desired potential is applied to the intermediate layers to thereby control the potential distribution of the whole of the high resistance film <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">(3) The Intermediate Films Control the Trajectory of an Emitted Electron Beam.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element <b>1012</b> form an electron trajectory matching the potential distribution formed between the face plate <b>1017</b> and substrate <b>1011</b>. Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element near at the spacer may limit the mount position of the spacer and so the positions of wiring lead and element may be required to be changed. In such a case, it is necessary to control the trajectory of emitted electrons and apply electrons to a desired position of the face plate <b>1017</b> in order to form an image without distortion and disturbance. By forming the low resistance intermediate layers on the upper and lower side surfaces <b>5</b> of the spacer in contact with the face plate <b>1017</b> and substrate <b>1011</b>, it is possible to have a desired potential distribution near the spacer <b>1020</b> and control the trajectory of emitted electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The low resistance film <b>21</b> is set to have a resistance value sufficiently lower than that of the high resistance film <b>11</b>. For example, 10<sup>5 </sup>Ωcm or lower is preferable, and 10<sup>3 </sup>Ωcm or smaller is more preferable. It is also preferable that the specific resistance is lower than by one digit than that of the high resistance film, or more preferably by two digits or larger. The material of the low resistance film <b>21</b> may be: metal such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Al, Cu and Pd; alloy thereof; printed conductor constituted of glass and metal or metal oxide such as Pd, Ag, Au, RuO<sub>2 </sub>and Pd—Ag; transparent conductor such as In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—SnO<sub>2</sub>; and semiconductor material such as poly-silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The connection member <b>1040</b> is preferably conductive in order to electrically connect the spacer <b>1020</b> to the row direction wiring lead <b>1013</b> and metal back <b>1019</b>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm, Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn, and Hv are electrical connection terminals of an air-tight structure for electrically connecting the display panel to an unrepresented electric circuit. Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm are electrically connected to the row direction wiring lines <b>1013</b> of the multi electron beam source, Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn are electrically connected to the column direction wiring lines <b>1014</b> of the multi electron beam source, and Hv is electrically connected to the metal back <b>1019</b> of the face plate.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The inside of the air-tight envelope is evacuated to a vacuum degree of about 10<sup>−7 </sup>Torr, by using unrepresented exhaust pipe and vacuum pump after the air-tight envelope is assembled. Thereafter, the exhaust pipe is sealed. In order to maintain the vacuum degree of the air-tight envelope, a getter film (not shown) is formed at a predetermined position of the inside of the air-tight envelope immediately before or after the exhaust pipe is sealed. The getter film is formed by heating getter material having Ba as its main component with a heater or through high frequency heating to vapor deposit it. The absorption function of the getter film maintains the inside of the air-tight envelope at a vacuum degree of 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>to 1×10<sup>−7 </sup>Torr.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As a voltage is applied to each cold cathode element <b>3112</b> via the terminals Ds<b>1</b> to Dxm and Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn of the image display apparatus using the above-described display panel, electrons are emitted from each cold cathode element <b>1012</b>. At the same time, a high voltage of several hundred V to several Kv is applied via the terminal Hv to the metal back <b>1019</b> to accelerate the emitted electrons and make them collide with the inner surface of the face plate <b>1017</b>. The fluorescent materials of each color constituting the fluorescent film <b>1018</b> emit light and an image can be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">If a surface conduction type emitting element is used as the cold cathode element <b>1012</b>, generally a voltage to be applied to the surface conduction type emitting element is about 12 to 16 V, a distance d between the metal back <b>1019</b> and cold cathode element <b>1012</b> is about 0.1 to 8 mm, and a voltage to be applied across the metal back <b>1019</b> and cold cathode element <b>1012</b> is about 0.1 Kv to 10 Kv.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The fundamental structure and manufacture method of the display panel and the outline of the image display apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention have been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, a method of manufacturing a multi electron beam source used by the embodiment display panel will be described. The material and shape of each cold cathode element and its manufacture method are not limited so long as the multi electron beam source to be used by the image display apparatus is an electron beam source wired by a simple matrix form. Therefore, other cold cathode elements such as surface conduction type emitting elements, FE type elements and MIM type elements may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Of these cold cathode elements, a surface conduction type emitting element is particularly suitable because the current situation requests for a display apparatus having a large display screen and being inexpensive. More specifically, the electron emission characteristics of an FE type element are greatly influenced by the relative position and shapes of the emitter cone and gate electrode. Therefore, manufacture techniques with very high precision are necessary, which is disadvantageous factors in realizing a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. An MIM type element is required to form thin and uniform insulating film and upper electrode, which is disadvantageous factors in realizing a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. In contrast, the surface conduction type emitting element requires a relatively simple manufacture method and is easy to realize a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. The present inventors have found that a surface conduction type emitting element having an electron emission area or its peripheral area made of a fine particle film has excellent electron emission characteristics and is easy to manufacture. Surface conduction type emitting elements are therefore most suitable for use as the multi electron beam source of an image display apparatus having a high luminance and a large display screen. The display panel of the embodiment uses surface conduction type emitting elements whose electron emission area and its nearby area are made of a fine particle film. The preferred fundamental structure and manufacture method of a surface conduction type emitting element will be first described and then the structure of a multi electron beam source having a number of elements wired in a simple matrix form will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The structures and manufacture methods of horizontal and vertical type conduction emitting elements have been described above. Next, the characteristics of an element used with a display apparatus will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows typical characteristics of (emission current Ie) relative to (element voltage Vf) and typical characteristics of (element current If) relative to (element voltage Vf) of an element used with a display apparatus. The emission current Ie is considerably smaller than the element current If and they are difficult to shown at the same scale. Therefore, these currents are shown at optional scales in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The element used with the display apparatus has the following three features of the emission current Ie.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">First, as a voltage higher than a certain voltage (called a threshold voltage Vth) is applied to the element, the emission current Ie increases abruptly, whereas as a voltage not higher than the threshold voltage Vth is applied, the emission current is hardly detected. Namely, the element is a non-linear element having a definite threshold voltage Vth relative to the emission current.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Second, since the emission current Ie changes with the voltage Vf applied to the element, the amount of the emission current Ie can be controlled by the element voltage Vf.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Third, a response speed of the emission current Ie to the element voltage Vf is fast. It is therefore possible to control the charge amount of electrons emitted from the element in accordance with the time duration while the voltage Vf is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Since a surface conduction type emitting element has the above-described features, it is possible to use it with the display apparatus. For example, in a display apparatus having a number of elements in correspondence with pixels of a display screen, an image can be displayed by sequentially scanning the display screen by utilizing the first feature. Namely, a proper voltage equal to or higher than the threshold voltage Vth corresponding to a desired pixel luminance is applied to the element to be driven, while a voltage not higher than the threshold voltage Vth is applied to elements not selected. By sequentially changing an element to be driven, it is possible to display an image by sequentially scanning the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">By utilizing the second or third feature, a pixel luminance can be controlled so that a gradation display of an image is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is a block diagram showing the outline structure of a drive circuit used for displaying an image by using a television signal of an NTSC system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, a display panel <b>1701</b> corresponds to the above-described display panel and is manufactured and operated in the manner described earlier. A scanner circuit <b>1702</b> scans display lines, and a control circuit <b>1703</b> generate a signal to be supplied to the scanner circuit <b>1702</b> and other signals. A shift register <b>1704</b> shifts data of one line, and a line memory <b>1705</b> supplies data of one line supplied from the shift register <b>1704</b> to a modulating signal generator <b>1707</b>. A sync signal separating circuit <b>1706</b> separates a sync signal from an NTSC signal.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The function of each element of the display apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> will be described in detail. The display panel <b>1701</b> is connected to an external electric circuit via terminals Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm, terminals Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn, and a high voltage terminal Hv. Of these terminals, the terminals Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm are applied with scan signals for sequentially driving a multi electron beam source of the display panel <b>1701</b>, i.e., cold cathode elements wired in a matrix form of m rows and n columns, one row (n elements) after another. The terminals Dy<b>1</b> and Dyn are applied with modulating signals for controlling an output electron beam of each of the n elements of one row selected by each scan signal. The high voltage terminal Hv is applied with a high d.c. voltage, for example, 5 Kv from a d.c. voltage source Va. This voltage is used as an acceleration voltage for supplying each electron beam output from the multi electron beam source with an energy sufficient for exciting the fluorescent materials.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Next, the scanner circuit <b>1702</b> will be described. This circuit <b>1702</b> has m switching elements (schematically shown as S<b>1</b> to Sm in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) each selecting either an output voltage from a d.c. voltage source Vx or 0 V (ground level) and supplying the selected voltage to each of the terminals Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm of the display panel <b>1701</b>. Each of the switching elements S<b>1</b> to Sm operates in response to a control signal Tscan output from the control circuit <b>1703</b> and can be realized easily by a combination of switching elements such as FET's. The d.c. voltage source Vx is designed based upon the characteristics of the cold cathode element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> so that it can output a constant voltage not higher than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth and supply it as a drive voltage to the non-selected elements.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The control circuit <b>1703</b> operates to match the operation timings of respective components in order to properly display an image in accordance with an image signal externally supplied. In accordance with a sync signal Tsync to be described later and supplied from the sync signal separating circuit <b>1706</b>, the control circuit <b>1703</b> generates various control signals including Tscan, Tsft and Tmry and supplies them to various components. The sync signal separating circuit <b>1706</b> is a circuit for separating an externally input NTSC television signal into sync signal components and luminance signal components. As well know, this circuit <b>1706</b> can be realized easily by using a frequency separating (filter) circuit. The sync signal separated by the sync signal separating circuit <b>1706</b> includes a vertical sync signal and a horizontal sync signal as well know in the art. For the simplicity of description, these sync signals are represented collectively by the Tsync signal. The luminance signal components separated from the television signal are collectively represented by a DATA signal also for the simplicity of description. The DATA signal is input to the shift resister <b>1704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The shift resister <b>1704</b> serial/parallel converts the image DATA signal of each line time sequentially and serially input, in response to the control signal Tsft supplied from the control circuit <b>1703</b>. This control signal Tsft functions, therefore, as a shift clock of the shift register <b>1704</b>. The image data of one line (drive data of n elements) serial/parallel converted is output from the shift register <b>1704</b> as n signals including Id<b>1</b> to Idn.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The line memory <b>1705</b> stores the image data Id<b>1</b> to Idn of one line for a necessary time in response to the control signal Tmry supplied from the control circuit <b>1703</b>. The stored data is output as I′d<b>1</b> to I′dn to the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The modulating signal generator <b>1707</b> is a signal source for properly modulating each of the cold cathode elements <b>1012</b> in accordance with the image data I′d<b>1</b> to I′dn. Each output signal from the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b> is applied to each of the cold cathode elements <b>1012</b> in the display panel <b>1701</b> via the terminals Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the surface conduction type emitting element has the following fundamental features regarding the emission current Ie. A definite threshold voltage Vth (8 V for a surface conduction type emitting element of embodiments to be later described) is rightly associated with electron emission, and if only a voltage equal to or higher than the threshold voltage Vth is applied, electron emission occurs. The emission current Ie changes with a voltage equal to or higher than the threshold voltage Vth, as shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. Therefore, if a pulse voltage not higher than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth is applied to a surface conduction type emitting element, electron emission will not occur, whereas if a voltage equal to or higher than the electron emission threshold voltage Vth is applied, an electron beam is output from the surface conduction type emitting element. The intensity of the output electron beam can be controlled by changing the pulse voltage peak Vm. By changing the pulse width Pw, the total amount of charges of an output electron beam can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As a method of modulating a surface conduction type emitting element in accordance with an input signal, a voltage modulating method, a pulse width modulating method and the like can be adopted. In the case of the voltage modulating method, as the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b>, a voltage modulating type circuit can be used which generates a voltage pulse having a constant pulse width and changes the pulse peak value in accordance with input data. In the case of the pulse width modulating method, as the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b>, a pulse width modulating type circuit can be used which generates a voltage pulse having a constant peak value and changes the width of the voltage pulse in accordance with input data.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The shift register <b>1704</b> and line memory <b>1705</b> may be of either a digital signal type or an analog signal type, if serial/parallel conversion of an image signal and image signal storage can be performs at a predetermined speed.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">If the digital signal type is used, it is necessary to convert an output signal. DATA from the sync signal separating circuit <b>1706</b> into digital signals. This can be made by using an A/D converter provided at an output stage of the sync signal separating circuit <b>176</b>. The circuit structure of the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b> slightly changes with whether an output signal of the line memory <b>1705</b> is digital or analog. More specifically, if a digital signal is used for voltage modulation, for example, a D/A converter is used as the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b> and if necessary an amplifier circuit is added. If a digital signal is used for pulse width modulation, for example, as the modulating signal generator <b>1701</b>, a combination of a high speed oscillator, a counter for counting a wave number of an output of the oscillator and a comparator for comparing an output of the counter with an output of the line memory is used. If necessary, an amplifier circuit is used for amplifying a pulse width modulated signal output from the comparator to a level of a drive voltage necessary for the cold cathode element.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">If an analog signal is used for voltage modulation, as the modulating signal generator <b>1707</b>, for example, an amplifier circuit using an operational amplifier can be adopted, and if necessary a shift level circuit is added. If an analog signal is used for pulse width modulation, for example, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) can be adopted, and if necessary an amplifier circuit is added which amplifies an voltage output from VCO to a level of a drive voltage necessary for the cold cathode element.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In an image display apparatus having the above-described structure and being applicable to the invention, electron emission occurs when a voltage is applied to each cold cathode element via the external terminals Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm and Dy<b>1</b> to Dyn.

In this embodiment, the spacer base member <b>22</b> was formed through glass rod heating/drawing as in the following manner. A glass rod was heated to change it in a semi-melted state. In this state, this glass rod was drawn from a slit. The formed spacer member <b>22</b> had a thickness of 0.3 mm and a length of about 500 mm. The width of the spacer base member <b>22</b> was 4 mm (which is equal to a distance between an electron source substrate and the metal back of the face plate of the display panel), and soda-lime glass was used.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Next, on both sides of the spacer base member <b>22</b>, high resistance films <b>12</b> were formed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">In place of the Ti target used in the first embodiment, a Cr target was used.

<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Next, the intermediate layers <b>13</b> were formed on the spacer base member <b>22</b> formed with the high resistance layers <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Thereafter, a face plate <b>1017</b> having a fluorescent film <b>1018</b> and metal back <b>1019</b> on the inner side thereof was disposed on a side wall <b>1016</b>, 5 mm above the substrate <b>1011</b>.

<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The air-tight envelope completed in the above manner was evacuated by a vacuum pump via an exhaust pipe (not shown) to a sufficient vacuum degree.

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Next, the unrepresented exhaust pipe was heated with a gas burner at the vacuum degree of about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr and melted to hermetically seal the air-tight envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Lastly, a getter process was executed to maintain the vacuum degree after the hermetical sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Scan signals and modulating signals from an unrepresented signal generator means were applied via the external terminals Dx<b>1</b> to Dxm and Dy<b>1</b> to byn to each cold cathode element (surface conduction type emitting element) <b>1012</b> of the image forming apparatus using the display panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 5</figref> and completed in the above-described manner. A high voltage was also applied via the high voltage terminal Hv to the metal back <b>1019</b> to accelerate an emitted electron beam, make electrons collide with the fluorescent film <b>1018</b>, excite the fluorescent material <b>21</b><i>a </i>of each color (R, G, B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>), and emit light to form an image. The voltage Va applied to the high voltage terminal Hv was set to 3 to 10 Kv, and the voltage Vf applied across the wiring electrodes <b>1013</b> and <b>1014</b> was set to 14 V. Light emission spots, including those formed by emission electrons from the cold cathode element <b>1012</b> near the spacer <b>1020</b>, were formed at a two-dimensionally equal pitch, and an image with clear and good color reproductivity was able to be formed. This means that the intermediate layers <b>13</b> of the spacer <b>1020</b> were electrically connected in a good state to the metal bask <b>1019</b> and wiring electrodes <b>1013</b> so that even if the spacers <b>1020</b> were disposed as in this embodiment, disturbance of an electric field which affects the electron trajectory was not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In this embodiment, high resistance films and intermediate layers can be formed by using a large base material before it is cut into each spacer.

Even during the evacuation and sealing processes for the air-tight envelope, the spacers . . . were not bent or broken and the sufficient space maintaining function as spacers was provided.

<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In this embodiment, although the spacer <b>1012</b> is abutted upon the row direction wiring electrode <b>1013</b> by using the frit glass <b>1041</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the frit glass <b>1041</b> may be used on the side of the metal back <b>1019</b> and the spacer <b>1012</b> is made in contact with the frit grass <b>1041</b> whereas the spacer <b>1012</b> is directly abutted upon the row direction wiring electrode <b>1013</b>. Also in this case, the above-described advantages of the embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Also in this embodiment, as described above, solution which contains conductive substances such as Ag-containing paste is developed on a substrate. An end portion of the spacer is immersed in this solution to transfer the solution to the spacer base member. After this transfer, the spacer base material is heated to form the intermediate layer. Not only in this embodiment, but also in other embodiments, such an intermediate layer forming method is effective in that the intermediate layer is hard to be peeled off at the boundary between the bottom and side surface of the spacer base member, i.e., at the edge of the spacer base member.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Further, according to the present embodiment, the base member formed by the heating/drawing is further subjected to the above transfer and heating, thereby forming the intermediate layer. While, without being limited the above embodiment, another method for forming the intermediate layer by means of a combination of the transfer and the heating/drawing may be further advantageous method in the following reason, that is, in general, the base member produced by the heating/drawing has edge sections with curved surface at upper and lower contact sections of the spacer due to the heating process. Accordingly, in case of using the above transfer in forming the intermediate layer, since the transfer liquid is transferred uniformly to the base member desirably rather than the base member of which sectional shape has a right angled corner, the intermediate layer can be formed more precisely. Also, simultaneously, the spacer can be supplied in a good yielding ratio.</p>

The spacer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> corresponds to the cross section taken along line <b>12</b>-<b>12</b> of the spacer base member shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the groove <b>102</b> is formed in a partial area of the spacer base member <b>101</b>. Therefore, a taper portion is formed in the spacer base member to improve the connection between the intermediate layer <b>85</b> and conductive connection area <b>86</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Also in this embodiment, defective connections to be formed at the base cut portion in rare occasions can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The spacer of this embodiment was formed in the following manner. The spacer base member <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> was formed by molding an alumina member with a metal mold having projections corresponding to the grooves <b>102</b> and thereafter by baking the alumina member. In this embodiment, the size of the spacer base member was 55 mm×70 mm, the thickness was 0.3 mm, and the depth of the groove was 50 μm. The groove <b>102</b> was formed on both sides of the spacer base member <b>101</b> along the cut portion <b>103</b>. With similar methods to those of the first embodiment, the high resistance film and intermediate layer <b>85</b> were formed sequentially. Thereafter, similar to the first embodiment, the spacer base member <b>101</b> was cut with a dicing saw along the cut portion <b>103</b> to form a plurality of spacers each having a size of 50 mm×6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Also in this embodiment, high resistance films and intermediate layers can be formed by using a large base material before it is cut into each spacer. Therefore, manufacture setting work efficiency was improved, a spacer forming time was shortened, and manufacture yield was improved. With this embodiment, connection between the intermediate layer <b>85</b> and conductive connection area <b>86</b> can be established at the groove as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Therefore, defective connections are hard to be formed and the manufacture yield can be improved further.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Spacers of this embodiment were used with an image forming apparatus similar to that used with the second and third embodiments. However, in this embodiment, the abut surfaces of the spacer upon the face plate substrate <b>81</b> and electron source substrate <b>82</b> were the cut surfaces. The image forming apparatus of this embodiment has a sufficient atmospheric pressure resistant structure and a sufficient space maintaining function of the spacer. A good color image can be displayed which means good electrical connections at both the metal back of the face plate and the wiring electrode of the electron source substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In this embodiment, the tapered portion formed by the projection of the metal mold is formed partially in the spacer. The tapered portion may be formed over the whole length of the spacer, with similar expected advantages. The taper portion may be formed either on the side of the face plate or on the side of the electron source substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">In this embodiment, although the groove is formed by the metal mold, the groove may be formed by a sand blaster method by which abrasive is blown toward the spacer base member to partially remove the spacer base member, or by a method by which the spacer base member is partially removed by laser.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">This embodiment features in that a cut groove is formed in the spacer base member in advance. This embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> which shows a spacer base member of this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, reference numeral <b>111</b> represents a spacer base member, reference numeral <b>112</b> represents a tapered groove, reference numeral <b>132</b> represents a cut portion, and reference numeral <b>125</b> represents an intermediate layer.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">In this embodiment, first, a spacer base member <b>111</b> is formed by a sheet forming method. In this case, a doctor blade having triangular projections was used to form a plurality of tapered grooves along one direction of the spacer base member <b>111</b>. The size of the spacer base member was 80 mm square, the thickness thereof was 0.2 mm, the depth of the groove was 50 μm, and the groove width was about 50 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Next, a high resistance film was formed on both sides of the spacer base member <b>111</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the intermediate layer <b>125</b> was formed in each groove <b>112</b>. Thereafter, the spacer base member <b>112</b> was cut off by applying a force thereto along the cut portion <b>132</b> to form a plurality of spacers.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">In this embodiment, the groove for cutting off the space base member is formed by using the doctor blade. Instead, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a plurality of through holes or via holes may be formed along the cut portion by using carbondioxide gas laser to cut off the spacer base member.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The groove may be formed on both sides of the spacer base member instead of one side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Spacers of this embodiment were used with an image forming apparatus similar to that used with the second and third embodiments. However, in this embodiment, the abut surfaces of the spacer upon the face plate substrate <b>81</b> and electron source substrate <b>82</b> were the cut surfaces. The image forming apparatus of this embodiment has a sufficient atmospheric pressure resistant structure and a sufficient space maintaining function. A good color image can be displayed which means good electrical connections at both the metal bask of the face plate and the wiring electrode of the electron source substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In this embodiment, the tapered groove for cutting off the spacer base member provides the reliable electrical connection between the upper and lower intermediate layers and conductive connection areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As another embodiment, the case wherein the first embodiment method is applied to the structure having an intermediate layer only on one side of the spacer, will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the structure of this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, reference numeral <b>121</b> represents a face plate substrate, reference numeral <b>122</b> represents an electron source substrate, reference numeral <b>123</b> represents a spacer, reference numeral <b>125</b> represents an intermediate layer, reference numeral <b>126</b> represents a conductive connection area, and a reference numeral <b>127</b> represents a wiring electrode on the electron source substrate. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the intermediate layer <b>125</b> is formed on only one side of the spacer base member. The intermediate layer <b>125</b> is electrically connected to the wiring electrode <b>127</b> on the electron source substrate via the conductive connection area <b>126</b>. The spacer <b>123</b> is maintained fixed by the conductive connection area <b>126</b> on the side of the electron source substrate <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the spacer base member of this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reference numeral <b>13</b> represents a spacer base member, and reference numeral <b>132</b> represents a line along which the groove <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is formed, this line corresponding to the cut portion for the spacer base member. Reference numeral <b>133</b> represents an intermediate layer.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Also with this structure, similar advantages described earlier can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The invention is also applicable to cold cathode electron emission elements different from surface conduction type emitting elements. For example, the invention is applicable to a field effect emission type element having a pair of electrodes formed in parallel with a substrate surface of an electron source, as described in JP-A-63-274047 assigned to the same assignee as the present assignee.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The invention is also applicable to am image forming apparatus using an electron source of the type different from a simple matrix form. For example, the spacer or space maintaining member such as described above is used between an electron source and a control electrode of an image forming apparatus which selects each surface conduction type emitting element by using the control electrode, as described in JP-A-2-257551.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">According to the concept of this invention, the invention is applied not only to an image forming apparatus suitable for image display but also to an image forming apparatus which is used for the light emission source such as light emitting elements of an optical printer constituted of a photosensitive drum and the light emitting diodes. In the latter case, by properly selecting M×N row and column direction wiring electrodes, the image forming apparatus can be used not only as a line light emission source but also as a two-dimensional light emission source.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">According to the concept of this invention, the invention is also applicable to the case wherein a member to which electrons are radiated from an electron source is a member other than an image forming member, e.g., an electron microscope. Therefore, the image forming apparatus of this invention may be used as an electron beam generator which does not limit a member to which electrons are radiated.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of a multi function display apparatus capable of displaying image information supplied from various image information sources such as television broadcasting, on a display panel using surface conduction type emitting elements described above as an electron beam source.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, reference numeral <b>2100</b> represents a display panel, reference numeral <b>2101</b> represents a drive circuit for driving the display panel, reference numeral <b>2102</b> represents a display controller, reference numeral <b>2103</b> represents a multiplexer, reference numeral <b>2104</b> represents a decoder, reference numeral <b>2105</b> represents an input/output interface circuit, reference numeral <b>2106</b> represents a CPU, reference numeral <b>2107</b> represents an image producing circuit, reference numerals <b>2108</b>, <b>2109</b> and <b>2100</b> represent an image memory interface circuit, reference numeral <b>2111</b> represents an image input interface circuit, reference numerals <b>2112</b> and <b>2113</b> represent a TV signal receiving circuit, and reference numeral <b>2114</b> represents an input section.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">If this display apparatus receives a signal containing both visual information and audio information, such as a television signal, it is obvious that both visual and audio information are reproduced at the same time. The description of circuits used for reception, separation, reproduction, processing, storage and the like of audio information and a speaker are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The function of each component will be described in the order of an image signal flow.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The TV signal receiving circuit <b>2113</b> is a circuit for receiving a TV image signal transmitted via a wireless transmission system such as radio wave communications and optical communications. The type of a TV signal to be received is not limited. For example, various TV signals may be used such as NTSC signals, PAL signals, and SECAM signals. TV signals having scan lines larger than NTSC, PAL and SECAM (such as high definition TV signals including MUSE signals) may also be used which are suitable for positively utilizing the advantages of the display panel suitable for a large display screen and a large number of pixels. A TV signal received at the TV signal receiving circuit <b>2113</b> is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The TV signal receiving circuit <b>2112</b> is a circuit for receiving a TV image signal transmitted via a wired transmission system such as coaxial cables and optical fibers. Similar to the TV signal receiving circuit <b>2113</b>, the type of TV signal is not limited to a particular type, and the TV signal received by this circuit <b>2112</b> is also supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The image input interface circuit <b>2111</b> is a circuit for fetching an image signal supplied from an image input device such as a TV camera and an image scanner. The fetched image signal is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The image memory interface circuit <b>2110</b> is a circuit for fetching an image signal stored in a video tape recorder (hereinafter abbreviated as VTR). The fetched image signal is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The image memory interface circuit <b>2109</b> is a circuit for fetching an image signal stored in a video disk. The fetched image signal is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">The image memory interface circuit <b>2108</b> is a circuit for fetching an image signal stored in a device storing still image data such as a so-called still image disk. The fetched image signal is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> is a circuit for connecting the display apparatus to an external computer, a computer network, or an output device such as a printer. The input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> usually transfers image data and character/graphics data, and in some cases transfers control signals and numerical data between CPU <b>2106</b> of the display apparatus and an external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The image producing circuit <b>2107</b> generates display image data in accordance with image data and character/graphics data externally input from the input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> and image data and character/graphics data output from CPU <b>2106</b>. This image producing circuit <b>2207</b> is assembled with circuits necessary for image production, such as a rewritable memory for storing image data and character/graphics data, a ROM for storing image patterns corresponding to character codes, and a processor for image processing.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Display image data generated by this image producing circuit <b>2107</b> is supplied to the decoder <b>2104</b>. In some cases, the display image data may be supplied via the input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> to an external computer network and a printer.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">CPU <b>2106</b> mainly performs an operation control of the display apparatus, generation, selection and edition of display images.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">For example, CPU <b>2106</b> outputs a control signal to the multiplexer <b>2103</b> to select or combine image signals to be displayed on the display panel. In this case, CPU <b>22105</b> supplies a control signal to the display panel controller <b>2102</b> in accordance with an image signal to be displayed, to thereby control the operation of the display panel regarding a screen display frequency, a scan method (such as interlace or non-interlace), and the number of scan lines of one field.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">CPU <b>2106</b> also controls to directly output image data and character/graphics data to the image producing circuit <b>2107</b>, and to access via the input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> to fetch image data and character/graphics data. CPU <b>210</b> may also help other tasks. For example, CPU <b>210</b> may directly operate to use the function of generating and processing data, similar to a personal computer and a word processor.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Alternatively, CPU <b>210</b> may connect an external computer network via the input/output interface circuit <b>2105</b> to perform a task, for example, arithmetic calculation, together with an external apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The input section <b>2114</b> is used for an operator to enter a command, a program, or data to CPU <b>2106</b>. The input section <b>2114</b> may use various input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, a joy stick, a bar code reader, and a voice recognition device.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">The decoder <b>2104</b> decodes various image signals input from the circuits <b>2107</b> to <b>2113</b> into three primary colors, or a combination of a luminance signal, an I signal and a Q signal. It is preferable that the decoder <b>2104</b> has therein an image memory indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. This is because it is necessary to process TV signals such as MUSE signals which require an image memory when these signals are decoded. In addition, provision of the image memory facilitates a display of a still image. Alternatively, it becomes easy to perform image processing such as image thinning, interpolation, enlargement, reduction, and synthesis, in addition to image edition, in cooperation with the image production circuit <b>2107</b> and CPU <b>2106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">The multiplexer <b>2103</b> selects desired images in accordance with a control signal supplied from CPU <b>2106</b>. Namely, the multiplexer <b>2103</b> selects desired image signals from the decoded image signals input from the decoder <b>2104</b> and outputs the selected image signals to the drive circuit <b>2101</b>. In this case, if selected image signals are changed during one frame display times different images can be displayed in divided areas of the screen, similar to a so-called multi screen television.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">The display panel controller <b>2101</b> controls the operation of the drive circuit <b>2101</b> in accordance with a control signal supplied from CPU <b>2106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The display panel controller <b>2101</b> also supplies the drive circuit <b>2101</b> with a signal for controlling the fundamental operation of the display panel, for example, the operation sequence of a drive power source (not shown) of the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The display panel controller <b>2101</b> also supplies the drive circuit <b>2101</b> with a signal for controlling the drive operation of the display panel, for example, a screen display frequency and a scan method (interlace or non-interlace).</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">In some cases, the display panel controller <b>2101</b> also supplies the drive circuit <b>2101</b> with a signal for controlling the image quality, for example, a display image luminance and contrast, color tone, and sharpness.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The drive circuit <b>2101</b> generates a drive signal to be applied to the display panel <b>2100</b>, and operates in accordance with the image signal input from the multiplexer <b>2103</b> and a control signal input from the display panel controller <b>2102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The function of each component has been described above. With the display apparatus constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, image information input from various image information sources can be displayed on the display panel <b>2100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">More specifically, after various image signals including television signals are decoded by the decoder <b>2104</b>, desired image signals are selected by the multiplexer <b>2103</b> and input to the drive circuit <b>2101</b>. In the meantime, the display controller <b>2102</b> generates a control signal for controlling the operation of the drive circuit <b>2101</b>, in accordance with the image signals to be displayed. The drive circuit <b>2101</b> applies drive signals to the display panel in accordance with the image signals and control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In this manner, an image is displayed on the display panel. A series of these operations is controlled collectively by CPU <b>2106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">With a cooperative operation by the image memory in the decoder <b>2104</b>, image producing circuit <b>2107</b> and CPU <b>2100</b>, the display apparatus can display image information selected from a plurality piece of image information, and also perform other operations such as image processing and image editing. The image processing includes image enlargement, reduction, rotation, motion, edge emphasis, thinning, interpolation, color conversion and image aspect conversion. The image editing includes image synthesis, erase, coupling, replacement and superposition. Although not particularly described in this embodiment, a dedicated circuit for audio processing and editing may be used similar to image processing and editing.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The display apparatus can therefore provide singularly all functions of a television display apparatus, a television conference terminal equipment, a business terminal equipment such as a word processor, and a game machine. The application range of this display apparatus is very broad covering both industrial and commercial application fields.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> shows only illustratively an example of the structure of the display apparatus using a display panel with an electron beam source made of surface conduction type emitting elements. Obviously, the invention is not limited only thereto. For example, of the constituent elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, circuits providing the functions not necessary for the specific application field may be omitted. Conversely, constituent elements may be added in accordance with a specific application field. For example, if this display apparatus is to be used as a video telephone, proper constituent elements are added, such as a television camera, a microphone, an illuminator, a transceiver including a modem.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The display panel of this display apparatus, particularly the display panel using surface conduction type emitting elements as an electron beam source, can be made compact and thin. Therefore, the depth of the display apparatus can be made shallow. Moreover, the display panel using surface conduction type emitting elements is easy to have a large screen area, a high luminance, and excellent characteristics of field of view. It is therefore possible for the display apparatus to display an image rich in scene appearance and excitements with good visualization.</p>
