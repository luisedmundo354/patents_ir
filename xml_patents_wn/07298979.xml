<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a solely usable image recording apparatus, and an image forming apparatus that can read images as well as can make recording upon coupling to optional image reader apparatus with the image recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Digital image processing today allows reading and recording images separately, and coupling of an image reader apparatus and an image recording apparatus, usable individually, allows using a photocopier or the like capable of reading and recording images.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an image forming apparatus exists which coupling an image reader apparatus <b>11</b>A (hereinafter referred to as “reader apparatus”) with an image recording apparatus <b>111</b>A (hereinafter referred to as “printer apparatus”).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the image forming apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an original document automatic feeding apparatus <b>40</b>A feeds an original document on an original document glass <b>201</b>A when a copying button is pushed, and an exposing apparatus <b>202</b>A radiates the original document and moves in arrow a direction to scan the entire side of the original document.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Light beam radiating the original document from the exposing apparatus is reflected at second and third mirrors <b>203</b>A and converges on a CCD <b>204</b>A by lens. The original document read by the CCD <b>204</b>A is sent to a laser scanner <b>100</b>A upon conversion to an electrical signal at the image processing section. An image recording optical system scans beam corresponding to image information radiated from the laser scanner <b>100</b>A to converge images on a photosensitive drum <b>101</b>A to produce an electrostatic latent image. The electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing device <b>102</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recording sheets are set in a feeding cassette <b>1</b>A and contained in the apparatus body. When the feeding cassette <b>1</b>A is set with the body, a sheet surface in the feeding cassette <b>1</b>A is lifted by a lifting motor, not shown, to render the sheets ready to be fed. The recording sheets start to be moved according to rotation of a feeding roller <b>2</b>A, are separated sheet by sheet with separation roller pair <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, and are conveyed to the registration roller pair <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>A via upstream side conveyance roller pair <b>5</b>A. <b>6</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The recording sheets whose registration, or position, is corrected by the registration roller pair <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>A are further conveyed to a transfer section, and the images previously developed by the developing device <b>102</b>A are transferred with the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>A and a transfer roller <b>103</b>A on a recording sheet. Recording sheets to which the images are thus transferred are removed from the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>A by a separation charger.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Then, a fixing device <b>11</b>A fixes the images on the recording sheets via a conveyance section and delivers the sheets with a delivery roller <b>12</b>A, thereby finishing a photocopier operation on one side in which the copied images come to the back side.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A coupling method for the conventional reader apparatus <b>110</b>A and the conventional printer apparatus <b>111</b>A, for such a photocopying image forming apparatus, is described in referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A)</figref> shows a printer apparatus <b>111</b>A for rendering transferring, recording, and delivering of the images, and a delivery section <b>112</b>A is placed to a top surface thereof to deliver the recording sheets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(B)</figref> shows a reader apparatus <b>110</b>A for reading the images to be copied; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(C)</figref> shows a rack apparatus serving as a frame for holding the reader apparatus <b>11</b>A when the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(A)</figref> shows a photocopying image forming apparatus <b>114</b>A to which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A are coupled via the rack apparatus <b>113</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(B)</figref> shows a wire connection of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A of the photocopying image forming apparatus <b>114</b>A; a printer controller <b>115</b>A for electrically controlling the printer apparatus body installed in the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A and a reader controller <b>116</b>A for controlling the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A communicate to each other through a communication cable <b>117</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A power is supplied to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A via a power supply cable <b>119</b>A from a power supply unit <b>118</b>A for supplying power for the printer apparatus body installed in the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is to be noted that with the conventional example, a control panel <b>120</b>A of the photocopying image forming apparatus is attached to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A, and no control panel <b>120</b>A is attached to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A, thereby forming the photocopying image forming apparatus <b>114</b>A, as a premise, upon coupling the reader apparatus <b>110</b>A to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A. Therefore, the printer apparatus <b>111</b>A itself does not have any control panel and does not function as a printer apparatus <b>111</b>A solely.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is to be noted that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, if a control panel <b>120</b>B is provided on a side of the printer apparatus <b>11</b>B, the apparatus can operate as the printer apparatus <b>111</b>B solely.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With the conventional structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the reader apparatuses <b>111</b>A, <b>110</b>B cannot be supported without the rack apparatuses <b>113</b>A, <b>113</b>B. The rack apparatuses <b>113</b>A, <b>113</b>B hold the reader apparatuses <b>111</b>A, <b>110</b>B, and are formed with high strength because needing to guarantee durability against exertion of downward force of 10 kg or more when the user manipulates the reader apparatuses <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B. The rack apparatus <b>113</b>A, <b>113</b>B are very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, where a control panel <b>120</b>B is arranged to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>B, the user cannot manipulate easily the photocopying image forming apparatus when the apparatus is manipulated only by this control panel <b>120</b>B because the level (arrow a<b>1</b>) of the unit is low.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">First, providing the control panel <b>120</b>A even to the side of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>B may be a solution but increases the costs of the apparatus. Second, lifting a level of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>B as to render the control panel <b>120</b>B easily controlled is another solution, but this narrows the delivery section <b>112</b>B, thereby making the user difficult to pick up the sheets. The high level of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>B generates problems such that the copied original documents are not easily placed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is an object of the invention to provide an image forming apparatus in which an image reader can be attached directly to a printer apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is another object of the invention to provide an image forming apparatus in which delivered sheets can be pulled out between an optionally provided image reader and a printer apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is yet another object of the invention to provide an image forming apparatus including a printer apparatus having a sheet delivery portion at a top thereof; and a frame arranged at a top surface of the printer apparatus as to extend in substantially a letter L-shape to a rear side and one lateral side of the printer apparatus, wherein an image reader is optionally attached to the top surface of the frame, and wherein a sheet can be pulled out of both of a front side and another lateral side at which no frame is provided.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to the drawings, an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention is described.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Whole Apparatus Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the whole structure of a photocopying image forming apparatus <b>114</b>C in which an image reading apparatus <b>110</b>C (hereinafter referred to as “reader apparatus”) and an image recording apparatus <b>111</b>C (hereinafter referred to as “printer apparatus”) are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is to be noted that the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C can be used solely, and functions as an image forming apparatus serving as a photocopier or facsimile machine capable of reading or recording images upon coupling a reader apparatus <b>110</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The basic structure of image reading and image recording is substantially the same as the structure of the prior art. That is, an original document automatic feeding apparatus <b>40</b>C feeds an original document on an original document glass <b>201</b>C when a copying button is pushed, and an exposing apparatus <b>202</b>C radiates the original document and moves in arrow a direction to scan the entire side of the original document.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Light beam radiating the original document from the exposing apparatus is reflected at second and third mirrors <b>203</b>C and converges on a CCD <b>204</b>C by lens. The original document read by the CCD <b>204</b>C is sent to a laser scanner <b>100</b>C upon conversion to an electrical signal at the image processing section. An image recording optical system scans beam corresponding to image information radiated from the laser scanner <b>100</b>C to converge images on a photosensitive drum <b>101</b>C to produce an electrostatic latent image. The electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing device <b>102</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Recording sheets are set in a feeding cassette IC and contained in the apparatus body. When the feeding cassette IC is set with the body, a sheet surface in the feeding cassette IC is lifted by a lifting motor, not shown, to render the sheets ready to be fed. The recording sheets start to be moved according to rotation of a feeding roller <b>2</b>C, are separated sheet by sheet with separation roller pair <b>3</b>C, <b>4</b>C, and are conveyed to the registration roller pair <b>7</b>C, <b>8</b>C via upstream side conveyance roller pair <b>5</b>C. <b>6</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The recording sheets whose registration, or position, is corrected by the registration roller pair <b>7</b>C, <b>8</b>C are further conveyed to a transfer section, and the images previously developed by the developing device <b>102</b>C are transferred with the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>C and a transfer roller <b>103</b>C on a recording sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Recording sheets to which the images are thus transferred are removed from the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>C by a separation charger. Then, a fixing device <b>11</b>C fixes the images on the recording sheets via a conveyance section <b>10</b>C and delivers the sheets with any of a first delivery roller <b>12</b>C, a second delivery roller <b>13</b>C, and a third delivery roller <b>14</b>C, thereby finishing a photocopier operation on one side.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Coupling Structure of the Reader Apparatus and the Printer Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Subsequently, a coupling method of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> is a perspective illustration showing the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C of the embodiment. It is to be noted that arrow b direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> is a direction toward the apparatus front; the proximal end of arrow b is a front side of the apparatus; and the distal end of arrow b is a rear aide of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The printer apparatus <b>111</b>C has a structure that the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is directly placed to a top of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C, requiring no rack apparatus unlike the prior art, so that the costs for the apparatus becomes inexpensive. The printer apparatus <b>111</b>C therefore has a housing or frame for supporting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C at the top of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C; side walls <b>121</b>C, <b>122</b>C (hatching regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>) of two directions other than the front side extend upward (arrow c direction) so as to open a delivery portion <b>112</b>C when viewed from a front side of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C (arrow b direction); a holding portion <b>123</b>C couples the two side walls <b>121</b>C, <b>122</b>C as to connect the two walls. The reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is to be mounted on the top surface of the holding portion <b>123</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A control panel <b>120</b>C for instructing the apparatus manipulations is secured to an upper portion of the side wall <b>122</b>C for mounting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and is arranged at a location where the users can control easily.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is to be noted that the side wall serving as a holding portion for the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C can be placed at a region <b>151</b>C (hatching region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>) opposing to the delivery section <b>150</b>C in arrow E direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>. If the side wall is provided at this region, however, the delivered recording sheets are difficult to be pulled out by the users, so that it is desirable to place the side wall <b>122</b> at the portion of the delivery means as described above whereas the side wall <b>121</b>C is placed on the rear side of the apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If a side wall is arranged at the region <b>151</b>C opposing to the delivery section <b>150</b>C in arrow E direction, a side wall <b>129</b>D having an opening <b>130</b>D (hatching region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is desirably arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so as to allow the users to pull out the recording sheets from arrow F direction, and in such a situation, the side walls are constituted of three faces (<b>121</b>D, <b>122</b>D, <b>129</b>D).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">[Housing Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A housing structure of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C to which the reader apparatus can be mounted is described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref> shows the housing of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C. A front frame <b>124</b>C and a rear frame <b>125</b>C of the body extend upwardly (arrow C direction), and a holding frame <b>126</b>C is secured to a top surface of the body as to connect the front frame <b>124</b> and the rear frame <b>125</b>C. That is, the hosing for holding the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is structured of a body frame of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is to be noted that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, a top cover <b>127</b>C is secured to a top surface of the holding frame <b>126</b>C so as to constitute a top outer portion of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C. Numeral <b>128</b>C is a holding surface on which the reader apparatus is mounted. In this structure, the surfaces <b>128</b>C are provided at three locations, and those can raise the accuracy of the level direction (arrow C direction) where the surfaces are provided at or more locations.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is to be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref> shows cross section d-d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref> as a cross section of the holding surface <b>128</b>C. The holding surface <b>128</b>C of the top cover <b>127</b>C is made higher than the other surface <b>129</b>C, and with the top cover <b>127</b>C, the level at which the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is mounted becomes highly accurate only by rendering accurate the size in the level direction (arrow C direction) of the holding surface <b>128</b>C (three locations in this embodiment), so that the position in the level direction of the reader apparatus is guaranteed. It is to be noted that the levels of the holding surfaces <b>128</b>C at three locations become substantially the same in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Substantially the same advantages can be obtained even without the holding frame <b>126</b>C, if the front frame <b>124</b>C and the rear frame <b>125</b>C support the holding surfaces <b>128</b>C for guaranteeing the level of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">[Coupling of the Printer Apparatus and the Reader Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the steps for coupling the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C are described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>, two blinding portion <b>131</b>C located on a rear side of the control panel <b>120</b>C secured to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C are cut out by a nipper or the like. It is to be noted that although in this embodiment the blinding portions <b>131</b>C are provided, such a blinding portion may not be provided, and if no blinding portion is placed, the process at the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> is unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>, front fixing member <b>132</b>C for the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are attached at two locations by screws <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(C)</figref>, the rear holding member <b>134</b>C for the reader apparatus is secured to the holding member <b>123</b>C at two locations by screws <b>135</b>C from the rear side of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(D)</figref>, the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is moved in arrow G direction, and position alignment holes <b>136</b>C formed at the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are inserted into the front fixing member <b>132</b>C for the reader apparatus. The reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are thus aligned in arrow H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> directions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, the screws <b>137</b>C for securing the optical apparatus in the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are disengaged (at three locations).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, a connector for power supply of an original document automatic feeding apparatus <b>40</b>C, and fixing screws <b>140</b>C for a rear cover <b>139</b>C of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are disengaged, and the rear cover <b>139</b>C is detached.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(C)</figref>, <b>6</b>(D), a rear fixing member <b>141</b>C for the reader apparatus is secured to the rear holding member <b>134</b>C for the reader apparatus by screws <b>142</b>C. This makes grounded a holding member <b>143</b>C of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and the rear holding member <b>134</b>C for the reader apparatus and aligned the reader apparatus <b>110</b> in arrow J, K directions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, by coupling the front fixing member <b>132</b>C for the reader apparatus described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(D)</figref> with the rear fixing member <b>141</b>C for the reader apparatus described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(C)</figref>, (D), the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C can be positionally restricted in all directions of arrows H, J, K shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(E)</figref>. This refrains the users from touching the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C from moving even when an earthquake occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, the communication cable <b>117</b>C for the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is connected, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, a power supply cable <b>119</b>C is connected for supplying electrical power to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C from the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A cable for a heater preventing the moisture from condensing on the reader apparatus incorporated in the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C may be connected when necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, by assembling the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C, coupling of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C and the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is completed with a preparation against earthquake. It is to be noted that the steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(A)</figref>, <b>7</b>(B) are completed if the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are placed on the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">[Layout of Cable and Delivery Means]</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the layout of respective cables and delivery means is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is for a layout in which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is placed with the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref> is a front perspective view; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref> is an illustration viewed from the rear side. The communication cable <b>117</b>C and the power supply cable <b>119</b>C are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref> is an illustration of the image forming apparatus viewed from the front side; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref> is an illustration of the image forming apparatus viewed from the rear side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, the side wall <b>122</b>C is disposed over a first delivering means <b>145</b>C, and utilizing this space, a second delivering means <b>146</b>C and a third delivering means <b>147</b>C can be arranged above the first delivering means <b>145</b>C. This layout allows the first to third delivering means to serve as multiple delivery outlets in matching to use of the users such as the delivery outlets special for, e.g., photocopier, printer, and facsimile machine.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, since the side wall <b>122</b>C for mounting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is arranged over the first delivering means <b>145</b>C, the optional delivering means <b>146</b>C, <b>147</b>C can be placed and can improve the usability.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref>, the side wall <b>121</b>C for mounting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C extends upward on the rear side of the printer apparatus. This structure allows electrical controlling members such as a printer controller <b>115</b>C for electrically controlling the printer apparatus mechanism incorporated in the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and a DC controller <b>149</b>C for controlling a hard disc drive <b>148</b>C and respective drive sources, thereby utilizing advantageously the space on a rear side of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The electrically controlling members (the printer controller <b>115</b>C, the hard disc drive <b>148</b>C, and DC controller <b>149</b>C) can be arranged near the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C, so that the communication cable <b>117</b>C for coupling the printer controller <b>115</b>C with the reader controller <b>116</b>C, and the power supply cable <b>119</b>C from the printer apparatus power unit <b>118</b>C to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are shortened, and so that an effect is obtainable against electromagnetic noises. Thus, by providing the layout for the electrically controlling members (the printer controller <b>115</b>C, the hard disc drive <b>148</b>C, and the DC controller <b>149</b>C) from an extension of the mounting region on the rear side of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C, the depth L of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can be reduced, thereby rendering the size of the entire apparatus compact.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[Controlling Panel]</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The controlling panel <b>120</b>C for instructing the apparatus manipulations is formed at the housing for mounting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C, is secured on a front side of the apparatus body over the side wall <b>122</b>C as described above, and is disposed at a position allowing the users to manipulate easily the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The controlling panel <b>120</b>C is structured for a common controlling panel used for the printer apparatus and for the photocopying image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment described above, the housing for holding the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C on the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is provided to make unnecessary a separated arrangement of the rack apparatus for mounting the reader apparatus like in the prior art, so that the apparatus can be formed with greatly decreased costs.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Because the sheet delivery portion of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is located at a lower portion of the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C when the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is coupled to the top of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C, and because the side walls <b>121</b>C, <b>122</b>C serving as holding portions for holding the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are formed at two sides other than the front side of the apparatus body, the recorded sheets can be pulled out from the front side at an upper portion of the image forming apparatus, so that the sheets can be pulled out easily. The reader apparatus is accurately arranged by placing at the same level all of the holding surfaces placed at three or more locations for mounting the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, the optional delivering means and the electrical controlling means can be arranged in the housing, so that the delivering means can be formed with good extensionality, so that the electrostatic noises can be reduced, and so that the entire apparatus body can be made compact as the mounting space is extended.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The arrangement of the common controlling panel <b>120</b>C on a front side of the housing allows the controlling panel <b>120</b>C to be placed at the level that the users can easily manipulate the panel <b>120</b>C and renders unnecessary formation of respective controlling panels to the printer apparatus and the reader apparatus where the apparatus is extended from the mere printer apparatus <b>111</b>C to the photocopying image forming apparatus to which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are coupled, so that the controlling panel can be placed at the most appropriate location as reducing the part numbers.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">[Second Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, as a second embodiment, an example in which a display screen of the controlling panel is switched between a case where the apparatus above described is solely used as a printer apparatus and a case where the apparatus is used as a photocopying image forming apparatus coupling the printer apparatus and the reader apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is to be noted that the printer apparatus, the reader apparatus, and the coupled structure of those are the same as structures in the first embodiment described above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The common controlling panel <b>120</b>C is provided for a situation where the apparatus is used as the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and for a situation where the apparatus is used as the photocopying image forming apparatus, and has various manipulation monitor screens.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Upon connection via the communication cable <b>117</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> between the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C, the apparatus body recognizes switching to the photocopying image forming apparatus to which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C are coupled. The screen is switched, upon turning on and off of the power switch, from a display screen of the controlling panel for the printer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref> to a display screen of the controlling panel for photocopying image forming apparatus at which photocopying, printing, and faxing are selectable as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With the display screen of the controlling panel for the printer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref>, there is no indication of photocopying and faxing, and as electrical information, the screen shows information such as “BOX” as a holder for accumulating respective sources of information by the users stored in the electrical memory or other information accumulating apparatus in the printer apparatus body as well as information of the printer apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">On the other hand, with display screen of the controlling panel for photocopying image forming apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref>, indicated are photocopy, facsimile, print (box), and extension (network information), and where the reader apparatus and facsimile machine is added to the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C, this apparatus becomes the photocopying image forming apparatus in a multi-form of photocopier, facsimile machine, and printer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is to be noted that although in this embodiment the distinction between the using state for the printer apparatus and the using state for the photocopying image forming apparatus depends on whether the communication cable <b>117</b>C is connected or disconnected, other structures may be possible such that the distinction is made depending on whether a cable for coupling when the reader apparatus is grounded is connected or disconnected, that the distinction is made depending on a switch provided for the printer apparatus or the reader apparatus, and that the distinction is made depending on an occurrence of downloading or memory replacement when the reader apparatus is grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, the screen of the display portion of the common controlling panel is automatically switched depending on the situations where the apparatus is used solely as the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and where the apparatus is used as the photocopying image forming apparatus in which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is coupled to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C, thereby improving the usability.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is to be noted that the structure that the controlling panel for controlling the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and the controlling panel for controlling the photocopying image forming apparatus are made common and that the display screen of the controlling panel when the apparatus is used solely as the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C and when the apparatus is used as the photocopying image forming apparatus in which the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C is coupled to the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C, is automatically switched, is advantageous not only for a situation where the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is arranged on the housing of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C as described above but also for a distinction made at a glance to the screen of the controlling panel as to whether the apparatus is usable solely for the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C or for the photocopying image forming apparatus even though the apparatus is useable as a photocopying image forming apparatus coupling the reader apparatus with the printer apparatus where the reader apparatus <b>110</b>C is arranged on a lateral side of the printer apparatus <b>111</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">This invention, as described above, enhances the layout space of respective apparatuses constituting the image forming apparatus without needing any separate rack or the like but with lower costs, upon the arrangement of the reader apparatus to the housing of the printer apparatus where the image forming apparatus of an intra-machine delivery type is constituted from coupling of the reader apparatus and the printer apparatus, and enables the best layout of the respective parts.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Descriptions of the embodiments of the invention are as the above, but the invention is not limited to those embodiments, and various modifications can be made within a scope of technological conception of the invention.</p>
