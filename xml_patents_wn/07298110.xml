<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates generally to a motor control system and method and, more particularly, to an integrated motor monitoring system for a work machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Today's work machines are employed in a number of machines used in industries such as manufacturing, mining, construction, and/or agriculture. These work machines generate a large amount of energy for performing a variety of tasks. Most work machines include a power source such as, for example, a diesel engine, a gasoline engine, a natural gas engine, or another appropriate power source that provides energy to complete a task. In certain work machines, the-power source is coupled to a motor that drives one or more mechanical devices that may perform a particular function associated with the power system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, these motors are operated under peak loading conditions for extended periods of time and, often, in extremely harsh environments. While these motors may be capable of operating under demanding conditions, the strain of continuous operation at peak loading can lead to damage to various components of the motor. For example, a sustained overload condition, if not properly monitored and/or controlled, may cause overheating of the conductive windings of the motor that could lead to permanent conductor damage and/or failure of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These motors may be protected from potential damage by monitoring and regulating the operation of the motor. One system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,178 issued to Dumbeck (hereinafter referred to as “the '178 patent”) on Mar. 18, 1980, has been developed to monitor the load on a motor by measuring the shaft rotation of the motor and wirelessly transmitting the monitored data over the power windings of the motor by inducing an RF signal onto the power windings. The system of the '178 patent includes a detector and slip analysis circuit mounted within the motor housing, a modulator, and transmitter mounted within the motor housing that impress a modulated motor load signal of radio frequency onto the line that supplies power to the motor. A receiver outside the motor receives the modulated signal, and a demodulator transforms the received signal to produce the motor load signal. The system of the '178 patent also includes a corrective means to correct the motor load signal for variations caused by power line voltage fluctuations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the system of the '178 patent may be capable of monitoring the operation of the motor over the power lines, this system may be unreliable. For example, because the monitoring system relies on current induction and indirect coupling methods for data transfer to wirelessly transmit data, as opposed to using direct electrical connections, the RF signals transferred over the power lines may be susceptible to electromagnetic interference, both internal and external to the motor. This interference may corrupt the monitored data, potentially resulting in unreadable or erroneous motor data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the system of the '178 patent does not provide a continuous electrical connection capable of providing power to operate the motor. For example, because an induction method is used to wirelessly transfer the RF signals over the motor power windings, the system of the '178 patent is limited to output powers less than 100 milliwatts, which may be too low to energize the field windings of the motor enough to provide mechanical motion of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, because the system of the '178 patent does not provide a direct electrical connection to the motor, additional wiring harnesses and control systems are still required to operate the motor, which could substantially increase the manufacturing and production costs of the motor. Moreover, the inclusion of power wiring within the motor housing increases the risk of noise for the RF data monitoring link, which may result in further degradation of the RF signal quality and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The presently disclosed integrated motor monitoring system and method are directed toward overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect, the present disclosure is directed toward an integrated motor monitoring system. The integrated motor monitoring system may include a housing and a motor disposed within the housing, the motor being configured to provide a power output. The integrated motor monitoring system may also include at least one monitoring device communicatively coupled to the motor and configured to monitor an operational aspect of the motor and generate a data signal associated with the operational aspect. The integrated motor monitoring system may further include a controller, disposed within the housing and in communication with the at least one monitoring device, and configured to energize a plurality of field conductors of the motor and receive the data signal from the at least one monitoring device over at least one of the plurality of field conductors.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Controller <b>16</b> may be operatively coupled to electronic control unit <b>12</b> and configured to communicate data information over power wire <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Controller <b>16</b> may be selectively coupled to field conductors <b>21</b> and configured to receive data signals from monitoring devices <b>17</b>.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Monitoring devices <b>17</b> may be communicatively coupled to controller <b>16</b> and may be configured to provide data information over a common information bus.

Alternatively and/or additionally, monitoring devices <b>17</b> may be continuously coupled to field conductors <b>21</b> using low frequency blocking circuitry or other isolation circuitry to prevent short circuiting of field conductors or otherwise interfering with normal motor commutation sequence or operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One or more sensor switches <b>26</b> may electrically couple monitoring devices <b>17</b> to field conductors <b>21</b> of motor <b>16</b> to provide a selective data flow path of data information to controller <b>16</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, sensor switches <b>26</b> may be operated to electrically couple monitoring devices <b>17</b> to field conductors <b>21</b>.

Furthermore, although sensor switches <b>26</b> are illustrated as self-actuating switches (e.g., MOSFET or IGBT switches based on current flowing in field conductors <b>21</b>), they may be mechanically controlled switches coupled to controller <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Switches <b>28</b> may include various components for providing selective current flow paths between power source <b>11</b> and motor <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Switches <b>28</b> may be operatively coupled to controller <b>16</b> and may be configured to operate (e.g., open and close) based on control signals received from controller <b>16</b>. For example, switches <b>28</b> may be collectively commanded by controller <b>16</b> to operate in a particular sequence.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Switches <b>28</b> may be coupled to power source <b>11</b> and may be configured to provide a selective current flow path to field conductors <b>21</b> of motor <b>15</b>.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The disclosed integrated motor monitoring system may be applicable to any system where an integrated, compact, and reliable motor control system may be advantageous. More specifically, the disclosed integrated electric control system may provide an integrated monitoring and control system for a motor for providing data monitoring signals over power wiring. The operation of integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in flowchart <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, operation of integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> is initiated when a power signal is applied to motor <b>15</b> (Step <b>51</b>) by controller <b>16</b>. Controller <b>16</b> may receive a power signal from power source <b>11</b> and energize field conductors <b>21</b> of motor <b>15</b>. For example, one or more switches <b>28</b> associated with controller <b>16</b> may be sequentially operated to selectively provide power signals in the form of current flow through one or more field conductors <b>21</b>. The sequencing of operation of switches <b>28</b> provides different current flow through each of field conductors <b>21</b>, generating a varying electromagnetic field. This varying electromagnetic field acts upon rotor <b>19</b> to generate angular velocity to provide torque output. The sequencing of the operation of switches <b>28</b> may be precisely coordinated by controller <b>16</b> in order to provide maximum operational control of the operational characteristics of motor <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Upon start-up of motor <b>15</b>, the current supplied to the field conductors over transmission lines <b>32</b> may be monitored (Step <b>52</b>). A current monitoring device may be associated with each field conductor to measure the current in each of field conductors <b>21</b>. For example, controller <b>16</b> may include an ammeter (not shown) electrically coupled to transmission lines <b>32</b> to monitor the current through each of transmission lines <b>32</b>. Because switches <b>28</b> may be configured to selectively enable current flow through each of the field conductors <b>21</b>, the instantaneous current on each of the field conductors <b>21</b> may be substantially different. Current data may be provided to controller <b>16</b> and monitored by CPU <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each current monitoring device may continuously monitor the current in a field conductor until the current in one or more field conductors <b>21</b> is substantially negligible, which may be pre-designated as an “off” state (Step <b>53</b>). Controller <b>16</b> may receive data associated with the current levels of each of field conductors <b>21</b> and may determine if the current is below a predetermined threshold, based on historical and/or predetermined specification data associated with motor <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the monitored current of one or more field conductors <b>21</b> drops below the predetermined threshold amount, a query may be sent to one or more monitoring devices <b>17</b>, and data may be received from the monitoring devices <b>17</b> in response to the query (Step <b>54</b>). The received data may be stored in computer readable memory <b>24</b>, analyzed by CPU <b>23</b> to determine the status of the operation of motor <b>15</b>, and/or used to modify the operation of motor <b>15</b>. Upon receipt of the data from monitoring devices <b>17</b>, current monitoring devices may continue to monitor current through one or more field conductors <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Controller <b>16</b> may receive data information indicative of an operation of motor <b>15</b> and may modulate the received data information for transmission over power wire <b>22</b> (Step <b>55</b>). For example, a plurality of data signals may be received by controller <b>16</b>. As a result, controller <b>16</b> may modulate the data using a variety of methods to distinguish each signal from the other during transmission over power wire <b>22</b>. Furthermore, controller <b>16</b> may modulate data signals to efficiently and reliably transfer data signals over power wire <b>22</b> in the presence of power signals on power wire <b>22</b>, using one or more modulation techniques such as, for example, frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, pulse-tone modulation, phase modulation, or any other appropriate modulation technique. In addition to modulation, the signals may be multiplexed so that a plurality of modulated signals may be integrated into a single signal. This integration may allow a large amount of information to be arranged to allow faster signal transmission, thereby reducing the opportunity for data collusions, attenuation, and interference during transmission over power wire <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Data signals may be transferred to electronic control unit <b>12</b> over power wire <b>22</b> (Step <b>56</b>). For example, once data signals have been appropriately modulated and formatted for transmission, controller <b>16</b> may transmit the data to electronic control unit <b>12</b> over power wire <b>22</b>. Because data signals have been modulated and/or formatted, interference between data signals and power signals may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An alternative series of method steps for operating integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> is illustrated by steps <b>62</b>-<b>65</b> of flowchart <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Controller <b>16</b> may be configured to monitor the switch sequence of electric drive <b>27</b> (Step <b>62</b>) and calculate a switch timing associated with the energizing of field conductors <b>21</b> (Step <b>63</b>). For example, switches <b>28</b> associated with electric drive <b>27</b> may operate based on current supplied to the field windings to achieve a desired output torque of motor <b>15</b>. To maintain the desired output torque, the specific sequence of switching may be calculated by controller <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During an “off” state of one or more switches <b>28</b>, controller <b>16</b> may determine a sensor switch timing (Step <b>64</b>) to operate one or more sensor switches <b>26</b> to provide a selective data flow path over the one or more field conductors <b>21</b> (Step <b>65</b>). Sensor switches <b>26</b> may communicatively couple an array of monitoring devices <b>17</b> to controller <b>16</b> via field conductors <b>21</b>. When a field conductor <b>21</b> is not energized, data communication is provided over a data flow path between monitoring devices <b>17</b> and controller <b>16</b> by operating one or more sensor switches <b>26</b>. Upon operating the sensor switch, integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> may continue in sequence with Step <b>54</b>, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Because controller <b>16</b> may be included within the motor housing and may be configured to receive data information over motor conductors, integrated electric motor control system <b>13</b> may substantially reduce manufacturing costs. For example, monitor and control systems in a single unit may benefit from the use of shared resources such as, for example, CPU, memory, RAM, communication electronics, etc. Moreover, costs associated with providing multiple units, each containing dedicated components, may be minimized. Furthermore, because data information may be transmitted using existing power wiring, manufacturing, maintenance, and replacement costs of wires, connectors, and wiring harnesses may also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, by combining motor control and monitoring functions in a single unit system, complexity may be reduced, minimizing system downtime and increasing productivity. For example, separate units may require maintenance and repair at different times, essentially increasing the likelihood of extended periods of equipment unproductiveness. However, by integrating the monitor and control functions in a single, compact unit the entire unit may be repaired or replaced simultaneously, which may decrease maintenance and/or repair down-times.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> may increase motor reliability by providing motor control capability based on monitored data. For example, because motor monitoring functions are implemented by controller <b>16</b>, operation and/or regulation of motor <b>15</b> may be controlled based upon the monitored characteristics of motor operation. As a result, operational aspects of motor <b>15</b> such as, for example, motor speed, torque output, field conductor current, or other operational aspects may be controlled based on operational characteristics of motor <b>15</b> such as temperature, vibration, acoustic noise, or field conductor overload. In the event of a fault condition, integrated motor monitoring system <b>13</b> may respond faster than conventional monitoring units having separate control units, which may reduce the potential for damage resulting from a fault condition.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed integrated motor monitoring system without departing from the scope of the invention. Other embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the present disclosure. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the present disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
