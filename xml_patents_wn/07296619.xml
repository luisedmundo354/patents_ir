<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A cooling device including a split-core with a plurality of twin fins connected with a plurality of grooves on the split-core is disclosed. Each twin fin includes a root and a pair of vanes extending from the root. Each root is connected with one of the grooves to mount the twin fins to the split-core. A heat spreader is in contact with a top portion of the vanes and a heat pipe is connected with the heat spreader and the split-core. A heat concentration in the split-core is dissipated by a thermal path through the heat pipes to the heat spreader and into the vanes and also by a path upward into the split-core and into the vanes via the roots of the twin fins.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a cooling device for dissipating heat from a component in thermal communication with the cooling device. More specifically, the present invention relates to a cooling device including a split-core and an array of twin fins connected with a split-core and a heat spreader connected with a top portion of vanes of the twin fins and a heat pipe connected with the split-core and the heat spreader. The heat pipe thermally transfers a portion of the heat concentrated in the split-core to the heat spreader where the heat is transferred to the top portion of the vanes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known in the electronics art to place a heat sink in contact with an electronic device so that waste heat generated by operation of the electronic device is thermally transferred to the heat sink to cool the electronic device. However, with continued increases in areal densities and system clock speeds in electronic devices such as microprocessors (CPU's), digital signal processors (DSP's), and application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), the amount of waste heat generated by those electronic devices and the operating temperature of those electronic devices are directly proportional to clock speed and device geometries. Efficient operation of a CPU as well as other high power dissipation electronic devices requires that waste heat be continuously and effectively removed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, as the aforementioned areal densities and system clock speeds of electronic devices continue to increase, a heat flux of the electronic devices also increases. Although air cooled heat sinks are commonly used to dissipate waste heat from the aforementioned electronic devices, the increased heat flux in high performance electronic devices is often concentrated in a small area, usually on a package surface that will be placed in thermal contact with the heat sink. The ability to effectively dissipate ever increasing levels of heat flux in high performance electronic devices has challenged current heat sink designs where the entire heat sink is fabricated using processes such as machining, forging, casting, and extrusion. Those processes make it difficult to increase the number of fins or an area of the fins in order to effectively dissipate heat flux concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, a heat mass includes a mounting surface that is in thermal communication with the electronic device and is operative to thermally conduct the waste heat away from the device and into the heat mass. As a result, the heat flux from the electronic device is concentrated in the area of the heat mass near the mounting surface. Ideally, it is desirable to spread the heat flux in the heat mass over as much of a volume of the heat mass as possible so that the heat is efficiently transferred to the fins and dissipated by the air flow over the fins.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heat flux is a thermal output per unit of area (i.e. W/cm<sup>2</sup>). For example, if a total thermal output is 100 Watts over a heat source having dimensions of 3.5 cm*3.5 cm, then the heat flux is 100 W÷(3.5 cm*3.5 cm)=8.163 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. At present, based on area and cost constraints, electronic device package size remains the same or decreases while the areal densities and clock speeds continue to increase. Consequently, the problems associated with heat flux concentration continue to increase and those problems cannot be solved solely by increasing heat sink size, the number of fins, or fan capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, there is a need for a cooling device with improved thermal conductivity that reduces heat flux concentration and efficiently dissipates waste heat from a component in thermal communication with the cooling device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cooling device of the present invention solves the aforementioned heat flux concentration problems. The cooling device includes a plurality of twin fins with each twin fin including a root and a pair of vanes extending outward of the root. The vanes are spaced apart to define a slot between the vanes and each vane includes a top portion, a leading edge, a trailing edge, and an outer edge. A split-core includes a plurality of grooves that are adapted to receive the roots of the vanes, a top face, a base, a mounting surface adapted to thermally connect the split-core with a component to be cooled, a heat spreader connected with the top portion of the vanes, and a heat pipe connected with the heat spreader and the split-core.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aforementioned problems associated with heat flux concentration are addressed by the split-core because heat thermally conducted into the split-core via the mounting surface is dissipated over multiple thermal paths. In a first path, a portion of a heat flux concentration proximate the mounting surface is thermally transferred by the heat pipe to the heat spreader where the heat is transferred to the top portion of the vanes and is dissipated by an air flow over the vanes. In a second path, the split-core conducts heat away from the component and upward towards the top face of the split-core where the heat spreads outward to the roots of the twin fins. The vanes of the twin fins provide a large surface area for the heat in the split-core to be dissipated by the air flow over vanes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another advantage of the split-core is that a length of the split-core need not span an entire length of the root of the vanes. As a result, a length and/or a diameter of the split-core can be reduced with a concomitant reduction in weight and cost of the cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the drawings, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in the drawings for purpose of illustration, the present invention is embodied in a cooling device for dissipating heat from a component. The cooling device includes a plurality of twin fins with each twin fin including a root and a pair of vanes extending outward of the root. The vanes of the twin fins are spaced apart to define a slot between the vanes and each vane includes a top portion, a leading edge, a trailing edge, and an outer edge. The cooling device also includes a split-core including a plurality of grooves that are adapted to receive the root of the twin fins, a top face, a base, a mounting surface adapted to thermally connect the split-core with the component, a heat spreader connected with the top portion of the vanes, and a heat pipe connected with the split-core and the heat spreader. The heat pipe is operative to thermally transfer a portion of the heat in the split-core to the heat spreader where the heat is transferred to the vanes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Waste heat from the component is thermally conducted into the split-core via the mounting surface and is dissipated through multiple thermal paths. In a first path, a first portion of a heat flux concentrated in the split-core proximate the mounting surface is thermally transferred by the heat pipe to the heat spreader where the heat is transferred to the top portion of the vanes and is dissipated by an air flow over the vanes. In a second path, the split-core conducts a second portion of the heat flux away from the component and upward towards the top face of the split-core where the heat spreads outward to the roots of the twin fins and is dissipated by the air flow over the vanes, the top face, the split-core, and through the slots. The cooling device can be used to dissipate waste heat from any component that requires cooling and the component to be cooled is not limited to electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>e, </i>a cooling device <b>10</b> for dissipating heat from a component (not shown) includes a plurality of twin fins <b>21</b> with each twin fin <b>21</b> including a root <b>27</b> and a pair of vanes <b>23</b> extending outward of the root <b>27</b> and spaced apart to define a slot S between the vanes <b>23</b>. Each vane <b>23</b> includes a top portion <b>29</b>, a leading edge <b>26</b>, a trailing edge <b>24</b>, and an outer edge <b>25</b>. The cooling device <b>10</b> also includes a split-core <b>11</b> including a plurality of grooves G that are adapted to receive the roots <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b>, a top face <b>13</b>, a base <b>17</b>, a mounting surface <b>19</b> adapted to thermally connect the split-core <b>11</b> with the component, a heat spreader <b>15</b> connected with the top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b>, and at least one heat pipe <b>14</b> connected with the split-core <b>11</b> and the heat spreader <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>e </i>the heat pipe <b>14</b> can be connected with the heat spreader <b>15</b> and the split-core <b>11</b> by a variety of methods that include but are not limited to forming an aperture <b>15</b><i>a </i>in the heat spreader <b>15</b> and an aperture <b>17</b><i>a </i>the split-core <b>11</b> and then inserting the heat pipe <b>14</b> into the apertures (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>a</i>). Because heat concentration in the spilt-core <b>11</b> will be in a volume of the split-core <b>11</b> proximate the mounting surface <b>19</b> where waste heat from the component enters the split-core <b>11</b>, it is desirable to position the connection of the heat pipe <b>14</b> with the split-core <b>11</b> at the base <b>17</b> of the split-core <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the aperture <b>17</b><i>a </i>can be positioned in the base <b>17</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>e. </i>Preferably, the aperture <b>17</b><i>a </i>is not a through hole but rather an opening extending only partially into the split-core <b>11</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The apertures <b>17</b><i>a </i>can be symmetrically disposed in the split-core <b>11</b> as depicted by a line of symmetry Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>or they can be asymmetrically disposed as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>by an offset distance Da relative to the line of symmetry Y.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, the aperture <b>15</b><i>a </i>can be a through hole extending between a top and bottom surfaces (<b>15</b><i>t, </i><b>15</b><i>b</i>) of the heat spreader <b>15</b> or a partial opening formed in the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the heat spreader <b>15</b>. If a through hole is used, then the heat pipe <b>14</b> can include a threaded portion to receive a fastener <b>15</b><i>f </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>) that connects the heat pipe <b>14</b> with the heat spreader <b>15</b>. For example, a machine screw can be used for the fastener <b>15</b><i>f. </i>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other mean can be used to connect the heat pipe <b>14</b> with heat spreader <b>15</b> including but not limited to welding, brazing, soldering, and press fitting, just to name a few. As another example, the heat pipe <b>14</b> can be inserted into the apertures <b>17</b><i>a </i>and then brazed to the base <b>17</b>, followed by inserting the heat pipe <b>14</b> into the apertures <b>15</b><i>a </i>and brazing the heat pipe <b>14</b> to the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>b</i>. If the aperture <b>15</b><i>a </i>is a through hole, then the heat pipe <b>14</b> can be brazed to both the top and bottom surfaces (<b>15</b><i>t, </i><b>15</b><i>b</i>). Preferably, the process used to connect the heat pipe <b>14</b> with the heat spreader <b>15</b> and the split-core <b>11</b> as well as the dimensions of the apertures (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>a</i>) and the heat pipe <b>14</b> are selected to provide a low thermal resistance connection the ensures maximum thermal transfer from the split-core <b>11</b> to the heat spreader <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d, </i>for some applications, it may be desirable to design the connection of the heat pipe <b>14</b> with the split-core <b>11</b> to include an offset distance d between a bottom of the heat pipe <b>14</b> and the mounting surface <b>19</b> so that a base plate as will be described below or some other means for mounting the cooling device <b>10</b> with the component can be effectuated without creating a mechanical interference with the heat pipe <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b, </i>the heat spreader <b>15</b> can be connected (see dashed oval <b>15</b><i>c</i>) with the top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> by a variety of means including but not limited to soldering, brazing, welding, a thermally conductive glue, a thermally conductive resin, and a thermal interface material. Examples of suitable thermal interface materials include but are not limited to thermally conductive pastes, paints, films, and coatings. Preferably, the connection of the heat spreader <b>15</b> with the top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> generates sufficient force between the heat spreader <b>15</b> and the top portions <b>29</b> so that a low thermal resistance path is created from the heat spreader <b>15</b> to the vanes <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A plurality of twin fins <b>21</b> connected with the split-core <b>11</b> sans the heat spreader <b>15</b> and heat pipes <b>14</b> are depicted in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>2</b><i>c</i>, and <b>3</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a close up view of the device <b>10</b> depicts a plurality of the twin fins <b>21</b> with their respective roots <b>27</b> connected with the grooves G on the split-core <b>11</b> such that the twin fins <b>21</b> form an array of fins that surround the split-core <b>11</b>. The leading edges <b>26</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> can define a chamber <b>30</b> that surrounds the top face <b>13</b>. The top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> can be a substantially planar surface for mounting the heat spreader <b>15</b> so that heat transferred to the heat spreader <b>15</b> via the heat pipes <b>14</b> is thermally transferred to the vanes <b>23</b>. Alternatively, the top portions <b>29</b> can be a profiled surface that complements a profile of the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the heat spreader <b>15</b>. The chamber <b>30</b> is preferable because it provides a space for an air flow F to circulate over the top face <b>13</b> to dissipate heat from the split-core <b>11</b> and for the air flow F to pass over the vanes <b>23</b> and through the slots S. The chamber <b>30</b> also allows for increased air circulation through the vanes <b>23</b> proximate the top portions <b>29</b> so that heat transferred to the vanes <b>23</b> from the heat spreader <b>15</b> is efficiently dissipated by the air flow F. The top face <b>13</b> of the split-core <b>11</b> may be substantially flush with the roots <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>), may extend outward the roots <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>), or may be positioned below an upper most portion of the roots <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, waste heat H<sub>W </sub>from a component (not shown) is thermally conducted into the split-core <b>11</b> through the mounting surface <b>19</b>. The waste heat H<sub>W </sub>is dissipated by the air flow F that passes over the vanes <b>23</b>, the top face <b>13</b>, the split-core <b>11</b>, and through the slots S. The air flow F can be from an air flow source such as a fan, for example. Although the heat spreader <b>15</b> is not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>c </i>and <b>3</b>, the top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> are in thermal communication with the heat spreader <b>15</b> and heat transferred from the heat spreader <b>15</b> to the top portions <b>29</b> of the vanes <b>23</b> is also dissipated by the air flow F. Preferably, the top portion <b>29</b> is sized to maximize its contact area with the heat spreader <b>15</b> (i.e. the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>b</i>) so that heat transfer from the heat spreader <b>15</b> to the vanes <b>23</b> is maximized. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, if the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>b </i>has a width of W<b>1</b> and the top portion <b>29</b> has a length of L<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>a</i>), then for this example L<b>1</b> is preferably substantially equal to W<b>1</b> (L<b>1</b>≈W<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a plurality of grooves G are adapted to receive the root <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b>. The grooves G can be formed by a pair of spaced apart projections <b>12</b> that extend outward of a surface <b>11</b><i>s </i>of the split-core <b>11</b>. A space between adjacent projections <b>12</b> is sufficient to receive a width <b>27</b><i>w </i>of the root of the twin fin <b>21</b>. Alternatively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the groove G can extend inward of the surface <b>11</b><i>s </i>and the groove G can include a width and a depth sufficient to receive the root <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b>. As will be described below, the grooves G can be aligned with an axis Z of the split-core <b>11</b> or the grooves G can be aligned at an angle with the axis Z (see β in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>). Factors including a size of the split-core <b>11</b> (e.g. its circumference if the split-core <b>11</b> is cylindrical) and the width <b>27</b><i>w </i>of the roots will determine a maximum number of the twin fins <b>21</b> that can be connected with the split-core <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the root <b>27</b> can be inserted into the groove G by using a tool <b>90</b>. The tool <b>90</b> can complement a shape of the slot S and the tool <b>90</b> can be used to urge the root <b>27</b> into the groove G so that the root <b>27</b> is firmly connected with the groove G and the root <b>27</b> is in contact with the groove G substantially over its entire length along the split-core <b>11</b>. As an example, the twin fin <b>21</b> can be fixedly connected with the groove G by applying a solder or the like to the root <b>27</b> and/or the groove G prior to insertion, then the root <b>27</b> can be soldered in the groove G. The tool <b>90</b> can be used to hold the root <b>27</b> in the groove G to prevent the twin fin <b>21</b> from moving during the insertion process.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similarly, a brazing process can be used to connect the root <b>27</b> with the groove G. To enhance thermally conductivity between the split-core <b>11</b> and the twin fin <b>21</b>, a thermal sealant or a thermal interface material can be positioned in the groove G and/or on the root <b>27</b> prior to insertion. Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the above processes can be used when the groove G is formed by the projections <b>12</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Other methods can be used to connect the root <b>27</b> with the groove G and the present invention is not to be construed as being limited to the methods disclosed herein. For instance, welding, vacuum brazing, adhesives, and glue are examples of other methods that can be used to effectuate a connection of the roots <b>27</b> with the grooves G.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>through <b>6</b><i>g, </i>examples of various configurations for the top face <b>13</b> of the split-core <b>11</b> are depicted. The top face <b>13</b> can include a planar profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>(see <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>), an arcuate profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, and a sloped profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>d </i>and <b>6</b><i>e, </i>the sloped and arcuate profiles can terminate in a frustum <b>13</b><i>f </i>(see <b>13</b><i>f </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>f </i>and <b>6</b><i>g, </i>the top face <b>13</b> includes concave arcuate and concave sloped profiles respectively, and those profiles can include the frustum <b>13</b><i>f. </i>The profile of the top face <b>13</b> can be selected based on air flow management in the chamber <b>30</b> and/or to increase the air flow F over the top face <b>13</b> to enhance heat transfer from the split-core <b>11</b> to the air flow F.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the grooves G can include a length L that substantially spans an entirety of a length of the surface <b>11</b><i>s </i>of the split-core <b>11</b>. The root <b>27</b> of each twin fin <b>21</b> can have a length that is substantially equal to the length L of the grooves G.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>c</i>, the heat pipe <b>14</b> can be implemented using a variety of heat pipe technologies that are well understood in the electronic arts. For example, the heat pipe <b>14</b> can be made from a solid piece of a high thermal conductivity material <b>14</b><i>m </i>such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and stainless steel, for example. On the other hand, the heat pipe <b>14</b> can comprise the high thermal conductivity material <b>14</b><i>m </i>with a sealed interior volume <b>14</b><i>v </i>that contains a capillary structure <b>14</b><i>c </i>and a working fluid <b>14</b><i>f. </i>The capillary structure circulates the working fluid <b>14</b><i>f </i>as the fluid <b>14</b><i>f </i>transitions from a vapor state back to a condensed liquid state. Typically, the working fluid <b>14</b><i>f </i>is sealed at a low pressure and is characterized by having a high thermal conductivity, a high surface tension, and a high latent heat of vaporization. For example, a fluid including but are not limited to water, sodium, methanol, and acetone can be used for the working fluid <b>14</b><i>v. </i>The capillary structure <b>14</b><i>c </i>can include but is not limited to a plurality of grooves, a mesh, a fiber, and sintered powder. Dimensions m<b>1</b> and m<b>2</b> of the heat pipe <b>14</b> should be selected to complement the apertures <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the split-core <b>11</b> and the heat spreader <b>15</b>, respectively. For example, the dimensions m<b>1</b> and m<b>2</b> can be 8.0 mm in diameter and the apertures <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>a </i>can be sized to accommodate those dimensions. The heat pipe <b>14</b> can be an off-the-shelf commercially available model or a custom made model by a company such as Thermacore® or Yeh-Chiang Technology Corporation® (YC Tek), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a component <b>50</b> is in thermal communication with the mounting surface <b>19</b> of the split-core <b>11</b>. The thermal communication can be by a direct contact between the component <b>50</b> and the mounting surface <b>19</b> as depicted or via an intermediate structure such as the thermal interface material <b>40</b>, for example. Waste heat H<sub>W </sub>enters the split-core <b>11</b> via the mounting surface <b>19</b> and is concentrated near the base <b>17</b> where the heat pipes <b>14</b> are connected with the split-core <b>11</b>. Even though the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>is thermally conducted throughout a volume of the split-core <b>11</b>, a heavy dashed oval depicts a region in the split-core <b>11</b> where a heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>is highest. The heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>can be particularly problematic when the component <b>50</b> is a high power dissipation, state-of-the-art, microprocessor such as the type used in leading edge workstations, desk top PC's, servers, and laptop computers. The heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>is highest at a surface <b>51</b> of the component <b>50</b> and in the region depicted by the heavy dashed oval. To efficiently cool the component <b>50</b> it is desirable to reduce the heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>in the split-core <b>11</b>. The split-core <b>11</b>, the heat pipes <b>14</b>, and the heat spreader <b>15</b> effectively reduce the heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>by providing multiple thermal paths to dissipate the waste heat H<sub>W</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a first path P<b>1</b>, a first portion of the heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>is thermally transferred by the heat pipe <b>14</b> to the heat spreader <b>15</b> where the heat is then transferred to the to the vanes <b>23</b> via the top portion <b>29</b> where the air flow F over the vanes <b>23</b> dissipates the heat. In a second path P<b>2</b>, the split-core <b>11</b> thermally conducts a second portion of the heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>upward towards the top face <b>13</b> where the heat spreads outward to the roots <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b> and is dissipated by the air flow F over the vanes <b>23</b>, the top face <b>13</b>, the split-core <b>11</b>, and through the slots S.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Another advantage of the multiple paths (P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>) is that a length of the split-core <b>11</b> need not span the entire length of the roots <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b>. Instead, the top face <b>13</b> of the split-core <b>11</b> can be recessed below an uppermost portion of the roots <b>27</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As a result, the cooling device <b>10</b> can be made smaller with a lower mass and a lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to Table 1 where data in a right column depicts an increase in heat removal efficiency of the cooling device <b>10</b> of the present invention in comparison to a prior cooling device with a split-core <b>11</b> but without the heat pipes <b>14</b> or the heat spreader <b>15</b>. Both cooling devices had sixty twin fins <b>21</b> connected with their respective split-cores <b>11</b>, a height of 50 mm (excluding the fan), and a diameter of 69 mm measured at the outer edges <b>25</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b>. The prior cooling device without the heat spreader <b>15</b> or the heat pipes <b>14</b> had a mass of 900 grams. In contrast, the cooling device <b>10</b> had a mass of 500 grams. The mass of both cooling devices did not include the mass of the Delta cooling fans. The cooling device <b>10</b> included two heat pipes <b>14</b> and the heat pipes <b>14</b> with a diameter of 8.0 mm and made by YC Tek.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In Table 1, the case temperature is a temperature measured at the component <b>50</b> (e.g. at the surface <b>51</b>) after the component <b>50</b> has reached a stable temperature so that a temperature difference ΔT between the case temperature and the ambient temperature can be measured. A thermal resistance of the cooling devices is calculated by dividing the ΔT by a thermal output of the component <b>50</b> in Watts (e.g. ΔT÷W). Therefore, for the cooling device <b>10</b> the thermal resistance was ([41°C.−25° C.]÷100 W=0.16° C./W). With 100 W of power dissipation from the components <b>50</b>, the cooling device <b>10</b> had a 6° C. lower case temperature and a 0.06° C./W lower thermal resistance for an improvement of 27% compared with the cooling device without the heat pipes <b>14</b> and heat spreader <b>15</b> (e.g. [{(0.22−0.16)÷0.22}*100]=27.2727% ). Another advantage of the cooling device <b>10</b> is that its mass is lower by 400 grams (i.e. 900 grams-500 grams) when compared to the cooling device without the heat pipes <b>14</b> and heat spreader <b>15</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the air flow F can be in a direction from the leading edge <b>26</b> to the trailing edge <b>24</b> or from the trailing edge <b>24</b> to the leading edge <b>26</b>. Accordingly, an air flow source, such as a fan, can either push or pull air through the slots S and over the vanes <b>23</b>. The air flow F entering the chamber <b>30</b> can also circulate over the top face <b>13</b> to dissipate the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>from the split-core <b>11</b>. The split-core <b>11</b> can have a length L that is long relative to a width W of the split-core <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>) so that an aspect ratio (L÷W) of the split-core <b>11</b> is large and the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>is thermally conducted up the split-core <b>11</b> along the second path P<b>2</b> towards the top face <b>13</b>. As described above, the roots <b>27</b> and grooves G can span substantially all of the length L so that the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>is transferred from the split-core <b>11</b> to the twin fins <b>21</b> along the entire length of the roots <b>27</b>. The split-core <b>11</b> can be made from a high thermal conductivity material (e.g. copper or graphite) that efficiently conducts the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>upward along the axis Z and outward towards the twin fins <b>21</b> so that the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>is spread over a larger area. As a result, the heat flux concentration H<sub>C </sub>at the surface <b>51</b> of the component <b>50</b> and in the base <b>17</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the roots <b>27</b> of the twin fins <b>21</b> can be connected with the grooves G using a clamp <b>41</b> that clamps around an ear <b>27</b>L on the root <b>27</b>. The clamp <b>41</b> can be a C-clamp, a clamping ring, or the like and can exert a force on the roots <b>27</b> that urges the roots <b>27</b> into firm contact with the grooves G. As described above, a thermal interface material or a thermal sealant material can be applied to the roots <b>27</b> and/or the grooves G to reduce thermal resistance between the split-core <b>11</b> and the twin fins <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">One example of an implementation of the clamp <b>41</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, where the clamp <b>41</b> includes a clamp body <b>43</b> with a gap <b>43</b><i>g </i>(see dashed line) in the clamp body <b>43</b>.

Latch pins (not shown) can also be used to mount the air flow source <b>70</b> on the heat spreader <b>15</b>. The air flow source <b>70</b> generates the air flow F and the air flow source <b>70</b> can push or pull air through the cooling device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, a system <b>200</b> for dissipating waste heat H<sub>W </sub>from a component can include the cooling device <b>10</b> and the air flow source <b>70</b> as described above. The air flow source <b>70</b> can be an electric fan, for example. Additionally, the system <b>200</b> can include the base plate <b>100</b> for mounting the system <b>200</b> with the component <b>50</b> so that the mounting surface <b>19</b> is in thermal communication with the component <b>50</b> to be cooled. The thermal interface material <b>40</b> can be used to thermally communicate the waste heat H<sub>W </sub>from the component <b>50</b> to the mounting surface <b>19</b> and into the split-core <b>11</b>. The base plate <b>100</b> can be mounted on a substrate <b>60</b>, such as a PC board, for example, that carries the component <b>50</b>. The base plate <b>100</b> can be mounted with the substrate <b>60</b> using fasteners <b>65</b> inserted through the mounting holes <b>101</b> in the base plate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The twin fins <b>21</b> can be made from a variety of thermally conductive materials including but not limited to aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), alloys of those materials, and a high thermal conductivity resin. Preferably, the vanes <b>23</b> and the root <b>27</b> are a homogenous unit, that is, they are a unitary whole. The twin fins <b>21</b> can be manufactured using a pressing or stamping process. A bending or rolling process can be used to form the arcuate profile <b>23</b><i>a </i>or to form an angular or non-planar profile on the vanes <b>23</b>. As an example, the twin fins <b>21</b> can be stamped from a sheet of material, such as a copper (Cu) sheet or an aluminum (Al) sheet. As another example, the twin fins <b>21</b> can be molded from a high thermal conductivity material such as a resin or a carbon fiber re-aligned resin. The vanes <b>23</b> need not be identical among the twin fins <b>21</b>. Because the twin fins <b>21</b> are attached by their roots <b>27</b> to the split-core <b>11</b>, twin fins <b>21</b> with vanes <b>23</b> that differ in size and shape can be connected with the split-core <b>11</b> via the grooves G.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The split-core <b>11</b> can also be made from a variety of thermally conductive materials including but not limited to aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), alloys of those materials, silicon (Si) substrate, thermally conductive resins, and graphite. The split-core <b>11</b> can be manufacture using processes including but not limited to casting, forging, extruding, and machining. The groves G or the projections <b>12</b> can be machined in the split-core <b>11</b> or they can be formed during the casting, forging, or extruding processes. As one example, the split-core <b>11</b> can be made using a forging process or an impact forging process. A shape of the split-core <b>11</b> as well as the grooves G can be directly forged. The split-core <b>11</b> can have any shape and need not have a circular or cylindrical shape as depicted herein. The split-core <b>11</b> and the twin fins <b>21</b> can be made from dissimilar materials. As an example, the split-core <b>11</b> can be made from graphite and the twin fins <b>21</b> can be made from copper (Cu). Alternatively, the split-core <b>11</b> can be copper (Cu) and the twin fins <b>21</b> aluminum (Al).</p>
