<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is in the field of telecommunication encompassing all existing sorts of interaction multimedia technology, and pertains more particularly to methods and apparatus for intelligently routing Instant Messaging Presence Protocol (IMPP) events to individual customer service representatives (CSRs) among a group of CSRs working in a communication center or other business premise.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of telephony communication, there have been many improvements in technology over the years that have contributed to more efficient use of telephone communication within hosted call-center environments. Most of these improvements involve integrating the telephones and switching systems in such call centers with computer hardware and software adapted for, among other things, better routing of telephone calls, faster delivery of telephone calls and associated information, and improved service with regard to client satisfaction. Such computer-enhanced telephony is known in the art as computer-telephony integration (CTI).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally speaking, CTI implementations of various design and purpose are implemented both within individual call-centers and, in some cases, at the telephone network level. For example, processors running CTI software applications may be linked to telephone switches, service control points (SCP), and network entry points within a public or private telephone network. At the call-center level, CTI-enhanced processors, data servers, transaction servers, and the like, are linked to telephone switches and, in some cases, to similar CTI hardware at the network level, often by a dedicated digital link. CTI processors and other hardware within a call-center is commonly referred to as customer premises equipment (CPE). It is the CTI processor and application software is such centers that provides computer enhancement to a call center.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a CTI-enhanced call center, telephones at agent stations are connected to a central telephony switching apparatus, such as an automatic call distributor (ACD) switch or a private branch exchange (PBX). The agent stations may also be equipped with computer terminals such as personal computer/video display units (PC/VDU) so that agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by telephone equipment. Such stations may be interconnected through the PC VDU by a local area network (LAN). One or more data or transaction servers may also be connected to the LAN that interconnects agent stations. The LAN is, in turn, typically connected to the CTI processor, which is connected to the call switching apparatus of the call center.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a call arrives at a call center, whether or not the call has been pre-processed at an SCP, typically at least the telephone number of the calling line is made available to the receiving switch at the call center by the network provider. This service is available by most networks as caller-ID information in one of several formats such as Automatic Number Identification (ANI). Typically the number called is also available through a service such as Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS). If the call center is computer-enhanced (CTI), the phone number of the calling party may be used as a key to access additional information from a customer information system (CIS) database at a server on the network that connects the agent workstations. In this manner information pertinent to a call may be provided to an agent, often as a screen pop on the agent's PC/VDU.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, advances in computer technology, telephony equipment, and infrastructure have provided many opportunities for improving telephone service in publicly switched and private telephone intelligent networks. Similarly, development of a separate information and data network known as the Internet, together with advances in computer hardware and software have led to a new multimedia telephone system known in the art by several names. In this new systemology, telephone calls are simulated by multimedia computer equipment, and data, such as audio data, is transmitted over data networks as data packets. In this system the broad term used to describe such computer-simulated telephony is Data Network Telephony (DNT).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For purposes of nomenclature and definition, the inventors wish to distinguish clearly between what might be called conventional telephony, which is the telephone service enjoyed by nearly all citizens through local telephone companies and several long-distance telephone network providers, and what has been described herein as computer-simulated telephony or data-network telephony. The conventional systems are referred to herein as Connection-Oriented Switched-Telephony (COST) systems, CTI enhanced or not.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">COST telephony is not limited to wired, or land-line systems, but may include wireless network systems as well. The purpose of the definitions here is to distinguish clearly between data-packet systems, which share available bandwidth, and non-packet systems, which use dedicated connections or channels.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The computer-simulated, or DNT systems are familiar to those who use and understand computers and data-network systems. Perhaps the best example of DNT is telephone service provided over the Internet, which will be referred to herein as Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT), by far the most extensive, but still a subset of DNT. DNT systems may also include wireless sub-systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Both systems use signals transmitted over network links. In fact, connection to data networks for DNT such as IPNT is typically accomplished over local telephone lines, used to reach points in the network such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The definitive difference is that COST telephony may be considered to be connection-oriented telephony. In the COST system, calls are placed and connected by a specific dedicated path, and the connection path is maintained over the time of the call. Bandwidth is basically assured. Other calls and data do not share a connected channel path in a COST system. A DNT system, on the other hand, is not dedicated or connection-oriented. That is, data, including audio data, is prepared, sent, and received as data packets over a data-network. The data packets share network links, and may travel by varied and variable paths.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to Internet protocol (IPNT) calls, a DNT center may also share other forms of media with customers accessing the system through their computers. E-mails, video mails, fax, file share, file transfer, video calls, and so forth are some of the other forms of media, which may be used. This capability of handling varied media leads to the term multimedia communications center. A multimedia communications center may be a combination CTI and DNT center, or may be a DNT center capable of receiving COST calls and converting them to a digital DNT format. The term communication center will replace the term call center hereinafter in this specification when referring to multi-media capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In systems known to the inventors, incoming IPNT calls are processed and routed within an IPNT-capable communication center in much the same way as COST calls are routed in a CTI-enhanced call-center, using similar or identical routing rules, waiting queues, and so on, aside from the fact that there are two separate networks involved. Communication centers having both CTI and IPNT capability utilize LAN-connected agent-stations with each station having a telephony-switch-connected headset or phone, and a PC connected, in most cases via LAN, to the network carrying the IPNT calls. Therefore, in most cases, IPNT calls are routed to the agent's PC while conventional telephony calls are routed to the agent's conventional telephone or headset. Typically separate lines and equipment must be implemented for each type of call weather COST or IPNT.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Due in part to added costs associated with additional equipment, lines, and data ports that are needed to add IPNT capability to a CTI-enhanced call-center, companies are currently experimenting with various forms of integration between the older COST system and the newer IPNT system. For example, by enhancing data servers, interactive voice response units (IVR), agent-connecting networks, and so on, with the capability of conforming to Internet protocol, call data arriving from either network may be integrated requiring less equipment and lines to facilitate processing, storage, and transfer of data.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With many new communication products supporting various media types available to businesses and customers, a communication center must add significant application software to accommodate the diversity. For example, e-mail programs have differing parameters than do IP applications. IP applications are different regarding protocol than COST calls, and so on. Separate routing systems and/or software components are needed for routing e-mails, IP calls, COST calls, file sharing, etc. Agents must then be trained in the use of a variety of applications supporting the different types of media.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Keeping contact histories, reporting statistics, creating routing rules and the like becomes more complex as newer types of media are added to communication center capability. Additional hardware implementations such as servers, processors, etc. are generally required to aid full multimedia communication and reporting. Therefore, it is desirable that interactions of all multimedia sorts be analyzed, recorded, and routed according to enterprise (business) rules in a manner that provides seamless integration between media types and application types, thereby allowing agents to respond intelligently and efficiently to customer queries and problems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More recently, communications companies have been developing ways to add a new IPNT medium to multimedia options for communication. This newer medium is the well-known instant message (IM) service. Instant messaging enables online or network connected parties to generate and deliver text messages to one another over the network. The inventors have incorporated IM technology within a communication center environment in order to provide more efficient solutions to challenges such as the ability to communicate current communication center status to customers attempting to reach the center for service for example.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Older call-centers relying on COST communication techniques simply play recorded messages, the recordings informing the customers of the status of an agent being called. More advanced communication centers, including multimedia centers, have more extensive automated services in place for interacting with customers in the event that no agents are available. Most of these services are, however, IVR driven and inform callers of options, as well as status of those persons the callers are attempting to connect with.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Challenges that have been addressed using IM technology include communicating estimated call-waiting times. In prior art, this is accomplished using IVR interaction. A customer must invest the time and suffer the inconvenience of placing a call to the communication center in order to receive the status information. As described above, this information is made available through IVR interaction in prior art systems.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One network-based system known to the inventor enables users of the system to obtain current agent-status information related to agents of an information-source facility connected to the network before initiating contact with the agent or agents of the information-source facility. The system comprises a status-server node connected to the information-source facility (communication center) and to the network, an interface-server node connected to the status node and to the network, the status-server node accessible to the interface node, a user-operated network-capable appliance connected to the network, the interface node accessible to the network-capable appliance, and a software application distributed on at least the status and interface server nodes, the software application enabling distribution of the agent-status information to the user-operated appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The user operating the network-capable appliance connects to the network and accesses the interfacing server node and requests the agent-status information, the agent-status information is then accessed from the status server node connected to the communication center by the interfacing server node and delivered to the requesting user over the operating network.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system, in one aspect, uses instant message presence protocol (IMPP) technology compatible with a formal protocol such as IMMP-IETF RFC 2778 and is described in disclosure included herein and referenced by Ser. No. 09/710,042 in the cross-reference section above. Such a system saves phone costs for customers and/or agents as well as reduces utilization requirements of communication-center interface technologies such as IVR technology.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An enhancement to this system enables communication center agents using the system also to obtain current status information related to clients of an information-source facility connected to the network in order to optimize callback connection success from the agents to the monitored clients.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also known to the inventor and referenced in the cross-reference section as Ser. No. 09/766,271 is a similar system that further provides a self-service interface for clients of a communication or information center that enables the client to determine agent states without calling the center, publish his or her own state without requiring the center to initiate a call, and perform a variety of business-related tasks at the center without requiring any agent interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The system utilizes an IMPP capable application for enabling a client to interact with communication-center resources through an interactive client interface component operable by the client for posting client data and for receiving and displaying agent and interaction data from the communication center.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A brokering component is also provided for managing client and communication center data and communication, and, additionally, a status monitoring and reporting component is provided for monitoring and reporting communication center and client status. The application is characterized in that a client using the user interface is enabled to access and alter communication center data, and also to initiate live interaction with the communication center. The application is described in relation to Internet uses and system architecture as well.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the area of IPNT outside of secure environments, Instant Messaging Presence Protocol IMPP has become a rapidly growing and popular form of communication. Active communication using standard IM messaging is enabled when connected IMPP users have downloaded and installed software from an IMPP service provider. Once the users are connected online, text typed in a senders dialog box is instantly viewable by a recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">There are many service providers offering IMPP service on the Internet today. Two of the most popular providers are MSN™ Messenger Service and AOL™ Instant Messenger. Despite the extreme popularity and growth of IMPP systems, a security standard has not yet been established for the instant communication method. Therefore, companies that want to use IM for private communication, whether internally between agents or between agents and clients, must either design a completely new IMPP system from the ground up or trust AOL or MSN enough to send all traffic (including sensitive information) through their networks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a result, the contributions referenced above as prior art, if third-party hosted, must be significantly tooled to provide adequate security and presence protocol as it applies to communication center guidelines or, if proprietary, completely created from scratch as a communication-center-controlled service requiring client (customer) subscription and full software provision.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A secondary challenge in implementing a secure IMP service in a communication center environment is that most third-party provided systems are not compatible with each other requiring a third-party host, such as a communication center to incorporate all of the software and hardware requirements to host multiple services used by clients. In this environment it becomes difficult for agents to respond in an ordered and coherent fashion especially if bombarded with multiple IMs from differing services.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Therefore, what is clearly needed is a system that allows controlled and intelligent routing of IMs to individual CSRs (agents) working as a group of active agents wherein intelligent rules and constraints are applied for ordering and in some cases structuring the communication sequences.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventor provides a novel software-hardware driven system for improving the reporting of communication-center presence information to prospective communication-center clients. The method and apparatus of the present invention is described in enabling detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an overview of a communication network <b>52</b> wherein reporting of communication-center presence information is practiced according to an embodiment of the present invention. Communication network <b>52</b> comprises, in this example, a public-switched-telephone network (PSTN) <b>55</b>, a data-packet-network (DPN) <b>61</b>, a communication center <b>21</b>, and an exemplary user <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">PSTN <b>55</b>, in this example, represents a preferred network connecting all connection-oriented-switched-telephony (COST) clients who call into communication center <b>21</b> for the purpose of doing business with the center. In another embodiment, a private telephone network may be utilized in place of or in combination with PSTN <b>55</b>. The inventor chooses PSTN <b>55</b> because of its high public-access characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A local telephony switch (LSW) <b>59</b> is illustrated within PSTN <b>55</b> and represents automated switching capability within the network. LSW <b>59</b> may be an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), a Public Branch Exchange (PBX), or any other type of telephony switching apparatus, in the broadest sense, including but not limited to DNT type switches/gateways as used in VoIP etc. LSW <b>59</b> is enhanced for computer-telephony-integration (CTI) by a CTI processor <b>62</b> connected thereto by a CTI connection. LSW <b>59</b> and CTI processor <b>62</b> may encompass various communication functionalities made available at network level by communication center <b>21</b>. For example, an instance of CTI software known to the inventor and termed Transaction Server (TS) is provided within CTI processor <b>62</b> and adapted to enable communication-center <b>21</b> to certain call-switching and routing aspects performed by LSW <b>59</b>. LSW <b>59</b> is connected to a central telephony switch (CSW) <b>53</b>, illustrated within communication center <b>21</b>, by a COST telephony trunk <b>57</b>. CSW <b>53</b> may be any one of several types of call processing switches as previously described with respect to LSW <b>59</b> above.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">CSW <b>53</b> is enhanced by a CTI processor <b>65</b>, which is connected thereto by a CTI connection as was described with reference to LSW <b>59</b>. CTI processor <b>65</b> also has an instance of TS software provided therein and adapted to communicate with TS software of processor <b>62</b>. Processors <b>62</b> (network) and <b>65</b> (communication center) are connected by virtue of a separate data network <b>64</b> enabling the above-described communication between TS instances. By using network <b>64</b> to connect processor <b>62</b> and <b>65</b>, communication center <b>21</b> may, in addition to controlling call switching and routing within PSTN <b>55</b>, receive information about callers ahead of actual calls arriving at CSW <b>53</b> for internal processing. This enhancement is known as double-dipping by the inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">DPN <b>61</b> is, in this example, the well-known Internet network and will hereinafter be termed Internet <b>61</b>. Internet <b>61</b> facilitates all Internet-protocol (IP) callers reaching communication center <b>21</b> through the Internet. Internet <b>61</b> may instead be a private or corporate Wide Area Network (WAN), or any other type of DPN as long as Internet communication protocols are supported. The inventor chooses Internet <b>61</b> as a preferred network because of it's high public-access characteristic. IP callers calling into communication center <b>21</b> may interface from any Internet-connected server, which provides network access to communication center <b>21</b>. Moreover, there may be many such servers distributed throughout network <b>61</b>, each server being a point of access.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Internet <b>61</b> has an Internet backbone <b>13</b> illustrated therein. Backbone <b>13</b> represents all the lines, equipment, and connection points making up the Internet network as a whole, including sub networks. A Web Server (WS) <b>15</b> is provided within Internet <b>61</b> and is connected to backbone <b>13</b>. WS <b>15</b> is adapted as an Internet file server as is known in the art. WS <b>15</b> represents one of a possible plurality of distributed customer-interfacing servers as described above. WS <b>15</b> serves electronic information pages, termed Web pages in the art, to requesting users. WS <b>15</b> is in this example hosted by the entity hosting communication center <b>21</b> and is utilized as a customer-interfacing server.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">WS <b>15</b> is enhanced with a software instance termed Web-Presence-Software (WPS) <b>16</b>, which enables prospective customers of communication-center <b>21</b> to view communication-center status related to agent availability for a call before deciding whether or not to actually place a call to communication center <b>21</b>. More about WPS <b>16</b> is provided later in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An exemplary user, illustrated herein as a PC icon labeled with the element number <b>9</b>, is connected to Internet backbone <b>13</b> by virtue of an Internet connection-line <b>11</b>. User <b>9</b> is assumed, in this example, to be accessing WS <b>15</b> through standard Internet-connection capabilities as are known in the art. Typically, user <b>9</b> would obtain access to WS <b>15</b> through a dial-up connection utilizing an Internet-service-provider (ISP) and PSTN <b>55</b>. However, there are many other means which may be used to obtain an Internet session with WS <b>15</b>, many of which may not require dialing, e.g. DSL, cable modems etc. User <b>9</b> may utilize some other Internet-capable appliance than the PC illustrated herein. Likewise, connection line <b>11</b> may be a wireless link, a cable-modem connection, or any other known Internet connection means.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An instance of software termed Customer-Presence-Software (CPS) <b>10</b> is provided to execute on customer-premise-equipment (CPE), which in this case is a PC operated by user <b>9</b>. CPS <b>10</b> is adapted to integrate communication-center status information into a customer's electronic interface, which is typically an electronic-information-page (Web page) served to the customer by WS <b>15</b> upon the customer's request. CPS <b>10</b> is an optional implementation in this example and is described in more detail later in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Communication center <b>21</b> has an Internet Protocol Router (IPR) <b>25</b> illustrated therein and adapted to handle incoming communication events sourced from WS <b>15</b> or any other interfacing Web server over network connection <b>19</b>. IPR <b>25</b> routes incoming events to agent workstations adapted to receive the events. Agent workstations <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>31</b> are illustrated within communication center <b>21</b> and adapted for communication-center activity covering both IP and COST transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Agent telephones <b>39</b> (workstation <b>27</b>), <b>41</b> (workstation <b>29</b>), and <b>37</b> (workstation <b>31</b>) are provided to handle COST communication events. Telephones <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>, and <b>37</b> are connected to CSW <b>53</b> by internal telephony wiring <b>45</b>. Each agent workstation <b>27</b>, <b>29</b>, and <b>31</b> has a personal computer/video-display unit (PC/VDU) provided therein and adapted for handling IP communication events and for receiving information about callers calling from PSTN <b>55</b>. These are PC/VDU <b>33</b>, PC/VDU <b>35</b>, and PC/VDU <b>43</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">PC/VDU's <b>39</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>43</b> are connected to a Local-Area-Network (LAN) <b>23</b>. LAN <b>23</b> is, in this case, enhanced for Internet communication. IPR <b>25</b> is connected to LAN <b>23</b> and functions as an event router as previously described above. Other equipment may also be connected to LAN <b>23</b> such as a customer information server (CIS), a statistical server, and other communication-center systems and equipment not shown here but assumed to be present. Processor <b>65</b> is connected to LAN <b>23</b> by a LAN connection <b>67</b>. In this way, information about COST callers being handled at LSW <b>59</b> may be routed over LAN <b>23</b> to destination PC/VDUs such as PC/VDU <b>35</b> in station <b>29</b> for example. Information about COST callers can also be handled by CSW <b>53</b> and routed over LAN <b>23</b> to destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art, that there may be many more workstations manned by communication-center agents than are illustrated in this embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Similarly, there may be many more CTI functions represented herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, IVR capability may be present at LSW <b>59</b>, as well as at CSW <b>53</b>. Automated systems such as automated fax systems and e-mail systems may also be present. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A status server <b>49</b> is provided within communication center <b>21</b> and adapted to monitor agent status and availability for receiving incoming communication events. Status server <b>49</b> is connected to LAN <b>23</b> by virtue of a LAN connection and monitors status at each workstation <b>27</b>-<b>31</b>. Software used for this purpose is not illustrated in this embodiment, but may be assumed to be present and operational within server <b>49</b>. Agents manning stations <b>27</b>-<b>31</b> may monitored as to how many calls are in their respective queues whether they are COST queues, IP queues, or virtual queues of either type. Estimated waiting times for each queue of each agent are determined using call-handling statistics available within center <b>21</b>. The information gathered to be made available t users may also be more extensive in scope, involving status of groups of agents and the like. Server <b>49</b> is capable of monitoring the status of each agent in real-time, but for practical purposes, may perform periodic status checks on a frequent basis such that real-time parameters are closely emulated. All current status information for every agent logged on to LAN <b>23</b> is compiled by server <b>49</b> and maintained as long as it is current.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An instance of Communication-Center-Presence Software (CCPS) <b>50</b> is provided within server <b>49</b> and adapted to interface with agent-monitoring software per instance of client request initiated through WS <b>15</b>. Status server <b>49</b> is, in this embodiment connected directly to WS <b>15</b> by a separate high-speed data link <b>20</b>. This implementation is not specifically required to practice the present invention, however the presence of link <b>20</b> enhances server-to-server communication. In the absence of data link <b>20</b>, all communication between WS <b>15</b> and status server <b>49</b> would be conducted over Internet connection line <b>19</b>, through IPR <b>25</b>, and over LAN <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In practice of the present invention in one preferred embodiment, user <b>9</b> accesses Internet <b>61</b> over Internet connection line <b>11</b> and logs into WS <b>15</b>. WS <b>15</b> serves a Web page as a response to a request from user <b>9</b>. The Web page requested is hosted by the entity hosting communication center <b>21</b> and therefore contains information about communication center <b>21</b> including contact links, product information, telephone numbers, and any other pertinent information that may be found on a customer interface. In addition to the more typical information contained in the Web page representing communication center <b>21</b>, a Web form (not shown) is made available for the purpose of taking a user's status request before requiring the user to place an actual call or initiate any contact with center <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The Web form, which is part of WPS <b>16</b>, allows a user to enter such information as a product description, profile information, or a purpose for the desired contact with communication center <b>21</b>. WPS <b>16</b>, upon receiving and registering a request from user <b>9</b> sends an instant message/request over high-speed data link <b>20</b> to status server <b>49</b>. CCPS <b>50</b> parses the request and obtains the most current status information from server <b>49</b> that matches the intent of the request. For example, if user <b>9</b> desires to purchase a four-wheel drive pickup, and communication center <b>21</b> is a car dealership, then CCPS <b>50</b> will only obtain status information connected to those agents within center <b>21</b> responsible for four-wheel drive sales.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once status information is obtained by server <b>49</b>, it is sent in the form of a response from server <b>49</b> to WS <b>15</b> whereupon it may be made available to user <b>9</b>. In another embodiment, the status response may be sent to user <b>9</b> along with a subsequent Web page whereupon the information is caused to be a part of the web page at the location of user <b>9</b>. In this case, CPS <b>10</b> would incorporate the information into the display of the subsequent Web page.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In still another embodiment, CCPS <b>50</b> may obtain all of the current agent-status information available from communication center <b>21</b> and send it to WS <b>15</b> over link <b>20</b> on a periodic or real-time basis. WPS <b>16</b> would, in this case, the enhanced with a filtering capability of filtering status information that closely matches a user request. Also in this case, an instant message would not need to be sent from WS <b>15</b> to status server <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a simple embodiment, status information viewable by user <b>9</b> would include any listed agents, number of calls in their queues, and estimated time waiting for agent availability with respect to each queue. For example, agent JIM may have 5 COST calls waiting, 5 IP calls waiting, and 8 unanswered emails. Therefore, agent Jim may be considered unavailable for immediate service. An estimated time waiting for Jim to respond may be averaged over all his media types, or maybe specified for each media type. User <b>9</b> may initiate a refresh action in order to obtain an update of status information. Contact links and other options may be presented in association with listed agents and agent status figures.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An interface of the type described above enables users to essentially browse agent-availability statistics before initiating any type of contact with communication center <b>21</b>. In the event that a response message or downloaded interface reveals an available agent, user <b>9</b> could initiate contact with that agent using provided contact links or information.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that there are many configuration possibilities that exist with respect to reporting agent-availability status of agents within communication center <b>21</b> to requesting user <b>9</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Instant messaging or embedding the information into Web pages before or after download are techniques which may be employed to practice the present invention. Likewise, the status information may be made a part of a Web browser's tool bar or caused to open in an interactive window that pops up on a user's screen when the data is ready for display. In still another embodiment user station <b>9</b> may contact IPR <b>25</b> via connection <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>19</b> and retrieve pertinent information maintained through CCPS <b>50</b>. This data may be displayed independently or integrated with a Web page from server <b>15</b>. The functionality of WPS <b>16</b> at Web server <b>15</b> in retrieving information from communication center <b>21</b> via CCPS <b>50</b> is but a single example of how a system according to the present invention may function. It has been described that similar functionality may be provided by CPS <b>10</b> at a client station, and that there is no limitation to the client station operating only through a Web server. In a broad sense, the means of communication of client station <b>9</b> with communication center <b>21</b> is not limiting to the invention. The cooperation of gathering software (CCPS <b>50</b>) at a communication center with an interface software (CPS <b>10</b>) at a client station is novel.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a further aspect, there are a variety of ways that the client stations in such a system may become enabled. In the system wherein retrieval of communication center status info is by software (WPS <b>16</b>) at server <b>15</b>, there is no need for additional software at the client station. A conventional browser will do. In the cases wherein software CPS <b>10</b> is enabled at a client station, that software may be sent to a client on a CD (for example), sent to the client in the background on accessing a Web page at server <b>15</b>, downloaded intentionally by a client at station <b>9</b> as a plug-in to a Web browser, and in other ways as well.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of a client-side media-interface <b>69</b> that contains status information according to an embodiment of the present invention. Interface <b>69</b> is an exemplary representation of a customer interface displaying agent-availability status after it has been requested and delivered. Interface <b>69</b> may be an integrated part of a Web page (incl. e.g. script, Java, Java script, X-Windows script, plug-in etc. etc.), a pop-up information window, an instant message interface, or any other mechanism of computerized display.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one embodiment, interface <b>69</b> is a product of CPS <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this embodiment, WPS <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> sends agent-availability information to user <b>9</b> over Internet connection <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>19</b>, and CPS <b>10</b> incorporates information into an interactive display-window or into the actual Web page served by server <b>15</b>. In another embodiment, interface <b>69</b> is a product of WPS <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and is embedded into the actual Web page before it is served to user <b>9</b>. In still another embodiment, interface <b>69</b> is a product of WPS <b>16</b> and is served to user <b>9</b> in the form of a standard instant-message interface using any of several known protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this basic example, agent-availability status is generalized to a group of agents and displayed as 3 parameters. These are a number of available agents <b>71</b>, a number of calls waiting <b>73</b>, and an estimated hold time <b>75</b>. In this case the information represents the most basic information available for the target group of agents. In this case there are 12 available agents that are handling the subject of request resulting in interface <b>69</b>. There are 25 calls waiting in a queue shared by the 12 available agents. The average estimated hold time for one of the 12 agents to respond to an immediately placed call is 2 minutes and 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this example, three interactive options are presented within interface <b>69</b>, in this case, below the agent-availability information. A contact option <b>72</b> is provided to allow a viewing customer to initiate an IP-to-IP telephone call, or an IP-to-COST telephone call. A contact option <b>74</b> enables a viewing customer to send an e-mail, which would be routed to one of the 12 available agents. A contact option <b>76</b> enables a viewing customer to initiate a callback from one of the 12 available agents. Using callback option <b>76</b> enables an invoking user to be entered into a virtual queue. A user in this case may expect a callback at approximately 2 minutes and 10 seconds after initiating the contact. In actual practice, the availability and variety of interactive contact options is dependent upon enterprise rules and available media. One with skill in the art will recognize that there are many alternative display scenarios which may be used with interface <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a more advanced case, interface <b>69</b> may contain much more detailed information including information that a specific to a user request invoking the interface. For example, each of the available agents <b>71</b> may be listed separately instead of collectively as illustrated herein. The number of calls waiting may be broken down to reflect the exact number of calls waiting for each available agent. Furthermore, estimated hold times may be determined individually for each busy agent. Likewise, additional information about agents may be listed such as skill levels, language preferences, ranking within the organization, and so on. The level at which detailed agent-availability data may be compiled and presented depends entirely on the sophistication and configuration of agent monitoring software in use within communication center.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating client and system procedural steps for practicing communication-center presence reporting according to an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>77</b>, the user logs onto a DPN, which in a preferred case, is the Internet network. At step <b>79</b>, the user of step <b>77</b> navigates to a Web site hosted by a communication center that the user desires to contact. At this point, a Web form may be present on a main Web page of the Web site navigated to in step <b>79</b>. Such a Web form would prompt a user for his or her intent or reason for the desired contact. These reasons are as wide-ranging as are enterprises that might host such a Web form. For example, a list of product descriptions may be presented for selection. Levels of contact priority may be established in the case of priority queuing, amongst others possibly based on user ID. Available options are limited only by enterprise rules.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>81</b>, a user enters the information solicited from him or her by the above-described Web form. At step <b>83</b>, the user submits the Web form. At step <b>84</b>, a Web presence server analogous to Web server <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> receives the request sent by the user of step <b>83</b>. At step <b>85</b>, the Web presence server forwards the request received in step <b>84</b> to a communication-center presence server analogous to server <b>49</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At this point, software analogous to CCPS <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> analyzes the received request and pulls the most current agent-availability data for the purpose of servicing the request. At step <b>86</b>, the applicable data is sent in the form of a response back to the Web presence server of step <b>85</b>. It is noted herein, that this communication between servers may occur over a separate high-speed data line as was described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above. Moreover, the server-to-server transaction may follow known request/response models used in Internet transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the applicable data is received at the Web presence server, software analogous to WPS <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may integrate the information into a subsequent Web page to be sent back to the user of step <b>77</b>, or it may formulate the response as an instant message, which is immediately dispatched act to user <b>77</b>. At step <b>87</b> then, the applicable data is delivered to the user of step <b>77</b> and is displayed as an interactive interface analogous to interface <b>69</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at step <b>89</b>. At this point, the user of step <b>77</b> may initiate contact with the target communication center or wait for a better time for contact initiation based on user-analysis of the received data. It is also noted herein that the user requesting the data may refresh his or her request periodically to obtain the most current agent-availability data during a session period. In some cases, the requesting user may receive streaming data in real-time showing continual changes in agent-availability status over the time spent viewing the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art, that the customer/system process steps illustrated in this example may be altered in description and order without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the Web presence server of step <b>84</b> may have a local access to the most current agent-availability data at the instant of receiving a request. This was described an embodiment wherein agent-availability data from the target communication center is periodically pushed or continually streamed to the Web presence server. Moreover, the agent-availability data may be integrated into a Web page at server side or client side dependent upon software implementation. In one embodiment, the entire transaction process from request to response and display is conducted using an instant message protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The method and apparatus of the present invention may be practiced on the Internet, a private or corporate WAN or LAN network or in any combination thereof. Web server <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be hosted by a single communication center or shared by a plurality of communication centers. In the latter case, it is more likely that agent-availability data will be pulled from the providing communication centers rather than pushed to the central location.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Client-Status Monitoring Capabilities</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In another aspect of the present invention an enhancement is provided that enables agents operating from within communications-centers to monitor client availability status for the purpose of callback optimization. In particular, in cases where the client has many media available, a collection of all media statuses is generated, and then presented as an amalgamated status to an agent or robotic agent. Additionally, the preferred mode and time for a back connection may be available as well.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one aspect of the system, client on-/off-line status information and the client's callback preferences are obtained at the same time using the same protocol. In another aspect of the system, client on-/off-line status information and the client's callback preferences are obtained independently, for instance using a presence service such as ICQ™ for the on-/off-line status information and HTTP or WAP for obtaining the client's callback preferences, or for instance during a previous communication between the client and an agent of the communication center.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one aspect of the system, client-status information is obtained from a single client terminal, such as a PC. In another aspect of the system, partial client-status information is obtained from multiple independent client terminals, such as a PC and a cellular phone, and combined to provide complete client-status information to the subscribing agent. In one aspect of the system, client on-/off-line status information is obtained concerning a single terminal device, such as a PC. In another aspect of the system, client on-/off-line status information is obtained concerning multiple independent terminal devices, such as a PC and a cellular phone, and combined to provide complete client on-/off-line status information.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one aspect of the system, client-status information is obtained using a single protocol, such as ICQ™. In another aspect of the system, partial client-status information is obtained using multiple protocols, such as ICQ™ and MSN Messenger Service™, and combined to provide complete client-status information to the subscribing agent. In one aspect of the system, client-status information is obtained via a single network, such as the Internet network. In another aspect of the system, partial client-status information is obtained via multiple networks, such as the Internet network and the cellular network, and combined to provide complete client-status information to the subscribing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an overview of a communications network <b>92</b> wherein agent monitoring of client status is practiced according to an aspect of the present invention. Communication network <b>92</b> is somewhat analogous to communications network <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above in terms of basic architecture and software implementation. Elements of network <b>52</b>, which are not modified for the purpose of enabling the present invention are not re-introduced with new element numbers. Newly provided or modified elements used in the practice of the present invention are introduced herein having new element numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Communication network <b>92</b> comprises PSTN <b>55</b>, DPN <b>61</b>, communication center <b>21</b>, and an exemplary user <b>9</b> as described above with reference to network <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">PSTN <b>55</b>, as described in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, represents a preferred network connecting all connection-oriented-switched-telephony (COST) clients whom call into communication center <b>21</b> for the purpose of doing business with the center. In another case, a private telephone network may be utilized in place of or in combination with PSTN <b>55</b>. The inventor chooses PSTN <b>55</b> because of its high public-access characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">LSW <b>59</b>, illustrated within PSTN <b>55</b> and represents automated switching capability within the network. LSW <b>59</b> may be an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), a Public Branch Exchange (PBX), or any other type of telephony switching apparatus, in the broadest sense, including but not limited to DNT type switches/gateways as used in Voice over IP (VoIP) etc. as was previously described. LSW <b>59</b> is CTI enhanced by CTI processor <b>62</b> connected thereto by a CTI connection. TS software provided within CTI processor <b>62</b> enables communication center <b>21</b> to control certain call-switching and routing aspects performed by LSW <b>59</b> as was described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">LSW <b>59</b> is connected to CSW <b>53</b>, illustrated within communication center <b>21</b>, by COST telephony trunk <b>57</b>. CSW <b>53</b> may be any of several types of call processing switches as previously described with respect to LSW <b>59</b> above. CSW <b>53</b> is enhanced by CTI processor <b>65</b>, which is connected thereto by a CTI connection as was described with reference to LSW <b>59</b>. CTI processor <b>65</b> also has an instance of TS software provided therein and adapted to communicate with TS software of processor <b>62</b>. Data network <b>64</b> provides a capability of double dipping described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above. Internet <b>61</b> facilitates all Internet-protocol (IP) callers reaching communication center <b>21</b> through the Internet. Internet <b>61</b> may be a private or corporate Wide Area Network (WAN), or any other type of DPN as long as Internet communication protocols are supported. The inventor chooses Internet <b>61</b> as a preferred network because of it's high public-access characteristic, as stated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. IP callers calling into communication center <b>21</b> may interface from any Internet-connected server, which provides network access to communication center <b>21</b>. Moreover, there may be many such servers distributed throughout network <b>61</b>, each server being a point of access. Internet <b>61</b> is represented by Internet backbone <b>13</b>, which represents all the lines, equipment, and connection points making up the Internet network as a whole, including sub networks.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Status server <b>49</b> is illustrated in this example as having a communication-center-presence-server CCPS <b>94</b> (software) installed therein, which is an enhanced version of CCPS <b>50</b> described in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. CCPS <b>94</b> not only provides clients with agent status information over the WWW, but also allows agents working within center <b>21</b> the capability of subscribing to client status information. More detail regarding the just-described enhancement is provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this example, there are 2 exemplary file servers illustrated as connected to Internet backbone <b>13</b>. These are a customer presence server (CPS) <b>95</b> and a foreign presence server (FPS) <b>93</b>. It is noted herein that CPS <b>95</b> effectively replaces WS <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and can be assumed to provide the formerly-described functionality of server <b>15</b> and associated web presence server (WPS software) <b>16</b> of the same example. CPS <b>95</b> functions as a file server enhanced with an instance of software (SW) <b>97</b>, which may be described, in this embodiment as CPS software <b>97</b>. CPS server <b>95</b> is, in this example, hosted by the same entity hosting communication center <b>21</b> and is utilized as a customer/agent interface.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">CPS SW <b>97</b> is enhanced for the purpose of allowing an agent to subscribe to real-time customer availability information as it applies to the remote station occupied by the customer. In this case, the station refers to remote PC <b>9</b>, also referred to as user <b>9</b> in this specification. User <b>9</b> is connected to backbone <b>13</b> by Internet-access line <b>11</b>, as was described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. CPS <b>95</b> is optional in this example and not specifically required in order to practice the present invention. CPS <b>95</b> represents a collection server that is utilized for collecting and organizing user status-states, which may be subscribed to or otherwise accessed by agents of center <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">FPS server <b>93</b> is adapted as a third-party server similar to those employed by well-known chat and instant messaging services. FPS <b>93</b> may be assumed to have software installed therein, and is adapted to organize instant communication between clients using a supported instant messaging service operating under a known protocol such as RFC2778 as was described in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is noted in this example, that CPS server <b>95</b> is connected to status server <b>49</b> within communication center <b>21</b> by high-speed data connection <b>20</b>. A second high-speed data connection <b>19</b> is provided for connecting FPS server <b>93</b> to status server <b>49</b>. In this respect, status server <b>49</b> has access capability to both CPS <b>95</b> and FPS <b>93</b>. It is similarly noted herein, that high-speed data-access lines connecting server <b>49</b> to servers <b>95</b> and <b>93</b> are not required in order to practice the present invention. Server <b>49</b> may instead of adapted to connect to Internet backbone <b>13</b> using a 24×7 or a switched Internet connection.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this embodiment, CPS <b>95</b> is hosted by center <b>21</b> and adapted to function in much the same way as FPS <b>93</b>. That is to say that CPS <b>95</b> is a central facility for interaction. In one embodiment of the present invention, CPS <b>95</b> is not present and CPS SW <b>97</b> is instead distributed directly to client machines, as in this case, CPS SW <b>97</b> illustrated as installed in PC <b>9</b>. It is noted herein that the functionality of CPS <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is included in the enhanced version, or CPS SW <b>97</b> shown on PC <b>9</b>. In the absence of server <b>95</b>, with client machines enhanced by SW <b>97</b>, CCPS <b>94</b> interacts directly with the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">User <b>9</b> may be assumed, in this example, to be accessing either FPS <b>93</b>, or CPS <b>95</b> for the purpose of determining agent status information as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and for making status information available to subscribing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">IPR <b>25</b> handles incoming message events sourced from FPS <b>93</b> and/or CPS <b>95</b>. Other than enhanced functionality represented by server <b>49</b> running CCPS <b>94</b> and dual connection capability from server <b>49</b> to CPS <b>95</b> and FPS <b>93</b>, communication center <b>21</b> operates identically to the center (<b>21</b>) described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> including the configuration of agent's workstations and so on. Therefore, detailed re-description of the agent's operating environment (workstations, LAN connectivity, etc) need not be provided in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment of the present invention, PC <b>9</b> has a known instant-messaging software application installed therein and adapted to use FPS <b>93</b> as a centralized communication server. An example of one such messaging service would be the well-known ICQ™service. In this case, CCPS <b>94</b> running on status server <b>49</b> is adapted to support the particular instant-messaging application employed by user <b>9</b> and supported at FPS <b>93</b>. The instant-messaging application is, of course, assumed to be executing on the client machine, shown here as FPS-SW <b>97</b>. For example, CCPS <b>94</b> may be adapted to recognize various descriptive states-of-activity represented at FPS <b>93</b> and associated with real-time communication states of connected users, in this case user <b>9</b>. Examples of such states available through instant messaging services include indications of whether user <b>9</b> may be off-line or online. Other status indications such as “user is away” or “do not disturb” may also be included as standard status indications available with known messaging services.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">CCPS <b>94</b> may be adapted to integrate an enhanced package of status indicators associated with communication-center use into software running on FPS <b>93</b> and on user station <b>9</b> such that user station <b>9</b> may communicate a variety of enhanced status messages to subscribing agents within communication center <b>21</b>. It is also noted herein, that the functionality of agent-status indication as taught in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> above may be integrated into software at FPS <b>93</b> and at user station <b>9</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. One example of an enhanced user-status indication that may be associated with communication center <b>21</b> may be an indication that user <b>9</b> is temporarily away and preferred contact is by cellular phone during this status period. Of course, the cellular phone number of user <b>9</b> would be provided as part of the indication. A communication-center agent, for example, an agent operating PC <b>43</b> within workstation <b>31</b> may subscribe to EPS <b>93</b> utilizing LAN <b>23</b>, server <b>49</b>, and high-speed data link <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In this case, the agent in question may be in various states of communication with a plurality of users connected to have FPS <b>93</b>. According to a push model, user-status indications may be pushed in the form of periodic instant messages to PC <b>43</b>, where they may be viewed by the monitoring agent. The monitoring agent may decide which callback options are appropriate based on user-status indication contained within the content of the instant message. That may be done by other protocol than just IM, e.g. HTTP, WAP, IPNT etc.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to a pull case, the agent operating PC <b>43</b> may subscribe to an interface (not shown) served by FPS <b>93</b> such that current status indications are contained within the interface and viewable on PC <b>43</b>. In this embodiment, status server <b>49</b> executing CCPS <b>94</b> provides interactive interfaces for both clients and agents for the purpose of viewing status. Also in this embodiment, status server <b>49</b> executing CCPS <b>94</b> may facilitate COST outbound dialing from agent to client through CSW <b>53</b> by virtue of connection <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">An agent operating at one of connected workstations <b>27</b>-<b>31</b> may subscribe to real-time status reports associated with a plurality of users connected to FPS <b>93</b>. Subscription may be defined as an active state of dialog established between an agent and the connected users. The dialog states may be initiated and established by users contacting agents through the method of the present invention. Therefore, users who have connected to FPS <b>93</b> and have initiated contact with an agent of communication center <b>21</b> may be considered for status reporting until the purpose of the dialog is achieved or the user is no longer connected to FPS <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some cases, the agent user will not be a human agent but will be a special purpose server (not shown) providing some very specific services. One example of such a special server is a callback server that automatically initiates callback calls to a customer <b>9</b> based on that user's callback preferences and routes the call to an agent after the customer answers. Another example of such a special purpose server is a server that monitors the communication center's status and, on request of the customer <b>9</b>, sends an alert to the customer when the communication center's status matches specific conditions, for instance when the average waiting time is smaller than three minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In a preferred embodiment, there can be multiple FPS and CPS servers in network <b>92</b>. There can for instance be one FPS <b>93</b> for every third-party presence service that is being used in the communication center. There can be for instance an FPS <b>93</b> that is able to obtain the cellular on-/off-line status of the customer's mobile (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In another embodiment, the customer can have multiple terminal devices such as a PC <b>9</b> and a cellular phone (not shown). For each type of terminal equipment there can be a different FPS <b>93</b> to obtain the on-/off-line status of the customer. By combining these partial statuses (SW not shown), for instance in CCPS <b>94</b>, a complete customer status can be presented to the subscribing agent. In one aspect, the CCPS <b>94</b> can combine the presence information of the customer. In another aspect, the customer's PC <b>9</b> can combine the presence information. Take for instance the case where the PC is equipped with a modem-board and where the customer's telephony is also connected to that same modem-board. In this case, the client's PC <b>9</b> can combine the client's on-/off-line status for the customer's fixed line and for the customer's internet access and his ability to participate in a chat session or a net-meeting, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some cases the agent doesn't necessarily have to subscribe for agent status info to the CPS or FPS, the CCPS could take over this job (e.g. agent doesn't use IMPP to subscribe but proprietary protocol). In the latter case the CCPS could subscribe to the CPS or FPS. Generally, it is better to have a call center node subscribe to all different types of CPS and FPS nodes, because there is a need or preference, to combine the customer status information from those different nodes into one presentation for the agent. In some other cases, this CCPS functionality could run on a dedicated node, could be combined with other functionality on a separate node (e.g. embedding the status information in web-page), could run on the agents workstation (or node in case of automated agent), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another aspect of the present invention, CPS <b>95</b> executing CPS SW <b>97</b> functions as a status broker in much the same way as FPS <b>93</b>. The exception being that CPS <b>95</b> is provided as a dedicated customer interface for the sole purpose of communication with communication center <b>21</b>. In this aspect, the instant messaging application, SW <b>97</b>, is proprietary and contains all of the status options and communications options supported by center <b>21</b> and does not have to be integrated with an existing instant messaging service. Provision of CPS <b>95</b> executing CPS SW <b>97</b> enables an agent operating one of workstations <b>27</b>-<b>31</b> within center <b>21</b> to subscribe to a single interface containing real-time or periodically updated status reports concerning all of the connected users which may be in dialog with the agent. In one embodiment, instant messages may be propagated in a push model as described above, instead of having subscription to an interactive interface.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Although in many cases the agent will not be communicating synchronously with the customer while receiving these customer's status info, it is possible to allow that, for example in cases where both the agent and the client need to do something, while communicating as well.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As previously described above, CPS <b>95</b> is optional and is intended to represent the central “place of status exchange” between agents and users, including but not limited to requests, etc. for dialog. According to another embodiment of the present invention CPS SW <b>97</b> is distributed directly to client PC stations similar to PC <b>9</b> as illustrated herein. In this case, status server <b>49</b> executing CCPS <b>94</b> functions as an instant message broker (i.e. proxy) between agents operating workstations <b>27</b>-<b>31</b> and users represented herein as user <b>9</b>. In this case user <b>9</b> would log into a web server analogous to web server <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the purpose of initiating contact with communication center <b>21</b>. Because and interfacing server is used to interface a plurality of users to communication center <b>21</b>, both instant message type status reports and status reports contained with an electronic information pages (web pages) are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some cases, signaling may be sent over the IM protocol, although typically, the other media will provide their own protocol, which will be used respectively, such as H.323 or SIP for IPNT.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In still another embodiment, user <b>9</b> initiates direct contact to communication center <b>21</b> by virtue of a client-installed version of CPS SW <b>97</b>, which would contain all of the appropriate contact mechanisms needed to effect IP-to-IP or IP-to-COST connections over the appropriate network paths to center <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, server <b>49</b> executing CCPS <b>94</b> may still be used as an agent-interface server, to which agents operating stations <b>27</b>-<b>31</b> may subscribe to be in order to view current user status, including but not limited to IP-to-IP events. It is noted herein, that IP-to-COST events would arrive at communication center <b>21</b> after having been routed through PSTN <b>55</b> through an appropriate gateway. However, when such events arrive at CSW <b>53</b> for internal routing, a channel may be opened from server <b>49</b> to the node, which is in this case PC <b>9</b>, from which the incoming event originated if the addressing information is included in the arriving COST event. In this scenario, an agent may interact with a user from a COST telephone and view that user's status information simultaneously. If for some reason the agent must terminate the call, the agent may still subscribe user's online status through the connection established to PC <b>9</b> by server <b>49</b>. Even though there is no active communication between the contacted agent and the initiating user status regarding connectivity state, callback instructions, and so on is immediately available to the contacted agent. Similarly, agent availability and estimated time of response reports associated with the contacted agent are available to user <b>9</b> as long as the connection between user <b>9</b> and server <b>49</b> is open.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In another embodiment, the on-/off-line status information for user <b>9</b> will reach the communication center <b>21</b> independently from the callback preference information for that user <b>9</b>. In one aspect, user <b>9</b> can be invited to fill out some form on a web page in order to specify callback preferences. In still another aspect, an agent can be feeding the customer preferences to the system during a communication with that customer <b>9</b>. In these aspects, the callback preference information can be combined with the on-/off-line status information. In one aspect, the web page can be accessed by the customer using a PC. In another aspect, the web page can be accessed using a mobile device that is for instance WAP enabled. In one aspect, the web-page can be hosted by the FPS <b>93</b> or the CPS <b>95</b>. In another aspect, it can be hosted by another server (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In still another embodiment, the customer's preferred third-party presence service can be part of the callback preferences. There are many third-party presence services such as, but not limited to, ICQ™ and MSN Messenger Service™. A user <b>9</b> that is a member of one these presence services, can allow agents of the communication center to monitor it's presence status by communicating it's preferred presence service to the communication center. In an aspect of the invention a customer that isn't a member of a third-party presence service can be allowed by the communication center to download the tools for a communication center specific presence service.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified logical connection diagram illustrating functionality of principally software elements in an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> CCPS <b>119</b> is illustrated as operable in a communication center <b>117</b> for receiving status from client devices and other information to be provided to agents. As described above, the agents may be live agents or robotic agents.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> there are two clients (persons) labeled Client <b>1</b> and Client <b>2</b>. There are four client devices <b>129</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>137</b>, and <b>125</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Client <b>1</b> has a PC <b>129</b> at his home, which executes an instance of FPS-SW <b>131</b>, which is, in this case, AOL. Client <b>1</b> also has a PC <b>137</b> at his office executing an instance of CPS-SW <b>195</b>. CPS-SW <b>139</b> is provided by the host of communication center <b>117</b>. Further, Client <b>1</b> has a WAP telephone <b>125</b> executing an instance of FPS-SW <b>127</b>, provided by Sprint in this example. Lastly there is a second client (Client <b>2</b>) operating a PC <b>133</b>, the PC executing an instance of FPS-SW <b>135</b>, in this example also AOL.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A first Foreign Presence Service Server (FPSS) <b>121</b> monitors both instances of AOL (and any other instances at client premises not shown), and provides presence information to CCPS <b>119</b>, which is enabled for AOL and is executing in communication center <b>117</b>. A second FPSS <b>123</b> monitors WAP telephone <b>123</b>. CCPS <b>119</b> monitors CPS-SW <b>139</b> executing on PC <b>137</b>, although alternatively, there may be an intermediate Client Presence Service Server between PC <b>137</b> and CCPS <b>119</b>, not shown here. Furthermore, in some cases additional servers maybe inserted as proxies etc. between for example FPSS <b>121</b>,<b>123</b> and CPSS <b>119</b> etc., not shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It may be assumed, for example, that Client <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may move between his PCs and carry his WAP telephone with him, being variously connected and available through the three client devices <b>125</b>, <b>129</b>, and <b>137</b>. Real time monitoring of all of these devices by CCPS <b>119</b> directly and through FPSS instances provides valuable information to a real or robotic agent associated with Center <b>117</b>, together with client preference information which may be achieved by any of several paths, as described above, in real time or according to pre-programmed preferences. The ability of agents, real or robotic, to respond to client's needs is therefore greatly enhanced. The skilled artisan will recognize that both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are greatly simplified illustrations, and there may be many more clients, client devices, and instances of FPS and CPS servers and software involved in many ways. The diagrams and accompanying descriptions are provided to convey the essentials of the invention and its functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art, that the method and apparatus of the present invention may be applied to a variety of connection scenarios without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Similarly, the software of the present invention may be provided in a variety of functionalities ranging from an extendable application program interface (API) to an existing instant-messaging service to a fully functional server-driven service application including client-side and server-side components.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art, that instant messages following standard instant message protocol can be sent back and forth between subscribing agents and clients without departing from the spirit and scope the present invention. In addition to instant messaging, status alerts may take the form of pager messages or other types of known alerts when a client status is determined to be off-line.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plan view of an exemplary agent-side media-interfaces <b>99</b> and <b>101</b> containing availability status and callback parameters according to an embodiment of the present invention. Interface <b>99</b> may take the form of instant message, a messaging window integrated into an electronic information page (web page), or any other graphics interface that may be propagated over network lines to subscribing devices. In this simple example, Joe Customer has a status of ONLINE and the requested callback medium of voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Other callback mediums listed in interface <b>99</b> include a COST medium and a Pager medium.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In a one case, an agent subscribes to the status of Joe Customer during a dialog session typically initiated by Joe Customer. Interface <b>101</b> is analogous informed to interface <b>99</b> with the exception that the indicated status is OFFLINE. The status depicted in interface <b>101</b> is an indication to a subscribing agent that Joe is no longer connected to an interfacing server on the network. If Joe is connected to the network but no activity is recognized for a predetermined period of time, Joe's status may be determined to be AWAY. In this example, interface <b>101</b> depicts a pager medium as a preferred callback option.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In another case of the invention, a single agent may subscribe to a plurality of customer status messages simultaneously such that he or she may manage outbound calling in a more optimal fashion. Moreover, because the messaging is bi-directional Joe may receive alerts or messages indicating estimated waiting time for a callback, or perhaps instant message data that resolves the current dialog between Joe and an agent. In the latter case, instant messaging may be used to dispose of calls.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating agent and system procedural steps for observing customer status and call back preferences according to an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>107</b>, a communication-center agent subscribes to customer presence server <b>95</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this case, through status server <b>49</b> within communication center <b>21</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is assumed in this step that the subscribing agent already has at least one customer who has initiated contact with the subscribing agent through server <b>95</b>. It may be that the subscribing agent is working with a plurality of customers also connected to server <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">At step <b>109</b>, the subscribing agent is served one or more instant messages containing customer status information. In one embodiment, a single interface such as a web page containing status data categorized for each customer the agent is working with is served at step <b>109</b>. In this case, status information related to each customer the agent is subscribing to may be contained in separate windows or lists available within interface. In another embodiment, the subscribing agent may select a customer and receive an instant message regarding that customer's status.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">At step <b>111</b>, the subscribing agent observes the customers status relating to whether the customer it is online or off-line. At step <b>113</b>, the subscribing agent observes the customer's call back preferences, which may very according to the customer's connection status. Call back preferences may include but are not limited to IP phone, cellular, e-mail, pager, COST telephone, interactive chat, and so on. At step <b>115</b>, the subscribing agent takes action based on the customer's status and stated call back preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one case of the invention, CPS <b>95</b> may be facilitated as sort of a callback queue wherein a plurality of the agent's customers may be directed to if the agent of contact happened to be busy at the time of contact. During the period of waiting, customer status and call back preferences are propagated to the subscribing agent and estimated times of response and other information they be propagated to the waiting customers. Flexibility exists in this embodiment in that unlike any normal call-waiting queue, the customer is free to move about and even disconnect from the network and go about normal business while waiting for a callback.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the case of a customer terminating his connection with server <b>95</b>, the subscribing agent will be served an instant message reflecting the customer's off-line status and a medium wherein the agent may contact the customer off-line such as a COST telephone, a pager, or some other off-line medium.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In another case of the invention, a priority state may be applied to the plurality of customers waiting for a response from a particular agent. In this embodiment, the customers may subscribe to estimated-waiting time alerts regardless of whether they are online or off-line. For example, a customer may indicate that an alert be sent to his or her paging device approximately five minutes before an agent is estimated to respond by calling the customer on his or her cell phone the event that the customer has gone off-line from the interfacing server. The subscribing agent is served the off-line status, which includes the preferred call back medium and the appropriate cell phone number to call. The page alert to the customer they be propagated by the interfacing server if the server is equipped with outbound dialing capability into a telephony network. In this case the server has the communication-center status information of the agent including the estimated times for the agent to handle his or her calls in queue.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The method and apparatus of the present invention may be practiced over a communications network comprising any combination of Data-Packet, COST, and wireless networks utilizing appropriate gateways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, many variations of customer states and agent states may be included as options for configuration into the software the present invention. For example, a client may configure as many devices into the system as desired for enabling agent callbacks under a variety of circumstances. Similarly, an agent may subscribe singularly or in a plural sense to specific customer states.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In still another case of the invention, a central server such as CPS <b>95</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be dedicated to communication-center <b>21</b> such that all interfacing customers have status interfaces which are available to all subscribing agents. In this case, subscribing agent may browse and subscribe to selected customer states based on agent/customer match-up. For example, a subscribing agent specializing home loans for example, may log into the system and subscribe to any customers connected the system who have initiated an inquiry to communication center <b>21</b> regarding loans. There are many variant possibilities.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Personal Interaction Client-Center Interface</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">According to another aspect of the present invention, a personalized client-center interface is provided, which in addition to accommodating the agent/client presence services described above, provides an interactive capability to clients for the purpose of enabling the client to perform a number of communication-center related tasks without involving agent interaction. In one embodiment, for example, the client is enabled to access information at the communication center, and to check thereby the status of a transaction. In this and other embodiments a client can access a variety of other information, and interact with communication center capabilities in a number of ways. The method and apparatus of the present invention is enabled in various embodiments by the teachings presented below.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an overview of a communications network <b>177</b> wherein a personal interaction-center system is utilized according to an embodiment of the present invention. Communications network <b>117</b> is somewhat analogous to communications network <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above in terms of basic architecture and software implementation. Elements of network <b>92</b> which are not modified for the purpose of enabling the present invention are not re-introduced with new element numbers. Communications network <b>117</b> comprises PSTN <b>55</b>, DPN <b>61</b>, communication center <b>21</b>, and an exemplary user <b>9</b> as described above with reference to network <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">PSTN <b>55</b>, as described in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, represents a preferred network connecting all COST clients who call into communication center <b>21</b> for the purpose of doing business with the center. PSTN <b>55</b> is connected to the communication center <b>21</b> through COST telephony trunk <b>57</b> and data network <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In this example there are 2 exemplary file servers illustrated as connected to Internet backbone <b>13</b>. These are a customer presence server (CPS) <b>95</b> and a customer interaction server (CIS) <b>119</b>. It is noted herein that CPS <b>95</b> is identical with CPS <b>95</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and can be assumed to provide the formerly described functionality of server <b>95</b> and associated web presence server software <b>97</b> of the same example. CPS server <b>95</b> is, in this example, hosted by the same entity hosting communication center <b>21</b> and is utilized as an agent/customer interface.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">CIS <b>119</b> is provided as a single example of a way in which the functionality of the present invention may be implemented. There are a number of other ways within the spirit and scope of the invention that this may be done, such as by utilizing the functions described above provided by WS <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with those of FPS <b>93</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The overall functionality may also be provided by utilizing the functions of WS <b>15</b> with those of CPS <b>95</b>. Further, there is no implication here that the user interface, in the case of a Web page, by hosted by a third party. The descriptions of the functions of CIS <b>119</b> in great detail in the following material is to be construed in this light, that there needs be an interface, and that described is exemplary, and that the functions may be provided differently within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">CPS SW <b>97</b> is enhanced for the purpose of allowing an agent to subscribe to real-time customer availability information as it applies to the remote station occupied by the customer. In this case, the station refers to remote PC <b>9</b>, also referred to as user <b>9</b> in this specification. User <b>9</b> is connected to the Internet backbone <b>13</b> by access line <b>11</b>, as was described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. CPS <b>95</b> represents a collection server that is utilized for collecting and organizing client status information, which may be subscribed to or otherwise accessed by agents of communication center <b>21</b>. CPS <b>95</b> is optional in this example and not specifically required in order to practice the present invention as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It is noted in this example, that CPS server <b>95</b> is connected to status server <b>49</b> within communications center <b>21</b> by high-speed data connection <b>20</b>. A second high-speed data connection <b>22</b> is provided for connecting CIS server <b>119</b> to status server <b>49</b>. In this respect, status server <b>49</b> has identical high-speed access capability to both CPS <b>95</b> and CIS <b>119</b>. It is similarly noted herein, that high-speed data-access lines connecting server <b>49</b> to servers <b>95</b> and <b>119</b> are not required in order to practice the present invention. Server <b>49</b> may instead be adapted to connect to Internet backbone <b>13</b> using such as a switched Internet connection.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this embodiment, CPS <b>95</b>, enhanced by CPS SW <b>97</b>, is hosted by communication center <b>21</b> and adapted to function in much the same manner as CIS <b>119</b>. That is to say that CPS <b>95</b> is a central facility for interaction. Agents <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> may be assumed, in this example, to be accessing either CIS <b>119</b>, or CPS <b>95</b> for the purpose of determining client status information and for making status information available to servicing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">IPR <b>25</b> handles incoming message events sourced from CIS <b>119</b> and/or CPS <b>95</b>. Other than enhanced functionality represented by server <b>49</b> running CCPS <b>94</b> and dual connection capability from server <b>49</b> to CPS <b>95</b> and CIS <b>119</b>, communication center <b>21</b> operates identically to the center (<b>21</b>) described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> including the configuration of agent's workstations and so on. Therefore, detailed re-description of the agent's operating environment (workstations, LAN connectivity, etc.) will not be provided in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Agents <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> may be assumed, in this example, to access either CIS <b>119</b>, or CPS <b>95</b> for the purpose of determining client status information in a similar manner as that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above so that the information can be used for optimizing call-back scenarios. It is again noted that in the absence of CPS <b>95</b>, it's function may be assumed to be provided to server <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">IPR <b>25</b> handles incoming message events sourced from CIS <b>119</b> and/or CPS <b>95</b>. Other than enhanced functionality represented by server <b>49</b> running CCPS <b>94</b> and dual connection capability from server <b>49</b> to CPS <b>95</b> and CIS <b>119</b>, communication center <b>21</b> operates identically to the center (<b>21</b>) described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> including the configuration of agent's workstations and so on. Therefore, detailed re-description of agent's operating environment (workstations, LAN connectivity, etc.) will not be provided in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A distributed software application is provided to reside in one part on server <b>119</b> as software (SW) <b>121</b> and in one part as software (<b>123</b>) residing at remote station <b>9</b>. SW <b>121</b> is adapted to enable a user operating station <b>9</b> through SW <b>123</b> to subscribe to a personalized and interactive activity interface (SW <b>121</b>). It is noted herein that while not required, SW <b>121</b> may incorporate the presence reporting capabilities taught in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (SW <b>97</b>) and of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (WPS <b>16</b>). The inventor intends that the three capabilities taught, customer presence reporting, agent presence reporting, and personalized client interaction capabilities may be combined, if desired, into a single distributed software implementation namely SW <b>121</b> and SW <b>123</b>. However, one with skill in the art will recognize that each capability taught may be separately implemented by both hardware and software provisions.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In one embodiment of the present invention, SW <b>123</b> residing on PC <b>9</b> is a known instant-messaging software adapted to enable client connection to CIS <b>119</b> as a centralized communication server. An example of one such known messaging service would be the well-known ICQ™ service. In this case, CCPS <b>94</b> running on status server <b>49</b> would be adapted to support the particular instant-messaging application employed by user <b>9</b> and supported at CIS <b>119</b> by SW <b>121</b>. In this case server <b>119</b> may be hosted by the entity hosting general IM services and through special arrangement, may provide personalized interfaces enabling client interaction to common clients of center <b>21</b> and the entity hosting server <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In a preferred embodiment, SW <b>121</b> provides interactive activity interfaces of the form of dynamic WEB pages complete with instant messaging capabilities. In this embodiment, SW <b>123</b> at station <b>9</b> represents a thin client application that may operate in a stand-alone fashion or be plugged into a client's browser application.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In another embodiment, server <b>119</b> is hosted by the same entity that hosts center <b>21</b>. In this regard, SW instances <b>121</b> and <b>123</b> are dedicated applications enabling client interaction capability with various communication-center resources.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">CCPS <b>94</b> running on status server <b>94</b> is adapted to handle brokering of all of the targeted resource information from center <b>21</b> as well as all of the client presence data from a plurality of clients. For example, CCPS <b>94</b> is adapted to integrate and distribute to SW <b>121</b> an enhanced package of client-accessible and researchable data resources associated with communication-center activity as it pertains to a requesting client in a personalized manner. Such data, incorporated into a dynamic interface by virtue of SW <b>121</b> running on CIS <b>119</b>, is accessible to clients operating SW <b>123</b>, in this case, running on user station <b>9</b>. In addition to providing interactive access to communication-center resources, instant messaging may be employed such that agents <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> may be able to communicate a variety of enhanced status messages to communicating clients being served by communication center <b>21</b>. It is also noted herein, that the functionality of agent-status indication as taught above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, may be integrated into software at CIS <b>119</b> and accessible from user station <b>9</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. A communication-center agent, for example, an agent operating PC <b>43</b> within workstation <b>31</b> may subscribe to CIS <b>119</b> utilizing LAN <b>23</b>, server <b>49</b>, and high-speed data link <b>22</b> for the purpose of determining client presence, as well as for assisting a client with interactive tasks, if required.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In a preferred implementation of the present invention, a client (<b>9</b>) can verify a current interaction status between himself or herself and communication center <b>21</b> without initiating a call to the center. Center <b>21</b> can also verify the status of client <b>9</b> without initiating a callback. The further goal of this specification is to enable client <b>9</b> to perform a variety of center-related tasks, which may be performed without agent involvement. Such tasks may include, but are not limited to, checking current status of an order-in-progress, reviewing interaction history regarding events leading to an order-in-progress, modifying or canceling orders-in-progress, researching available product data, initiating contact with entities of center <b>21</b>, subscribing to personalized notices of events including special sales and promotions, changing personal contact and status information, requesting a callback from the communication center specifying a specific medium and specifying a specific time, initiating a communication with the communication center and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In one embodiment, client interaction at CIS <b>119</b> is open such that any subscribing agent in question may monitor states of activity of a plurality of users actively connected to CIS <b>119</b>. According to a push model, user-status indications may be pushed in the form of periodic instant messages to, for example, PC <b>43</b>, where they may be, for example, viewed by a monitoring agent working station <b>31</b>. In this case, a monitoring agent may decide whether or not to become actively involved in interaction with a client. For example, if a client is reviewing interaction history regarding a particular product of interest handled by a monitoring agent, that agent may invite the client to a pre-scheduled chat session about the product, or perhaps an impromptu chat, which may lead to an additional sale. There are many possibilities when one considers full instant messaging and chat capability.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">According to one embodiment, an agent operating PC <b>43</b> may subscribe to an interface (not shown) served by CIS <b>119</b> such that current status indications are contained within the interface and viewable on PC <b>43</b>. In this embodiment, status server <b>49</b> executing CIS <b>119</b> provides interactive interfaces for both clients and agents for the purpose of viewing status and as a predecessor to impending dialogue. Also in this embodiment, status server <b>49</b> executing CCPS <b>94</b> may facilitate COST outbound dialing from agent to client through CSW <b>53</b> by virtue of connection <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">An agent operating one of the connected workstations <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> or <b>31</b> may subscribe real-time status reports associated with a plurality of users connected to CIS <b>119</b> as previously described. Subscription may be defined as an active or in-active state of dialog established between an agent and the connected users. The dialog states may be initiated and established by users contacting agents through the method of the present invention or by agents contacting users.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Although the present specification teaches a personalized interaction capability whereby clients may interact with various communication-center hosted resources, it will be clear to one with skill in the art that bi-directional status reporting as taught in the cross-referenced specifications, disclosure of which is encompassed by description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, may also be provided through the same interface. An example of such an enhanced interface is presented below.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a plan view of an interactive user interface <b>125</b> served by CIS <b>119</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the Personal Interaction User Interface (PIUI) <b>125</b> is composed of two sub-elements or sections. These are a section labeled Add/Edit Information and a section labeled View Status. In this embodiment, the Add/Edit Information element is made up of four basic categories of data used to create a dynamic multifaceted profile of a client that is accessible to communication center entities. These four categories represent interactive add/edit functions illustrated in this example, by an element number <b>127</b> (critical account and personal data), an element number <b>129</b> (network-capable appliance communication information), an element number <b>131</b> (personal agenda information), and an element number <b>133</b> (personal interests data). The information described in sub-element <b>133</b> lends itself to life style and preferences of a client and therefore is established in a manner as to be updated as often as is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The section of interface <b>125</b> labeled View Status comprises two basic categories. These categories are illustrated herein by element number <b>135</b> ( view interaction history) and element <b>137</b> (view communication center status). The information described in category <b>135</b> relates to current and past interaction history between a client operating interface <b>125</b> and entities of a communication center. Entities as defined herein may also be assumed to include automated systems. The information described in category <b>137</b> relates to status information made available by the center upon request and, in some cases, dependant on the nature of the request.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition to the above, element <b>139</b> is for viewing the status of individual agents as personal account managers, allowing a user to monitor calls holding for the agent, estimated hold time, and to submit a call-back request. Element <b>141</b> allows the user to initiate a communication in any one of a variety of formats, as indicated. As can be seen in this example, interface <b>125</b> covers all of the functionality described in the embodiments introduced by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, every client subscribing to the system of the present invention is provided with at least an identification parameter (member ID number). In this way, data obtained and stored from internal and external sources is easily identifiable to a particular client. In addition, passwords and log-in requirements may be instituted depending on enterprise rules. Much profile information about clients may be automatically compiled using on-going historical data resulting from ongoing relationships with clients. Such data, if available, may automatically appear in the described Add/Edit Information section of interface <b>125</b> when first created. It is important to note herein that the data categories <b>127</b>, <b>129</b>, <b>131</b>, and <b>133</b> may be populated using automatic interaction recording methods during communication center interaction events.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring now to personal data category <b>127</b>, this information is illustrated herein as divided into various basic subcategories. These subcategories are listed from top to bottom as: login name, password, address, and age, marital status, etc. Each category may be further divided into more subcategories as deemed appropriate. As data is automatically compiled about a client over time, the client's profile becomes more and more accurate. Interface <b>125</b> enables a client to manually add or edit information at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Element <b>129</b> provides information relating to the network-capable appliance capabilities of the client. This element is divided into various subcategories befitting the status of the client. In this example, the subcategories are Email, cell phone, telephone, and pager. This element may be edited continuously in keeping with the changing requirements of the client. Additional communication capabilities may include but are not limited to IP phone, PC applications such as specific chat interfaces, file-share programs, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Element <b>131</b> reflects personal agenda information provided by a client and is divided into various subcategories that pertain to the client's personal preferences relative to time and date available for communicating with agents at the communication center and preferred method or methods of communication. Personal agenda information may be edited frequently as a client's personal state changes.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Element <b>133</b> pertains to personal interests of a client and is divided into multiple subcategories. In this example, the subcategories listed include interest lists, subscriptions, and product updates. Category <b>133</b> is, in this example, a vehicle through which a client may communicate general desires to agent's of a communication center. For example, interest lists may detail all of a client's particular interests whether related to communication-center business or not. By knowing interests of a client, agents may be better able to relate to the client on a personal level. Moreover, interests may be taken into consideration when serving the client. Subscriptions may include client subscriptions to communication-center provided material as well as to materials provided by other sources. Product updates may include requests to add notifications of when new or newly enhanced products offered by the communication center are available. Frequent client editing and addition of new data through category <b>133</b> is expected.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the View Status section of interface <b>125</b>, element <b>135</b> enables client access to personal interaction history as previously described. Subcategories of category <b>135</b> represented herein include a date of last interaction, an update option, and a cancel option. Information accessed through interaction within category <b>135</b> is compiled over time and is personalized to the client. Such available history data may include separate interaction records pertinent to separate communication mediums. Interaction records may be further divided by product, agent interacted with, and so on. Moreover, interaction with automated systems of a communication center may be included. In one embodiment, a client may be provided with various options for ordering interaction history records. For example, a client may order a combined record including all communication-center interaction presented according to data and time. In another embodiment, partial records may be ordered through a search function (not shown) provided in interface <b>125</b>. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Element <b>137</b> pertains to communication center status reflecting information pertinent to a client when desiring contact with an entity of a communication center. It is noted here that a client may access and view agent status without initiating a contact event. However, in some embodiments, a client may submit an instant message summarizing an intent of a pending communication event whether it will be initiated by a client or by an agent calling the requesting client. Subcategories represented herein include calls holding, agents available, estimated hold time, and submit call back request. These and various other available options provide information for the client relative to the status of the communication center, and availability of services before connecting to the communication center or requesting a contact event from the center.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art, that there may be more categories and subcategories described in interface <b>125</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The inventor has outlined basic categories and basic subcategories and deems them sufficient for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, as an interactive interface, it may be assumed that appropriate secondary interfaces will display for clients interacting with interface <b>125</b> such that selective viewing, data entry, editing, and so on may be accomplished. Such secondary interfaces may be linked to each category and subcategory through hyper linking or other known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art, that the method and apparatus of the present invention may be applied to a variety of connection scenarios without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Similarly, the software of the present invention may be provided in a variety of functionalities ranging from an extendable application program interface (API) to an existing instant-messaging service to a fully functional server-driven service application including client-side and server-side components.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art, that instant messages, following standard instant message protocol, can be propagated back and forth between subscribing agents and clients without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In addition to instant messaging, status alerts may take the form of pager messages or other types of known alerts when a client status is determined to be off-line. In addition, multiple protocols may be used, including IWP, HTTP, WAP, and other known protocols, either alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Secure IMPP Routing</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In one aspect of the present invention, the inventor provides a novel way of supporting third-party IMPP services in a secure manner by intelligently routing IM events within a closed, or in some cases open system of Customer Service Representatives (CSRs). Such a system is described in enabling detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an overview of a communications network <b>1001</b> wherein IMPP event routing is practiced according to an embodiment of the present invention. Network <b>1001</b> consists of, in this example, a communication center <b>1026</b>, an Internet network <b>1021</b>, and a public-switch-telephone-network (PSTN) <b>1019</b>. Network <b>1001</b> is analogous in preferred embodiments to networks <b>52</b> or <b>92</b> described above with respect to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> pertaining to general function and preferences. For example, Internet <b>1021</b> and PSTN <b>1019</b> are preferred components because of a high public access characteristic and also because of network integration capabilities. It is not illustrated that network <b>1021</b> and network <b>1019</b> may pass data back and forth through an appropriate network gateway, but the capability may be assumed to be present.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Communication center <b>1026</b> is a dually-capable center able to handle call events both from network <b>1021</b> and from network <b>1019</b>. Communication center <b>1026</b> has a local area network (LAN) <b>1002</b> operable therein and enabled in this example with IP protocols. In some cases, a central switch (SW) <b>1016</b> is provided within center <b>1026</b> and adapted to receive COST communication events. In other cases, other equivalents may be used such as a router, a softswitch or switchless telephony. In all those cases, some call routing capabilities exist, and are equivalent to a CTI server. A CTI server (T-Server) is provided and illustrated as connected to SW <b>1016</b> by a CTI-enabled link. T-Server <b>1015</b> provides at least intelligent routing routines for routing events within center <b>1026</b>. In one embodiment, there may be similar T-Server-enhanced equipment provided within network <b>1019</b> and connected to a local switch (LSW) <b>1018</b> provided therein. As in previous network examples represented above by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, there may also be a separate digital network connecting server <b>1015</b> to a similar server in PSTN <b>1019</b> to provide a path for quick and parallel transfer of data for such as agent level routing at the PSTN level.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">A plurality of workstations A-N are provided within center <b>1026</b> each having access to LAN <b>1002</b>. Workstation A has a PC <b>1011</b> and a telephone <b>1012</b> implemented therein. Workstation N has a PC <b>1013</b> and a telephone <b>1014</b> implemented therein. It may be assumed that other workstations connected to LAN <b>1002</b> are similarly endowed with a PC and telephone, or other, equivalent network terminals. In this particular example, telephones <b>1012</b> and <b>1014</b> in stations A and N respectively are connected to their respective computers through cabling to the soundcard of each. This enables an agent to accept COST events either by picking up the phone, or by using the PC sound system. Telephones <b>1012</b> and <b>1014</b> are connected to SW <b>1016</b> by internal telephony wiring <b>1015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">A proxy server <b>1003</b> is provided within communication center <b>1026</b> and shares connection to LAN <b>1002</b> with workstations A-N. A data router <b>1007</b> running a firewall address translation application (FATS) <b>1008</b> is provided within center <b>1026</b> and also connected to LAN <b>1002</b> as a separate machine from server <b>1003</b>. In actual practice, servers <b>1003</b> and router <b>1007</b> can be combined into one server/router machine having a LAN connection to LAN <b>1002</b>. The inventor illustrates separate machines for purpose of clear description only.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Internet <b>1021</b> has instant message presence protocol (IMPP) service providers A and B servers illustrated therein and connected to an Internet backbone <b>1020</b>. Backbone <b>1020</b> represents all of the lines, connection points and equipment that make up the Internet network as a geographic whole. Therefore, there are no geographic limitations to the practice of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">IMPP service provider A (server <b>1022</b>) is adapted as a communication server of a provider such as the well-known AOL™ IM service. IMPP service provider B (server <b>1023</b>) is adapted as a communication server hosted by a service other than AOL™ such as, perhaps MSN™. Moreover, there may be other IM servers present in this embodiment representing still other IM providers, of which there are many known without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The inventor provides 2 known examples and deems them sufficient for the purpose of describing the present invention in an enabling manner.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Clients of services represented by servers <b>1022</b> and <b>1023</b> within Internet <b>1021</b> are illustrated in this example as service provider A client (PC <b>1024</b>), and service provider B client (PC <b>1025</b>). In this example, client <b>1024</b> is an AOL™ user having IM software (SWa) and Internet connectivity to server <b>1022</b>. Client <b>1025</b> is a MSN™ user having IM software (SWb) and Internet connectivity to server <b>1023</b>. Internet connectivity for both clients <b>1024</b> and <b>1025</b> is represented by Internet access lines illustrated from each client to Internet backbone <b>1020</b>. It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that clients <b>1024</b> and <b>1025</b> may access the Internet network (<b>1021</b>) through the PSTN network and ISP provision as is generally known in the art, but not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. There are also other known methods of Internet access any one of which may be used for either or both clients in this example as long as IM capability is supported over the access network.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">An important goal of the present invention is to provide a controlled routing program that brokers communication between clients, namely <b>1024</b> and <b>1025</b> and agents (customer-service representatives-CSRs) of center <b>1026</b> operating at LAN-connected stations A and B. It is noted herein that agent presence information, client presence information, center status information and passive client interface capabilities as was described in disclosure covered by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> above may be assumed to be installed and operational within proxy server <b>1003</b>. Server <b>1003</b> is adapted, in a preferred embodiment, as a central communication server and event router/switch through which all IM communication to and from agents in center <b>1026</b> passes. As previously described, router <b>1007</b> running application <b>1008</b> may also be considered to be integrated in some embodiments with proxy <b>1003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In order to provide intelligent routing rules for routing IM events, T-server <b>1015</b> must be consulted by proxy <b>1003</b> for rules-related states such as agent availability, skill level, and so on. In this example, server <b>1003</b> consults server <b>1015</b> through LAN <b>1002</b>. In another embodiment there may be a direct data link connecting the two servers. In still other embodiments the two servers may be implemented as one more powerful server.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Proxy server <b>1003</b> has SWa and SWb installed thereon, the software instances representing AOL™ and MSN™ IM packages. It is noted herein that there is no limit to the quantity of separate IM services that can be supported within center <b>1026</b>. In cases where 2 separate protocols are compatible, one application may be installed within proxy <b>1003</b> that covers the functionality of both. In one embodiment server <b>1003</b> may have translation software in order to translate all kinds of supported IM protocols into one unified protocol supported by CSRs. In this case the client <b>1025</b> and the CSR may have different kinds of IM client software.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">CSR stations A through N also have IM applications installed on respective PCs <b>1011</b>-<b>1013</b>. CSR station A may support one or more separate instances of IM software for different providers as may all of the other stations. Any combination may be extant as long as the information is known to T-server software (<b>1015</b>). Agent-availability routines are utilized as a preferred routing criteria in this embodiment. Agent skill level routines, priority routing routines, and other routing routines may be similarly incorporated singularly or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In practice of the invention IMPP provider servers <b>1022</b> and <b>1023</b> are adapted to present a communication link to accessing clients (<b>1024</b>, <b>1025</b>) whereby invocation of the link initiates an IM to center <b>1026</b>, specifically to proxy server <b>1003</b>. Proxy server <b>1003</b> of center <b>1026</b> is capable of generating IM messages in response to those received from servers <b>1022</b> and <b>1023</b> independently from the CSR system represented in this example by LAN-connected CSR representatives grouped for communication and routing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Proxy <b>1003</b> is also capable of routing IM notification events directly to representative PCs <b>1011</b> or <b>1013</b> over LAN <b>1002</b> upon consultation with and direction response from T-server <b>1015</b> executing the routing routines. In this example, router <b>1007</b> represents this function and FATS <b>1008</b> provides address translation capability to proxy <b>1003</b> for routing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Assume now that a CSR at station <b>1024</b> desires to contact center <b>1026</b> through server <b>1022</b>, in this case, an AOL™ server. SWa is proprietary AOL™ IM software. By invoking an icon presented in the users interface, an IM requesting communication is generated and sent to server <b>1022</b> hosting the communication at this point. Server <b>1022</b> sends notification of the received event/request to proxy server <b>1003</b>. It is important to note here that for security reasons, the only visible address to the user IM software is the IP address of proxy <b>1003</b>. Proxy server <b>1003</b> having an appropriate instance of SWa installed therein responds by generating an IM to server <b>1022</b> to open dialogue. Proxy <b>1003</b> is capable of robotic IM communication simulating the function of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) software. That is to say that before a request is eventually routed to a CSR representative, proxy server <b>1003</b> may execute one or more transactions with the user at server <b>1022</b> to find out how best to route the call.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">When proxy <b>1003</b> has enough information to route a request, it notifies T-server <b>1015</b> of a pending request and associated parameters. Parameters may include a user's IP address, telephone number, version and brand of the IM application used by the user and other information subsequent to privacy policies of the acting IMPP provider. T-Server <b>1015</b> executes an agent-availability routine in this example to look for a CSR at any of stations A-N that has a running instance of AOL™ IM software or one compatible to the user's software and looks to see if the particular agent is available for an IM notification. T-server <b>1015</b> selects an available agent and sends notification of the selection back to proxy <b>1003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Once selection is accomplished, proxy <b>1003</b> notifies the CSR with the user IM request and the CSR responds to server <b>1003</b> opening a connection that is now hosted by proxy <b>1003</b>. A variety of options can be presented to users and made available through IMPP providers, such as the previously-described passive interaction interface, communication center status data, agent presence information and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In one embodiment, IPP providers simply provide a communication re-direct to proxy <b>1003</b> for any users invoking the option regardless of service/software brand. In this case proxy <b>1003</b> determines user identity, brand and version of IM capability, and immediately opens an IVR-type dialogue with the requesting user independently. IM transactions may at this time be hosted within server <b>1003</b> because of re-direct capability. In this case IMPP providers do not maintain communication channels on behalf of the users. Server <b>1003</b> must be adapted to function as an IMPP provider in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">For security purposes, the only visible address outside of center <b>1026</b> is the IP address of proxy <b>1003</b>. Proxy <b>1003</b> uses FATS software <b>1008</b> to translate to a selected CSR IP address on LAN <b>1002</b>. In some cases, a CSR may have 2 or more IP addresses included in availability status provided that these are addresses of appliances that can practice IM messaging and have the IM application at least compatible with that of the requesting user.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In one embodiment, if a CSR cannot be found available then proxy <b>1003</b> returns an IM to the user stating this fact, and may also provide an estimated time waiting before a CSR will be available. In this embodiment, proxy <b>1003</b> may provide an IM form allowing a user to provided preferred call-back information. In one embodiment a passive interface may also be presented enabling the user to alter his or her personal center data such as order status, payment status, and so on. Similarly, proxy <b>1003</b> may be enhanced with the capability of re-directing the user to an automated system that the user may then interact with to automatically make a payment, place an order, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The example presented herein represents a closed system wherein all of the CSRs operate on a limited LAN network. However this is not required in order to practice the present invention. In one embodiment the system may be extended to include more than one communication center and remote agents operating from isolated homes or offices but connected to the Internet for communication. All that is required for routing purposes is the software for monitoring CSR status locally and reporting software for remote CSRs over a defined network.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that varying third-party IMPP services will have variances in the way each application looks (interface) and, in some cases use options. Therefore, it is important to note herein that previously-described interfaces such as a passive interface template and other created templates or forms that may be passed in the form of IM messaging, such as customer presence status and communication center status including agent presence status, would be designed for use with each supported IMPP service at the communication center. In some cases, that may require a software plug-in (adapter) to be created and made available to clients if special purpose forms containing check boxes and the like are passed as IMs using stock third-party applications. In such full service environments, the inventor intends that these provisions be available and adaptable to the third party software instances.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">On the other hand many, if not all, of the functional goals of the present invention can be met using the existing interface cosmetics currently used by most third-party applications, requiring no additional software modifications. For example, estimated waiting time can be communicated in a traditional IM. With enhanced parsing capabilities, a user may simply type any client presence information using the traditional third-party IM interface. Center information and agent presence information can be handled in much the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">A primary goal of the invention is to provide intelligent routing of traditional third-party hosted IM messages in such a way as to emulate an IVR/telephony routing convention wherein various routing rules and protocols may be applied. There are many possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart illustrating client/service steps for practicing IM communication according to an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>1100</b>, a client analogous to one (<b>1024</b>, <b>1025</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> above establishes Internet connection through one of various known methods. Once connected, at step <b>1101</b> the client invokes his or her personal IMPP software. At this step, an automatic server connection is established between the client and a third-party IMPP message server analogous to server <b>1022</b> or <b>1023</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">At step <b>1102</b>, the client invokes a link to, in this example, a communication center analogous to center <b>1026</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. It is noted herein that a communication center is used in this example only for illustrative purpose as a convention having a group of CSRs connected for communication. In one embodiment, the CSR group could be remotely employed in an individual sense and share connection with a proxy server on the network, the server adapted to practice the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In step <b>1102</b>, the link connecting to the center may be tiered such that invoking the link brings up a plurality of more granular links associated with specific groups of CSRs working in the center wherein such distinct groups may be un associated with each other with regard to center functions. For example, one CSR group within a center may handle sales whereas another may be dedicated to account management or quality service. There are many options.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">At step <b>1103</b>, the client is optionally re-directed to a proxy server analogous to server <b>1003</b> incorporating the function of server <b>1007</b> both of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. If a client is re-directed, the IMPP message server is not hosting subsequent communication. In this case communication hosting is taken over by the proxy. In this event, the proxy must be endowed with all of the required software enabling the IMPP server.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In another aspect, at step <b>1107</b>, the IMPP server, instead of performing a re-direct as described at step <b>1104</b>, simply routes the client or user's IM request to the proxy server. In the case of re-direction at step <b>1103</b>, at step <b>1104</b>, the proxy server interacts directly with the client via IM messaging. In this step, the proxy emulates IVR technology in order to glean information from the client to aid in more appropriate routing. IM interaction between the proxy and client may follow a dedicated and directed sequence of options and answers, or may, with enhanced parsing capability, follow a more informal approach.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In the case of IMPP hosting communication as described with reference to step <b>1107</b>, at step <b>1108</b>, the proxy server interacts with the client through the IMPP host, the server functioning also as a client. In both cases, after obtaining enough client information for intelligent routing, at step <b>1105</b> the proxy consults routing services available and selects a routing state based on information collected from the client and any available conditions reported by the routing system. For example, the information collected from the client may include a desire to be connected with an accounting representative to discuss a late bill or payment. The routing system would check availability of a CSR in accounting having IM software running that is compatible with the client application and that is immediately available.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">At step <b>1106</b> then, the proxy server routes the target IM event to the selected CSR workstation, preferably through a security firewall using an address translation protocol. At step <b>1109</b>, communication is established between the selected CSR and the client either through the IMPP message server as a retentive host, or with the proxy server functioning as the communication host. It is important to note herein for security reasons, that it may be preferable to pass hosting responsibility to the proxy server within the center as this embodiment affords the added security of a firewall. The implementation will depend in part on the sensitivity level of the business enterprise and communication associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the process steps described herein may be further broken down to include more granular substeps without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, client identification steps, multiple routing consultation steps, optional steps for center contact from the IMPP server and so on may be herein assumed to be a part of the process without departing from the spirit and scope.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">It will be further apparent to one with skill in the art that functionality of presence reporting for both client and agent as well as estimated time for CSR availability and general center status information may be made available through the traditional IM interface without a requirement for special templates designed for an IM environment. However, depending on levels of cooperation of IMPP service entities, special templates and interfaces including operational protocols may be developed and offered.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The method and apparatus of the present invention can be practiced over any data-packet-network wherein a group of connected entities, either CSRs, automated systems, or a combination of both maintain addresses accessible through the network and share a routing system. Therefore, the method and apparatus of the present invention should be afforded the broadest scope with regard to examination for allowance. The spirit and scope of the present invention is limited only by the language of the claims that follow.</p>
