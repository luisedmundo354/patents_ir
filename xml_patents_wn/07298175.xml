<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to reduction in sub-threshold leakage current in deep sub-micron technology and more particularly to the use of transistor stacking in programmable multiplexers to achieve this result in CMOS IC devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Future electronic systems will continue to require both ever increasing speed and decreasing power consumption. To attain higher speeds and maintain low power consumption, integrated circuit (IC) chips, as one of the principle components of electronic systems, will need to operate at ever higher frequencies while consuming as little power as possible. As device sizes decrease to increase speed and reduce chip size, increased static power consumption will become a major hurdle to attaining low power consumption goals, especially for IC chips manufactured using CMOS technology. Static power consumption is the power consumed by circuits, and more particularly, individual devices that are not actively changing states, i.e., the transistors are in a steady off state. Up until now, static power consumption in CMOS technology has been negligible. But the continued shrinking of device sizes will change this.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Continuing process advancements have allowed for reductions in critical dimensions in CMOS manufacturing. IC device dimensions have now or are about to reach a critical point where static power consumption will become a major concern unless new techniques are implemented to avoid unacceptable static power consumption levels. As device sizes have shrunk there has been a reduction in power supply voltage (V<sub>dd</sub>). While lower V<sub>dd </sub>corresponds to lower dynamic power consumption, it also reduces the speed of the device. To maintain or increase device speed, efforts have been pursued to reduce the threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>) of transistors within a given process. However, the subthreshold voltage current, or leakage current, of a transistor exponentially increases with any V<sub>th </sub>decrease. At prior larger device dimensions, this exponential leakage current increase was still negligible. But, at current and future device dimension sizes, this exponential increase in leakage current will result in a rapid and noticeable increase in static power consumption. Thus, without employing a new approach, the designer may be required to make unacceptable trade off decisions between speed and power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To counteract this increasing power consumption problem, it would be possible to increase the voltage threshold level of the transistors; however, this would have negative impacts on the transistor speed or frequency that the device could be used. Furthermore, increasing V<sub>th </sub>can introduce other problems because of noise margins that must be maintained within the device. It has been found that increasing V<sub>th </sub>to more than V<sub>dd</sub>/3 will negatively impact the functionality of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As device sizes continue to shrink, this static power consumption issue will become important for the entire semiconductor industry. It is particularly important now for makers of devices such as programmable logic devices (PLDs) that contain large numbers of transistors on a single die that, after programming, may remain in a static off state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A PLD is an integrated circuit comprised of an array of configurable logic elements (CLEs) surrounded by a general routing matrix (GRM) with multiple input/output ports. In general, PLDs include programming elements such as static random access memory cells (SRAMs), antifuses, EPROMs, Flash cells, or EEPROMS. These memory elements are used to control the functions performed by the CLEs, the routing of signals in the GRM between CLEs and their input/output ports, and also control the functionality of the input/output ports. Recently, PLD makers have trended toward providing a large number of tri-state drivers to support high fan out signals to be routed in the GRM. A PLD is designed to perform any logic function required by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In practice, once a PLD user designs the function to be implemented by the PLD, and the PLD is programmed to perform the function, a large number of the resources available on the PLD are unused. Thus, the PLD may have a large percentage of transistors that are not being used at any given time. XILINX™, a leading manufacturer of PLDs, makes a variety of PLD known as a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Analysis of typical designs used by users of XILINX™ FPGAs shows that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of the FPGA resources are typically unused. These unused resources are in a static mode and thus as static power consumption increases for a given process the FPGA and PLD in general is likely to see large increases in overall power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desirable then to implement new circuit techniques that will operate at increased speeds and reduce leakage current in static CMOS devices and thereby reduce IC chip power consumption.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to some embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an integrated circuit schematic is shown that illustrates a typical integrated circuit (IC) implementation of an eight-by-one multiplexer (“MUX”) known in the art. The MUX includes a plurality of pass transistors, such as transistors <b>10</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>14</b>, wherein each transistor <b>10</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>14</b> includes a gate <b>16</b>,<b>18</b>,<b>20</b> operable to activate and deactivate the respective transistor <b>10</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>14</b>. Each transistor <b>10</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>14</b> connects a MUX input, such as inputs <b>22</b>,<b>24</b>,<b>26</b>, to a common node <b>28</b>, wherein each MUX input <b>22</b>,<b>24</b>,<b>26</b> is connected to either a low voltage source (“0” volts), or a high voltage source (“V<sub>DD</sub>”). The common node <b>28</b> is connected to an output circuit, such as the buffer circuit <b>30</b>. The transistor gates <b>16</b>,<b>18</b>,<b>20</b> are each connected to an output of a block of static random access memory (SRAM) cells <b>32</b>, so that each output of the SRAM block <b>32</b> activates or deactivates a transistor <b>10</b>,<b>12</b>,<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also referred to as a “configuration SRAM,” the SRAM block <b>32</b> is manipulated to pass a single input to the common node <b>28</b> by activating a single transistor while leaving the remaining transistors deactivated. An example of a configuration SRAM may be found in the configuration memory of a PLD. If the transistor <b>10</b> is activated, for example, the input value 22 (0 in this case) is communicated to the common node <b>28</b> while the remaining input values are isolated from the common node <b>28</b> by their respective deactivated transistors. In the illustrated circuit, the possible input values communicated to the common node <b>28</b> may be 0 or V<sub>DD</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Unfortunately, multiplexers such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are susceptible of subthreshold leakage current. Transistors that are deactivated, such as transistor <b>12</b> in the above example, allow some current to leak from the input <b>24</b> to the common node <b>28</b> if there is a difference in voltage levels between the input <b>24</b> and the common node <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One method of reducing such leakage current is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein the MUX has been divided into two stages of transistors, a first stage <b>34</b> and a second stage <b>36</b>. The first stage <b>34</b> includes two groups of transistors, a first group <b>38</b> and a second group <b>40</b>, wherein each group <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> includes a plurality of transistors. The transistors of the first group <b>38</b> connect a first plurality of inputs to a first common node <b>42</b>, and the transistors of the second group <b>40</b> connect a second plurality of inputs to a second common node <b>44</b>. The transistors of the first group <b>38</b> are controlled by a first four-cell memory block <b>46</b>, and the transistors of the second group <b>40</b> are controlled by a second four-cell memory block <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second stage <b>36</b> includes two transistors <b>50</b>,<b>52</b>, wherein a first transistor <b>50</b> selectively communicates a signal from the first common node <b>42</b> to the buffer circuit <b>30</b>, and wherein a second transistor <b>52</b> selectively communicates a signal from the second common node <b>44</b> to the buffer circuit <b>30</b>. The second stage transistors are controlled by a two-cell memory block <b>54</b>. The multi-stage MUX of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> reduces leakage current by taking advantage of what is known as transistor “stack effect.” Stack effect occurs when two or more transistors are placed in series and deactivated, wherein the subthreshold leakage current through the series of two transistors is as much as an order of magnitude less than it would be through a single transistor of the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The stack effect occurs in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because one of the two second stage transistors <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> will always be outside of the signal path and thus deactivated. If the signal path through the MUX includes a transistor of the second group <b>40</b>, for example, the second transistor <b>52</b> of the second stage <b>36</b> is also activated as part of the signal path. The first transistor <b>50</b> of the second stage <b>36</b>, however, is deactivated along with all of the transistors of the first group <b>38</b> of the first stage <b>34</b>. Thus, each of the transistors of the first group <b>38</b> are deactivated and “stacked with” the first transistor <b>50</b> of the second stage, greatly reducing leakage current from the V<sub>DD </sub>inputs of the first group <b>38</b> through the transistors. Likewise, when the signal path includes a transistor of the first group <b>38</b>, the first transistor <b>50</b> of the second stage <b>36</b> is activated as part of the signal path and the second transistor <b>52</b> is deactivated along with all of the transistors of the second group <b>40</b> of the first stage <b>34</b>, thus creating the stack effect.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An alternative two-tier MUX circuit design is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that the two, four-cell memory blocks <b>46</b>,<b>48</b> of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are replaced with a single four-cell memory block <b>60</b> and two logic elements <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each of the logic elements <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> receives a four-bit control signal from the four-cell memory block <b>60</b> as well a two-bit control signal from the two-cell memory block <b>54</b> of the second stage <b>36</b>. Each logic element <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> decodes the two-bit control signal to determine whether the first transistor <b>50</b> or the second transistor <b>52</b> of the second stage <b>36</b> is activated. If the first transistor <b>50</b> of the second stage <b>36</b> is activated, the first logic element <b>58</b> passes the four-bit control signal to the transistors of the first group <b>38</b>, and the second logic element <b>56</b> deactivates the transistors of the second group <b>40</b>. Conversely, if the second transistor <b>52</b> of the second stage <b>36</b> is activated, the first logic element <b>58</b> deactivates the transistors of the first group <b>38</b>, and the second logic element <b>56</b> passes the four-bit control signal to the transistors of the second group <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the logic elements <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> have been discussed and shown as separate circuit elements for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated that the functionality of both elements <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> may be implemented in a single combinatorial logic element.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each logic element <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> is preferably entirely combinatorial, or implemented without memory elements of any kind such as flip-flops or other such memory elements. The circuit design embodied in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then, reduces the total number of memory cells required to implement the multiplexer. The circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, includes the four-cell memory block <b>60</b> and the two-cell memory block <b>54</b>, thus using a total of six memory cells. The circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in contrast, includes two four-cell memory blocks <b>46</b>,<b>48</b> as well as the two-cell memory block <b>54</b>, thus using a total of ten memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A MUX circuit design which further reduces subthreshold leakage current is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein the circuit presents three stages <b>62</b>,<b>64</b>,<b>66</b> of transistors. A first stage <b>62</b> includes eight transistors divided into four groups <b>68</b>,<b>70</b>,<b>72</b>,<b>74</b>; a second stage <b>64</b> includes four transistors <b>76</b>,<b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b> divided into two groups <b>84</b>,<b>86</b>; and a third stage <b>66</b> includes two transistors <b>88</b>,<b>90</b>. Each group <b>68</b>,<b>70</b>,<b>72</b>,<b>74</b> of the first stage <b>62</b> is connected to a different transistor <b>76</b>,<b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b> of the second stage; and each group <b>84</b>,<b>86</b> of transistors of the second stage <b>64</b> is connected to a different transistor of the third stage <b>66</b>. This circuit design includes four configuration memory elements: three four-cell memory blocks <b>92</b>,<b>94</b>,<b>96</b> and one two-cell memory block <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The three-stage design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> enables more deactivated transistors to benefit from the stack effect than the two-stage design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, thus further reducing leakage current through deactivated transistors. This design augments the stack effect in two ways: first, three deactivated transistors can be stacked in series instead of two. Second, a greater portion of transistors not in a signal path can be deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To illustrate, if a transistor of the fourth group <b>74</b> of the first stage <b>62</b> of transistors is activated, the fourth transistor <b>82</b> of the second stage <b>64</b> and the second transistor <b>90</b> of the third stage <b>66</b> would also be activated as part of the signal path to communicate the input signal to the buffer circuit <b>30</b>. All transistors of the first group <b>68</b> and the second group <b>70</b> of the first stage <b>62</b>, as well as all transistors of the first group <b>84</b> of the second stage <b>64</b> and the first transistor <b>88</b> of the third stage <b>66</b> are deactivated. Thus, all transistors that are connected either directly or indirectly to the first transistor <b>88</b> of the third stage <b>66</b> are deactivated, resulting in a series of three stacked transistors between the first stage <b>62</b> and the third stage <b>66</b>. Stacking the transistors three deep in this manner reduces subthreshold leakage current by as much as two or three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, a portion of the transistors connected directly or indirectly to the second transistor <b>90</b> of the third stage <b>66</b> are also deactivated. For example, both transistors of the third group <b>72</b> of the first stage <b>62</b>, as well as the third transistor <b>80</b> of the second stage <b>64</b>, are deactivated and thus benefit from the stack effect. Thus, the stack effect can be used for six of the eight inputs, and three-deep stacking can be used for four of the eight inputs. In the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by comparison, only four of the eight inputs could be stacked at any give time, and only two transistors could be placed in series.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An alternative implementation of a three-stage MUX circuit is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, except that the four-cell memory blocks <b>92</b>,<b>94</b>,<b>96</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are replaced by two-cell memory blocks <b>98</b>,<b>100</b>,<b>102</b> and a plurality of logic elements <b>104</b>,<b>106</b>,<b>108</b>,<b>110</b>,<b>112</b>,<b>114</b>. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> functions similarly to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in that all transistors in the second stage <b>64</b> and the third stage <b>66</b> are deactivated except for those that form part of the signal path. In contrast to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, however, the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> does not employ fully-decoded control signals, but rather uses the logic elements to decode a portion of the control signals. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, uses a four-cell memory block <b>96</b> to control the four transistors <b>76</b>,<b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b> of the second stage <b>64</b> of the circuit. The same transistors <b>76</b>,<b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b> of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are controlled by a two-cell memory block <b>102</b> and the two-cell memory block <b>54</b> that controls the transistors <b>88</b>,<b>90</b> of the third stage <b>66</b>, wherein the logic elements <b>112</b>,<b>114</b> decode the control signal from the memory block <b>54</b> to determine which of the third stage transistors <b>88</b>,<b>90</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By way of example, the memory block <b>102</b> outputs a two-bit control signal that is communicated either to the first group <b>84</b> or the second group <b>86</b> of transistors of the second stage <b>64</b>, depending on which of the third stage transistors <b>88</b>,<b>90</b> is activated. If the first transistor <b>88</b> is activated, the logic element <b>114</b> communicates the control signals from the memory block <b>102</b> to the first group of transistors <b>84</b>, and the logic element <b>112</b> deactivates the second group of transistors <b>86</b>. If the second transistor <b>90</b> is activated, the logic element <b>114</b> deactivates the first group of transistors <b>84</b>, and the logic element <b>112</b> communicates the control signals from the memory block <b>102</b> to the second group of transistors <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first group <b>68</b> and second group <b>70</b> of transistors of the first stage <b>62</b> are controlled by logic elements <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, respectively, in a manner similar to the first and second groups <b>84</b>,<b>86</b> of the second stage <b>64</b>. The logic elements <b>104</b>,<b>106</b>, however, are each controlled by a two-cell memory block <b>98</b> and logic element <b>114</b>. If the first transistor <b>76</b> of the second stage <b>64</b> is activated, logic element <b>104</b> communicates the control signals from the memory block <b>98</b> to the first group of transistors <b>68</b>, and the logic element <b>106</b> deactivates the second group of transistors <b>70</b>. If the second transistor <b>78</b> of the second stage <b>64</b> is activated, logic element <b>104</b> deactivates the first group of transistors <b>68</b>, and logic element <b>106</b> communicates the control signals from the memory block <b>98</b> to the second group of transistors <b>70</b>. The remaining transistors are operated in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is advantageous in that it requires fewer configuration memory elements than the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. While the circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes three four-cell memory blocks <b>92</b>,<b>94</b>,<b>96</b> and one two-cell memory block <b>54</b> for a total of fourteen memory cells, the circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes four two-cell memory blocks <b>54</b>,<b>98</b>,<b>100</b>,<b>102</b> for a total of eight memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another aspect of the present invention for reducing subthreshold leakage current. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, therefore only the differences between the two will be explained in detail. The MUX circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes a power-gating transistor <b>116</b> for power gating one or more elements of the buffer circuit <b>30</b>, and a logic element <b>118</b> for controlling the power-gating transistor <b>116</b>. The power-gating transistor <b>116</b> reduces leakage current in buffer circuit <b>30</b>, which does not benefit from transistor stacking in the MUX, by isolating the buffer circuit <b>30</b> from either a voltage source or a ground when the MUX is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The logic element <b>118</b> controls the power-gating transistor <b>116</b> by communicating a signal to a gate of the transistor <b>116</b>. As illustrated, the signal communicated to the gate of the transistor <b>116</b> is a function of the two-bit control signal from the memory block <b>54</b>. The transistor <b>116</b> may be deactivated, for example, when the logic element <b>118</b> determines that the control signal from the memory block <b>54</b> deactivates both second stage transistors. It will be appreciated that power gating may be implemented in any of the buffer circuits disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates yet another aspect of the present invention for reducing subthreshold leakage current. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a portion of a MUX circuit wherein each cell of one or more configuration memory blocks are shown individually, such as memory cell <b>210</b>. The above-described methods of reducing leakage current do not address leakage current that may occur in circuit elements of the memory blocks. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a circuit design for reducing leakage current in configuration memory blocks by selectively connecting a lower-power voltage supply to memory cells in mulitplexers not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To illustrate operation of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reference will now be made to a first memory cell <b>210</b> and accompanying transistors <b>206</b>,<b>208</b>, with the understanding that all memory cells and accompanying transistors operate in a substantially identical manner. When the circuit is in use, the cell <b>210</b> is powered by a first voltage source <b>202</b> by activating transistor <b>206</b> to connect the source <b>202</b> to the cell <b>210</b> and deactivating transistor <b>208</b> to isolate the cell <b>210</b> from a second voltage source <b>204</b>. When the circuit is not in use, the cell <b>210</b> is powered by the second voltage source <b>204</b> by activating transistor <b>208</b> to connect the source <b>204</b> to the cell <b>210</b> and deactivating transistor <b>206</b> to isolate the cell <b>210</b> from a first voltage source <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first voltage source carries a voltage equal to V<sub>GG1</sub>, while the second voltage source carries a voltage equal to V<sub>GG2</sub>. If V<sub>GG2 </sub>is significantly less than V<sub>GG1</sub>, the voltage supplied to the memory cell <b>210</b> is significantly less while the circuit is not in use. Thus, leakage current through the block of memory cells may be drastically reduced while the circuit is not in use. This method may be used in combination with other aspects of the present invention.</p>
