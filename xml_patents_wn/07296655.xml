<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application generally relates to an acoustic liner for a duct. More particularly, this application relates to a splice for covering seams in the acoustic liner.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional turbine and turbofan engines for aircraft include a plurality of fan blades that rotate within a duct commonly known as a fan case. The fan case serves as a protective covering to protect the fan blades and the aircraft. Further the fan case channels airflow into the turbine engine. The inner surface of the fan case is constructed to withstand impacts from objects that may come into contact with the fan case and includes acoustical features to reduce the noise emitted from the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to provide a fan case liner with a layer of noise attenuation structures and a face layer including a plurality of openings. The face layer is typically a thin sheet of metal or composite material mounted over the noise attenuation structure. Noise causing pressure disturbances emanate through openings within the face layer into the noise attenuation structure where the pressure disturbances dissipate to reduce the total amount of noise.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The face layer forms the inner surface and typically includes at least one seam to accommodate assembly tolerances as well as accommodating loads generated by thermal expansion. A splice is bonded over the seam to protect the edges of the face sheet and the underlying noise attenuation structure. The splice is typically a solid strip of material that overlaps each side of the face layer. The splice is bonded with an adhesive to the face layer on either side of the seam. The adhesive and splice combine to block openings through the face layer to the noise attenuation structure. Disadvantageously, this results in an acoustically dead area within the liner assembly that does not absorb noise. The acoustically dead area reduces the effectiveness of the noise attenuation structures of the acoustic liner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a splice for an acoustic liner that is acoustically active to improve noise attenuation properties of a liner assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example fan case assembly according to this invention includes a liner assembly having a face sheet with a plurality of openings. A seam within the face sheet is covered over with an acoustically active splice that includes a plurality of acoustic regions that provide for communication of noise energy through the acoustic splice to the noise attenuation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fan case assembly includes a housing and a liner assembly. The liner assembly includes the noise attenuation layer that is covered by the protective face sheet. The face sheet includes the plurality of openings that communicate noise energy to the noise attenuation layer. The face sheet protects the noise attenuation layer from objects or other debris that may impact against the liner assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The face sheet is typically a single sheet that is attached over the noise attenuation layer such that an axial seam is formed. An acoustically active splice covers this axial seam to prevent intrusion of objects that may damage the noise attenuation layer. The splice includes a plurality of acoustic regions that are open to the face sheet and the plurality of openings to provide communication of noise energy through the acoustically active splice.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the liner assembly of this invention includes an acoustically active splice for covering a seam within the face sheet that provides for improved acoustical performance of the liner assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings, the following of which is a brief description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a duct for a engine assembly is shown and commonly referred to as a fan case assembly <b>10</b>. The fan case assembly <b>10</b> includes an exterior housing <b>17</b> and a liner assembly <b>12</b> that defines an interior surface of the fan case assembly <b>10</b>. The liner assembly <b>12</b> includes a noise attenuation layer <b>18</b> having a plurality of cells <b>20</b>. Noise energy passes through a face sheet <b>22</b> into the plurality of cells <b>20</b> where it is dissipated as heat.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The face sheet <b>22</b> includes a plurality of openings <b>24</b> that provide for communication of noise energy emitted by the gas turbine engine to the noise attenuation layer <b>18</b>. The face sheet <b>22</b> is a sheet of metal or composite material that is wrapped circumferentially within the fan case assembly <b>10</b>. The face sheet <b>22</b> may comprise a single sheet of material or several sheets. Whether one or many face sheets <b>22</b> are utilized, a seam <b>26</b> is formed along adjacent edges of the face sheet <b>22</b>. The seam <b>26</b> is formed as a result of assembly stack up tolerances, and to accommodate thermal expansion during operation. An acoustically active splice <b>30</b> according to this invention is installed to cover the seam <b>26</b> and prevent intrusion of objects and other material to the noise attenuation layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The noise attenuation layer <b>18</b> extends in sections from a cowling <b>16</b> of the fan case assembly <b>10</b> rearward under the face sheet <b>22</b>. The noise attenuation layer <b>18</b> continues further rearward under an abraidable strip <b>15</b> that is disposed adjacent a fan blade <b>14</b>. The abraidable strip <b>15</b> absorbs and protects the fan blades <b>14</b> from contact with the liner assembly <b>12</b>. Another portion of the noise attenuation layer <b>18</b> extends further rearward from the abraidable strip under a plate <b>28</b>. The plate <b>28</b> is of material that is thicker than the face sheet <b>22</b> and provides impact protection for the liner assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An acoustically active splice <b>30</b> covers the seam <b>26</b> in the face sheet <b>22</b>. The splice <b>30</b> covers the seam <b>26</b> and includes a plurality acoustic regions <b>32</b>. The acoustic regions <b>32</b> provide for the communication of noise energy through the splice <b>30</b> to the plurality of openings <b>24</b> within the face sheet <b>22</b>. The communication of noise energy through the splice <b>30</b> provides an acoustically active seam that absorbs noise energy rather than reflecting it or blocking noise energy from entering the plurality of openings <b>24</b> within the face sheet <b>22</b> that would create an acoustically dead zone.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the splice <b>30</b> includes a center portion <b>34</b> that covers the seam <b>26</b>. Extending outwardly from the center portion <b>34</b> is a web structure <b>36</b>. The web structure <b>36</b> includes a plurality of web portions <b>38</b> that define the boundaries of the acoustic regions <b>32</b>. The acoustic region <b>32</b> extends from the center portion <b>34</b> to define an overall width of the splice <b>30</b>. The overall width <b>44</b> provides a bonding area that is adhered adjacent edges of the face sheet <b>22</b> along the seam <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the splice <b>30</b> provides the open areas in the form of the acoustic regions <b>32</b> providing for noise energy to pass through. However, the splice <b>30</b> must also include sufficient area on either side of the seam <b>26</b> to provide for bonding material to adhere and affix the splice <b>30</b> to the face sheet <b>22</b>. The web portions <b>38</b> include a width <b>42</b> that minimizes local blockage of the plurality of openings <b>24</b>, and also combines to provide desired bonding area for securing the splice <b>30</b> to the face sheet <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the center portion <b>34</b> includes a width <b>37</b> that is preferably of such a size as to ensure coverage of the seam <b>26</b> between ends of the face sheet <b>22</b>. The center portion <b>34</b> is not completely bonded to the face sheet <b>22</b> as a portion of the center portion <b>34</b> covers a gap <b>40</b> formed by the seam <b>26</b>. The width <b>37</b> of the center portion <b>34</b> is determined to cover the seam <b>26</b> for the extremes of tolerance stack up conditions for a specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The splice <b>30</b> includes a tail portion <b>35</b> that extends downwardly between and into the seam <b>26</b> and adjacent portions of the noise attenuation layer <b>18</b>. Adhesive <b>46</b> is utilized on opposite sides of the seam <b>26</b> to adhere the splice <b>30</b> over the seam <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The acoustic regions <b>32</b> are configured as a plurality of repeating triangle shaped openings defined by the web structure <b>36</b>. The web structure <b>36</b> provides the triangle shaped openings as a series of alternating chevrons disposed on either side of the center portion <b>34</b>. The alternating shapes provide the desired openness to the underlying face sheet <b>22</b> while combining to provide desired surface area sufficient for providing a desired bond between with the face sheet <b>22</b>. Although the acoustic splice <b>30</b> as illustrated in the example embodiment as triangular shaped acoustic regions <b>32</b> it is within the contemplation of this invention that other shapes of acoustic regions may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> another example splice <b>50</b> according to this invention includes a series of rectangular shaped acoustic regions <b>52</b>. The acoustic regions <b>52</b> are defined by a web structure <b>56</b> that extends from a center portion <b>54</b>. The openness of the acoustic regions <b>52</b> provide communication to the underlying noise attenuation layer to provide an acoustically active region that absorbs noise energy to minimize sound emitted from the fan case assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, the acoustic splice of this invention provides a liner assembly that has substantially improved noise attenuation characteristics due to the substantial elimination of an acoustically dead seam between edges of the face sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although a preferred embodiment of this invention has been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason, the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention.</p>
