<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) on Patent Application No. 192387/2003 filed in Japan on Jul. 4, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a carrier detecting circuit suitably employed as a demodulator of a signal containing a carrier, and an infrared communication device that mounts the carrier detecting circuit for use in reception.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Infrared communication devices capable of receiving infrared rays have been widely used, such as infrared remote controller receivers. In an infrared communication device, a received infrared transmission code signal is converted into an electric signal by a photodiode, for example, and then amplified. Then, in the infrared communication device, a bandpass filter extracts a predetermined carrier frequently component from the amplified signal, and a carrier detecting circuit determines in accordance with an output signal of the bandpass filter, whether or not a carrier exists, and then outputs a result of the determination.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram showing an arrangement example of a carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b>. The carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b> is provided with a detection circuit <b>121</b> which generates a carrier detection level Det from an output signal Sig of the bandpass filter (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>); an integration circuit <b>109</b> which integrates in accordance with the output Det of the detection circuit <b>121</b>, a time during which the carrier exists; and a hysteresis comparator <b>110</b> which compares an integration output Int of the integration circuit with a threshold level Vt so as to determine whether or not the carrier exists.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The detection circuit <b>121</b> is composed of a detector <b>122</b> and an integrator <b>123</b>, and basically performs the following operations. Namely, the detector <b>122</b> generates from the output Sig of the bandpass filter, a signal Dett (hereinafter abbreviated to a baseband component Dett) indicating a waveform of a baseband component (not more than 10 kHz) of the output Sig. Further, the integrator <b>123</b> compares the baseband component Dett with a reference voltage Vf, and charges and discharges an integration capacitor C<b>102</b>. With this, the carrier detection level Det is generated as a both terminal voltage of the integration capacitor C<b>102</b>. The carrier detection level Det is to be compared to the output Sig of the bandpass filter by the integration circuit <b>109</b>. Note that, the detection circuit <b>121</b> is shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-51093 (Tokukai 2002-51093, published on Feb. 15, 2002; USPN 2002-0098818).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the detection circuit <b>121</b> of the carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b>, pulses of the carrier frequency to be detected are detected in a group by the detector <b>122</b>, and the time during which the pulse group exists is integrated by the integrator <b>123</b>, so that the integration output Int is obtained as the carrier detection level Det. In other words, the detector <b>122</b> does not directly generate the carrier detection level Det for the whole receiving system, but is used in the process of generating the carrier detection level Det.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The detector <b>122</b> is arranged so as to include a high-speed amplifier <b>124</b> which amplifies a difference between the output Sig and the carrier detection level Det at high speed enough to sufficiently respond to the carrier frequency, and outputs a resultant voltage of the amplification; a diode D<b>101</b> which rectifies the output of the high-speed amplifier <b>124</b>; a capacitor C<b>101</b> to which the output voltage of the high-speed amplifier <b>124</b> is charged via the diode D<b>101</b>; and a constant current source <b>125</b> which discharges the capacitor C<b>101</b> by a constant current I<b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The integrator <b>123</b> is arranged so as to include an amplifier <b>126</b> which outputs a current corresponding to a difference between the charged voltage of the capacitor C<b>101</b> (namely, output Dett of the detector <b>122</b>) and the predetermined reference voltage Vf from a reference voltage source (not shown); and the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> which is charged with the output current of the amplifier <b>126</b> and which outputs the charged voltage as the carrier detection level Det.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is waveform charts of the carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b> as arranged above. The high-speed amplifier <b>124</b> amplifies the difference between the output Sig of the bandpass filter indicated by the reference symbol β<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the carrier detection level Det indicated by the reference symbol β<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. With this, the capacitor C<b>101</b> is charged by the action of the diode D<b>101</b> for a period W<b>1</b> during which the pulses of the carrier frequency are detected, as indicated by β<b>11</b> (Dett) and β<b>12</b> (Vf) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. This raises the output Dett, which is the detection level of the pulse group of the carrier frequency. On the other hand, in a period W<b>2</b> during which the pulses are not detected, the capacitor C<b>101</b> is discharged at the current I<b>100</b> by the constant current source <b>125</b> so that the output Dett lowers. As described above, the period W<b>1</b> is the period during which the pulse group of the carrier frequency to be detected exists as described above, and the integrator <b>123</b> integrates the period W<b>1</b>. With this, an integration output of the integrator <b>123</b> is the carrier detection level Det indicated by the reference symbol β<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the reference symbol α<b>11</b> indicates the integration output Int of the integration circuit <b>109</b> at the following stage, the reference symbol α<b>12</b> indicates a threshold level of the hysteresis comparator <b>110</b>, and Dout indicates a digital output signal which is based on the baseband component and demodulated by the hysteresis comparator <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the transmission signal of the infrared remote controller is an ASK signal modulated using a carrier whose frequency is from 30 kHz to 60 kHz, and each transmission code has a time length of about 50 msec to 150 msec. Further, in the carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b>, the detector <b>122</b> detects in a group the pulses of the carrier frequency to be detected (30 kHz to 60 kHz as described above), and the integrator <b>123</b> integrates the period W<b>1</b> during which the pulse group exists, so as to obtain the carrier detection level Det as the integration output of the integrator <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore the detector <b>122</b> is required to operate at high speed enough to sufficiently respond to the carrier frequency. This can cause a capacitance of the capacitor C<b>101</b> to be comparatively small. On the other hand, the amplifier <b>126</b> of the integrator <b>123</b> is required to have a response speed with respect to at least a frequency of the baseband component (not more than 10 kHz). Namely, in order to generate the carrier detection level Det based on the baseband component, the integrator <b>123</b> needs to have a long time constant of about 100 msec. Consequently, the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> is required to have a comparatively large capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It has been generally difficult for the integrator <b>123</b> to obtain high response characteristics with respect to a minute current. In these years, however, a chip capable of achieving high response characteristics as well as the time constant of about 100 msec due to a capacitance value that can be integrated (about 100 pF) has been developed as the integrator <b>123</b> of the carrier detecting circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, as more and more infrared communication devices such as the infrared remote controller receivers have come to be mounted on portable information terminals, cutting the cost of the infrared communication devices is highly demanded. In accordance with this, the integration condenser of the carrier detecting circuit, which conventionally has been an external chip condenser (about 0.1 μF), is now become smaller (about 100 pF as described above) and usually built in the integrated circuit as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, even if the condenser can be built in the integrated circuit as described above, the condenser comprises a large portion (about 10 pF to 15 pF/100 μm×100 μm) of the integrated circuit. Thus, miniaturizing the condenser can reduce the chip size, thereby further cutting the cost highly effectively. Here, effective SN separation is required in a carrier detecting circuit including a built-in integration condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an electric circuit diagram concretely showing an arrangement of a typical conventional integrator <b>131</b> used as the integrator <b>123</b>. The integrator <b>131</b>, which is shown in Tokukai 2002-51093, is basically arranged so as to include the integration capacitor C<b>102</b>, a charging circuit <b>132</b>, and a discharging circuit <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The charging circuit <b>132</b> is composed of transistors qn<b>101</b> and qn<b>102</b> which constitute a differential pair; a constant current source f<b>101</b>; a reference voltage source <b>134</b>; transistors qn<b>103</b> and qp<b>101</b> which takes out an output from the differential pair; transistors qp<b>103</b> and qp<b>104</b> which constitute a current mirror circuit and mirrors an output current from the transistor qp<b>101</b>; a transistor qp<b>102</b> which inputs to the integration capacitor C<b>102</b>, an output current from the transistor qp<b>104</b>; and transistors qp<b>105</b> and qp<b>106</b> which constitute a leak photocurrent compensating circuit as shown in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-262153 (Tokukaihei 3-262153; published on Nov. 21, 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">On the other hand, the discharging circuit <b>133</b> is composed of transistors qn<b>104</b> and qn<b>105</b> which constitute a differential pair; constant current sources f<b>102</b> and f<b>103</b>; transistors qp<b>107</b> and qp<b>108</b> which constitute a current mirror circuit and mirrors an output current from the transistor qn<b>104</b>; a transistor qn<b>106</b> which outputs as the carrier detection level Det, an output from the transistors qp<b>108</b> and qn<b>105</b>; and transistors qp<b>109</b> and qp<b>110</b> which constitute a leak photocurrent compensating circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the integrator <b>131</b> as arranged above, if the voltage charged to the capacitor C<b>101</b>, namely the output Dett of the detector <b>122</b>, is lower than the reference voltage Vf from the reference voltage source <b>134</b>, the transistor qn<b>102</b> is switched ON. This consequently switches ON the transistors qn<b>103</b>, qp<b>101</b>, qp<b>103</b>, qp<b>104</b> and qp<b>102</b>, so that the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> is charged by a charge current Icj. Note that, since the discharging circuit <b>133</b> discharges the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> by a discharge current Icf, the charge current Icj is a current obtained by subtracting the discharge current Icf from a charge current from the transistor qp<b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Here, the following expression is satisfied.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Icj=i</i>101/<i>hfe</i>(<i>qn</i>103)−<i>i</i>102/<i>hfe</i>(<i>qn</i>104),  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">where i<b>101</b> is a constant current that the constant current source f<b>101</b> draws from the emitters of the transistors qn<b>101</b> and qn<b>102</b>; i<b>102</b> is a constant current that the constant current source f<b>102</b> draws from the emitters of the transistors qn<b>104</b> and qn<b>105</b>; and hfe (qn<b>103</b>) and hfe (qn<b>104</b>) are current amplification ratios of the transistors qn<b>103</b> and qn<b>104</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">On the other hand, if the output Dett is higher than the reference voltage Vf, the transistor qn <b>102</b> is switched OFF. This consequently switches OFF the transistors qn<b>103</b>, qp<b>101</b>, qp<b>103</b>, qp<b>104</b> and qp<b>102</b>. Therefore the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> is not charged from the transistor qp<b>102</b> but only discharged by the discharge current Icf.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore the following expression is satisfied.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Icf=i</i>102/<i>hfe</i>(<i>qn</i>104)  (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If it is assumed as typical values that i<b>101</b>=30 nA, i<b>102</b>=30 nA, hfe (qn)=150, and C<b>102</b>=100 pF, then Icj=100 pA, Icf=100 pA, and a charge and discharge time constant is 100 msec/0.1 V in accordance with t=CV/I. In this case, a charge and discharge current ratio (Icj/Icf) is 1, and it is possible to receive a signal whose transmission code has a duty ratio of 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Here, in order to further reduce the capacitance of the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> for the cost reduction, it is necessary to reduce both the operating currents i<b>101</b> and i<b>102</b> of the differential pairs while substantially maintaining the above time constant.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, if the operating currents i<b>101</b> and i<b>102</b> are low currents of not more than 10 nA, the following problems may occur. Namely, the impedance of the transistors in the charge and discharging circuits increase to such an extent that the circuits cannot operate normally. Further, influence of process variation and temperature dependence become significant.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, an input and output resistance of a single transistor increases as a corrector current Ic decreases. This is expressed by the following expressions.
<br/>

<br/>
Note that, Vt=k*T/q (k: Boltzmann constant, T: absolute temperature, q: elementary charge of electron), and Va is Early voltage.
</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to halve the capacitance of the integration capacitor C<b>102</b> to 50 pF, it is necessary to decrease each of the operating currents i<b>101</b> and i<b>102</b> to 15 nA. Here, in the discharging circuit <b>133</b>, in particular, the collector currents of the transistors qn<b>104</b> and qn<b>105</b> have to be i<b>102</b>/2=7.5 nA. As a result, the foregoing problems occur.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The following will explain an embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, and <b>9</b> through <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, an arrangement of a receiver that includes a carrier detecting circuit in accordance with the present embodiment will be briefly explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram showing an arrangement example of an infrared remote controller receiver <b>1</b> which is an infrared communication device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is waveform charts of sections in the receiver <b>1</b>. The receiver <b>1</b> is so arranged that an external photodiode <b>2</b> converts an infrared transmission code signal into a photocurrent signal Iin as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and inputs the converted photo-current signal Iin to a receiving chip <b>3</b>. Further, the receiving chip <b>3</b>, which is an integrated circuit, demodulates the converted photocurrent signal Iin thus received and outputs a digital signal Dout to a microcomputer or other device which controls an electronic device. The infrared signal is an ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) signal which is modulated using a carrier having a predetermined frequency of about from 30 kHz to 60 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the receiving chip <b>3</b>, the photocurrent signal Iin is sequentially amplified by a first-stage amplifier (HA) <b>4</b>, a second-stage amplifier (2ndAMP) <b>5</b>, and a third-stage amplifier (3rdAMP) <b>6</b>. A bandpass filter (BPF) <b>7</b>, which is tuned to the frequency of the carrier, takes out from an output signal of the third-stage amplifier <b>6</b>, a carrier component output Sig as indicated by the reference symbol α<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Then, a detection circuit <b>8</b> at the subsequent stage detects the output Sig at a carrier detection level Det indicated by the reference symbol α<b>2</b> to be described later, and generates the carrier detection level Det in accordance with a result of the detection (details will be described later). Further, the integration circuit <b>9</b> integrates a time during which the carrier exists, as indicated by the reference symbol α<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Then, a hysteresis comparator <b>10</b> compares an integration output Int of the integration circuit <b>9</b> with a predetermined threshold level indicated by the reference symbol α<b>12</b> so as to determine whether or not the carrier exists, and digitally outputs a result of the determination as the output signal Dout.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A lowpass filter <b>11</b> is provided with respect to the output side of the first-stage amplifier <b>4</b>. The lowpass filter <b>11</b> detects from the output of the first-stage amplifier <b>4</b>, a DC level originating from fluorescent light and sunlight. On the other hand, the second-stage amplifier <b>5</b> at the subsequent stage amplifies the direct output of the first-stage amplifier <b>4</b> after filtering out a portion of the DC level detected by the lowpass filter <b>11</b>. With this, the influence of the fluorescent light and sunlight is eliminated from the output of the second-stage amplifier <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, an ABCC circuit <b>12</b> is provided in relation to the first-stage amplifier <b>4</b>. The ABCC circuit <b>12</b> controls a DC bias of the first-stage amplifier <b>4</b> in response to an output of the lowpass filter <b>11</b>. Further, a fo trimming circuit <b>13</b> is provided in relation to the bandpass filter <b>7</b>. The fo trimming circuit <b>13</b> adjusts a center frequency fo of the bandpass filter <b>7</b> by trimming zener diodes (not shown) between terminals TRM<b>1</b> through TRM <b>5</b> which are respectively drawn from connection points of resistances of voltage dividers (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> in accordance with the present embodiment is provided with the detection circuit <b>8</b>, the integration circuit <b>9</b>, and the hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>. More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the detection circuit <b>8</b> is composed of a detector <b>22</b> and an integrator <b>23</b>, and basically performs the following operations. Namely, the detector <b>22</b> generates from the output Sig of the bandpass filter, a signal Deft (hereinafter abbreviated to a baseband component Dett) indicating a waveform of a baseband component (not more than 10 kHz) of the output Sig. Further, the integrator <b>23</b> compares the baseband component Dett with a reference voltage Vf, and charges and discharges an integration capacitor C<b>2</b>. With this, the carrier detection level Det is generated as a both terminal voltage of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b>. The carrier detection level Det is to be compared to the output Sig of the bandpass filter <b>5</b> by the integration circuit <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the detection circuit <b>8</b>, pulses of the carrier frequency to be detected are detected in a group by the detector <b>22</b>, and the time during which the pulse group exists is integrated by the integrator <b>23</b>, so that the integration output Int is obtained as the carrier detection level Det. In other words, the detector <b>22</b> does not directly generate the carrier detection level Det for the whole receiving system, but is used in the process of generating the carrier detection level Det.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The detector <b>22</b> is arranged so as to include a high-speed amplifier <b>24</b> which amplifies a difference between the output Sig and the carrier detection level Det at high speed enough to sufficiently respond to the carrier frequency, and outputs a resultant voltage of the amplification; a diode D<b>1</b> which rectifies the output of the high-speed amplifier <b>24</b>; a capacitor C<b>1</b> to which the output voltage of the high-speed amplifier <b>24</b> is charged via the diode D<b>1</b>; and a constant-current source <b>25</b> which discharges the capacitor C<b>1</b> by a constant current IO.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The integrator <b>23</b> is arranged so as to include an amplifier <b>26</b> which outputs a current corresponding to a difference between the charged voltage of the capacitor C<b>1</b> (namely, output Dett of the detector <b>22</b>) and the predetermined reference voltage Vf from a reference voltage source (not shown); and the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> which is charged with the output current of the amplifier <b>26</b> and which outputs the charged voltage as the carrier detection level Det.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, the detection circuit <b>8</b> in accordance with the present embodiment uses as the integrator <b>23</b>, an integrator <b>41</b> arranged as follows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an electric circuit diagram concretely showing an arrangement of the integrator <b>41</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">What is notable in the integrator <b>41</b> as arranged above is that “the constant current source F<b>4</b> as a bypass current source is provided with respect to the input differential pair, and charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> are reduced with respect to operating currents I<b>1</b> and I<b>2</b> of the differential pairs which are generated by the constant current sources F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>. The integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is generally charged and discharged as follows. Namely, the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is either charged or discharged in accordance with the output Dett of the detector <b>22</b>; or charged by the charging circuit in accordance with the output Dett while the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is constantly discharged at a constant level by the discharging circuit. By contrast, in the integrator <b>41</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf are set using a difference between (i) a sum of the operating current I<b>1</b> of the input differential pair and a current I<b>4</b> flowing through the bypass current source and (ii) the operating current I<b>2</b> of the differential pair.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the charged voltage of the capacitor C<b>1</b>, namely the output Dett of the detector <b>22</b>, is lower than the reference voltage Vf from the reference voltage source <b>44</b>, the transistor QN<b>2</b> is switched ON. This consequently switches ON the transistors QN<b>3</b>, QP<b>1</b>, QP<b>3</b>, QP<b>4</b>, and QP<b>2</b>. As a result, a current proportional to the sum of (A) the operating current I<b>1</b> and (B) the constantly flowing bypass current I<b>4</b> generated by the constant current source F<b>4</b> flows into the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> as a base current of the transistor QP<b>2</b>. On the other hand, a current proportional to the constantly flowing operational current I<b>2</b> generated by the constant current source F<b>2</b> flows out of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> as a base current of the transistor QN<b>4</b>. Therefore the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is charged by a current corresponding to a difference between the current flowing from the charging circuit <b>42</b> and the current flowing into the discharging circuit <b>43</b>. Here, the charge current Icj is expressed as follows:
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">where current amplification ratios of the transistors QN<b>3</b> and QN<b>4</b> are hfe(QN<b>3</b>) and hfe(QN<b>4</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">On the other hand, if the output Dett is higher than the reference voltage Vf, the transistor QN<b>2</b> is switched OFF, but the bypass current I<b>4</b> generated by the constant current source F<b>4</b> still flows. This consequently switches ON the transistors QN<b>3</b>, QP<b>1</b>, QP<b>3</b>, QP<b>4</b>, and QP<b>2</b>. As a result, the charging circuit <b>42</b> outputs a current proportional to the bypass current I<b>4</b> as the base current of the transistor QP<b>2</b>. Therefore the discharge current Icf of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is a current corresponding to a difference between a current flowing into the discharging circuit <b>43</b> and a current flowing from the charging circuit <b>42</b>. Here, the discharge current Icf is expressed as follows.

</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, even in a condition where the operating current I<b>2</b> is 70 nA which is larger than the operating current i<b>102</b>, and I<b>1</b>=15 nA and hfe(QN)=150, it is possible to achieve Icj=50 pA and Icf=50 pA by providing I<b>4</b>=27.5 nA. As a result, even though the operating current I<b>2</b> is 70 nA which is larger than the operating current i<b>102</b> and C<b>2</b> is set to 50 pF which is smaller than in the integrator <b>131</b>, it is possible to obtain the charge and discharge time constant of 100 msec/0.1 V the same as in the integrator <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In order to reduce the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> so as to reduce a chip area of the integrated circuit while maintaining a desired time constant, it is necessary to reduce the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf. In the conventional circuit configuration, if the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf are reduced by means of reduction of the operating currents i<b>101</b> and i<b>102</b> which flow through the transistors qn<b>101</b> and qn<b>102</b> and the transistors qn<b>104</b> and qn<b>105</b> as the differential pairs, problems may occur because the currents flowing through the transistors become small. Namely, examples of the problems include malfunction due to an increased impedance of the transistors, and significance influence of process variation and temperature dependency.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In contrast, the integrator <b>41</b> in accordance with the present embodiment is provided with the bypass current source F<b>4</b>. With this bypass current source F<b>4</b>, even if the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf are reduced in order to obtain the desired time constant, it is not necessary to excessively reduce in response to the reduction of the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf, the operating currents I<b>1</b> and I<b>2</b> which flow through the transistors QN<b>1</b> and QN<b>2</b> and the transistors QN<b>4</b> and QN<b>5</b> as the differential pairs. With this, it is possible to effectively reduce the chip area without causing the problems that arise from the reduction of the currents flowing through the transistors QN<b>1</b>, QN<b>2</b>, QN<b>4</b>, and QN<b>5</b>, such as the malfunction due to an increased impedance of the transistors, and the significant influence of process variation and temperature dependency.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Note that, the capacitance value of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> can be reduced to less than 50 pF, depending on the values of I<b>2</b>, I<b>2</b>, and I<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, the detection circuit <b>8</b> in accordance with the present embodiment outputs the carrier detection level Det in a manner as described below. Specifically, the detector <b>22</b> performs level discrimination of the received signal Sig based on the carrier detection level Det, so as to detect pulses of the carrier frequency to be detected. Then, the integrator <b>41</b> integrates a time during which the output Dett from the detector <b>22</b> is higher than the predetermined integration reference value Vf so as to detect pulses of the carrier frequency in a group, and outputs the integration output as the carrier detection level Det.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Accordingly noise superposed on the carrier is responded by the detector <b>22</b> at high speed, and the carrier detection level Det created by the integrator <b>41</b> is raised. In the integrator <b>41</b>, the transistors in the charging circuit <b>42</b> and discharging circuit <b>43</b> charge and discharge in accordance with whether or not the carrier exists, the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> which outputs the carrier detection level Det. These transistors are required to have response characteristics not to the carrier frequency, but only to a frequency of the baseband component. Therefore it is possible to further reduce the charge and discharge currents Icj and Icf of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> while obtaining a margin for the response of the transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, for performing the charging and discharging using the difference between the current from the charging circuit <b>42</b> and the current to the discharging circuit <b>43</b>, the charging circuit <b>42</b> in accordance with the present embodiment is provided with the bypass current source F<b>4</b> with respect to the input differential pair to which the output Dett is supplied from the detector <b>22</b>. The bypass current source F<b>4</b> constantly generates a charge current at a constant level. With this, even if the current value I<b>1</b> for driving the input differential pair that operates at the frequency of the received signal Sig is kept to be relatively small, it is possible to obtain a relatively large charge current because the bypass current source F<b>4</b> generates the constant level of charge current I<b>4</b> as an additional value. On the other hand, by providing the bypass current source F<b>4</b> to the charging circuit <b>42</b>, the discharging circuit <b>43</b> which operates at the baseband frequency can have a larger current value compared with the current value in the conventional discharging circuit. Namely, it is possible to set the current value of the discharging circuit <b>43</b> to a sum of (A) the current value to be discharged from the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> and (B) the current value I<b>4</b> of the bypass current source F<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore it is possible to concretely realize the constant charging and discharging as described earlier while retaining the comparatively small current value I<b>1</b> of the input differential pair, which needs to be operated at high speed, in the charging circuit <b>42</b>. As a result, it is also possible to realize the integrator <b>41</b> which consumes lower amounts of power.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, the integrator <b>41</b> is provided with the leak photocurrent compensating circuit composed of a PNP current mirror circuit of the transistors QP<b>5</b> and QP<b>6</b> adjacent to a PNP current mirror circuit of the transistors QP<b>3</b> and QP<b>4</b>, and the leak photocurrent compensating circuit composed of a PNP current mirror circuit of the transistors QP<b>9</b> and QP<b>10</b> adjacent to a PNP current mirror circuit of the transistors QP<b>7</b> and QP<b>8</b>. Note that, the PNP current mirror circuit (QP<b>3</b> and QP<b>4</b> or QP<b>7</b> and QP<b>8</b>) whose leak photocurrent is to be compensated, and the PNP current mirror circuit (QP<b>5</b> and QP<b>6</b> or QP<b>9</b> and QP<b>10</b>) as the leak photocurrent compensating circuit are adjacent to each other, and have the similar circuit configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows a structure of a lateral PNP transistor <b>51</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of the lateral PNP transistor <b>51</b>. An N-type epitaxial layer <b>53</b> is formed on a P-type substrate layer <b>52</b>, and divided by a trench <b>54</b> so as to form an element region. Due to the structure of the integrated circuit, a parasitic photodiode <b>55</b> is generated between the N-type epitaxial layer <b>53</b> as a base diffusion region and the substrate layer <b>52</b>, and connected between the base terminal of the PNP transistor <b>51</b> and the substrate layer <b>52</b> (ground).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, when incident light generates a photocurrent Ipd which flows from the N-type epitaxial layer <b>53</b> to the substrate layer <b>52</b>, the photocurrent Ipd serves as a base current Ib of the PNP transistor <b>51</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and significantly affects the circuit characteristics. The photocurrent Ipd increases in accordance with a volume of incident light. Thus, the photocurrent Ipd is large when the PNP transistor <b>51</b> is provided in the vicinity of the photodiode <b>2</b>. Further, since the photocurrent Ipd also increases in accordance with an area of the N-type epitaxial layer <b>53</b>, the photocurrent Ipd is larger as the PNP transistor <b>51</b> has a larger current capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Therefore, even if a low current is used in the current mirror circuit composed of the PNP transistor which is especially easily affected by light, it is possible to allow the current mirror circuit to create correct charge and discharge currents by providing adjacently to the current mirror circuit, a leak photocurrent compensating circuit composed of a similar PNP current mirror circuit. Note that, this method is described in detail in Tokukaihei 3-262153, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, the integrator <b>41</b> is designed to have the charge and discharge time constant of 100 msec/0.1 V. Though transmission codes of remote controllers vary depending on the manufacturer, each transmission code generally has the time length of about 50 msec to 150 msec as described earlier. Therefore, by designing the charge and discharge time constant as described above, it is possible to optimally detect the carrier with respect to the transmission codes of remote controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The following will describe another embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an electric circuit diagram concretely showing an arrangement of an integrator <b>61</b> used as the integrator <b>23</b>, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The integrator <b>61</b> is similar to the integrator <b>41</b> described earlier. Thus, parts corresponding to those used in the integrator <b>41</b> will be given the same reference symbols, and their explanation will be omitted here. Note that, among the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a charging circuit <b>62</b> other than the reference voltage source <b>44</b> (to be described later), and a discharging circuit <b>63</b> constitute the amplifier <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The integrator <b>61</b> differs from the integrator <b>41</b> described earlier in that the constant current source F<b>4</b> is not provided and, notably, a part of the transistors have different emitter areas. The transistors having different areas will be indicated by subscripts a attached to the reference symbols of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Namely, in the charging circuit <b>62</b>, transistors QP<b>3</b><i>a </i>and QP<b>4</b><i>a </i>which constitute a current mirror circuit are formed to have an emitter area ratio of m:1. In the discharging circuit <b>63</b>, transistors QN<b>4</b><i>a </i>and QN<b>5</b><i>a </i>which constitute a differential pair are formed to have a emitter area ratio of 1:n, and transistors QP<b>7</b><i>a </i>and QP<b>8</b><i>a </i>which constitute a current mirror circuit are formed to have an emitter area ratio of 1:n.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thus, if the output Dett of the detector <b>22</b> is lower than the reference voltage Vf, the charge current Icj to the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is expressed as follows.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Icj=I</i>1/<i>m/hfe</i>(<i>QN</i>3)−<i>I</i>2/(<i>n+</i>1)/<i>hfe</i>(<i>QN</i>4)  (7)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, if the output Dett is higher than the reference voltage Vf, the discharge current Icf from the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is expressed as follows.

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Icf=I</i>2/(<i>n+</i>1)/<i>hfe</i>(<i>QN</i>4)  (8)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If it is assumed as typical values that I<b>1</b>=45 nA, I<b>2</b>=45 nA, hfe(QN)=150, C<b>2</b>=50 pF, m=3, and n=5, then Icj=50 pA, Icf=50 pA, and the charge and discharge time constant is 100 msec/0.1 V. Here, a charge and discharge current ratio (Icj/Icf) is 1, and it is possible to receive a signal whose transmission code has a duty ratio of 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this case, with I<b>2</b>=45 nA and n=5, a collector current of the transistor QN<b>4</b><i>a </i>is 7.5 nA. This is the low current which is not more than 10 nA, but the integrator as a whole has a large current value. Thus, the impedance of the whole discharging circuit <b>63</b> does not increase and does not cause a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Note that, the capacitance value of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> can be reduced to less than 50 pF, depending on the values of I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, m, and n.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">With this, the problems due to the reduction of the currents flowing through the transistors do not occur even if the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> and the chip area of the integrated circuit are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The following will explain a further embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>), and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram showing an arrangement example of a carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> in accordance with the further embodiment of the present invention. The carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> is similar to the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Thus, parts corresponding to those used in the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> will be given the same reference symbols, and their explanation will be omitted here. The carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> is composed of a detection circuit <b>71</b> which is provided instead of the detection circuit <b>8</b>; the integration circuit <b>9</b>; and the hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the detection circuit <b>71</b> is composed of the detector <b>22</b> arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>; and an integrator <b>73</b> which is provided instead of the integrator <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The integrator <b>73</b> is arranged substantially the same as the integrator <b>23</b>, but the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> is notably provided with a bias voltage source <b>74</b>. The bias voltage source <b>74</b> applies a predetermined constant voltage V<b>1</b> to a terminal of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> of the integrator <b>73</b>, which is the terminal opposite to the terminal for receiving the charge and discharge currents.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>) show operating waveforms in a case where the carrier detecting circuit uses a power source that operates intermittently, namely in a case where the infrared remote controller receiver receives signals intermittently in order to reduce power consumption. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the operating waveforms of the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> provided with the detection circuit <b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the operational waveforms of the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> provided with the detection circuit <b>71</b> shown in FIG. <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), if the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> once releases electric charges when the power is cut off, the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> cannot properly operate during a period (100 msec to 300 msec) after the power is next applied until the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> having a large capacitance is charged again to the predetermined carrier detection level Det. If the time is wasted in stabilizing the circuit as described above, a time for actually receiving the remote controller codes becomes short during a receiving period of the intermittent reception. This may prevent normal reception.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> in accordance with the present embodiment can rapidly raise the carrier detection level Det to the predetermined level by means of the bias voltage V<b>1</b>, even after electric charges of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> is released when the power is cut off. Thus, a longer time can be used to receive the remote controller codes during the receiving period of the intermittent reception. Therefore the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> is effectively used together with a power source that intermittently operates.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In response to a recent strong demand for energy saving, a standby power of the remote controller is arranged to operate intermittently in some cases. In these cases, if the charge and discharge time constant of the carrier detecting circuit is large as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), the carrier detecting circuit cannot properly receive the codes for a long period after the power is applied, because it takes time for the circuit to stabilize. On the other hand, if the charge and discharge time constant is reduced, it is not possible to keep the carrier detection level Det stable enough to stably detect a carrier with respect to the transmission codes from the remote controller. Here, the carrier detection level Det sharply changes, and thus the carrier detecting circuit cannot stably detect the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In contrast, the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> in accordance with the present embodiment is provided with the bias voltage source <b>74</b> for applying the predetermined constant voltage V<b>1</b> to the terminal of the integration capacitor C<b>2</b> of the integrator <b>73</b>, which is the terminal opposite to the terminal for receiving the charge and discharge currents.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Therefore, by using the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b>, it is possible to rapidly raise the carrier detection level Det after the power is applied, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), while obtaining the charge and discharge time constant enough to stably detect the carrier, thereby properly receiving the codes.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As an example, the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> in accordance with the present embodiment sets the charge and discharge time constant of not less than 100 msec as a charge and discharge time constant enough to stably detect the carrier. With this, the carrier detection level Det stabilizes enough to stably detect the carrier with respect to the transmission codes of the remote controller, so that the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b> can stably detect the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, it is preferable that the bias voltage V<b>1</b> is set in the neighborhood of or equal to the level of the output Sig (reception signal) of the bandpass filter <b>5</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The following will explain yet another embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>), and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram showing an electrical arrangement of an infrared remote controller receiver <b>81</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention.

Thus, parts corresponding to those used in the receiver <b>1</b> will be given the same reference symbols, and their explanation will be omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Notably, the receiver <b>81</b> is provided with a detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC (Auto Gain Control), in addition to the detection circuit <b>8</b> or <b>71</b> for reception signals which constitutes either (A) the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> including the integrator <b>41</b> or <b>61</b> or (B) the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b>. Moreover, the detection circuit <b>82</b> is also provided with the integrator <b>41</b>, <b>61</b>, or <b>73</b>. The detection circuit <b>82</b> detects a noise peak of the output Sig of the bandpass filter <b>5</b>, and in response to a result of the detection, an AGC circuit <b>83</b> controls gains of the second-stage amplifier <b>5</b> and the third-stage amplifier <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Emitted light from an inverted fluorescent lamp for home use contains a component of from 30 kHz to 60 kHz, which is the same as the carrier component of the infrared remote controller. Thus, if there is an inverted fluorescent lamp around the receiver, the receiver detects the noise component of the inverted fluorescent lamp. This causes a problem such that the receiver incorrectly operates or, in the worst case, cannot correctly receive the transmission signals. Therefore, by providing the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC and causing the AGC circuit <b>83</b> to carry out the gain control, it is possible to improve characteristics against the disturbance fluorescent light noise.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">However, if the AGC circuit <b>83</b> performs the gain control, it is necessary to provide the carrier detecting circuit for AGC separately from the carrier detecting circuit for signal detection. Here, addition of another stage of circuit whose capacitance is as much as 100 pF enlarges the chip size, thus increasing the cost. Therefore the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC is provided with the integrator <b>41</b> or <b>61</b> as in the detection circuit for reception signals. With this, it is possible to suppress the cost by suppressing the chip area while retaining the characteristics against the disturbance fluorescent light.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As described above, the infrared communication device in accordance with the present embodiment is arranged so as to include a detection circuit for AGC <b>82</b> which generates an AGC voltage for AGC by integral action based on a reception signal, in addition to either the carrier detecting circuit <b>20</b> including the integrator <b>41</b> or <b>61</b> or the carrier detecting circuit <b>70</b>, the detection circuit <b>82</b> being provided with the integrator <b>41</b>, <b>61</b>, or <b>73</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Alternatively, an integrator <b>61</b> (<b>73</b>) which performs the integral action in the detection circuit for AGC <b>82</b> includes a charging circuit <b>62</b> and a discharging circuit <b>63</b>.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, it is preferable that a carrier detecting circuit in the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC has a larger charge and discharge time constant compared with the carrier detecting circuit in the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) for reception signals. Reasons for this will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) shows waveforms in a case where the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC is smaller than the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) for reception signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) shows waveforms in a case where the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC is larger than the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) for reception signals.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Generally, the carrier detecting circuit in the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) is provided with a quick charging circuit with respect to the carrier detection level Det in order to improve the characteristics against disturbance fluorescent light. Consequently, the carrier detection level Det indicated by the reference symbols γ<b>12</b> and γ<b>22</b> quickly rises in accordance with the output Sig of the bandpass filter <b>5</b> indicated by the reference symbols γ<b>11</b> and γ<b>21</b>. The output Sig is discriminated at the carrier detection level Det, and then the waveform of the discriminated output Sig is shaped by the integration circuit <b>9</b> and the hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>. As a result, it is possible to obtain the baseband signal (output signal Dout) indicated by the reference symbols γ<b>13</b> and γ<b>23</b>, which is pulses of a result of the discrimination that are detected in groups.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) where the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC is smaller than the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) for reception signals, the AGC voltage, as indicated by the reference symbol γ<b>14</b>, quickly rises in accordance with the output Sig of the bandpass filter <b>5</b> indicated by the reference symbol γ<b>11</b>. Further, the AGC voltage limits the gains of the second-stage amplifier <b>5</b> and the third-stage amplifier <b>6</b>, and thereby rapidly lowers an amplitude level of the output Sig, as indicated by the reference symbol γ<b>3</b>. Here, even if the output Sig is discriminated at the carrier detection level Det, pulses are not detected. As a result, after the waveform of the output Int of the integration circuit <b>9</b> is shaped by the hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>, some pulses are missing from the baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In contrast, in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) where the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>82</b> for AGC is larger than the charge and discharge time constant of the detection circuit <b>8</b> (<b>71</b>) for reception signals, the AGC voltage, as indicated by the reference symbol γ<b>24</b>, gradually rises in accordance with the output Sig of the bandpass filter <b>5</b> indicated by the reference symbol γ<b>21</b>. Further, the AGC voltage maintains the comparatively high gains of the second-stage amplifier <b>5</b> and the third-stage amplifier <b>6</b>, and thereby maintains a sufficient amplitude level of the output Sig. Here, when the output Sig is discriminated at the carrier detection level Det, pulses are continuously detected. As a result, when the waveform of the output Int of the integration circuit <b>9</b> is shaped by the hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>, the baseband signal can be obtained continuously. In this manner, it is possible to prevent the pulse missing due to instable AGC operation.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As described above, a carrier detecting circuit (<b>20</b>, <b>70</b>) of the present invention which generates a carrier detection level by integral action based on a reception signal and detects using the carrier detection level whether a carrier exists is so arranged that an integration capacitor (C<b>2</b>) is charged and discharged using a difference current between a current charged from a charging circuit (<b>42</b>) and a current discharged to a discharging circuit (<b>43</b>), the charging circuit (<b>42</b>) and the discharging circuit (<b>43</b>) being provided in an integrator (<b>23</b>; <b>41</b>) which performs the integral action.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further, a carrier detecting circuit (<b>20</b>, <b>70</b>) of the present invention is arranged so as to include a detector (<b>22</b>) for detecting from a reception signal, a group of pulses of a carrier frequency to be detected; an integrator (<b>23</b>; <b>41</b>) for integrating based on an output signal of the detector (<b>22</b>), a time during which the group of pulses exist, and outputting a result of the integration as a carrier detection level; an integration circuit (<b>9</b>) for integrating based on the carrier detection level and the reception signal, a time during which a carrier exists; and a determination circuit (hysteresis comparator <b>10</b>) for determining based on an output of the integration circuit, whether the carrier exists, the integrator (<b>23</b>; <b>41</b>) including an integration capacitor (C<b>2</b>), a charging circuit (<b>42</b>) which constantly charges the integration capacitor, and a discharging circuit (<b>43</b>) which constantly discharges the integration capacitor, at least one of a level of a current charged from the charging circuit and a level of a current discharged to the discharging circuit being changed in accordance with the output signal of the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A carrier detecting circuit mounted on an infrared remote controller receiver, etc., may be arranged so that an integrator performs integral action based on a reception signal so as to generate a carrier detection level, and detects using the carrier detection level whether a carrier exists. Here, the carrier detecting circuit eliminates noise superposed on the carrier by discriminating the reception signal at the carrier detection level, for example, and then integrates a result of the discrimination so as to generate the carrier detection level.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Generally, in the process of generating the carrier detection level, the integration capacitor is (i) either charged or discharged in accordance with the result of the discrimination, or (ii) charged in accordance with the result of the discrimination while the integration capacitor is constantly discharged at a constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In contrast, in the present invention, the integration capacitor is both charged and discharged constantly at a level that varies in accordance with the result of the discrimination.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In order to reduce the integration capacitor so as to reduce a chip area of the integrated circuit while maintaining a desired time constant, it is necessary to reduce the charge and discharge currents. Here, if operating currents which flow through the transistors in the charging circuit and operating currents which flow through transistors in the discharging circuit are reduced in accordance with the reduction of the charge and discharge currents, problems may occur because the currents flowing through the transistors become small. Namely, examples of the problems include the malfunction due to an increased impedance of the transistors, and the significant influence of process variation and temperature dependency.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In contrast, with the arrangement as described above, the integration capacitor is charged and discharged using a difference current between a current charged from the charging circuit and a current discharged from the discharging circuit. Therefore, even if the charge and discharge currents are reduced, it is not necessary to excessively reduce in response to the reduction of the charge and discharge currents, the operating currents which flow through the transistors in the charging circuit and discharging circuit. With this, it is possible to effectively reduce the chip area without causing the problems that arise from the reduction of the currents flowing through the transistors, such as the malfunction due to the increased impedance of the transistors, and the significant influence of process variation and temperature dependency.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The carrier detecting circuit may be arranged so as to include a detector (<b>22</b>) for discriminating the reception signal at the carrier detection level so as to detect pulses of a carrier frequency to be detected, the integrator integrating a time during which an output from the detector is not less than a predetermined integration reference value so as to detect the pulses of the carrier frequency in a group, and outputting a result of the integration as the carrier detection level.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">With this arrangement, noise superposed on the carrier is responded by the detector at high speed, and the carrier detection level created by the integrator is raised. On the other hand, in the integrator, the transistors in the charging circuit and discharging circuit charge and discharge in accordance with whether or not the carrier exists, the integration capacitor which outputs the carrier detection level. These transistors are required to have response characteristics not to the carrier frequency, but only to a frequency of the baseband component. Therefore it is possible to further reduce the charge and discharge currents of the integration capacitor while obtaining a margin for the response of the transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Further, the carrier detecting circuit may be arranged so that the charging circuit includes a bypass current source (F<b>4</b>) with respect to an input differential pair (QN<b>1</b>, QN<b>2</b>) to which the output of the detector is supplied, the bypass current source allowing the charging circuit to constantly generate a constant level of charge current; and the discharging circuit, which operates at a baseband frequency, has a current capacitance that is a sum of a current value to be discharged from the integration capacitor and a current value generated by the bypass current source.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">With this arrangement, the input differential pair in the charging circuit, which receives the output of the detector and operates at the frequency of the reception signal, still has a comparatively low current value, and the bypass current source provided with respect to the input differential pair generates the constant level of charge current as an additional value. On the other hand, by increasing the current value of the discharging circuit than that of the conventional discharging circuit, the discharging circuit which operates at the baseband frequency additionally generates a current corresponding to the additional current value of the bypass current source.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Therefore it is possible to concretely realize the constant charging and discharging as described earlier, while retaining the comparatively low current value of the input differential pair, which is required to operate at high speed, in the charging circuit.
