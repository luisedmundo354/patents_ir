<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a resin gear forming a power transmission device for various machines, such as printers, copying machines, video tape recorders and automotive parts, and a method for producing the same. The present invention also relates to an injection molded resin rotating body, such as a resin gear, a resin pulley or a resin sprocket, and a method for producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional power transmission devices for machines, such as copying machines and automotive parts, use resin gears in order to reduce the price, weight and operation noises of parts. Typically, such a resin gear is formed so as to have a predetermined shape by injection molding. The shape of the resin gear is devised so that the resin gear has a desired precision of tooth profile and a desired strength in accordance with intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show such a conventional injection molded resin gear <b>21</b>. In the injection molded resin gear <b>21</b> shown in these figures, in order to decrease the amount of shrinkage in a process for cooling and solidifying a resin after injection molding to improve the precision of gear, a rim <b>23</b> having teeth <b>22</b> on its outer periphery is connected to a hub <b>25</b>, into which a driving shaft <b>24</b> is to be fitted, by means of a thin-plate-like web <b>26</b> in radial directions. However, in such an injection molded resin gear <b>21</b> having the thin web <b>26</b>, the rigidity of the web <b>26</b> deteriorates, so that there are some cases where a twist between the rim <b>23</b> and the hub <b>25</b> is given by external force acting thereon during power transmission to deteriorate the precision of transmission of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in the conventional injection molded resin gear <b>21</b>, circumferential ribs <b>27</b> are formed on both sides of the web <b>26</b> between the hub <b>25</b> and the rim <b>23</b> to be connected to the hub <b>25</b> by radial ribs <b>28</b> and to rim <b>23</b> by radial ribs <b>30</b>, so that the rigidity of the web <b>26</b> is enhanced by the plurality of circumferential ribs <b>27</b> and radial ribs <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10-278124).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a conventional injection molded resin gear <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, there are some cases where injection molding gates <b>31</b> are arranged on a side of the web <b>26</b> on extension lines La which extend in radial directions from the radial ribs <b>30</b>. Since a resin material injected into a cavity (not shown) from the gates <b>31</b>, which are arranged on the extension lines La extending in radial directions from the radial ribs <b>30</b>, is easy to flow along a space for forming the radial ribs <b>30</b> in the cavity (not shown), the resin material is late in flowing into a space for forming the web <b>26</b> in the cavity, so that the flow velocity of the resin material is not uniform in radial directions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, if the radial ribs <b>28</b> are arranged at positions at which resin materials injected from adjacent two of the gates <b>31</b> meet each other, after the resin materials injected from the adjacent two of the gates <b>31</b> meet each other, the resin materials are easy to flow in a space for forming the radial ribs <b>28</b> in the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result, when the resin material injected from the gates <b>31</b> flows in the cavity, the time for the resin material to reach outside and inside radial ends varies in accordance with the circumferential positions. Thus, the flow of the resin material is not uniform, so that it is difficult to uniformly apply an appropriate molding pressure on the rim <b>23</b> having the teeth <b>22</b> and on the hub <b>25</b> into which the driving shaft <b>24</b> is to be fitted. In addition, the cooling rate of the resin material is not uniform, and the amount of shrinkage during cooling and solidification varies in accordance with the circumferential positions, so that it is difficult to improve the precision of gear.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, in the injection molded resin gear <b>21</b> formed by injection-molding a resin including a reinforced fiber, such as carbon fiber, since the radial flow velocity of the resin material injected from the gates <b>31</b> varies in accordance with the circumferential positions as described above, the orientation of the reinforced fiber is disturbed to cause a great difference in shrinkage during cooling and solidification of the resin material, and to cause a different in cooling solidification rate of the resin material, so that there is a problem in that the roundness (the precision of gear) of the toothed portion formed on the rim <b>23</b> deteriorates.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore an object of the present invention to eliminate the aforementioned problems and to provide an injection molded resin gear having a higher precision of gear, an injection molded resin rotating body having a higher precision of shape, and a method for producing them.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the injection molding gates <b>12</b> are arranged so that the middle position in circumferential directions between adjacent two of the gates <b>12</b> is not positioned on extension lines L<b>1</b>, which extend in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b>, and on extension lines L<b>2</b> which extend in radial directions from the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>. The gates <b>12</b> are arranged at positions in radial directions so that a pressure during injection molding effectively acts on the side of the rim <b>6</b> to improve the precision of shape of the teeth <b>5</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the positions of the gates <b>12</b> in radial directions are nearer to the circumferential ribs <b>8</b> than the hub <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, in the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> in this preferred embodiment, the gates <b>12</b> are not positioned on the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and the extension lines L<b>1</b> which extend in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b>, and the gates <b>12</b> are not positioned on the outside radial ribs <b>11</b> and the extension lines L<b>2</b> which extend in radial directions from the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the resin material injected from the gates <b>12</b> into a cavity <b>14</b> of a die <b>13</b> first flows in a portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>in the cavity <b>14</b>, which corresponds to the web <b>7</b>, without being first filled in portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>in the cavity <b>14</b>, which correspond to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b>, and in portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>in the cavity <b>14</b>, which correspond to the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, so that the filling rate in radial directions in the cavity <b>14</b> is uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As a result, according to this preferred embodiment, the cooling solidification rate of the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> after injection molding is uniform, so that it is possible to decrease the difference in shrinkage between portions of the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> to improve the precision of gear (roundness and precision of tooth profile). In particular, if the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> in this preferred embodiment is formed by injection-molding a resin containing a reinforced fiber, such as carbon fiber, it is difficult to disturb the orientation of the reinforced fiber of the resin material, so that it is possible to remarkably decrease the difference in shrinkage between portions due to the disturbance of the orientation of the reinforced fiber. Thus, it is possible to more effectively improve the precision of gear.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> having been cooled and solidified in the cavity <b>14</b> is separated from the injection molding gates <b>12</b> when being taken out of the cavity <b>14</b>, so that cut scars <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed by separating the gates <b>12</b> from the gear remain at positions corresponding to the injection molding gates <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). However, the cut scars <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed by separating the gates <b>12</b> from the gear do not influence the precision of gear and do not disturb power transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, if the gates <b>12</b> are arranged at positions corresponding to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and/or outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, or if the gates <b>12</b> are arranged on the extension lines L<b>1</b> extending in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and/or on the extension lines L<b>2</b> extending in radial directions from the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, after the resin material injected from the gates <b>12</b> into the cavity <b>14</b> first flows in the portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and in the portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, the resin material flows in the portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the web <b>7</b>. Thus, the cooling solidification rate is not only ununiform after injection molding, but it is also difficult to adequately hold a pressure on the side of the rim <b>6</b>, which is required to hold the precision of molding of the teeth <b>5</b>, and a pressure on the side of the hub <b>4</b> into which the driving shaft <b>2</b> is to be fitted, so that it is difficult to improve the precision of gear.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> in this preferred embodiment, the middle position in circumferential directions between adjacent two of the gates <b>12</b> is displaced from the extension lines L<b>1</b> extending in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b>, and from the extension lines L<b>2</b> extending in radial directions from the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>. As a result, after the resin materials injected from adjacent two of the gates <b>12</b> into the cavity <b>14</b> meet each other at the middle position in circumferential directions between the adjacent two of the gears <b>12</b>, the resin materials do not flow in the portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and in the portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, prior to the portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the web <b>7</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, it is possible to more effectively improve the precision of gear in cooperation with the advantageous effects obtained by the fact that the gates <b>12</b> are not positioned on the extension lines L<b>1</b> extending in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and on the extension lines L<b>2</b> extending in radial directions from the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in these figures, in the injection molded resin gear <b>1</b> in this preferred embodiment, a plurality of injection molding gates <b>12</b> are arranged in regular intervals on a circumferential rib <b>8</b>. The injection molding gates <b>12</b> are arranged at the middle position between a connecting portion, at which each of inside radial ribs <b>10</b> is connected to the circumferential rib <b>8</b>, and a connecting portion at which a corresponding one of outside radial ribs <b>11</b> is connected to the circumferential rib <b>8</b>. In addition, the gates <b>12</b> are arranged on the circumferential rib <b>8</b> so that the middle position in circumferential direction between adjacent two of the gates <b>12</b> is not positioned on extension lines L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> extending in radial directions from the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and outside radial ribs <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to this preferred embodiment with such a construction, after resin materials injected from the gates <b>12</b> flow along the circumferential rib <b>8</b>, the resin materials substantially uniformly flow in radial directions from the circumferential rib <b>8</b>, so that the circumferential rib <b>8</b> functions as a ring gate. Therefore, according to this preferred embodiment with such a construction, the flow of the resin materials injected from the gates <b>12</b> is uniform, and the cooling solidification rate after injection molding is uniform, so that it is possible to inhibit the occurrence of a difference in shrinkage between portions to further improve the precision of gear in cooperation with the advantageous effects obtained by the same portions as those in the above described first preferred embodiment.</p>

In this preferred embodiment, the same reference numbers as those in the above described first preferred embodiment are given to the same portions as those in the first preferred embodiment to omit repeated explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the injection molded resin gear <b>201</b> in this preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, only one injection molding gate <b>12</b> is arranged. In this preferred embodiment, the injection molding rate <b>12</b> is arranged at a position on one side <b>9</b> of a web <b>7</b> surrounded by a hub <b>4</b>, a circumferential rib <b>8</b> and adjacent two of inside radial ribs <b>10</b> so as to be displaced in circumferential directions with respect to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and outside radial ribs <b>11</b>. In addition, the injection molding gate <b>12</b> is arranged so that the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and outside radial ribs <b>11</b> are not positioned on an extension line extending in radial directions from the injection molding gate <b>12</b>. Thus, the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and the outside radial ribs <b>11</b> are not arranged at positions at which resin materials injected from the injection molding gate <b>12</b> meet each other in circumferential directions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to this preferred embodiment with such a construction, the resin material injected from the injection molding gate <b>12</b> into a cavity <b>14</b> does not first flow in portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the inside radial ribs <b>10</b> and/or in portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the outside radial ribs <b>11</b>, prior to a portion <b>7</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the web <b>7</b>.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Other Preferred Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention should not be limited to the above described injection molded resin gears <b>1</b>, <b>101</b> and <b>201</b> in the first through third preferred embodiments, but the invention may be widely applied to an injection molded resin rotating body, such as an injection molded resin pulley, an injection molded resin sprocket or an injection molded resin roller. That is, the present invention may be widely applied to an injection molded resin rotating body which comprises an outside annular portion onto which a belt or chain is to be wound, a shaft supporting portion for engaging a shaft, and a plate portion which connects the annular portion to the shaft supporting portion in radial directions.
