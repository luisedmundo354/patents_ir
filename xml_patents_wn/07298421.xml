<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present intention relates to a digital television reception system, and more particularly, to a 8T-VSB (Vestigial Sideband) reception system resistant to ghost and noise and receiving and decoding supplemental data in addition to MPEG data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The United States of America has employed ATSC 8T-VSB (8 Trellis-Vestigial Sideband) as a standard since 1995, and has been broadcasting in the ATSC 8T-VSB since the later half of 1998. South Korea also has employed the ATSC 8T-VSD as a standard. South Korea started test broadcasting in May 1995, and has since August 2000 put in place a regular test broadcasting system. The advancement of technology allows the transmission of digital television(DTV) in the same 6 MHz bandwidth currently used by NTSC.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a conventional ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system <b>25</b> (“VSB transmission system”). The VSB transmission system <b>25</b> generally comprises a data randomizer <b>1</b>, Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b>, data interleaver <b>3</b>, Trellis coder <b>4</b>, multiplexer <b>5</b>, pilot inserter <b>6</b>, VSB modulator <b>7</b> and RF converter <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is a data randomizer <b>1</b> for receiving and making random MPEG data (video, audio and ancillary data). The data randomizer <b>1</b> receives the MPEG-II data output from an MPEG-II encoder. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the MPEG-II encoder takes baseband digital video and performs bit rate compression using the techniques of discrete cosine transform, run length coding, and bi-directional motion prediction. The MPEG-II encoder then multiplexes this compressed data together with pre-coded audio and any ancillary data that will be transmitted. The result is a stream of compressed MPEG-II data packets with a data frequency of only 19.39 Mbit/Sec. The MPEG-II encoder outputs such data to the data randomizer in serial form. MPEG-II packets are 188 bytes in length with the first byte in each packet always being the sync or header byte. The MPEG-II sync byte is then discarded. The sync byte will ultimately be replaced by the ATSC segment sync in a later stage of processing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, the 8-VSB bit stream should have a random, noise-like signal. The reason being that the transmitted signal frequency response must have a flat noise-like spectrum in order to use the allotted 6 MHz channel space with maximum efficiency. Random data minimizes interference into analog NTSC. In the data randomizer <b>1</b>, each byte value is changed according to known pattern of pseudo-random number generation. This process is reversed in the VSB receiver in order to recover the proper data values.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b> of the VSB transmission system <b>25</b> is used for subjecting the output data of the data randomizer <b>1</b> to Reed-Solomon coding and adding a 20 byte parity code to the output data. Reed Solomon encoding is a type of forward error correction scheme applied to the incoming data stream. Forward error correction is used to correct bit errors that occur during transmission due to signal fades, noise, etc. Various types of techniques may be used as the forward error correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b> takes all 187 bytes of an incoming MPEG-II data packet (the sync or header byte has been removed from 188 bytes) and mathematically manipulates them as a block to create a digital sketch of the block contents. This “sketch” occupies 20 additional bytes which are added at the tail end of the original 187 byte packet. These 20 bytes are known as Reed-Solomon parity bytes. The 20 Reed-Solomon parity bytes for every data packet add redundancy for forward error correction of up to 10 byte errors/packet. Since Reed-Solomon decoders correct byte errors, and bytes can have anywhere from 1 to 8 bit errors within them, a significant amount of error correction can be accomplished in the VSB reception system. The output of the Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b> is 207 bytes (187 plus 20 parity bytes).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The VSB reception system will compare the received 187 byte block to the 20 parity bytes in order to determine the validity of the recovered data. If errors are detected, the receiver can use the parity bytes to locate the exact location of the errors, modify the corrupted bytes, and reconstruct the original information.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The data interleaver <b>3</b> interleaves the output data of the Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b>. In particular, the data interleaver <b>3</b> mixes the sequential order of the data packet and disperses or delays the MPEG-II packet throughout time. The data interleaver <b>3</b> then reassembles new data packets incorporating small sections from many different MPEG-II (pre-interleaved) packets. The reassembled packets are 207 bytes each.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The purpose of the data interleaver <b>3</b> is to prevent losing of one or more packets due to noise or other harmful transmission environment. By interleaving data into many different packets, even if one packet is completely lost, the original packet may be substantially recovered from information contained in other packets.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The VSB transmission system <b>25</b> also has a trellis coder <b>4</b> for converting the output data of the data interleaver <b>3</b> from byte form into symbol form and for subjecting it to trellis coding. In the trellis coder <b>4</b>, bytes from the data interleaver <b>3</b> are converted into symbols and provided one by one to a plurality of Trellis coders and precoders <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>32</b>-<b>12</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Trellis coding is another form of forward error correction. Unlike Reed-Solomon coding, which treated the entire MPEG-II packet simultaneously as a block, trellis coding is an evolving code that tracks the progressing stream of bits as it develops through time.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The trellis coder <b>4</b> adds additional redundancy to the signal in the form of more (than four data levels, creating the multilevel (<b>8</b>) data symbols for transmission. For trellis coding, each 8-bit byte is split up into a stream of four, 2-bit words. In the trellis coder <b>4</b>, each 2-bit input word is compared to the past history of previous 2-bit words. A 3-bit binary code is mathematically generated to describe the transition from the previous 2-bit word to the current one. These 3-bit codes are substituted for the original 2-bit words and transmitted as the eight level symbols of 8-VSD. For every two bits that enter the trellis coder <b>4</b>, three bits come out.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The trellis decoder in the VSB receiver uses the received 2-bit transition codes to reconstruct the evolution of the data stream from one 2-bit word to the next. In this way, the trellis coder follows a “trail” as the signal moves from one word to the next through time. The power of trellis coding lies in its ability to track a signal's history through time and discard potentially faulty information (errors) based on a signal's past and future behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A multiplexer <b>5</b> is used for multiplexing a symbol stream from the trellis coder <b>4</b> and synchronizing signals. The segment and the field synchronizing signals provide information to the VSB receiver to accurately locate and demodulate the transmitted RF signal. The segment and the field synchronizing signals are inserted after the randomization and error coding stages so as not to destroy the fixed time and amplitude relationships that these signals must possess to be effective. The multiplexer <b>5</b> provides the output from the trellis coder <b>4</b> and the segment and the field synchronizing signals in a time division manner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An output packet of the data interleaver <b>3</b> comprises the 207 bytes of an interleaved data packet. After trellis coding, the 207 byte segment is stretched out into a baseband stream of 828 eight level symbols. The segment synchronizing signal is a four symbol pulse that is added to the front of each data segment and replaces the missing first byte (packet sync byte) of the original MPEG-II data packet. The segment synchronizing signal appears once every 832 symbols and always takes the form of a positive-negative-positive pulse swinging between the +5 and −5 signal levels</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The field synchronizing signal is an entire data segment that is repeated once per field. The field synchronizing signal has a known data symbol pattern of positive-negative pulses and is used by the receiver to eliminate signal ghosts caused by poor reception.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The VSB transmission system <b>25</b> also has the pilot inserter <b>6</b> for inserting pilot signals into the symbol stream from the multiplexer <b>5</b>. Similar to the synchronizing signals described above, the pilot signal is inserted after the randomization and error coding stages so as not to destroy the fixed time and amplitude relationships that these signals must possess to be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Before the data is modulated, a small DC shift is applied to the 8T-VSB baseband signal. This causes a small residual carrier to appear at the zero frequency point of the resulting modulated spectrum. This is the pilot signal provided by the pilot inserter <b>6</b>. This gives the RF PLL circuits in the VSB receiver something to lock onto that is independent of the data being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">After the pilot signal has been inserted by the pilot inserter <b>6</b>, the output is subjected to a VSB modulator <b>7</b>. The VSB modulator <b>7</b> modulates the symbol stream from the pilot inserter <b>6</b> into an 8 VSB signal of an intermediate frequency band. The VSB modulator <b>7</b> provides a filtered (root-raised cosine) IF signal at a standard frequency (44 Mhz in the U.S.), with most of one sideband removed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In particular, the eight level baseband signal is amplitude modulated onto an intermediate frequency (IF) carrier. The modulation produces a double sideband IF spectrum about the carrier frequency. The total spectrum is too wide to be transmitted in the assigned 6 MHz channel.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sidelobes produced by the modulation are simply scaled copies of the center spectrum, and the entire lower sideband is a mirror image of the upper sideband. Therefore using a filter, the VSB modulator discards the entire lower sideband and all of the sidelobes in the upper sideband. The remaining signal (upper half of the center spectrum) is firmer eliminated in one-half by using the Nyquist filter. The Nyquist filter is based on the Nyquist Theory, which summarizes that only a ½ frequency bandwidth is required to transmit a digital signal at a given sampling rate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Finally, there is a RF (Radio Frequency) converter <b>8</b> for converting the signal of an intermediate frequency band from the VSB modulator <b>7</b> into a signal of a RF band signal, and for transmitting the signal to a reception system through an antenna <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The foregoing VSB communication system is at least partially described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,636,251, 5,629,958 and 5,600,677 by Zenith Co. which are incorporated herein by reference. The 8T-VSB transmission system, which is employed as the standard digital TV broadcasting in North America and South Korea, was developed for the transmission of MPEG video and audio data. As technologies for processing digital signals develop and the use of the Internet increases, the trend currently is to integrate digitized home appliances, the personal computer, and the Internet into one comprehensive system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system <b>150</b> (“VSB reception system”). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a demodulator <b>11</b> for receiving a RF band signal through an antenna <b>10</b> and converting the RE band signal into a base band signal, a synchronizing and timing recovery (not shown) for recovering a segment synchronizing signal, a field synchronizing signal and symbol timing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">There is a comb filter <b>12</b> for removing an NTSC interference signal, and a channel equalizer <b>13</b> for correction of a distorted channel by using a slicer predictor <b>14</b>. A phase tracker <b>15</b> is provided for correcting a phase of a received signal, and a Trellis decoder <b>16</b> for subjecting the phase corrected signal to Viterbi decoding. There is a data deinterleaver <b>17</b> for carrying out a reverse action of the data interleaver <b>3</b> in the transmission system, and a Reed-Solomon decoder <b>18</b> for decoding the Reed-Solomon coded signal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The VSB reception system <b>150</b> further includes a a data derandomizer <b>19</b> for making a reverse action of the data randomizer <b>1</b> in the transmission system. Thus, the VSB reception system <b>150</b> can receive only the MPEG data, and no supplemental data. Accordingly, the development of a reception system that can receive the supplemental data as well as the MPEG video and audio data is needed. Moreover, the prediction reliability of the slicer predictor <b>14</b> in the VSB reception system <b>150</b>, which predicts a signal level group, degrades in the presence of excessive channel noise or an excessive ghost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, illustrates a block diagram showing a VSB transmitter <b>95</b> for the transmission of the supplemental and MPEG data in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the VSB transmitter <b>95</b> includes a VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> and a VSB transmission system <b>25</b>. The description of the VSB transmission system <b>25</b> is described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and thus will not be repeated. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> includes a Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b>, a data interleaver <b>21</b>, a null sequence inserter <b>22</b>, an MPEG header inserter <b>23</b>, a multiplexer <b>24</b>, an 8T-VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, and an antenna <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for the transmission of the supplemental data from the VSB transmitter <b>95</b> (i.e., a broadcasting station) to a VSB reception system on a channel (terrestrial or cable), the VSB transmitter <b>95</b> subjects the supplemental data to various digital signal processes. To provide backward compatibility of the present invention with existing devices, the supplemental data is preferably 164 byte packet which will eventually be processed to be a 187 byte packet before entering the VSB transmission system <b>25</b>. However, the size of the supplemental data packet may be varied so long as the output of the VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> is compatible with the VSB transmission system <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b>, there is provided a Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> for the correction of errors. The supplemental data is coded at a Reed-Solomon coder (or R-S coder) <b>20</b>. Preferably, the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> is used for subjecting the supplemental data to Reed-Solomon coding and adding a 20 byte parity code to the output data. As described above, Reed Solomon encoding is a type of forward error correction scheme applied to the incoming data stream. Forward error correction is used to correct bit errors that occur during transmission due to signal fades, noise, etc. Various other types of error correction techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used as the forward error correction process.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the preferred embodiment, the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> of the VSB supplemental data processor takes 164 bytes of an incoming supplemental data packet and mathematically manipulates them as a block to create a digital sketch of the block contents. The 20 additional bytes are added at the tail end of the original 164 byte packet. These 20 bytes are known as Reed-Solomon parity bytes. Since Reed-Solomon decoders of the VSB reception system correct byte errors, and bytes can have anywhere from 1 to 8 bit errors within them, a significant amount of error correction can be accomplished in the VSB reception system. The output of the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> is preferably 184 bytes (164 bytes from the original packet plus 20 parity bytes).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> further includes the data interleaver <b>21</b>, which interleaves the output data of the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b>. The data interleaver <b>21</b> is for interleaving the coded supplemental data to enhance performance against burst noise. The data interleaver <b>21</b> may be omitted, if it is not required to enhance the burst noise performance of supplements data.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The data interleaver <b>21</b> according to the preferred embodiment mixes the sequential order of the supplemental data packet and disperses or delays the supplemental data packet throughout time. The data interleaver <b>21</b> then reassembles new data packets incorporating small sections from many different supplemental data packets. Each one of the reassembled packets are preferably 184 bytes long.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, the purpose of the data interleaver <b>21</b> is to prevent losing of one or more packets due to noise or other harmful transmission environment. By interleaving data into many different packets, even if one packet is completely lost, the original packet may be recovered from information contained in other packets. However, because there is a data interleaver in the ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system, the data interleaver for the supplemental data can be omitted if it is not required to enhance the burst noise performance of the supplemental data. For this reason, the data interleaver <b>21</b> may not be necessary for the VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> also includes the null sequence inserter <b>22</b> for inserting a null sequence to an allocated region of the interleaved (if the data interleaver <b>21</b> was present) or Reed-Solomon coded supplemental data for generating the predefined sequence for the supplemental data at an input terminal of a Trellis coder (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The null sequence is inserted so that the VSB reception system receives the supplemental data reliably, even in a noisy channel or multipath fading channel. An example structure of the transmission data formed by the insertion of the null sequence will be explained below in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the VSB supplemental data processor <b>90</b> includes the MPEG header inserter <b>23</b> for adding an MPEG header to the supplemental data having the null sequence inserted thereto, for backward-compatibility with the legacy VSB reception system. Because the MPEG-II data supplied to the VSB transmission system <b>25</b> is 187 bytes long, the MPEG header inserter <b>23</b> places, preferably, three headers in front of each packet (which was 184 bytes) to form a 187 byte long packet identical to the MPEG-II data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The supplemental data having the MPEG header added thereto is provided to a multiplexer <b>24</b>. The multiplexer <b>24</b> receives as inputs the processed supplemental data from the MPEG header inserter <b>23</b> and MPEG data packets. MPEG data packet, such as a broadcasting program (movie, sports, entertainment, or drama), coded through a different signal path (output from MPEG encoder), is received together with the supplemental data at the multiplexer <b>24</b>. Upon reception of the MPEG data and the supplemental data, the multiplexer <b>24</b> multiplexes the supplemental data and the MPEG data at a fixed ratio under the control of a controller defining a multiplexing ratio and unit and forwards the multiplexed data to the 8T-VSB transmission system <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, which is described in detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, processes the multiplexed data and transmits the processed data to the VSB reception system through the antenna <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> uses a code having a block size N=184, a payload K=164, and an error correction capability T=10. On the other hand, as a generator polynomial of the Galois Field and the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b>, the same code as the Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used. According to the preferred embodiment, other values of the block size N, the payload K, and the error correction capability T may be used in the Reed-Solomon coder <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For an example, a code having N=184, K=154, and T=15 may be used, or a code having N=92, K=82, and T=5 may be used. Although the Reed-Solomon code is used in the present invention other code suitable for error correction known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used therein.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, one data field has 313 segments: 312 data segments <b>124</b> and one field synchronizing segment <b>122</b>. The 312 data segments have data segments of the supplemental data and the MPEG data segments. Each data segment has 184 byte data, a 3 byte MPEG header, and the 20 byte Reed-Solomon parity. The 3 byte MPEG header will be used by the MPEG decoder in the VSB reception system.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The use of the MPEG header is explained in more detail. ISO/IEC 13818-1 has a definition on an MPEG transport packet header. If a 0×47 synchronization byte is removed from the MPEG transport packet header, a 3 byte header is left. A PID (program identification) is defined by this 3 bytes. A transport part of the MPEG decoder discards a packet if the PID of the received packet received is not valid. For example, a null packet PID or other reserved PID can be used. Therefore, the MPEG header inserter <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> inserts the 3 byte header containing such a PID into the supplemental data packet. Therefore, the supplemental data can be discarded at the MPEG decoder of the legacy VSB receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The VSB reception system determines the multiplexing locations of the MPEG data and the supplemental data in the field data received synchronous to the field synchronizing signal. The VSB reception system demultiplexes the MPEG data and the supplemental data based on the multiplexing locations. A multiplexing ratio and method for multiplexing the MPEG data and the supplemental data may vary with amounts of data thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Information on the variable multiplexing method and ratio may be loaded, for example, on a reserved area of the 92 bits not used in the field synchronizing signal. By retrieving and decoding such information, the VSB reception system identifies the correct multiplexing ratio and method from the multiplexing information contained in the field synchronizing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Alternatively, the multiplexing information may be inserted, not only in the reserved area of the field synchronizing signal, but also in the data segment of the supplemental data. One of the supplement data segment may be used to transmit the multiplexing information for use by the VSB reception system.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a diagram for explaining the process for inserting a null sequence into the supplemental data at the null sequence inserter <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to generate the predefined sequence at the input of the trellis coder.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The VSB transmission system inserts the predefined sequence into the supplemental data before transmission for performance enhancement of the VSB reception system. The sequence has a series of ‘1’s and ‘0’s arranged in an order fixed in advance. The numbers of ‘1’ and ‘0’ are required to be the same in average. For example, the predefined sequence may be an output of a pseudo random sequence generator whose initial value is fixed in advance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, upon reception of one bit of supplemental data, the null sequence inserter <b>22</b> inserts one null bit therein, to provide 2 bits. The null bit is randomized in the 8T-VSB transmission system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and then subjected to Reed-Solomon coding. The coded supplemental data is interleaved, and applied to a Trellis coder (not shown) as an input d<b>0</b>. The input signal d<b>0</b> is a low order bit of the two bits applied to the Trellis coder.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of inserting the null sequence into the supplemental data by the null sequence inserter <b>22</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The supplemental data having the null sequence inserted therein is transmitted to the VSB reception system. The predefined sequence has 1's and 0's arranged in a fixed order. The predefined sequence inserted in the supplemental data can be used for performance improvement in the reception system.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, the channel equalizer of the VSB reception system uses the sequence to enhance ghost cancellation performance of both the supplemental data and the MPEG data and the Trellis decoder uses the sequence to improve noise performance of supplemental data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, upon reception of one supplemental data byte, the null sequence inserter <b>22</b> for generating the predefined sequence inserts null bits, to provide two bytes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The inserted null sequence is processed in the VSB transmission system <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and then transmitted to the VSB reception system. The null sequence is randomized by the data randomizer <b>1</b> of the VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, and coded by the Reed-Solomon coder <b>2</b>. Then, the null sequence is interleaved by the data interleaver <b>3</b>, and provided to the Trellis coder <b>4</b> as an input signal D<b>0</b>. This converted sequence is the predefined sequence. The input signal D<b>0</b> is a lower bit of the two input bits to the Trellis coder <b>4</b>. The Trellis coder is basically operative such that three bits are provided with two received bits.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The VSB reception system generates the sequence received as the input signal D<b>0</b> from the Trellis coder in the 8T-VSB transmission system <b>25</b>, i.e., the predefined sequence, and uses the generated sequence for improving the performance of the VSB reception system. Alternatively, other sequences known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used instead of the null sequence described above.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The VSB transmitter <b>95</b> of the present invention is required to have substantially identical probabilities of occurrence of the 8 levels, for having backward-compatibility with the related art VSB transmission system. Therefore, the presence of the 0's and 1's in the sequence received as the input signal D<b>0</b> at the Trellis coder are required to be almost the same.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a block diagram of the components of the trellis coder <b>4</b> used in the VSB transmission system <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates state transition diagrams of the Trellis coder shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The trellis coder <b>4</b> comprises a coder <b>28</b>, a precoder <b>27</b> and a modulator <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Trellis coder <b>78</b> and the precoder <b>27</b> receive two input bits D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> and provide three output bits C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b>. An 8T-VSB modulator <b>29</b> provides modulated values ‘z’ of the three output bits C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reference numerals <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b </i>denote adders, and <b>27</b><i>b</i>, <b>28</b><i>a</i>, and <b>28</b><i>c </i>denote registers.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the input bit D<b>1</b> is precoded into the output bit C<b>2</b> by the precoder <b>27</b>. The input bit D<b>0</b> is the same as the output bit C<b>1</b>. The output bit C<b>0</b> is a value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the Trellis coder <b>28</b>. Signal levels are determined by an output bitstream C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b> of the Trellis coder <b>28</b> and the precoder <b>77</b>, wherein there are 8 whole signal levels (−7, −5, −3, −1, +1, +3, +5, +7). The whole signal levels are divided into two groups of signal levels (−7, −3, +1, +5) (−5, −1, +3, +7) each with 4 levels according to the output bit C<b>0</b>. In other words, one out of the two groups of signal levels (−7, −3, +1, +5) (−5, −1, +3, +7) each with 4 levels are selected according to the value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, if the estimation of the present value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>in the coder <b>28</b> is possible, prediction of an output signal level of the coder <b>28</b> falling on one of the two signal level groups is possible. In other words, to estimate the present value of the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>in coder <b>28</b> means to predict one of the two signal level group in which the next output signal of the coder <b>28</b> will fall on. As a result, a four level slicer having two times the distance between each signal level can be used instead of a conventional 8 level slicer with reduced signal level separations.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In order to estimate the value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the coder <b>28</b>, the Viterbi algorithm is preferably used for the Trellis decoder <b>52</b> of the VSB reception system <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). If a wrong prediction is made on the signal level groups, the prediction error can be higher. Therefore, for minimizing the prediction error, the conventional 8T-VSB reception system <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) uses the four level slicer if the prediction reliability is high, and/or uses an original 8 slicer if the prediction reliability is low.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present invention improves the prediction reliability significantly by using the predefined sequence transmitted from the VSB transmission system. Preferably, both the slicer predictor and the Trellis decoder used in the VSB reception system use the Viterbi algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The Viterbi algorithm estimates one of state transitions (or paths) that has the highest probability with respect to time. As expressed in equation (1), the probability that a state value of the Trellis coder <b>28</b> is ‘Si’ at a time ‘k’ is proportional to a cumulative metric Mi of the state value Si.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in the state transition diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, since the input bit to the Trellis coder <b>28</b> has two bits, the number of branches connecting the states is four. Of the four paths connecting respective states S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b>, the Viterbi algorithm selects and stores a path having the least cumulative metric value. A part that carries out such a process is called an ACS (Accumulate/Compare/Select) module. By selecting a metric having the smallest value from the metrics selected and stored in the respective states S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b>, a state of the highest probability at the time ‘k’ can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the VSB transmitter <b>95</b> for digital TV broadcasting shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the null sequence is inserted in the supplemental data, and the predefined sequence is transmitted to the VSB reception system through the bit D<b>0</b> received at the Trellis coder. Preferably, the use of the predefined sequence at the VSB reception system may significantly improve performance of the Viterbi algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, the case when the bit of the predefined sequence transmitted from the transmission system at the time ‘k’ is ‘1’ will be discussed. In this case, it is impossible that the branches having D<b>1</b> and D<b>0</b> being 00 and 10 among the four branches connecting the states S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b> are selected to be the path of the highest probability.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The case when a bit D<b>1</b> of the predefined sequence is ‘0’ will be discussed. In this case, it is impossible that the branches having D<b>1</b> and D<b>0</b> being 01 and 11 among the four branches connecting the states S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b> are selected to be the pat of the highest probability. At the end, the use of the predefined sequence permits the ACS module to reduce the number of branches from four to two by using the Viterbi algorithm. As a result, the performance of the Trellis decoder and the reliability of the slider predictor in the reception system is significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the ATSC 8T-VSB reception system <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the channel equalizer <b>13</b> and the phase tracker <b>15</b> use a slicer and a slice and a slider predictor <b>14</b>, respectively.

The VSB reception system <b>300</b> filter includes a demultiplexer <b>56</b> for demultiplexing the data from the modified legacy VSB receiver <b>100</b> into the MPEG data (also known as data segment) and the supplemental data (also known as data segment), and a supplemental data processor <b>200</b> for processing the supplemental data segment from the demultiplexer <b>56</b> in reverse order of the transmission system, to obtain the original supplemental data.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the modified legacy VSB receiver <b>100</b> includes a demodulator <b>47</b>, a comb filter <b>48</b>, a channel equalizer <b>49</b>, a slicer predictor <b>50</b>, a phase tracker <b>51</b>, a Trellis decoder <b>52</b>, a first data deinterleaver <b>53</b>, a first Reed-Solomon decoder <b>54</b>, and a data de-randomizer <b>55</b>. The supplemental data processor <b>200</b> includes an MPEG header remover <b>57</b>, a null sequence remover <b>58</b>, a second data deinterleaver <b>59</b>, and a second Reed-Solomon decoder <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the preferred embodiment, the demodulator <b>47</b> converts a RF band signal into a base band signal, and the synchronizing and timing recovery system (not shown) recovers a segment synchronizing signal, a field synchronizing signal, and a symbol timing. The comb filter <b>48</b> removes an NTSC interference signal, if detected, and the channel equalizer <b>49</b> corrects a distorted channel by using the slicer predictor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The phase tracker <b>51</b> corrects a rotated phase, and the Trellis decoder <b>52</b> undertakes Viterbi decoding by using the generated sequence and the Viterbi algorithm. The channel equalizer <b>49</b>, the slicer predictor <b>50</b>, the phase tracker <b>51</b>, and the Trellis decoder <b>52</b> process the received symbols by using the sequence generated at the sequence generator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The first data deinterleaver <b>53</b> acts in reverse of the action of the data interleaver in the ATSC 8T VSB transmission system, and the first Reed-Solomon decoder <b>54</b> again decodes a signal Reed-Solomon coded at the ATSC 8T VSB transmission system. The data derandomizer <b>55</b> acts in reverse of the action of the data randomizer in the transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the sequence generator <b>46</b> indicates if the received symbol is the supplement data symbol or not, and generates a sequence identical to the predefined sequence that is inserted and transmitted in the supplemental data.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The slicer predictor <b>50</b> is the ACS part of the trellis decoder. In other words, the slicer predictor <b>50</b> is a trellis decoder with decoding depth <b>0</b>. The slicer predictor <b>50</b> estimates the state transistion sequence. After the ACS operation, the slicer predictor <b>50</b> estimates the maximum likely sequence and predicts one of the signal level groups on which the next symbol might fall.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the channel equalizer <b>49</b>, the slicer predictor <b>50</b>, the phase tracker <b>51</b>, and the Trellis decoder <b>52</b> improve signal processing performances by using the predefined sequence. This occurs when the components using the predefined sequence use the sequence information with the delayed sequence information, taking the delay in data processing at prior components into account.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the VSB reception system <b>300</b>, the demultiplexer <b>56</b> demultiplexes the data from the modified legacy VSB receiver <b>100</b> into a supplemental data segment and an MPEG data segment by using the multiplexing information detected from, for example, the field synchronizing signal. In the preferred embodiment the first Reed-Solomon decoder <b>54</b> makes no Reed-Solomon decoding of the supplemental data segment, but only removes the 20 byte parity bits added at the Reed-Solomon coder in the VSB transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the channel noise is excessive, many errors are present in the parity bytes of the Reed-Solomon code compared to the supplemental data because the parity bytes of the ATSC Reed-Solomon code has no predefined sequence inserted, resulting in no gain at the Trellis decoder <b>52</b>. The first Reed-Solomon decoder <b>54</b> makes no Reed-Solomon decoding of the supplemental data segment because it is highly possible that the first Reed-Solomon decoder <b>54</b> makes an erroneous correction in the case where the supplemental data segment has an error in excess of, for example, 10 bytes.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The supplemental data segment from the demultiplexer <b>56</b> is provided to the MPEG header remover <b>57</b>. The MPEG header remover <b>57</b> removes 3 bytes of MPEG header from the supplemental data segment. The MPEG header is inserted when the supplemental data is transmitted in an ATSC format at the VSB transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The null sequence remover <b>58</b> then removes the null sequence inserted in the supplemental data segment at the null sequence inserter in the VSB transmission system. The second data deinterleaver <b>59</b> acts in reverse of the interleaving process on the supplemental data segment in the VSB transmission system. If the interleaving process is omitted in the VSB transmission system, the VSB reception system <b>300</b> may disable the second deinterleaver <b>59</b> or not include it at all. The second Reed-Solomon decoder <b>60</b> decodes the Reed-Solomon code of the supplemental data segment.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The phase tracker <b>15</b> of the related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) also selectively uses the slicers therein in response to the slicer predictor. The phase tracker <b>51</b> of the VSB reception system <b>300</b> of the present invention is different from the related art VSB reception system in that the predefined sequence is used in the prediction and selection of the slicer. The phase tracker uses slicers to correct the phase error, so it also uses the slicer with the aid of slicer prediction from trellis decoder. The selective use of slicer of the phase tracker is the same with that of the equalizer.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Since the predefined sequence is inserted in the supplemental data symbol only, the VSB reception system <b>300</b> is required to identify the supplemental data symbol, and to determine whether the predefined sequence from the transmission system is ‘0’ or ‘1’.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">There are two methods for identifying information on the supplemental data symbol and the predefined sequence at the VSB reception system <b>300</b>. In the first method, symbols of one field of one ATSC data frame are stored in advance in ROM Read Only Memory). Since the data derandomizer of the ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system is initially synchronized to the field synchronizing signal, the cycles of the predefined sequence is also in field units. However, the first method requires a large memory because the predefined sequence is required to be stored in field units according to a multiplexing method in the transmission system. In the second method, the VSB reception system has a transmitter for generating the predefined sequence as its own.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a block diagram of the sequence generator <b>46</b> in the reception system of the present invention according to the second method. The sequence generator <b>46</b> includes a multiplexer <b>61</b>, a modified randomizer <b>62</b>, a dummy parity inserter <b>63</b>, a data interleaver <b>64</b>, and a Trellis coder <b>65</b>. The multiplexer <b>61</b> has a supplemental data dummy packet and an MPEG data dummy packet provided thereto. The MPEG data dummy packet produces 187 dummy bytes of 0×00. The supplemental data dummy packet produces three dummy bytes of 0×00 for the MPEG header bytes, and 184 dummy bytes of 0×AA for the supplemental data. Those dummy bytes are multiplexed at the multiplexer <b>61</b> and randomized at the modified randomizer <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The modified randomizer <b>62</b> randomizes the output of the multiplexer <b>61</b> by subjecting the intentionally produced pseudo random bytes and 0×55, for example, to bit-wise AND operation, and a resultant of the AND logical operation and input bits from the multiplexer <b>61</b> to bit-wise exclusive OR operation. Then the dummy parity inserter <b>63</b> inserts the dummy bytes 0×00 of the 20 parities added by the Reed-Solomon coder of the ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system to the randomized data. The output of the dummy parity inserter <b>63</b> is interleaved at the data interleaver <b>64</b>. The trellis coder <b>65</b> converts the interleaved dummy bytes into symbols and each byte produces four symbols. A detail of the Trellis coder <b>65</b> is show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The symbols are provided to the 12 Trellis coder and precoders <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>32</b>-<b>12</b>. The symbols are preferably not subjected to precoding and Trellis coding, but forwarded as provided. Each of the symbols finally forwarded thus has two bits D<b>1</b> D<b>0</b>. In this instance, if the bit D<b>1</b> is ‘1’, the symbol is the supplemental data symbol and if the bit d<b>1</b> is ‘0’, the bit D<b>0</b> is the MPEG data symbol. If the bit D<b>1</b> is ‘1’, the bit D<b>0</b> is the predefined sequence that is provided to the Trellis coder of the transmission system. The sequence generator <b>46</b> is operative synchronous to the field synchronizing signal recovered at the reception system.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates signal level diagrams of three kinds of slicers used for MPEG data symbols used in the channel equalizer <b>49</b>. Each slicer shows signal levels. Each slicer determines a signal that has the shortest distance to a signal received from the transmission system. If the prediction reliability of the slicer prediction is low, the slicer <b>1</b> having 8 levels is used. If the prediction reliability of the slicer is high, either the slicer <b>2</b> or the slicer <b>3</b> is selected according to a estimation of the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>in the coder <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. If a value the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>estimated is ‘0’, the slicer <b>2</b> is selected and if the estimated value is ‘1’, the slicer <b>3</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates signal level diagrams of six kinds of slicers used for supplemental data symbols. If the symbols are symbols of the supplemental data, the six slicers can be used by using the bit D<b>1</b> of the predefined sequence. When the sequence bit D<b>0</b> is ‘0’, a signal level group transmitted from the VSB transmission system is (−7, −5, +1, +3). When the sequence bit D<b>0</b> is ‘1’, a signal level group transmitted from the VSB transmission system is (−3, −1, +5, +7). When the reliability of the slicer predictor is poor, either the slicer <b>4</b> or the slicer <b>5</b> is selected, depending on the value of the sequence bit D<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A case when the slicer predictor has a high reliability will be discussed. When the sequence bit D<b>0</b> is ‘0’, the slicer <b>4</b> may be divided into two slicers of <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, according to a value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the Trellis coder <b>28</b>. If the value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>is ‘0’, the slicer <b>6</b> is selected, and if value stored is ‘1’, the slicer <b>7</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If the sequence bit D<b>0</b> is ‘1’, the slicer <b>5</b> is divided into two slicers of slicer <b>8</b> and slicer <b>9</b>, according to a value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the Trellis coder <b>28</b>. Therefore, if the value stored ill the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>is ‘0’, the slicer <b>8</b> is selected, and if the value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>is ‘1’, the slicer <b>9</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As discussed, the slicers <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> may be compared to the related art slicers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> to find that a signal distance of the slicers <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> is greater by two times than the related art slicers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. Therefore, in the case of the supplemental data symbol, slicers each having a greater slicer distance can be used with the use of a predefined sequence, resulting in a consequential reduction of decision error.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a channel equalizer <b>49</b> of the VSB reception system <b>300</b> of the present invention using the predefined sequence. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the channel equalizer includes a feed-forward filter <b>66</b>, a feedback filter <b>67</b>, an adder <b>68</b> for adding outputs of the filters <b>66</b> and <b>67</b>, nine slicers <b>69</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>69</b>-<b>9</b>, a multiplexer <b>70</b>, and a controller <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to the preferred embodiment, an input signal to the channel equalizer <b>49</b> is provided to the feed-forward filter <b>66</b>, and an output signal of the feed-forward filter <b>66</b> and an output signal of the feedback filter <b>67</b> are added at the adder <b>68</b>. An output signal of the adder <b>68</b> is an output signal of the channel equalizer <b>49</b>. The output signal of the channel equalizer <b>68</b> is provided to the nine slicers <b>69</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>69</b>-<b>9</b> in common, for the slicers <b>69</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>69</b>-<b>9</b> to decide the signal level.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The controller <b>71</b> controls the multiplexer <b>70</b> such that the multiplexer <b>70</b> selects one of the outputs of the slicers <b>69</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>69</b>-<b>9</b> and provides to the feedback filter <b>67</b>, and the controller <b>71</b>. The controller <b>71</b> updates filter coefficients of the feed-forward filter <b>66</b> and the feedback filter <b>67</b> by using the selected slicer output and file output of the channel equalizer <b>49</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the slicer predictor <b>50</b> receives the output signal of the channel equalizer <b>49</b> and the output signal of the sequence generator <b>46</b>, and predicts a value stored in the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the Trellis coder <b>28</b> in the VSB transmission system by using the received signals. The slicer predictor <b>50</b> then calculates the reliability of the predicted value, and forwards the values to the controller <b>71</b> of the channel equalizer <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The controller <b>71</b> of the channel equalizer <b>49</b> receives information on the symbol received as being the supplemental data or the MPEG data, and the predefined sequence D<b>0</b> inserted in the supplemental data symbol from the sequence generator <b>46</b>. The controller <b>71</b> receives the estimated value of the register <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the Trellis coder <b>28</b> in the transmission system together with the prediction reliability from the slicer predictor <b>50</b>, and, selects one of the outputs of the nine slicers <b>69</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>69</b>-<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As described above, the VSB reception system <b>300</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention has the following advantages. First, the VSB reception system has components for processing both the MPEG data and the supplemental data.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Second, the sequence generator <b>46</b> provided in the VSB reception system <b>300</b> (for generating a predefined sequence as an input signal to a Trellis coder of a transmission system) can improve reception performance of the reception system with respect to a channel ghost signal and a noise signal over the related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system. Particularly, performances of the slicer predictor and the Trellis coder in the reception system are significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Third, by using the predefined sequence, the VSB reception system <b>300</b> can use slicers each having a greater signal distance than the conventional slicers at the channel equalizer and the phase tracker therein, which minimizes decision error. This enhances the tracker deghosting performance of the equalizer and the phase tracking performance of the phase tracker.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the VSB communication system, and the signal format for the VSB communication system of the present invention without depositing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
