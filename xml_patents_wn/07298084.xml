<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and displays utilize row and column drivers with ZnO channels that control pixel transistors with ZnO channels, which in turn address OLEDs of an array to produce images of a display screen. A display backplane including the ZnO row and column drivers and the OLEDs may be constructed by utilizing aperture masking or a combination of photolithography and aperture masking. Monolithic integration of the ZnO row and column drivers together with the ZnO pixel transistors is thereby achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Display backplanes are an important component in a display device, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, or other display technology. Display backplanes include a substrate providing a platform upon which circuitry is created to cause a display screen to display images. Typically, the backplane includes an array of pixel transistors that provide an electrical signal to an array of pixel elements, such as OLED cells, to cause the picture elements or pixels to produce light that results in the image to be viewed. Additional circuitry includes row and column drivers and is typically located separately from the backplane. The row and column drivers decode the incoming video data to individually activate the pixel transistors and thereby individually control the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Because the pixel transistors in the typical case are located on the backplane itself, the pixel transistors are formed as thin film transistors (TFFs) and thereby allow for a very thin display screen such as for thin screen computer and television monitors, telephones, and other compact devices. Because the row and column drivers in the typical case are not located on the backplane, they are not necessarily TF Is. However, the row and column drivers occupy separate space, such as on an integrated circuit chip installed on a display circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The interconnections between the row and column drivers and the backplane array can be complex. As the number of rows and columns increase, the interconnect density increases. Even when the row and column drivers are silicon chips bonded to the glass, the level of interconnect complexity can become prohibitive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is desirable in some display screen applications to eliminate or dedicate for other purposes the space required for the row and column driver chip and/or to bring the row and column drivers into closer proximity with the pixel transistors. Therefore, it is desirable to move the row and column drivers directly onto the backplane along with the pixel transistors. However, the row and column drivers must have very fast switching capabilities whereby conventional TFT construction utilizing low mobility semiconductor channels such as amorphous silicon becomes problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is advantageous, particularly for an OLED based display, to have TFTs including a semiconductor with as large an electron mobility as possible. In general, the electron mobility directly affects transistor speed and/or transistor size. Semiconductors like amorphous silicon have field effect mobilities on the order of 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup>/V-sec. Materials such as polysilicon have higher mobilities (greater than 20 cm<sup>2</sup>/V-sec) but require higher processing temperatures and more complex fabrication procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present invention address these issues and others by providing displays and methods that utilize row and column drivers and pixel transistors that are monolithically integrated (i.e., patterned concurrently and by substantially the same process) onto a display substrate while also employing OLEDs as the front-plane elements. The row and column drivers as well as the pixel transistors are constructed as TFTs that have zinc oxide (ZnO) channels, which have a sufficiently high mobility to achieve the switching speeds necessary to properly decode the display signals and activate the OLED pixels. The ZnO row and column drivers address the ZnO pixel transistors that activate the OLEDs of an array to form images on the display screen. The TFTs may be patterned through a process involving aperture masks such as repositionable polymeric aperture masks. Alternatively, the TFFs may be patterned through photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment is a display that includes a backplane substrate. A set of thin film transistor row and column drivers that contains ZnO channels is patterned on the backplane substrate. Additionally, a set of pixel thin film transistors that contain ZnO channels is monolithically integrated with the set of thin film transistor row and column drivers on the backplane substrate. A set of organic light-emitting diodes is patterned on the backplane substrate. Each organic light-emitting diode, which includes a stack of layers, is activated to produce light by a corresponding one or more pixel thin film transistors of the set, and the corresponding one or more pixel thin film transistors are addressed by the set of thin film transistor row and column drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment is a method of creating a display. The method involves patterning a set of ZnO channel thin film transistor row and column drivers on a backplane substrate. The method further involves patterning a set of ZnO channel pixel thin film transistors on the backplane substrate such that the pixel thin film transistors are in electrical connection with the thin film row and column drivers. The method also involves patterning a set of organic light emitting diodes in electrical connection with the pixel thin film transistors. Each organic light emitting diode includes a stack of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another embodiment is a method of creating a video display backplane. This method involves utilizing polymeric aperture masking to define ZnO channel row and column drivers and ZnO channel pixel thin film transistors on a backplane substrate. This method further involves utilizing polymeric aperture masking to define organic light-emitting diodes on the backplane substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present invention provide display backplanes having the combination of ZnO row and column drivers integrated onto the same substrate as ZnO pixel transistors and OLEDs. These embodiments provide the superior viewing characteristics of OLEDs with the compactness of integrated row and column drivers. Furthermore, certain embodiments provide for the construction of the backplane utilizing polymeric aperture masking to pattern the ZnO row and column drivers, the ZnO pixel transistors, and the OLEDs. Certain of these embodiments provide for the efficient use of a polymeric aperture masking process resulting in a high yield for the backplane construction while benefiting from the superiority of OLEDs with a reduced likelihood of OLED damage during manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various techniques known in the art may be utilized to pattern the transistors. For example, in some embodiments, photolithography may be utilized to pattern the TFTs followed by utilizing an aperture mask to pattern OLED layers. In other embodiments, wet chemical processing may be avoided altogether as aperture masks may be utilized to pattern the OLED stack as well as the TFTs used as the row and column drivers and the pixel TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As noted, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the transistors can be prepared using an aperture mask, such as a shadow mask. Illustrative procedures utilizing aperture masks are set forth in U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 2003/0152691 and US2003/0150384, incorporated herein by reference. To further illustrate the aperture masking process, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified block diagram of a deposition station that can use an aperture mask for patterning the OLED stack as well as the TFT row and column drivers and pixel TFTs. In particular, deposition station <b>10</b> can be constructed to perform a vapor deposition process in which material is vaporized and deposited on a deposition substrate through an aperture mask. The deposited material may be any material necessary for the OLED layers or TFT layers including semiconductor material, dielectric material, or conductive material used to form a variety of elements. For example, organic or inorganic materials may be deposited. In some cases, both organic and inorganic materials can be deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An aperture mask <b>20</b>, formed with aperture mask patterns passes through deposition station <b>10</b> such that the aperture mask can be placed in proximity with a display backplane substrate <b>12</b>. Backplane substrate <b>12</b> may comprise any of a variety of materials depending on the desired display circuit to be created. For example, backplane substrate <b>12</b> may comprise a flexible material or alternatively a rigid material. Any backplane substrates such as glass substrates, silicon substrates, rigid plastic substrates, metal foils coated with an insulating layer, or the like, could also be used. In any case, the backplane substrate <b>12</b> may or may not include previously formed features, such as where the TFTs are first patterned onto the backplane substrate <b>12</b> using photolithography and at least one layer of the OLEDs are subsequently patterned using the aperture mask. In some examples, all layers of the OLEDs are patterned using the aperture mask.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Deposition station <b>10</b> is typically a vacuum chamber. After a pattern in aperture mask <b>20</b> is secured in proximity to backplane substrate <b>12</b>, material <b>16</b> is vaporized by deposition unit <b>14</b>. For example, deposition unit <b>14</b> may include a boat of material that is heated to vaporize the material. The vaporized material <b>16</b> deposits on backplane substrate <b>12</b> through the deposition apertures of aperture mask <b>20</b> to define at least a portion of a circuit layer on backplane substrate <b>12</b>. Upon deposition, material <b>16</b> forms a deposition pattern defined by the pattern in aperture mask <b>20</b>. Aperture mask <b>20</b> may include apertures and gaps that are sufficiently small to facilitate the creation of small circuit elements using the deposition process as described above. Additionally, the pattern of deposition apertures in aperture mask <b>20</b> may have a large dimension as mentioned above. Other suitable deposition techniques include e-beam evaporation, various forms of sputtering, and pulsed laser deposition. Example 1, referenced below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, includes details for one illustrative method of patterning the TFTs and OLEDs by utilizing aperture masks.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, utilizing an aperture mask as discussed above is one manner for depositing the TFTs making up the row and column drivers and the pixel TFTs of the display backplane. Furthermore, an aperture mask as discussed above is also one manner for patterning one or more of the layers of the OLEDs that are also present on the substrate adjacent to the pixel TFT. A cross-section of the OLED deposited adjacent the pixel TFT for activating the OLED is shown in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In some devices, all layers of the OLED stack are patterned using an aperture mask.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It can be beneficial to utilize a polymeric aperture mask, constructed from materials such as polyimide. Advantages of using polymeric aperture masks for patterning the OLED stack include potentially less damage to the OLED material by the aperture mask and the ability to stretch the aperture mask to mitigate dimensional changes in the mask due to various causes such as thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an alternative to aperture mask procedures, the ZnO based TFT circuitry may be produced by photolithography while the OLEDs are separately deposited via an aperture mask procedure discussed above. Well-known photolithography techniques may be utilized for defining the ZnO pixel circuitry. Examples of such photolithography techniques are disclosed in Badih El-Kareh, Fundamentals of Semiconductor Processing Technologies, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Chapter 4, pages 590-592, Boston, (1995). Additionally, Example 2, referenced below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, includes details for an illustrative process of applying photolithography to first pattern the TFTs followed by application of a shadow mask to pattern the OLED stack. Accordingly, the aperture mask process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided for purposes of illustration and is not intended to be limiting as to the manner for patterning the TFTs of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the deposition of the pixel TFT and OLED atop a common substrate <b>42</b>. In this example, the OLED is top emitting (i.e., emits away from rather than through the substrate). As noted above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate <b>42</b> may be constructed of various materials such as glass and other rigid materials or may be made flexible through the use of materials such as metal foil, and plastic (e.g, polyimide, PEN). A gate electrode <b>44</b>, constructed of materials such as titanium and gold, is directly patterned onto the substrate <b>42</b> and then a gate dielectric <b>46</b> such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is patterned atop the gate electrode <b>44</b> to entirely isolate the gate electrode <b>44</b> from the semiconductor channel <b>48</b>. The semiconductor channel <b>48</b> is a layer of ZnO that is patterned atop the gate dielectric <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A drain electrode <b>52</b>, constructed of materials such as aluminum, is patterned on one side of the channel <b>48</b> while a separate source electrode <b>50</b> is patterned on the other side of the channel <b>48</b> and may be constructed of the same material as the drain electrode <b>52</b>. The source electrode <b>50</b> extends onto the substrate <b>42</b> and is positioned between the substrate <b>42</b> and the OLED stack <b>56</b>. An encapsulant layer <b>54</b>, constructed of materials such as a photoimageable epoxy or other material such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, is patterned over the layers of the TFT including the source/drain electrodes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and the channel <b>48</b> while leaving a void above the area of the source electrode <b>50</b> where the OLED stack <b>56</b> is patterned. It should be noted that the use of the terms source and drain are somewhat arbitrary as it will be appreciated that the electrode contacting the OLED stack <b>56</b> may be either the source or the drain, depending upon the circuit design that is chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typically, the source electrode and drain electrode features are patterned such that a channel length of about 1 micrometer to about 50 micrometers (preferably about 5 micrometers to about 20 micrometers) separates them. For photolithographically patterned TFTs, the gate length may be as small as 1 micrometer, with 5 micrometers being typical. For aperture mask patterned TFTs, the gate length is more likely to be 5 to 60 micrometers with a typical gate length of 20 to 30 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The steps of one illustrative process for patterning the layers of the TFTs, including the pixel TFT of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, are set forth in detail in Example 1 where the TFTs are patterned by use of an aperture mask. Likewise, the steps of another illustrative process for patterning the layers of the TFTs including the pixel TFT of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are set forth in detail in Example 2 where the TFTs are patterned by photolithography. In either case, the TFTs may be patterned at the substantially same time and through substantially the same process such that the TFT row and column drivers and the pixel TFTs are monolithically integrated onto the display substrate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The OLED stack <b>56</b> is constructed of a stack of organic materials. These materials and their particular order within the stack <b>56</b> for one illustrative example are set forth in Examples 1 and 2. To complete a path for current through the OLED stack <b>56</b>, a top electrode <b>55</b> is patterned over the top of the OLED stack <b>56</b>. This top electrode <b>55</b> is constructed of a transparent material such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or a thin metal layer so that the light may be emitted through the electrode <b>55</b>. Upon receiving electrical current, the materials of the OLED stack <b>56</b> begin to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, voltage is applied to the drain electrode <b>52</b>. However, very little current is passed to the source electrode <b>50</b> unless voltage is also applied to the gate electrode <b>44</b> as the channel <b>48</b> remains in a non-conductive state. Upon application of voltage to the gate electrode <b>44</b>, the channel <b>48</b> becomes conductive and current flows through the channel to the source electrode <b>50</b> and through the OLED stack <b>56</b>, thereby causing the OLED to emit light <b>58</b> away from the substrate <b>42</b>. Accordingly, an array of OLEDs addressed in this manner results in an image being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the deposition of the pixel TFT and OLED atop a common transparent substrate <b>62</b>, constructed of materials such as glass or a transparent plastic where the OLED is bottom emitting (i.e., emits light through the substrate). A gate electrode <b>64</b> is directly patterned onto the substrate <b>62</b> and then a gate dielectric <b>66</b> is patterned atop the gate electrode <b>64</b> to entirely isolate the gate electrode <b>64</b> from the semiconductor channel <b>68</b>. The semiconductor channel <b>68</b> again is a layer of ZnO that is patterned atop the gate dielectric <b>66</b>. A drain electrode <b>72</b> is patterned on one side of the channel <b>68</b> while a separate source electrode <b>70</b> is patterned on the other side of the channel <b>68</b>. The source electrode <b>70</b> makes contact with a transparent OLED electrode <b>77</b>, such as an ITO electrode, so that the OLED may emit light through the electrode <b>77</b> and substrate <b>62</b>. An encapsulant layer <b>74</b>, again constructed of materials such as a photoimageable epoxy or other material such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, is patterned over the layers of the TFT including the source/drain electrodes <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and the channel <b>68</b> while leaving a void above the area of the transparent electrode <b>77</b> where the OLED stack <b>76</b> is patterned. A top electrode <b>75</b> is deposited atop the OLED stack <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, voltage is applied to drain electrode <b>72</b>. However, little current is passed to the source electrode <b>70</b> unless voltage is also applied to the gate electrode <b>64</b> as the channel <b>68</b> remains in a non-conductive state. Upon application of voltage to the gate electrode <b>64</b>, the channel <b>68</b> becomes conductive and current flows through the channel to the source electrode <b>70</b> and through the OLED stack <b>76</b>, thereby causing the OLED to emit light <b>78</b> through the electrode <b>77</b> and substrate <b>62</b>. A matrix of OLEDs addressed in this manner results in an image being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While not specifically discussed above, it will be appreciated that the OLED may be protected from exposure to ambient elements by including an encapsulant that encloses the OLED stack of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The encapsulants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> then further encapsulate the TFTs and the OLED stack.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustrative example of circuitry <b>80</b> of a single light-emitting cell where two ZnO pixel TFTs are used. A first voltage source <b>82</b> provides enable pulses on a periodic basis to gate a ZnO pixel TFT <b>86</b>. ZnO pixel TFT <b>86</b>, once switched on, charges capacitor <b>88</b> and the gate of ZnO pixel TFT <b>90</b> based on the data pulse from a second voltage source <b>84</b>. Charging the gate of ZnO pixel TFT <b>90</b> switches ZnO pixel TFT <b>90</b> to a conductive state, thereby allowing current to flow through the OLED <b>92</b> from a supply voltage <b>94</b> which produces light for forming an image. The first voltage source <b>82</b> that is providing enable pulses represents the output from row driver circuitry discussed below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, while the second voltage source <b>84</b> that is providing data pulses represents the output from column driver circuitry also discussed below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary circuit diagram of an array of light-emitting cells based on the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Four cells are shown for purposes of illustration, and there are two ZnO pixel TFTs per cell in this example. One ZnO pixel TFT of each cell is driven by an enable pulse from output <b>95</b>, <b>98</b> of ZnO TFT based row driver circuitry while each OLED of each cell is further driven by a data pulse from output <b>97</b>, <b>99</b> of ZnO TFT based column driver circuitry to provide power to each OLED from the voltage source <b>96</b>. Accordingly, the arrays of OLEDs produce images as a result of the decoding by the row and column driver outputs activating the individual OLEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary circuit diagram that illustrates one alternative light-emitting cell design that is based on ZnO pixel TFTs and that mitigates variation in ZnO TFT parameter variation that might otherwise compromise OLED performance. The generalized circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, excluding the ZnO aspects of the transistors, are known in the art. Specifically, a circuit layout like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is shown and described by Yi He et al, EEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 21(12), 590-592 (2000).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, ZnO transistors <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are switched on with a signal from voltage source <b>102</b>. Current source <b>104</b> provides the data during this time and forces ZnO transistor <b>114</b> to pass the current from current source <b>104</b>, while charging storage capacitor <b>110</b> to the voltage level necessary to drive ZnO transistor <b>114</b> at the desired current level. During this time current will not flow through ZnO transistor <b>112</b> if power source <b>118</b> is at a lower voltage than the drain electrode of ZnO transistor <b>114</b>. This process accommodates transistor threshold voltage shifts that may occur over time. Current through ZnO pixel transistor <b>114</b> then activates OLED <b>116</b> to emit light. When the select signal from power source <b>102</b> is turned off, ZnO transistors <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are turned off, but current now sourced by voltage source <b>118</b> continues to flow though ZnO transistor <b>114</b> and OLED <b>116</b> as long as storage capacitor <b>110</b> remains charged. The cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may also be extended to produce an array of cells similar that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exemplary circuit diagram that illustrates ZnO TFT based digital logic gates that may be used as the building blocks of row and column driver circuitry which produces the enable and data pulses discussed above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. The particular logic gate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example of a “NOT OR” (NOR) gate <b>120</b>. However, it will be appreciated that other logic gate designs formed of ZnO TFTs may be utilized as the building blocks of the row and column driver circuitry, such as OR, AND, “EXCLUSIVE OR” (XOR) logic gates. In this example, a first ZnO TFT <b>124</b> receives power from a voltage source <b>122</b>. TFT <b>124</b> remains in a conductive state and an output <b>125</b> is taken from the source of the TFT <b>124</b>. However, the output <b>125</b> is also connected to the drain of ZnO TFT <b>126</b> and ZnO TFT <b>130</b>. If a logic high is provided at either gate <b>128</b> of TFT <b>126</b> or gate <b>132</b> of TFT <b>130</b>, then the output <b>125</b> is pulled to a logic low.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments of the present invention, these logic gates <b>120</b> are formed by the ZnO based TFTs <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> being patterned on the backplane substrate in the electrical configurations shown along with the ZnO based pixel TFTs and OLEDs. The ZnO TFTs of the logic gates may be monolithically integrated with the ZnO based pixel TFTs on the backplane substrate of a display, either by the aforementioned processes of aperture mask based patterning or photolithography based patterning. The patterning of electrical connections of the ZnO based logic gates forming the row and column driver circuitry will become apparent with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a standard flip-flop <b>134</b>, but this flip-flop is formed by a set of interconnected NOR gates <b>120</b> that are formed of ZnO based TFTs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that are monolithically integrated with the ZnO pixel TFTs on the backplane substrate of the display. A clock input <b>136</b> is provided as is a data input <b>138</b>. The flip-flop <b>134</b> provides an output <b>140</b> and an inverted output <b>142</b>. It will be appreciated that other logic devices besides flip-flops may be utilized when constructing row and column driver circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a standard shift register <b>144</b>, but this shift register is formed of cascaded flip-flops <b>134</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which are constructed from the logic gates including the ZnO based TFTs patterned on the backplane substrate. The clock <b>136</b> and data signals <b>138</b> are provided serially from the video data bus of the device producing the display data. In this example, the shift register <b>144</b> receives the data bits for the columns of the array of pixels serially but must de-multiplex the serial data by converting the serial data into parallel data. Parallel data allows each pixel to receive its controlling bit or bits simultaneously, as opposed to sequentially. The clock signal <b>136</b> propagates the bits down the cascaded flip-flops until the data bit is being provided from the output <b>140</b> that corresponds to the proper column of the display. In the simple example shown, the first data bit in is intended for the fourth column so the first data bit has reached its destination column by the fourth clock pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the propagation, a row driver circuit, which may also be a logic device such as a set of shift registers, maintains a logic low output for each row line until the data bits are located at the appropriate column output <b>140</b> of the column shift register <b>144</b>. This timing is based on the number of clock pulses since the last logic high output of the row driver circuit. This prevents the gating transistor, such as transistor <b>86</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, from passing the incorrect bit to the gate of the pixel transistor directly connected to the OLED. Once the bits are properly aligned with the respective columns, the row driver circuit provides a logic high output to allow the ZnO pixel TFTs gating each output <b>140</b> to become conductive. In doing so, the bit for each column is passed to the gate of the ZnO pixel TFT directly connected to the OLED thereby causing the OLED to either emit light or not, depending upon the value of the bit.</p>
