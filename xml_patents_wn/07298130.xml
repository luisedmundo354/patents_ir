<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example in which the present invention is applied to a serial bus interface LSI <b>1</b> according to the IEEE1394.b standard. Differential input terminals RD, NRD of LSI <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are connected to a twisted pair cable through capacitors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> for removing DC components, respectively. Two terminal resistors <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are connected in series with each other between the differential input terminals RD, NRD. An intermediate tap voltage of the terminal resistors <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> is called a common mode voltage Vcm.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The LSI <b>1</b> first receives an input signal (low speed signal) having an intermittent clock waveform of 50 MHz for speed negotiation at the differential input terminals RD, NRD. After a data transfer rate is determined, an input signal (high speed signal) having a random data waveform of, e.g., 500 MHz is applied to the differential input terminals RD, NRD. The 500-MHz input signal is processed by a receiver <b>10</b>, a clock recovery unit (CRU) <b>11</b>, a serial-parallel (S-P) converter <b>12</b> and a 10-bit-8-bit (10B-8B) encoder <b>13</b>. The receiver <b>10</b> amplifies the input signal without offset and supplies an output S<b>10</b> indicating the amplification result to the CRU <b>11</b>. Note that illustration of a transmitter in the LSI <b>1</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The LSI <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further includes a signal detector <b>15</b> capable of covering such a wide input frequency range. The illustrated signal detector <b>15</b> includes an offset receiver <b>20</b>, a charge pump <b>21</b>, a capacitor <b>22</b> and a hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> in order to detect whether a low speed signal having a amplitude greater than a preset value is received or not. The offset receiver <b>20</b> amplifies a signal received through the differential input terminals RD, NRD and produces an output S<b>20</b>. The output S<b>20</b> changes between H level and L level according to this input signal only when the input signal has an amplitude greater than a prescribed offset (e.g., 50 mV). When the amplitude of the input signal is not greater than 50 mV, the output S<b>20</b> is retained at L level. The charge pump <b>21</b> converts the output S<b>20</b> of the offset receiver <b>20</b> into a current. The capacitor <b>22</b>, which is inserted between an output S<b>21</b> of the charge pump <b>21</b> and a ground voltage VSS, converts the output current of the charge pump <b>21</b> into a voltage. Accordingly, a terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> fluctuates according to the level (H level, L level) of the output S<b>20</b>. A charging current of the capacitor <b>22</b> is preset to a value larger than a discharging current thereof so that the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> gradually rises when the H level period of the output S<b>20</b> has the same length as that of the L level period thereof The hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> is a comparator having hysteresis in input/output characteristics in order to prevent malfunction. The hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> compares the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> with a first reference voltage (⅓)×VDD and a second reference voltage (⅔)×VDD, and supplies the comparison result as an output S<b>23</b>. The first and second reference voltages are voltages that vary according to variation in power supply voltage VDD. The output S<b>23</b> is set to H level when the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> exceeds (⅔)×VDD. The output S<b>23</b> is set to L level when the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> is less than (⅓)×VDD. The output S<b>23</b> of the hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> is connected to one input of an OR circuit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The signal detector <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further includes a transition counter <b>30</b>, a delay circuit <b>31</b> and an AND circuit <b>32</b> in addition to the receiver <b>10</b> in order to detect whether a high speed signal is received or not. The transition counter <b>30</b> checks if the number of transitions of the output S<b>10</b> of the receiver <b>10</b> exceeds a prescribed value within a fixed period. More specifically, according to a clock signal CLK having a frequency corresponding to the determined data transfer rate, the transition counter <b>30</b> asserts its output S<b>30</b> to H level when the number of transitions of the output S<b>10</b> reaches thirty-two or more within <b>512</b> cycles of the clock signal CLK. The delay circuit <b>31</b> delays the output S<b>30</b> for output as a signal S<b>31</b>. The AND circuit <b>32</b> supplies the AND operation result of the outputs S<b>30</b>, S<b>31</b> as an output S<b>32</b>. Accordingly, the output S<b>32</b> is behind the output S<b>32</b> only for the timing of the rise. The output S<b>32</b> of the AND circuit <b>32</b> is connected to the other input of the OR circuit <b>24</b>. The OR circuit <b>24</b> supplies a signal indicating the OR operation result of the outputs S<b>23</b>, S<b>32</b> as a signal detection output SD.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Even when the circuit formed by the offset receiver <b>20</b>, charge pump <b>21</b>, capacitor <b>22</b> and hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> cannot follow a high speed signal, the offset-less receiver <b>10</b> and the transition counter <b>30</b> can follow this signal. Note that, when the offset receiver <b>20</b> has a structure capable of following a high speed signal, the output S<b>20</b> of the offset receiver <b>20</b> may be supplied to the transition counter <b>30</b> instead of the output S<b>10</b> of the offset-less receiver <b>10</b>, as shown by dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this case, even if the output S<b>10</b> of the receiver <b>10</b> is uncertain, signal detection can be implemented without any influence thereof <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of the specific structure of the offset receiver <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The offset receiver <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes an input amplifier section <b>40</b>, an offset section <b>50</b>, an output load resistor section <b>60</b>, an output amplifier section <b>65</b>, and differential signal lines S<b>40</b>, NS<b>40</b> connecting these components to each other. The input amplifier section <b>40</b> includes MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistors <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> and current sources <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> in order to amplify a signal received through the differential input terminals RD, NRD and output the amplified signal to the differential signal lines S<b>40</b>, NS<b>40</b>. The offset section <b>50</b> includes a MOS transistor <b>51</b> receiving a gate voltage Vcm+25 mV, a MOS transistor <b>52</b> receiving a gate voltage Vcm−25 mV, and a current source <b>53</b> in order to implement an offset of, e.g., 50 mV. The output load resistor section <b>60</b> includes MOS transistors <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> receiving a common bias voltage Vb at their gates, and resistors <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>. When the input amplitude of the input amplifier section <b>40</b> is greater than 50 mV, the input amplifier section <b>40</b> predominantly operates as compared to the offset section <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the output S<b>20</b> changes between H level and L level according to the signal received through the differential input terminals RD, NRD. However, when the amplitude of the input signal is not greater than 50 mV, the offset section <b>50</b> predominantly operates as compared to the input amplifier section <b>40</b>. Therefore, the offset section <b>50</b> forcibly sets the output S<b>20</b> to L level.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of the specific structure of the charge pump <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The charge pump <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes an up-switch <b>71</b>, a down-switch <b>72</b>, a current source <b>73</b> for supplying a current (1.5×Ic) to the capacitor <b>22</b>, and a current source <b>74</b> for drawing a current Ic out of the capacitor <b>22</b>. When the output S<b>20</b> of the offset receiver <b>20</b> is retained at L level, the down-switch <b>72</b> is retained in the ON state to continuously discharge the capacitor <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> will not exceed (⅔)×VDD. On the other hand, when the output S<b>20</b> changes between H level and L level, the capacitor <b>22</b> is alternately charged and discharged. A charging current (1.5×I<i>c</i>) is larger than a discharging current (I<i>c</i>). Therefore, when the H level period of the output S<b>20</b> corresponding to a clock waveform has the same length as that of the L level period thereof, the terminal voltage of the capacitor <b>22</b> gradually rises and finally exceeds (⅔)×VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of the specific structure of the transition counter <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The transition counter <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a first counter <b>81</b>, a second counter <b>82</b> and an SR latch <b>83</b>. The first counter <b>81</b> counts 512 cycles of the clock signal CLK, and the second counter <b>82</b> counts 32 cycles of the output S<b>10</b> (or S<b>20</b>). If the second counter <b>82</b> finishes counting 32 cycles before the first counter <b>81</b> finishes counting 512 cycles, the SR latch <b>83</b> is set according to the output of the second counter <b>82</b>. As a result, the output S<b>30</b> is asserted to H level. However, if the first counter <b>81</b> finishes counting 512 cycles before the second counter <b>82</b> finishes counting 32 cycles, the SR latch <b>83</b> is reset according to the output of the first counter <b>81</b>. As a result, the output S<b>30</b> returns to L level.</p>

It is herein assumed that an intermittent clock waveform having a cycle of 2.67 ms and duration of 666.7 μs is applied to the differential input terminals RD, NRD, and the differential input terminals RD, NRD are rendered in the high impedance state (H<i>i</i>-Z) during the remaining period of each cycle. In this case, the offset receiver <b>20</b>, charge pump <b>21</b>, capacitor <b>22</b> and hysteresis comparator <b>23</b> mainly operate out of the components in the signal detector <b>15</b>, and the signal S<b>23</b> is output as signal detection output SD. T<i>d</i><b>1</b> is a delay time of the signal detection output SD with respect to the input waveform of the differential input terminals RD, NRD. Note that it is preferable to determine a time constant by the charge pump <b>21</b> and the capacitor <b>22</b> and set the delay time of the delay circuit <b>31</b> so as to prevent the signal S<b>32</b> from being output prior to the signal S<b>23</b>.</p>
