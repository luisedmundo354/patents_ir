<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 2004-46527 filed on Jun. 22, 2004 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to a local oscillator for a multi-band wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless communication system uses various frequency bands. For example, a 800 MHz frequency band is used for cellular CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), a 1900 MHz frequency band is used for PCS (Personal Communication Service), and a 1500 MHz frequency band is used for GPS (Global Positioning System).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, a wireless communication terminal uses only one frequency band. For example, a CDMA wireless communication terminal uses about 800 MHz frequency band but not the 1900 MHz PCS frequency band nor the 1500 MHz GPS frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A multi-band communication system uses two or more frequency bands. For example, a wireless communication receiver is capable of receiving CDMA signals, PCS signals, and GPS signals. The prior art multi-band communication system uses multiple voltage-controlled oscillators for various frequency bands. Therefore, the prior art multi-band communication system has large chip size, high power consumption, and high cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A 0-IF (Zero-Intermediate Frequency) communication system does not use an IF (Intermediate Frequency). The 0-IF system is also called a Direct Conversion system. The 0-IF system is opposite to a Super Heterodyne system that uses IF. The 0-IF system directly converts a carrier signal to a baseband signal. In addition, the 0-IF system directly converts a baseband signal to a carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The 0-IF system may reduce the number of SAW Filters (Surface Acoustic Wave Filters) and mixers so that the 0-IF system may reduce production cost and device size. The number of wireless communication systems to which the 0-IF system is applied has increased recently.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When a LO (Local Oscillating) signal has almost the same frequency as the frequency of the RF (Radio Frequency) signal, the 0-IF system performs adversely with signal leakage, DC offset, and I/O mismatch. Therefore, the 0-IF system generates an oscillating signal that has a frequency different from the frequency of the RF signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, a 0-IF multi-band wireless communication system generates oscillating signals that have frequencies different from the RF signal frequency using multiple voltage-controlled oscillators. The 0-IF system divides the frequencies of the oscillating signals to generate frequency divided oscillating signals. The 0-IF system mixes the oscillating signals and the divided oscillating signals with each other to generate the local-oscillating signals having wanted frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a conventional multi-band wireless communication system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a PCS signal, a cellular signal, and a GPS signal are received at antennas <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>, respectively. Band pass filters <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>123</b> filter the received PCS signal, cellular signal, and GPS signal, respectively, for filtering away unwanted frequency band signals. The filtered PCS signal, cellular signal, and GPS signal are amplified by LNAs (Low Noise Amplifiers) <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>133</b>, respectively. Band pass filters <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> filter the amplified PCS signal and cellular signal, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Then, mixers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>153</b> mix the thus processed PCS signal, cellular signal, and GPS signal with local-oscillating signals LO<b>1</b>, LO<b>2</b>, and LO<b>3</b>, respectively. The local oscillator <b>100</b> generates the local-oscillating signals LO<b>1</b>, LO<b>2</b>, and LO<b>3</b>. Therefore, a 0-IF PCS signal, a 0-IF cellular signal, and a 0-IF GPS signal are generated from the mixers <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>153</b>. Low pass filters <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, and <b>163</b> filter the 0-IF PCS signal, the 0-IF cellular signal, and the 0-IF GPS signal, respectively. A modem <b>170</b> modulates or demodulates the filtered 0-IF PCS signal, 0-IF cellular signal, and 0-IF GPS signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The local oscillator in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes two voltage-controlled oscillators <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, a complex LO generator <b>103</b>, and a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) <b>104</b>. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>101</b> generates a first frequency band signal at about 1700 MHz. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>102</b> generates a second frequency band signal at about 3150 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For the cellular signal, the LO generator <b>103</b> divides a frequency of the 1700 MHz frequency band signal by two to generate the local-oscillating signal LO<b>2</b>. The frequency range of the local-oscillating signal LO<b>2</b> is in a range from about 832 MHz to about 894 MHz. For the GPS signal, the LO generator <b>103</b> divides a frequency of the 3150 MHz frequency band signal by two to generate the local-oscillating signal LO<b>3</b>. The frequency range of the local-oscillating signal LO<b>3</b> is about 1575.42 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For the PCS signal, the LO generator <b>103</b> divides a frequency of the 1700 MHz frequency band signal by eight to generate a divided signal. The LO generator <b>103</b> mixes the 1700 MHz frequency band signal with the divided signal to generate the local-oscillating signal LO<b>1</b>. The frequency range of the local-oscillating signal LO<b>1</b> is in a range from about 1840 MHz to about 1990 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The local oscillator <b>100</b> of the prior art uses two voltage-controlled oscillators <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> and at least one mixer within the LO generator <b>103</b> to generate the local-oscillating signals. Thus, the multi-band wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> unfortunately has large chip size, high power consumption, high product price, and increased noise floor and spurious frequencies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, a local oscillator of the present invention uses one voltage-controlled oscillator to generate local-oscillating signals for a multi-band wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a local oscillator according to an aspect of the present invention, a voltage-controlled oscillator generates an oscillating signal in response to a control signal. In addition, a local oscillating signal generator includes at least one buffer and at least one frequency divider for generating from the oscillating signal a plurality of frequency signals having different frequencies. The local oscillating signal generator also includes a switching circuit that selects one of the plurality of frequency signals. The local oscillator also includes a phase locked loop that generates the control signal from the selected frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, the local oscillating signal generator outputs a local-oscillating signal generated from the selected frequency signal. In that case, the local oscillating signal generator further includes another frequency divider coupled to an output of the switching circuit to generate the local-oscillating signal by frequency division of the selected frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment of the present invention, the local oscillating signal generator generates a respective local-oscillating signal from each of the plurality of frequency signals. In that case, the local oscillating signal generator further includes a respective frequency divider for receiving a corresponding one of the frequency signals to generate the respective local-oscillating signal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further embodiment of the present invention, the frequency signal selected by the switching circuit depends on a tuned frequency range of the voltage-controlled oscillator.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Such a local oscillator is used to particular advantage within a multi-band wireless communication system comprising antennas for receiving multiple frequency band signals each having a respective frequency range. In that case, the local-oscillating signals from the local oscillator are used for mixing with the frequency band signals.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this manner, the local oscillator uses just one voltage-controlled oscillator for reduced chip size, power consumption, product price, and noise.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a local oscillator <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the local oscillator <b>200</b> includes a voltage-controlled oscillator <b>210</b>, a phase locked loop <b>220</b>, and a local-oscillating signal generator <b>230</b>. The voltage-controlled oscillator <b>210</b> generates an oscillating signal OSC in response to a control signal CTR.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A frequency tuning range of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> includes a first range from about 3680 MHz to about 3980 MHz corresponding to two times a PCS band (PCS band multiplied by 2), a second range from about 3328 MHz to about 3576 MHz corresponding to four times a cellular band (cellular band multiplied by 4), or a third range of about 3150.84 MHz corresponding to two times a GPS band (GPS band multiplied by 2). Consequently, the total frequency tuning range of the voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> is from about 3150.84 MHz to about 3980 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The local oscillating signal generator <b>230</b> divides a frequency of the oscillating signal OSC by 2 or 4 to generate a local-oscillating signal LO of wanted frequencies. The local oscillating signal generator <b>230</b> includes buffers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>236</b>, frequency dividers <b>233</b> and <b>235</b>, and a switching circuit <b>234</b>. The buffers <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> buffer the oscillating signal OSC. For example, the buffer <b>231</b> buffers the oscillating signal OSC (about 3680 MHz through about 3980 MHz) when the local oscillator <b>200</b> is used for a PCS band signal, and the buffer <b>232</b> buffers the oscillating signal OSC (about 3150.84 MHz) when the local oscillator <b>200</b> is used for a GPS band signal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The divider <b>233</b> divides a frequency of the oscillating signal OSC by 2. For example, the divider <b>233</b> divides the frequency of the oscillating signal (about 3328 MHz through about 3576 MHz) when the local oscillator <b>200</b> is used for a cellular band signal. In this manner, each of the buffer <b>231</b>, the buffer <b>232</b>, and the divider <b>233</b> outputs a respective frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The switching circuit <b>234</b> selects one of the frequency signals from the buffer <b>231</b>, the buffer <b>232</b>, and the divider <b>233</b>. The switching circuit <b>234</b> may be implemented with CMOS switches or multiplexers to select one of the frequency signals from the buffer <b>231</b>, the buffer <b>232</b>, and the divider <b>233</b> in response to a mode selection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The divider <b>235</b> is coupled to the output of the switching circuit <b>234</b> to divide a frequency of the selected frequency signal from the switching circuit <b>234</b> to generate the local-oscillating signal LO. The buffer <b>236</b> is also coupled to the output of the switching circuit <b>234</b> to buffer the selected frequency signal from the switching circuit <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The phase locked loop <b>220</b> generates the control signal CTR based on a phase difference between the selected frequency signal and a reference signal (not shown) to decrease the phase difference.
