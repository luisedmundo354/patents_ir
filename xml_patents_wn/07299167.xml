<p id="p-0007" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a control unit <b>1</b> for controlling an entire device such as a central processing unit (CPU), an input/output unit <b>2</b> such as display unit, switch or wireless remote controller, a storage unit <b>3</b> in which a program to be executed is stored, a storage unit <b>4</b> for work in which a file or the like is temporarily stored when executing the program, a general-purpose network <b>100</b> such as the Internet or local area network (LAN), and a storage medium <b>101</b> such as flexible disk or compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) are described.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">The control unit <b>1</b>, the input/output unit <b>2</b>, the storage unit <b>3</b> and the storage unit <b>4</b> form a device <b>50</b> that is an incorporated device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">An input/output of the input/output unit <b>2</b> is interconnected with the control unit <b>1</b>. Also inputs/outputs of the storage unit <b>3</b> and the storage unit <b>4</b> are interconnected with the control unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">The operation in the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will now be briefly described. When started, the control unit <b>1</b> performs initialization of the device <b>50</b> as it is necessary, and reads out and executes the program stored in the storage unit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The control unit <b>1</b> controls the input/output unit <b>2</b> according to the program that is being executed. When executing the program, the control unit <b>1</b> also prepares a temporary file or the like and properly stores it into the storage unit <b>4</b>, if necessary, and thus operates the device <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">However, in the device <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the program is incorporated in the device. Therefore, in the case of correcting trouble of the program or adding a function, the program stored in the storage unit <b>3</b> must be modified or another program must be added.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The operation of adding a function in the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart for explaining the procedure to add a function.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">At “S<b>001</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is judged whether addition of a function to the device <b>50</b> is necessary or not. If it is judged that addition of a function is necessary, it is judged at “S<b>002</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> whether the program in the storage unit <b>3</b> of the device <b>50</b> is rewritable or not.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">If it is judged at “S<b>002</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the program in the storage unit <b>3</b> is rewritable, an additional program is written to the storage unit <b>3</b> at “S<b>003</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">For example, the additional program is written to the storage unit <b>3</b> via the network <b>100</b> or written to the storage unit <b>3</b> via the storage medium <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">On the other hand, if it is judged at “S<b>002</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the program in the storage unit <b>3</b> is not rewritable, the storage unit <b>3</b> of the device <b>50</b> is replaced with a storage unit in which an additional program is already written, at “S<b>004</b>” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (i.e., read-only memory (ROM) replacement is performed).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">However, in the addition of a function in the conventional example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the resources of the device <b>50</b>, which is an incorporated device, such as the storage capacity of the storage unit <b>3</b> and the processing speed of the control unit <b>1</b>, are limited in many cases in order to reduce the cost. Therefore, the resources of the device cannot cope with addition of a function that requires resources exceeding the processing speed and the storage capacity that are not anticipated at the time of manufacturing.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">This invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a structural block diagram showing an embodiment of a function adding system according to this invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a control unit <b>1</b>, an input/output unit <b>2</b>, as storage unit <b>3</b> and the storage unit <b>4</b> are denoted by the same numerals as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and communication units <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> such as network interfaces, a control unit <b>7</b> for controlling the entire device such as a CPU, a storage unit <b>8</b> in which a program to realize addition of a function is stored, and a general-purpose network <b>102</b> such as the Internet or LAN are described.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The control unit <b>1</b>, the input/output unit <b>2</b>, the storage unit <b>3</b>, the storage unit <b>4</b> and the communication unit <b>5</b> form a device <b>51</b> that is an incorporated device. The communication unit <b>6</b>, the control unit <b>7</b> and the storage unit <b>8</b> form an arithmetic processing unit <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">In the device <b>51</b>, which is an incorporated device, an input/output of the input/output unit <b>2</b> is interconnected with the control unit <b>1</b>, and also inputs/outputs of the storage unit <b>3</b> and the storage unit <b>4</b> are interconnected with the control unit <b>1</b>. An input/output of the control unit <b>1</b> is interconnected with the communication unit <b>5</b>. The communication unit <b>5</b> is connected to the network <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">On the other hand, in the arithmetic processing device <b>52</b>, an input/output of the storage unit <b>8</b> is interconnected with the control unit <b>7</b>, and an input/output of the control unit <b>7</b> is interconnected with the communication unit <b>6</b>. The communication unit <b>6</b> is connected to the network <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">The operation in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0072">In the description of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if it is judged that the additional function is available, the control unit <b>1</b> performs reconstruction of the user interface such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function.

However, the user interface may be reconstructed when a designated operation is performed, instead of dynamically reconstructing the user interface as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">Specifically, the user interface is reconstructed only when the power is turned on while a specific button is being pressed or when plural specific buttons are simultaneously pressed, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">In such cases, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit <b>1</b> of the device <b>51</b>, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">Moreover, when certain trouble disables use of the additional function of the arithmetic processing device <b>52</b> or <b>53</b> during processing, use of the corresponding user interface may be disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">Specifically, an additionally displayed button or menu is deleted, or operation (press, selection or the like) of the button or menu is disabled while the button or menu is still displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080">In such cases, a request for processing of the additional function that is disabled during processing can be prevented. In the latter case, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit <b>1</b> of the device <b>51</b>, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0081">It is described in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the other drawings that the arithmetic processing device <b>52</b> (or <b>53</b>) is simply connected to the network <b>102</b>. A specific example of the arithmetic processing device may be a server prepared by a manufacturer or a personal computer installed at home.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">In the former case, the device <b>51</b> (for example, home electronic device), which is an incorporated device, accesses the server prepared by the manufacturer via the Internet and causes the additional function to be processed on the server. In this case, the manufacturer can charge the user in accordance with the time for which the user uses the server.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">In the latter case, the device <b>51</b> (for example, home electronic device), which is an incorporated device, causes the additional function to be processed by using the remaining resources of the personal computer that is connected to a LAN at home and in which a program to execute the additional function has been installed in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">Specific examples of the device <b>51</b>, which is an incorporated device, include a hard disk recorder, measuring device, copy machine, air-conditioning equipment such as air conditioner, and so on. They can be applied to expansion of a timer function or expansion of a setting function of general home electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085">For example, in the case of a hard disk recorder, an image is encoded according to the MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group/Moving Picture Experts Group) system or the like and recorded onto a hard disk. When eliminating noise from the recorded image or adding an effect to the recorded image or performing other works such as editing, the arithmetic processing unit is caused to perform the work. Thus, various editing works can be arbitrarily added irrespective of the processing capability and resources of the hard disk recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">For example, in the case of a measuring device, measurement data acquired by the measuring device is sent to the arithmetic processing device and the arithmetic processing device is caused to perform necessary processing. Thus, processing of various contents can be arbitrarily added irrespective of the processing capability and resources of the measuring device.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">For example, in the case of a copy machine, special processing of a copied image, an advanced OCR (optical character recognition/optical character reader) function or the like can be easily added by using an input/output unit such as touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">For example, in the case of air-conditioning equipment such as air conditioner, a preset temperature and an operating time of a day are set in the arithmetic processing device, and the air-conditioning equipment is controlled by a trigger such as turning on/off of operation from the arithmetic processing device or changing the preset temperature. Thus, finer control can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">Such expansion of the timer function can be applied to general home electronic devices such as washing machine, television, electric rice cooker and refrigerator. As information set in each of the home electronic devices (for example, user settings such as setting of a washing process of the washing machine or a cooking process of the rice cooker, and setting of channel of the television) is externally stored into the arithmetic processing device, it is easy to take over the information (user settings) when purchasing new home electronic devices to replace the existing ones.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">This invention has the following advantages. According to the inventions of claims <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, in the case of using an additional function, by accessing an arithmetic processing device in which a program to execute an additional function is installed, via a network, then making a request for processing of the additional function, and receiving the result of processing, a device which is an incorporated device can add the function irrespective of the resources of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">According to the inventions of claims <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, in the case of using an additional function, by accessing a web server unit of the arithmetic processing device in which a program to execute the additional function is installed, via the network, then making a request for processing of the additional function and receiving the result of processing, the device, which is an incorporated device, can add the function irrespective of the resources of the device. Moreover, since a control unit causes a web page sent from the web server unit to be displayed on a display screen by using a web browser, the control unit need not perform reconstruction of a user interface or the like such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function on the display screen or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">According to the inventions of claims <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, reconstruction of the user interface is performed when a designated operation is performed by an input/output unit, such as downloading the user interface itself via the network or reading the user interface from a storage medium or causing the input/output unit to display a preset user interface. Thus, the user interface is not reconstructed frequently and the load on the control unit of the device, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">According to the invention of claim <b>11</b>, when certain trouble disables use of an additional function of the arithmetic processing unit during processing, the corresponding user interface is deleted or operation (press, selection or the like) of the user interface is disabled. Thus, a request for processing of the additional function that is disabled during processing can be prevented. Moreover, in the latter case, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit of the device, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.</p>
