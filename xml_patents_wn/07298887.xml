<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB colors are disclosed. The analyzing method includes the steps of feeding a target PCB, to be measured, to an image pick-up position where a pick-up unit is disposed, by a feeding unit, picking up an image of a metal surface of the fed target PCB, extracting pixel data from the picked-up image for the target PCB, performing a mapping operation for RGB signals of the extracted pixel data in accordance with a mapping program, thereby determining relative RGB values, producing cumulative distribution data of the relative RGB values for the target PCB in accordance with an RGB-mapping process, and quantitatively determining the oxidation degree of the target PCB metal surface exhibited with the lapse of time, based on the cumulative distribution data. Since relative values of RGB colors in an image picked up from the metal surface of a PCB can be analyzed, it is possible to rapidly and easily analyze the surface condition of the PCB such as oxidation, contamination, or structural defects of the PCB in a quantitative manner without using an expensive surface analyzer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a printed circuit board (PCB) using RGB colors and more particularly, a system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB colors, in which the oxidation degree of the PCB is quantitatively measured, based on relative values of RGB signals, in unit pixels of an image obtained by picking up an image of the PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PCBs, which are mounted thereon with electronic elements such as semiconductor chips, resistors, and capacitors, serve to electrically connect the mounted electronic elements via conductive wiring patterns of desired shapes or to supply a drive voltage to the electronic elements. Such a PCB includes a board for mounting electronic elements thereon, and wirings of desired patterns for electrically connecting the mounted electronic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The configuration of such a PCB and the procedure for manufacturing the PCB will now be described in detail. A copper clad laminate (CCL) is first prepared by forming a copper film on one surface or both surfaces of a thin substrate made of an insulating material such as epoxy or bakelite resin. In order to increase the bonding force of the copper film to the resin of the substrate, the formation of the copper film is carried out in such a manner that the copper film reacts with the resin of the substrate, thereby penetrating into the resin by a certain depth, for example, about 5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thereafter, a shearing process is carried out so as to shear the CCL to have a desired panel size suitable for subsequent processes. The sheared CCL is then subjected to a beveling process, so that it has round corners. Subsequently, the CCL is subjected to a scrubbing process for removing fingerprints or dust on the copper film surface of the CCL or providing roughness to the copper film surface in order to increase the bonding force of a dry film to be laminated on the copper film surface in a subsequent lamination process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">After completion of the scrubbing process, the dry film is formed on the copper film surface. The dry film consists of a film-shaped photoresist adapted to form a desired wiring pattern on a PCB, a Mylar film for providing a certain degree of flexibility, and a cover film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An artwork film formed with a wiring pattern is then attached to the dry film. Thereafter, the resulting structure is subjected to an exposure process in which ultraviolet rays are irradiated onto the structure so as to cure portions of the photoresist reacting with the ultraviolet rays. At this time, the other portions of the photoresist do not vary. A development process is then carried out using a certain developer, thereby dissolving and, thus, removing uncured portions of the photoresist while leaving the cured photoresist portion to be subsequently used as an etch resist. Thus, an etch mask made of the etch resist is formed on the copper film of the CCL for formation of a desired wiring pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">After formation of the etch mask, an etchant is sprayed onto the resulting structure, thereby removing an exposed portion of the copper film corresponding to a region other than a wiring pattern region where the copper film is protected by the etch resist. Accordingly, a desired wiring pattern is formed. After formation of the wiring pattern, the etch resist is completely stripped. Thus, the PCB is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a PCB manufacturing method involves repeated processes of lamination, etching and cleaning of copper films, as described above. However, the final product, that is, the PCB, may have a poor surface condition due to contamination sources such as dust or fingerprints left on the copper films, and oxidation or discoloration of the wiring patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, where oxidation occurs at bonding pads of the PCB, made of a metal such as Cu, to be connected to corresponding portions of a semiconductor chip, attachment of balls or wires may not be achieved due to oxides present on the bonding pad surfaces. Although the attachment may be achieved, its bonding strength is considerably low.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, it is necessary to measure the degree of an oxidation at the metal surface of a PCB enabling identification of the above mentioned problem. Conventionally, this measurement is achieved with the operator's naked eye or expensive equipment such as a surface analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, the method of visually inspecting the surface condition of a PCB by the operator makes it difficult to obtain accurate inspection results because it is greatly influenced by various parameters of the surroundings such as the ability of the operator, surrounding brightness, and time. Furthermore, this method has limited repeatability and reproducibility for the inspection results. For this reason, there is a problem in that it is impossible to obtain quantitative data capable of determining respective qualities of optional PCBs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, where an expensive surface analyzer such as ESCA or Auger is used, it can accurately measure the condition of the metal surface of an optional PCB. However, there are problems in that the surface analyzer increases the manufacturing costs of PCBs due to high installation costs thereof, and cannot be easily applied to products newly developed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been made in view of the above mentioned problems, and an object of the invention is to provide a system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB colors, in which oxidation, contamination, and structural defects of the PCB are quantitatively measured, based on relative values of RGB signals, in unit pixels of an image obtained by picking up an image of the PCB.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Now, a system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB signals in accordance with the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First, the configuration and operation of the system for analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB signals in accordance with the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a feeding unit <b>100</b> is shown which carries a PCB, to be measured, thereon, and feeds the PCB to an image pick-up position where a pick-up unit <b>200</b> to be described hereinafter is disposed. The feeding unit <b>100</b> includes a conveyor belt connected to a production line for PCBs, and adapted to feed a PCB to the image pick-up position, a sensor installed at a predetermined position on the conveyor belt, and adapted to sense the operating state of the conveyor, a control signal input/output unit for receiving, from a signal analyzing unit <b>300</b>, a control signal adapted to control the operation of the feeding unit, and a control unit for controlling the whole of the feeding unit.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the feeding unit has been described as using the conveyor belt, it is not limited thereto. It may be possible to feed a PCB to the image pick-up position, using a feeding unit having a configuration different from that of the above described feeding unit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pick-up unit <b>200</b> picks up an image of the metal surface of the PCB fed by the feeding unit <b>100</b>, divides data of the picked-up image into pixels of a corresponding bitmap, and stores luminance data of the picked-up image data corresponding to each pixel in an internal memory included in the pick-up unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When a signal requesting inputting of the image data corresponding to the picked-up image of the PCB metal surface is inputted from the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b> via a certain communication interface, for example, an RS232C communication interface, the pick-up unit <b>200</b> transmits the image data stored in the internal memory to the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For the pick-up unit <b>200</b> adapted to pick up the image of the PCB metal surface, a digital camera, scanner or charge coupled device (CCD) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b> receives the image data from the pick-up unit <b>200</b> via the communication interface, it maps the image data for a selected pixel, using RGB values in predetermined RGB ranges, and measures the degree of oxidation on the associated PCB metal surface, based on the results of the mapping, thereby quantitatively determining whether or not the associated PCB has poor quality. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b> includes a data transmitting/receiving unit <b>301</b>, a light source setting unit <b>302</b>, an RGB range setting unit <b>303</b>, a database <b>304</b>, a signal converting unit <b>305</b>, and a signal processing unit <b>306</b></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The data transmitting/receiving unit <b>301</b> receives the picked-up image data of the PCB metal surface inputted from the pick-up unit <b>200</b> via the communication interface, and then sends the received image data to the signal processing unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The data transmitting/receiving unit <b>301</b> receives various control signals inputted through a data input unit such as a keyboard, to set system operating conditions, for example, a light source setting control signal adapted to set the color temperature and brightness of light, to be irradiated onto the PCB upon picking up an image of the PCB, to certain values, respectively, an RGB range setting control signal adapted to set RGB ranges to be used when RGB-mapping the picked-up image data for a selected pixel, a control signal for controlling the operation of the feeding unit <b>100</b>, and an image pick-up control signal for controlling the pick-up unit <b>200</b>. The data transmitting/receiving unit <b>301</b> sends the received control signals to the signal processing unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The data transmitting/receiving unit <b>301</b> also receives cumulative distribution data of fractions and relative values of R signals associated with the metal surface of the PCB, and transmits the received cumulative distribution data to a certain output device (not shown) such as a computer monitor or printer via a certain communication interface. The cumulative distribution data is produced by the signal converting unit <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The light source setting unit <b>302</b> performs a control operation for light emitted from a light source to be used when picking up an image of the PCB metal surface. For example, the light source setting unit <b>302</b> controls the color temperature and brightness of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Based on a control signal received from the signal processing unit <b>306</b>, the RGB range setting unit <b>303</b> sets RGB ranges to be applied to an RGB mapping process which will be performed for selected pixel data of the PCB metal surface in accordance with a certain mapping program.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the RGB ranges, that is, R, G, and B ranges, may be set to have level values of 0 to 255 respectively corresponding to different intensity values of a corresponding one of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) signals associated with each pixel of the PCB surface image.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">That is, each of the RGB signals, that is, R, G, and B signals, may be represented by 256 intensity levels respectively having level values of 0 to 255. The number of different colors representable in this case is 256<sup>3 </sup>(R×G×B=16,777,216). That is, various colors can be represented by appropriately combining various intensity values of R, G, and B signals. For example, black can be represented by an RGB intensity combination of (0,0,0), bright red (255,0,0), bright green (0,255,0), yellow (255,255,0), cyan (0,255,255), magenta (255,0,255), and white (255,255,255).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The database <b>304</b> stores data of R signal fractions (%) and associated relative values measured for the metal surface of the PCB. The R signal fractions are measured at intervals of, for example, 24 hours after performing a moisture absorption test for the metal surface of the PCB under predetermined conditions of, for example, 85° C./60% RH/168 h. The relative value associated with each R signal fraction is calculated by dividing the R signal fraction by an R signal fraction measured at normal temperature for the metal surface of a general PCB not subjected to any moisture absorption test. The following Table 1 shows data of R signal fractions and associated relative values measured at intervals of 24 hours for the metal surface of the PCB after performing a moisture absorption test under the conditions of 85° C./60% RH/168 h.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The surface condition of the PCB varying with the lapse of time and R signal fraction data representing the variation in PCB surface condition will now be described in detail with reference to Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to Table 1, it can be seen that R signal fractions, and therefore, oxidation degrees, measured at intervals of time for the metal surface of the PCB after performing a moisture absorption test under the conditions of 85° C./60% RH/168 h are distributed in a range from about 22% to about 67%. It can also be seen that relative values respectively associated with the R signal fractions are distributed in a range from about 1.00 to about 3.01.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">That is, where oxidation caused by adsorption of moisture is performed for 168 hours, a great increase in R signal fraction is exhibited in a period of time after 72 hours, but before 120 hours. Such a phenomenon is caused by a great increase in the thickness or distribution of oxides formed on the metal surface of the PCB in accordance with oxidation of the metal surface.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After 120 hours, a substantially constant R signal fraction is exhibited. This is because levels of R signals are substantially uniform in accordance with an increase in the scattering degree of reflective visible rays caused by the greatly increased thickness or distribution of oxides on the metal surface of the PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to Table 2, it can be seen that R signal fractions, and therefore, oxidation degrees, measured at intervals of time for the metal surface of the PCB after performing a moisture absorption test under severe conditions of 85° C./85% RH/168 h are distributed in a range from about 22% to about 73%. It can also be seen that relative values respectively associated with the R signal fractions are distributed in a range from about 1.00 to about 3.2. These distributions of R signal fractions and relative values are similar to those of Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This routine will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The R signal fraction represents the degree of oxidation generated on the metal surface of the PCB. A higher R signal fraction represents an increased oxidation of the PCB metal surface.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b> completely stores, in the database <b>304</b>, the relative values measured at intervals of time for the metal surface of the comparative PCB, the pick-up unit <b>20</b> picks up an image of the metal surface of a target PCB fed by the feeding unit <b>100</b> for measurement thereof, under the control of the signal analyzing unit <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (S<b>200</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This routine will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This routine will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Based on the cumulative distribution data of RGB signals produced in association with the metal surface of the PCB in the above described routine, the signal processing unit <b>306</b> quantitatively determines the degree of oxidation generated on the metal surface of the target PCB, thereby determining whether or not the target PCB has poor quality (S<b>407</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a system for and a method of analyzing the surface condition of a PCB using RGB colors, which can analyze relative values of RGB colors in an image picked up from the metal surface of a PCB, thereby rapidly and easily analyzing the surface condition of the PCB such as oxidation, contamination, or structural defects of the PCB in a quantitative manner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In accordance with the present invention, the measure for determining poor quality of PCBs is set in a relative or quantitative manner, based on cumulative distribution data of relative RGB values in the picked-up PCB image.
