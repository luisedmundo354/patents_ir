<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to grease trap assemblies provided in waste water drain line systems, and more particularly to such grease trap assemblies having automatic, powered skimmer arrangements for skimming and removing grease and oils from the wastewater passing through the grease trap assembly prior to exiting through an outlet into the municiple sewer system serving the facility. Such grease trap assemblies are used in connection with commercial food preparation sinks, rinse sinks and dishwashing and utensil washing facilities and such in restaurants, fast food outlets, hospitals, hotels and other large kitchen facilities that produce grease and oil-laden wastewater in order to reduce the amount of grease, cooking oil and other contaminants that are introduced into the municipal sewer system and treatment facilities serving the area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These grease trap assemblies are well known in the industry and range in complexity from structurally simple units that require periodic manual skimming by facility personnel to rather complex structural arrangements that provide for automatic skimming and pump discharge of skimmed grease and oil into external containers positioned adjacent the side wall of the trap assembly. The simple forms of traps in essence simply provide an enclosed, hollow box or settling tank structure having a kitchen wastewater inlet at one end and an outlet at the opposite end for connection to a sewer line, baffle plates typically being arranged within the cavity to interrupt direct flow-through of wastewater between the inlet and outlet, and defining a separation area between the baffles in which grease and oil may naturally float to the surface of the wastewater contained within the box. Periodically as needed, an employee must remove the top cover of the box and manually skim the grease and oil that has accumulated at the surface of the wastewater. This is an extremely unpleasant and time consuming task, made worse as is well known by the pungent and foul odors that are inherent in the skimmed materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Grease trap assemblies having automatic skimmer arrangements contained within the trap box have also been provided heretofore, and typically utilize rotating skimmer discs connected to an external drive means arranged to cause continuous rotation of the discs within the trap housing. The discs are cleaned by wiper blades arranged to direct grease and oil to a pump arrangement for pump discharge or by gravity flow into a holding container disposed alongside or vertically below the trap apparatus, such, as taught by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,133,881, 4,268,396 and 4,051,024. These power skimmer arrangements all provide structurally complex rotating disc-type mechanical assemblies contained substantially entirely within the body housing of the grease traps and therefore are arranged, and structurally capable only of discharging skimmed grease and oils to the side of the grease trap tank adjacent to and alongside the external periphery of the tank. This requires additional floor space in the kitchen facility beyond that required by the grease trap tank itself, and completely prevents installation of these types of assemblies in in-floor situations. Moreover, because the skimming disc apparatus and related mechanical and often electrical structure of the grease skimming and removal apparatus of these patent teachings are contained and mounted within the hollow confines of the wastewater holding tank of the grease trap assemblies, routine and periodic inspection and maintenance of the assemblies requires access into the tank which is designed to maintain a predetermined level of grease-laden wastewater therein, making such operations extremely unpleasant and difficult to perform. Also the mechanical structures, since they occupy space within the interior confines of the grease trap tanks, obstruct inspection of the bottom of the tank for identifying and cleaning of the bottom of the tank of accumulated solids, etc. that invariably settle and build up over time. Further, since the mechanical and electrical components of the skimmer apparatus are contained in either submerged or close proximity to the water retained in the grease trap tank, these parts must be provided in a more expensive form capable of withstanding the hot and humid environment in which they must operate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a skimming apparatus which is well adapted for inclusion in original manufacture of a complete grease trap assembly, but the invention is also particulary well adapted for retrofitting and upgrading existing, already installed and in use manual skimming trap assemblies into automatic skimmer condition as will become readily apparent. No other automatic grease removal skimmer apparatus has been provided heretofore that is arranged for and structurally capable of reasonably retrofitting existing, already installed grease trap assemblies, and it has been discovered that there is a great need and desire in the marketplace for such an apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In its basic concept this invention provides a grease skimming and removal apparatus contained substantially in a self-contained vertically extending tower assembly mounted on the top wall of a grease trap settling tank assembly, the tower providing for power driven belt skimming of wastewater contained in the tank and vertical carrying of skimmed grease and oils to an elevated position within the confines of the tower disposed vertically above the top of the grease trap settling tank for subsequent gravity discharge into a holding container supported on the tower vertically above the grease trap settling tank.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is by virtue of the foregoing basic concept that the principal objective of this invention is achieved; namely the provision of a substantially self-contained grease trap skimming and grease removal apparatus that overcomes the structural complexities, limitations and disadvantages of grease trap grease removal systems of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described which may be provided in the form of a complete skimming-type grease trap apparatus for purchase and installation in a facility as a complete assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described which may be provided as a skimming and grease removal apparatus for retrofit installation onto existing and already-installed grease trap tank assemblies with minimal modification thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described wherein the grease removal and collection apparatus requires no additional floor space than that already occupied by the grease trap apparatus itself, and also accommodates in-floor grease trap installations in commercial facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described in which the drive motor and electrical apparatus are contained entirely outside of and remote from the interior, water-containing grease trap tank apparatus, thereby substantially eliminating possibility of electrical shock or shorting and expenses relating to the provision of sealed such units required for operation in close proximity to water and humid enclosures such as is present within grease trap tank enclosures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described which completely avoids the structural need for grease discharge pumps and related structural complexity and expense.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A still further object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described which is arranged to provide for grease removal and collection with substantially no escape of odors emanating from the confines of the grease trap tank, the tower and the collection vessel between collection vessel-emptying and maintenance operations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another object and advantage of this invention is the provision of a skimming and grease removal apparatus of the class described which is of simplified construction for economical manufacture and installation and facility of operation and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the present invention will appear from the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings of a preferred embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a basic grease trap assembly generally indicated at <b>10</b> mounting a tower-type skimmer and grease removal apparatus <b>12</b> embodying features of the present invention. For purposes of illustration herein, the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> is shown in a form arranged for retrofit or subsequent installation onto an already-installed, basic grease trap settling tank assembly <b>10</b> in order to upgrade the assembly into automatic skimming capability. It is to be understood however that the grease trap settling tank assembly <b>10</b> and tower-type grease skimming and removal apparatus may also be provided together as a complete trap apparatus assembly as well. In either case, the basic grease trap tank assembly typically comprises, as shown, a substantially hollow box member or settling tank formed of a bottom wall <b>14</b>, upstanding side and opposite end walls <b>16</b> and a top wall shown herein as a removable top lid member <b>18</b> arranged for releasable securement in position enclosing the interior confines of the trap box.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A wastewater inlet pipe <b>20</b> communicates the interior of the grease trap assembly with the waste water drain of one or more sinks (not shown) or dishwasher (not shown) of a facility, and an outlet pipe <b>22</b> communicates the interior of the trap assembly with the sewer system (not shown) servicing the facility. Baffle members <b>24</b>, <b>24</b>′ are typically provided to obstruct and prevent direct flow of wastewater through the box from inlet <b>20</b> to outlet <b>22</b> and provide a reduced turbulence, separation or settling area <b>26</b> therebetween for greases and oils <b>28</b> mixed with the wastewater entering the interior cavity of the trap assembly to naturally separate and float to the top surface of the wastewater level maintained in the separation area <b>26</b>. The baffle <b>24</b>′ also prevents passage of the separated, floating grease and oil <b>26</b> through the outlet <b>22</b> and into the sewer system, as is well understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the top lid member <b>18</b> includes, or in the case of retrofitting an existing trap assembly is provided with, an opening <b>30</b> therethrough positioned vertically above the separation area <b>26</b> provided for the confinement of floating grease and oils <b>28</b> as described previously. The tower-type skimmer apparatus <b>12</b> of this invention is mounted to the top lid member <b>18</b> in position overlying and extending vertically upwardly from the opening <b>30</b> as seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the particular embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and as seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> of the drawings, a mounting flange member <b>32</b> is secured fixedly to the lid member <b>18</b> by any suitable securing means such as by screws, bolts, weld or bonding. The flange member is configured to effectively encircle the opening <b>30</b> and provide a secure, fixed mounting base for receiving and securing the tower assembly <b>12</b>, yet to be described in detail, in upstanding position on the grease trap assembly extending vertically from the top wall or lid thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the particular embodiment illustrated herein, releasable latch-type lock members <b>34</b> mounted on the tower assembly <b>12</b> are provided to releasably engage corresponding catches <b>36</b> secured on the mounting flange member <b>32</b> to positively but releasably secure the tower assembly in upstanding, mounted condition on the top of the trap assembly <b>10</b>. This mounting arrangement also allows for simple and convenient removal of the tower skimmer apparatus if desired for inspection, maintenance and repair without requiring entry into or disassembly of the grease trap assembly <b>10</b> itself, as in the case of prior art automated grease removal assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now more specifically to the tower skimmer apparatus of this invention, as clearly seen in viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a vertically elongated, vertically extending tower body housing member <b>38</b> forms a substantially hollow, upstanding body housing enclosure having side walls <b>40</b>, a closed top end wall <b>42</b> and an open bottom end <b>44</b> arranged for registry with the mounting flange <b>32</b> and the opening <b>30</b> provided on the top lid member of the grease trap assembly <b>10</b> previously described. Thus it can be seen that the interior confines of the upstanding hollow tower housing enclosure is in substantially direct communication with the separation area <b>26</b> within the interior confines of the grease trap tank apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The upstanding tower body housing <b>38</b> mounts within its interior a drive motor <b>46</b> (seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and shown schematically in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which may, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, be supported within the interior cavity of the tower by mounting members <b>48</b> arranged to enclose and separate the motor and other electronics of the apparatus from the interior areas of the tower that are exposed to the wastewater, grease and oils, heat, humidity and other injurious elements present within the confines of grease traps as will be evident.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated, the drive shaft <b>50</b> of motor <b>46</b> mounts a first, upper pulley member <b>52</b> for rotation with the drive shaft of the motor. A mount <b>54</b> within the housing is arranged to receive and support one end of a downwardly extending pulley support structure <b>56</b> arranged to extend downwardly through the open bottom end <b>44</b> of the tower housing. When the tower is installed on the top of a grease trap tank, the support <b>56</b> extends through the opening <b>30</b> in the top lid member of the trap assembly and terminates a predetermined spaced distance below the lid member in an opposite end mounting an axle bracket <b>58</b>. The axle bracket rotatably mounts a second, lower submerged pulley <b>60</b> by an axle member <b>62</b>. As is apparent in viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, said predetermined spaced distance that the pulley support member extends below the bottom open end <b>44</b> of the tower assembly is selected and arranged to position the second, lower pulley <b>60</b> in a submerged condition beneath the surface of the wastewater contained within the grease trap tank assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As is readily apparent from the drawings, the opposite, first and second pulleys <b>52</b>, <b>60</b> are configured to receive, support and rotate an endless grease skimmer belt member <b>64</b> formed as a continuous, vertically elongated, vertically extending closed loop when the drive motor <b>46</b> is operating. Preferably, as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, tension means is provided for maintaining the belt member <b>64</b> in a tensioned condition on the opposite pulleys <b>52</b>, <b>60</b> in order to assure proper and continuous driving interengagement between the pulleys and the skimmer belt member.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the particular embodiment shown therein, and seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, tension means is provided by forming the pulley support member <b>56</b> as a telescopically extensible assembly comprising an inner leg member <b>66</b> slidingly carried within the hollow confines of an outer tube member <b>68</b>, a tension spring <b>70</b> interengaging the inner and outer members, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to continuously urge the inner leg member <b>66</b> in its extension direction, thereby maintaining the belt <b>64</b> in a tensioned condition on the opposite pulleys. It is to be understood that in the particular embodiment of the invention illustrated herein, the apparatus is arranged herein to provide a clockwise direction of rotation of the pulleys and belt <b>64</b> carried thereon as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to the skimmer belt <b>64</b>, although it can be formed of a variety of various flexible materials such as selected synthetic thermoplatic resins, plastic, vinyl, rubber, metals and even selected fabric materials, it has been found that a preferred skimmer belt construction is formed as an endless belt or strap of selected flexible polyurethane material having a belt width of approximately one inch. This particular belt material is preferred for its strength, durability, resistance to wear and corrosion, flexibility, ability to be tensioned without stretching, its surface for effective cleaning contact by wiper blades, and because grease and oils have a strong affinity for attaching to the surface of this material, making for effective skimming operation as will become clear. Another preferred belt material is stainless steel. It is to be understood that in larger size trap assemblies with higher volume skimming requirements, the width of the belt may be increased as needed or desired, and accordingly large scale arrangements may utilize belts having a width of five to six inches or more.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As also seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, a belt cleaning and grease discharge chute assembly <b>72</b> is supported in a vertically elevated, downwardly angularly tilted position in the tower apparatus and arranged for cleaning the belt of clinging grease and oil <b>28</b>′ collected from the surface of the waste water in the grease trap during rotation of the belt during operation of the invention. In this regard, the chute assembly illustrated includes a support base <b>74</b> fixedly mounted in the interior of the tower body housing adjacent the upper pulley member <b>52</b> and arranged for passage of a course of the belt loop therethrough as evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A discharge chute member <b>76</b> is preferably removably secured to and supported by the support base member <b>74</b>, as by releasably interengaging slot <b>78</b> and tab <b>78</b>′ arrangement shown, the chute disposed thereon in an angularly downwardly tilted condition. The discharge chute <b>76</b> is, as shown, arranged with wiper blade mounts positioned on opposite sides of the belt passing therebetween and, in the embodiment shown, through corresponding openings through the support base <b>74</b> and chute <b>76</b>. As seen, each of the wiper blade mounts illustrated herein comprises a blade support member arranged to retain and support a corresponding wiper blade member <b>80</b> secured thereto, as by screws <b>82</b>, each blade member supported in a angularly upstanding condition with its upper, wiper edge maintained in frictional, wiping engagement with the corresponding side surface of the belt <b>64</b> as clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>. The wiper blades are preferably formed of a selected synthetic thermoplastic resin, although they may alternatively be formed of metal, rubber and other suitable materials as well.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The downwardly angled discharge chute <b>76</b> communicating with the wiper blades <b>80</b> is arranged to, with the help of gravity, carry and direct grease and oil downwardly from the wiper blades and along the chute to the exterior of the tower housing assembly for discharge into an external collection vessel <b>84</b> removably supported on the tower. Preferably the discharge chute <b>76</b> and collection vessel <b>84</b> are supported by the tower body housing for disposition of the collection vessel on, or supported in a position vertically over the top lid member <b>18</b> of the underlying trap assembly <b>10</b> so that the only floor space that is required of the entire apparatus is the floor space occupied by the grease trap tank assembly <b>10</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred form, and as seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>5</b>, the collection vessel is mounted, as by odor-sealing mounting member <b>86</b> to a removable tower housing access door member <b>88</b> which, when removed, allows facilitated access to the interior confines of the tower for periodic inspection and maintenance and replacement of the belt, wiper blades, pulleys and parts contained therein. As shown, the door member may be releasably secured on the tower by latch-type lock members <b>90</b> on the tower releasably engaging corresponding catches <b>92</b> similar to those described earlier in connection with lock members <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. Obviously, other suitable forms of releasable lock means may be provided as an alternative if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The quick release type of lock member such as those shown is preferred however to facilitate easy removal of the door panel from the tower when the discharge container is being supported by the door panel, as shown, in order to expedite the separation and replacement of the container on the tower assembly when the container needs to be emptied. Interengaging support hooks <b>94</b> on the tower may be provided to cooperate with corresponding openings <b>96</b> on the door panel for removably supporting the weight of the door panel and container as will be readily apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A removable container lid member <b>98</b> is provided to releasably close the interior of the container to prevent spillage and the escape of odors, and to facilitate emptying of the container as is also readily apparent. Thus mounted on the assembly, the interconnected interior confines of the collection vessel, the tower, and the grease trap tank assembly are substantially sealed from the exterior environment, thereby preventing the escape of odors from the interior confines of the grease trap apparatus, tower and collection vessel to the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With the motor <b>46</b> connected to a source of power (not shown) and operating, the skimmer belt member <b>64</b> is revolved by its support on the first, upper, drive pulley <b>52</b> and the submerged second, lower pulley <b>60</b> in a clockwise direction of rotational movement (in this particular embodiment as viewed best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>). As is evident in viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the rotating belt member collects or skims grease and oil <b>28</b>′ from the surface of the waste water contained in the collection area <b>26</b> of the grease trap and carries the skimmed grease and oils clinging to the belt vertically upward out of the interior confines of the grease trap tank and into the confines of the tower and over the upper drive pulley <b>52</b>. The wiper blades <b>80</b> frictionally engage the opposite side surfaces of the belt member <b>64</b> as shown, and effectively wipe the respective surfaces of the moving belt clean of grease and oils, and direct the grease and oils downwardly along the wiper blades to the elevated receiving end of the downwardly sloping discharge chute <b>76</b>, whereupon the grease and oil flows, assisted by the influence of gravity, down the inclined chute and out of its vertically lower discharge end and into the interior confines of the container where the skimmed grease and oil is allowed to collect. Periodically as needed, the container assembly is simply removed and the contents discarded according to normal procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The operation of the motor may be manually activated, as by a simple on/off power switch (not shown). Alternatively a motor controller <b>100</b>, such as a timer, may be provided to automatically and selectively operate the motor on a timed schedule or cycle that may be set as needed for the particular kitchen situation as is determined by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates that the second, lower, submerged pulley assembly previously described may if desired also include an elongated axle member <b>62</b>′ arranged for rotation with the belt pulley <b>60</b>, the elongated axle member adapted to mount an impeller member or propeller <b>102</b> configured to create a gentle, underwater drawing current when the skimmer belt is rotating to draw floating grease and oil toward the area of the vertically upward moving skimmer belt member and into contact therewith. Other means for inducing such current flow may of course be alternatively provided as desired or needed for the purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, as those skilled in grease trap apparatus are aware, it may be desirable or necessary that the water temperature in the trap may need to be raised in order to assure against congealing of the grease on the top surface of the water, as may occur in cases of low output of wastewater and use of lower temperature water in facility sinks, etc. In this regard, the tower housing may also include a heating element (not shown) arranged to extend downwardly through the opening and into the wastewater held within the trap. The heating element would be controlled for operation in accordance with the operation of the skimmer belt assembly and arranged to heat the wastewater to a temperature of approximately 110° F.-120° F. for maintaining greases and oils in a liquid state and for efficient skimming operation of the belt, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates that the tower type skimmer apparatus of this invention may alternatively be provided as an integral element of the top wall or top lid member <b>104</b> of a grease trap tank apparatus <b>10</b>, or provided as the lid member of a complete, original manufacture of a tower type skimmer grease trap apparatus. Alternatively, in the case of a retrofit upgrade of an already existing grease trap apparatus, this arrangement may be employed to provide an alternative to the requirement of providing an opening <b>30</b> through the existing lid member of the grease trap.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">From the foregoing it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes other than those already described may be made in the size, shape, type, number and arrangement of parts described hereinbefore without departing from the spirit of this invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
