<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a multi-function peripheral with a single sheet-feeding mechanism, and more particularly to a multi-function peripheral having a single sheet-feeding mechanism to perform the scan and print operations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A multi-function peripheral (MFP) available in the current market has combined the scan and print functions. A sheet-feeding mechanism for feeding a to-be-scanned document is utilized in a sheet-fed scanning mode such that a scan module scans the to-be-scanned document. Another sheet-feeding mechanism for feeding a to-be-printed sheet is utilized in a printing mode such that a print module can print data on the to-be-printed sheet. That is, the scan module and the print module individually utilize different sheet-feeding mechanisms or different sheet-feeding principles to feed the document and sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, the conventional multi-function peripheral needs two sheet-feeding mechanisms. So, the resource, cost and space are wasted, and the system integration becomes more complicated accordingly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a multi-function peripheral with a single sheet-feeding mechanism to perform the scan and print operations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above-mentioned object, the invention provides a multi-function peripheral including a first scan module, a print module and a sheet-feeding mechanism. The first scan module scans a front side of a to-be-scanned document. The print module prints data on a to-be-printed sheet. The sheet-feeding mechanism feeds the to-be-scanned document and the to-be-printed sheet and moves the to-be-scanned document and the to-be-printed sheet along a sheet feeding path and across the first scan module and the print module.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Replacing two independent sheet-feeding mechanisms of the prior art with one single sheet-feeding mechanism to perform the scan and print operations can decrease the manufacturing cost, save the occupied space, and facilitate the miniaturization of the multi-function peripheral.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration showing a multi-function peripheral according to a first embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multi-function peripheral <b>1</b> of this embodiment includes a first scan module <b>10</b>, a print module <b>20</b> and a sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b>. The first scan module <b>10</b> scans a front side PA of a to-be-scanned document P. The print module <b>20</b> prints data on a to-be-printed sheet S. The sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> feeds the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S moves the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S along a sheet feeding path T and across the first scan module <b>10</b> and the print module <b>20</b> for the scan and print operations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this embodiment, the first scan module <b>10</b> is a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) scan module. In another embodiment, the first scan module <b>10</b> is a CIS (Contact Image Sensor) scan module. The first scan module <b>10</b> includes a CCD image sensor <b>11</b>, a lens <b>12</b> and at least one reflecting mirror <b>13</b>. Light rays coming from the to-be-scanned document P are reflected by the at least one reflecting mirror <b>13</b>, focused by the lens <b>12</b>, and then received by the CCD image sensor <b>11</b>. The print module <b>20</b> is an ink-jet print module in this embodiment, and may be a laser print module, a thermal print module or a dot matrix type print module in another embodiment. The sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> includes a sheet input tray <b>31</b>, a sheet output tray <b>32</b>, a sheet feeding passageway <b>38</b> and a plurality of sheet feeding rollers <b>39</b>. The sheet feeding rollers <b>39</b> feed the to-be-scanned document P or the to-be-printed sheet S, which is stored in the sheet input tray <b>31</b>, to a sheet input passageway <b>33</b>. Then, the sheet feeding rollers <b>39</b> feed the document P or the sheet S to the sheet output tray <b>32</b> after the scan or print operation is finished. Alternatively, it is also possible to use at least one sheet feeding component (e.g., a belt in a belt type sheet-feeding mechanism) to advance the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S from the sheet input tray <b>31</b> to the sheet output tray <b>32</b> through the sheet feeding passageway <b>38</b>. Therefore, the sheet input tray <b>31</b> is linked to the sheet output tray <b>32</b> via the sheet feeding passageway <b>38</b>, such that the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S are inputted from the sheet input tray <b>31</b> and outputted to the sheet output tray <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this embodiment, the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S are moved firstly across the first scan module <b>10</b> and then the print module <b>20</b>. In addition, the print module <b>20</b> and the first scan module <b>10</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the sheet feeding path T. That is, the first scan module <b>10</b> is disposed at a lower side of the sheet feeding path T, and the print module <b>20</b> is disposed at an upper side of the sheet feeding path T. In other embodiments, however, the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S are moved firstly across the print module <b>20</b> and then across the first scan module <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the print module <b>20</b> and the first scan module <b>10</b> are disposed on the same side of the sheet feeding path T.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration showing a multi-function peripheral according to a second embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except that the multi-function peripheral <b>1</b> of this embodiment further includes a second scan module <b>40</b> for scanning a back side PB of the to-be-scanned document P. The second scan module <b>40</b> including a CCD image sensor <b>41</b>, a lens <b>42</b> and at least one reflecting mirror <b>43</b> performs the same scan operation as the first scan module <b>10</b>. Thus, the duplex scan effect can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are schematic illustrations showing a multi-function peripheral according to a third embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, this embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except that the sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> of this embodiment moves the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S along different paths so as to prevent the to-be-scanned document P from being tarnished by the laser or thermal print module <b>20</b>. The sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> includes a sheet input passageway <b>33</b>, a print passageway <b>34</b>, a bypass passageway <b>35</b>, a sheet output passageway <b>36</b> and a guiding rod <b>37</b>. The to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S are inputted from the sheet input tray <b>31</b> to the sheet input passageway <b>33</b>. The print passageway <b>34</b> selectively communicates with the sheet input passageway <b>33</b> such that the print module <b>20</b> can print data on the to-be-printed sheet S fed through the print passageway <b>34</b>. The bypass passageway <b>35</b> selectively communicates with the sheet input passageway <b>33</b> such that the to-be-scanned document P may be fed therethrough. The sheet output passageway <b>36</b> communicates with print passageway <b>34</b> and the bypass passageway <b>35</b> so as to output the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S to the sheet output tray <b>32</b>. The guiding rod <b>37</b> is capable of rotating to guide the to-be-scanned document P from the sheet input passageway <b>33</b> to the bypass passageway <b>35</b>, or to guide the to-be-printed sheet S from the sheet input passageway <b>33</b> to the print passageway <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this embodiment, the sheet or document is fed from a lower position to an upper position. So, the sheet input tray <b>31</b> is disposed at a position lower than that of the sheet output tray <b>32</b>, and this configuration is similar to that of the current printer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a scan operation is being performed, the sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> feeds the to-be-scanned document P from the sheet input tray <b>31</b> to the sheet input passageway <b>33</b>, in which the first scan module <b>10</b> scans the to-be-scanned document P. The guiding rod <b>37</b> rotates into a horizontal state such that the document P enters the bypass passageway <b>35</b> from the sheet input passageway <b>33</b>, enters the sheet output passageway <b>36</b> from the bypass passageway <b>35</b>, and finally arrives at the sheet output tray <b>32</b>. In this state, a drum <b>21</b> of the print module <b>20</b> does not contact the document P.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when a print operation is being performed, the sheet-feeding mechanism <b>30</b> feeds the to-be-printed sheet S from the sheet input tray <b>31</b> into the sheet input passageway <b>33</b>, in which the first scan module <b>10</b> does not scan the to-be-printed sheet S. The guiding rod <b>37</b> rotates into a slanting state such that the to-be-printed sheet S enters the print passageway <b>34</b> from the sheet input passageway <b>33</b>, in which the print module <b>20</b> prints data on the to-be-printed sheet S. Then, the sheet S enters the sheet output passageway <b>36</b> from the print passageway <b>34</b> and finally arrives at the sheet output tray <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are schematic illustrations showing a multi-function peripheral according to a fourth embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, this embodiment is similar to the third embodiment except that the sheet input tray <b>31</b> of this embodiment is disposed at a position higher than that of the sheet output tray <b>32</b>. Such a configuration is similar to that of the current scanner. In addition, the multi-function peripheral <b>1</b> of this embodiment further includes a switch <b>50</b>. The user can operate the switch <b>50</b> to control a rotation position of the guiding rod <b>37</b> so as to control feeding paths of the to-be-scanned document P and the to-be-printed sheet S selectively. The switch <b>50</b> may further control the first scan module <b>10</b> and the print module <b>20</b> to perform the scan and print operations, respectively. Alternatively, the switch <b>50</b> can directly control the first scan module <b>10</b> and the print module <b>20</b> to perform the scan and print operations without controlling the rotation position of the guiding rod <b>37</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the scan and print operations from being performed in error. The switch <b>50</b> may also be implemented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention replaces the conventional two sheet-feeding mechanisms with the single sheet-feeding mechanism to perform the scan and print operations, so it is possible to decrease the manufacturing cost, save the space, and facilitate the miniaturization of the multi-function peripheral. In addition, the single sheet-feeding mechanism of the invention simplifies the multi-function peripheral, and the chance of failure or wear possibility can be decreased. Furthermore, because only one sheet input tray and one sheet output tray are provided, the peripheral may be operated in a more human-oriented manner. The switch can be configured such that the scan mode or print mode of the multi-function peripheral can be locked after the user has placed the sheets or documents in order to prevent the peripheral from operating in error.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the invention has been described by way of examples and in terms of preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications.
