<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The reaction product of a monomer comprising phthalazinone and a phenol group, and at least one sulfonated aromatic compound. The monomer comprising phthalazinone and a phenol group is used in a reaction with the sulfonated aromatic compound to produce ionomers with surprising and highly desirable properties. In one embodiment, the inventive ionomer is a sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone), hereinafter referred to as sPPEK. In another embodiment, the inventive ionomer is a sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether sulfone), herein after referred to as sPPES. In another embodiment, the inventive ionomer is other sulfonated aromatic polymeric compounds. The invention further includes the formation of these polymers into membranes and their use for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and in particular for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The inventive polymers may be manufactured in membrane form, and can be dissolved into solution and impregnated into porous substrates to form composite polymer electrolyte membranes with improved properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an ionomer and its use as an electrolyte or electrode component in a fuel cell, and particularly in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solid polymer electrolytes or films have been well known in the art for many years. These polymers are typically characterized by high ionic conductivity, herein defined as greater than 1×10<sup>−6 </sup>S/cm. Such high conductivity values make them valuable where rapid transport of ionic species, for example, protons, is useful, for example in fuel cells. Additionally, it is desirable for such ionically conducting polymers to be made in the form of membranes or thin films. In so doing, the resistance to ionic transport, which is a function of the film thickness, can be reduced. These materials must also function in the temperature range of interest, which can vary from below room temperature up to a large fraction of the melting temperature of the polymer, depending on the application. Additionally, the polymer must be robust mechanically, so that it does not crack, either during installation in a fuel cell, or during use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of ionomers as solid polymer electrolytes in fuel cells is well known, having been developed in the 1960s for the US Gemini space program. Historically, the industry has moved from phenol sulfonic materials, which suffered from poor mechanical and chemical stability; to polystyrene sulfonic acid polymers, which have improved mechanical stability, but still suffer chemical degradation; to poly(trifluoro-styrene)sulfonic acid, which has improved chemical stability, but poor mechanical stability; to perfluorinated sulfonic acid materials (commercially available as NAFION® membranes), which has improved mechanical and chemical stability [e.g., see A. J. Appleby and F. R. Foulkes, <i>Fuel Cell Handbook</i>, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1989; Table 10-1, pg. 268].</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The perfluorinated sulfonic acid materials, for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat Nos. 3,282,875, 4,358,545 and 4,940,525, are still far from ideal ionomers. These materials must be hydrated to conduct protons at an acceptable rate. As a result, in dry conditions or at temperatures above 100 degrees C., they work poorly in hydrogen-oxygen or hydrogen-air fuel cells. Furthermore, these fluoropolymer ionomers are expensive to produce because of the inherently high cost of the fluorinated monomers required for their preparation. Finally, as more fully described below, they tend to have a high permeability to methanol, and therefore are inefficient electrolytes for use in direct methanol fuel cells.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These limitations have led to the development of several classes of ionomers that are not substantially fluorinated, but rather are based upon aromatic or linear polymers. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,083,768 a polyelectrolyte membrane is prepared from a preswollen membrane containing an insoluable cross-linked aromatic polymer. Although these membranes have low ionic resistance, the controlled penetration of the functional groups during preparation can make preparation difficult. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,436, 6,025,085 and 6,099,988 the preparation and use of polybenzimidizole membranes as ionomers is disclosed. These polymers are described as particularly suitable for use at temperatures above 100 degrees C. U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,031 discloses a ionomer comprising a sulfonated polyethersulfone that is suitable for use in a fuel cell. Kono et. al. discloses in U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,254 a solid electrolyte having a reduced amount of non-cross-linked monomer that can be rapidly cured through exposure to active radiation and/or heat and has high conductivity. Finally, Wang et. al. have disclosed in WO 0225764 ionomers made by direct polymerization of sulfonated polysulfones or polyimide polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other substantially non-fluorinated ionomers are those in the class of sulfonated Poly(aryl ether ketone)s. It is convenient to prepare sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s by post-sulfonation. However, post-sulfonation results in the placement of the sulfonic acid group ortho to the activated aromatic ether linkage, where the sulfonate groups are relatively easy to hydrolyze. Moreover, only one sulfonic acid per repeat unit can be achieved. To overcome this limitation, a new route was developed to prepare sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone)s with monomer containing sulfonate groups derived from sulfonating the dihalide monomer. Sulfonation of the dihalide monomer, 4,4′-dihalobenzophenone and 4,4′dihalodiphenylsulfone, results in sulfonic acid functionalization on both deactivated phenyl rings ortho to the halogen moiety, which offers them more chemical stability against desulfonation, and allows for two sulfonic acid groups per repeat unit of the resulting polymer. This approach displays other advantages, including being free from any degradation and cross-linking, and the ability to easily control the content of sulfonate groups by adjusting the ratios of the dihalide monomer to the sulfonated dihalide monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to prepare ion exchange membrane for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) with excellent combined physical chemical properties and of low cost, attempts have been made by utilizing sulfonated poly(aromatic ether sulfone) and sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone). These membranes can be made by two methods. One is direct sulfonation of polymers, as reported in Polym. V28, P1009 (1987) wherein direct sulfonation of poly(aromatic ether ketone) to prepare sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone) was reported. This method is straightforward, but decomposition and crosslinking also occurred. The degree of sulfonation is also difficult to control. In addition, the sulfonated group directly attached to bisphenol-A could cause sulfonated group be hydrolyzed and detached from the polymer structure after prolong service at high temperature. Another method is to prepare sulfonated monomers first, followed by polymerization afterwards. Macrom. Chem. Phy., (1997), P1421 (1998) reported this method. First, sulfonated difluoro-benzophenone was obtained by sulfonation of difluoro-benzophenone, then it was mixed with some difluoro-benzophenone and bisphenol-A, followed by a copolymerization into sulfonated poly(aromatic ether ketone). The polymer structure is characterized by the following structure:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="43.52mm" wi="130.30mm" file="US07297429-20071120-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
process does not induce decomposition or crosslinking side reactions and it could control degree of sulfonation. The sulfonic acid groups located on the aromatic ring structure derived from benzophenone are much more stable than the ones on bisphenol-A rings. However, because of the existence of methyl group in the polymer structure, its anti-oxidation property is reduced. Furthermore, as the content of sulfonated group increases, swelling in water becomes very severe.
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Recently, bisphenol A-based and phenolphthalein-based and 4,4′-thiodiphenol-based sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s were prepared by another method. Generally, most homogeneous ionomers have the problem of large swelling degree at compositions where they have reasonable conductivity. So other components are blended with the polymer in order to obtain ionomer membranes with lower swelling.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One issue with many of these polymers is that the ionic conductivity is not as high as desirable. A high ionic conductivity in an ionomer is desirable because the higher the ionic conductivity, the lower the cell resistance when the polymer is used as the electrolyte in a fuel cell. Because lower cell resistance leads to higher fuel cell efficiency, lower resistance (or high conductance) is better. One approach to reducing the resistance of these ionomers is to reduce its thickness, as the resistance is directly proportional to thickness. Unfortunately, these ionomers cannot be made too thin because as they become thinner, they become more susceptible to physical or chemical damage, either during cell assembly or cell operation. One approach to deal with this issue has been disclosed in RE 37,707, RE 37,756 and RE 37,701 where ultra-thin composite membranes comprising expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and an ion exchange material impregnated throughout the membrane are disclosed. Composite ionomer membranes are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,861.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One further complication in the use of ionomers as solid polymer electrolytes in fuel cells is the need for the electrolyte to act as an impermeable barrier to the fuel. Should the fuel permeate through the electrolyte it reduces cell efficiency because the fuel that permeates through the electrolyte is either swept away into the outlet gas stream or chemically reacts on the oxidant side, giving rise to a mixed potential electrode. In either case, the fuel is not used for producing electricity. Furthermore, the fuel that permeates through the electrolyte may also poison the catalyst on the oxidizing side, further reducing the cell efficiency. This issue, called fuel crossover, is a particular problem when methanol is the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Methanol crossover rates tend to be high in many solid polymer electrolytes because the methanol absorbs and permeates in the polymer in much the same way that water molecules do. Since many solid polymer electrolytes transport water easily, they also tend to transport methanol easily. One approach to reducing methanol crossover is to simply use thicker membranes because the methanol transport resistance (as defined below) increases with increasing thickness. This solution has limited utility, though, because as the thickness increases the ionic resistance of the membrane increases as well. Higher ionic resistance in the membrane is detrimental to fuel cell efficiency because it results in higher internal resistance and thus higher (iR) power losses. Therefore, the ideal membrane for direct methanol fuel cells would be one that has both very high methanol transport resistance and at the same time, has low ionic resistance. The combination of these two characteristics would allow the use of thinner membranes, leading to low iR power loss due to membrane resistance, while simultaneously minimizing the effect of methanol crossover.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The use of various polymers has been suggested to circumvent this methanol crossover issue. In WO 96/13872 the use of polybenzimidazole is suggested for direct methanol fuel cells. In WO 98/22989, a polymer electrolyte membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSSA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is reported to have low methanol crossover. In WO 00/77874 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,294 sulfonated polyphosphazene-based polymers are proposed as suitable ionomers for direct methanol fuel cells. Finally, poly(arylene ether sulfone) has been reported to have low methanol permeability [Y. S. Kim, F. Wang, M. Hickner, T. A. Zawodinski, and J. E. McGrath, Abstract No. 182, The Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts, Vol. 2002-1, The Electrochemical Society, Pennington, N.J., 2002]. Despite these attempts, a need still exists for an ionomer with lower methanol crossover rates and acceptably high ionic conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is thus an object of this invention to satisfy the long-felt need for improved ionomers for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane and as an electrode component in fuel cells. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of forming a fuel cell using the inventive polymers. It is a further object of the invention to form a composite solid polymer electrolyte with improved properties comprising the inventive polymers and a support. It is yet another object of the invention to improve performance of a direct methanol fuel cell comprising the inventive polymers. Finally, it is also an object of the new invention to provide a fuel cell wherein the electrode comprises the inventive polymer.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0077">The invention starts with a useful molecular structure, which lead to preparation of sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone)s in one preferred embodiment. In this embodiment, the invention utilizes sulfonated benzophenone and a monomer 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)phthalazinone, which leads to introduction of phthalazinone structure into the polymer. Without being limited by theory, the pPhthalazinone group is believed to have better high-temperature anti-oxidation properties than the bisphenol-A materials of prior art; also, the electron rich conjugated hetero-cyclic nitrogen groups form hydrogen-bonding with sulfonic acid group, which increases crosslinking density of membrane materials, thus reducing swelling in water, which results in improvement of overall combined properties for PEMFC applications.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0078">More specifically, this embodiment of the invention utilizes monomers of sulfonated dihalo(or dinitro)benzophenone, dihalo(or dinitro)benzophenone, and a monomer containing phthalazinone and phenol group to prepare copolymers of the novel sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone)s, characterized in the following structure:</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0092">In one embodiment, the invention comprises the following polymerization procedures: equal molar ratio of (sulfonated benzophenone and benzophenone) to the monomer containing phthalazinone and phenol group, metallic bases or excess 100% of metallic base salts, certain amount of toluene (xylene or chloroform), certain amount of polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, tetramethylene sulfone, phenyl sulfone, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and N,N-dimethylformamide, were charged to a 3-necked bottle. The bottle is equipped with nitrogen gas supply, cooling condenser, and mechanical agitator. Under the protection of nitrogen blanket, the reaction medium was heated to dehydration. The water was removed by azeotropic boiling with azeotropic dehydration agents, heating temperature up to 150-220° C., with 4-32 hours of polymerization time. After natural cooling, the desired reaction product was isolated by repeating the following purification procedure three times: dilution with some solvents, coagulated, filtered, and dried.

This material can be processed into films by dissolution in N, N-dimethylformamide, followed by casting and drying of the wet film. The dried film has very good mechanical properties. The good mechanical properties are characterized by the reference teaching in U.S. Pat. No. 4,320,224. A 0.2-millimeter thick film, made by solvent casting and drying, can be folded at least five times with 180° folding angle. If the folded film has no breaking character, the resin is considered having good mechanical properties. Our invented resin has such good mechanical properties.

<p id="p-0077" num="0102">As disclosed herein, the reaction product of combining a monomer comprising phthalazinone and phenol groups with at least one monomer of a sulfonated aromatic compounds imparts surprising and desirable properties to the resulting product, particularly for use in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. One well skilled in the art will recognize that a wide range of sulfonated aromatic compounds can be used with said phthalazinone monomer to produce desirable products. Comonomers of the unsulfonated versions of these sulfonated monomers may also be present in the reaction. Reactions conditions such as reaction temperatures, dehydration agents and coagulation agents may vary depending on the particular sulfonated aromatic compound, but are readily determined by one skilled in the art from the known properties of the monomer or its unsulfonated cousin.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0103">The polymers disclosed herein can be formed into a membrane <b>10</b> (as shown in the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) using methods well known in the art, including solution casting or dry pressing. The ease with which the polymer dissolves in aprotic dipolar organic solvents such as DMSO makes solution casting the preferable method.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0104">One important parameter used to characterize ionomers is the equivalent weight. Within this application, the equivalent weight (EW) is defined to be the weight of the polymer in acid form required to neutralize one equivalent of NaOH. Higher EW means that there are fewer active ionic species (e.g., protons) present. If it takes more of the polymer to neutralize one equivalent of hydroxyl ions there must be fewer active ionic species within the polymer. Because the ionic conductivity is generally proportional to the number of active ionic species in the polymer, one would therefore like to lower the EW in order to increase conductivity. The polymers disclosed herein can be prepared with a range of EWs between about 300 and greater than 4000, with preferable EW in the range of 400 to 1500. As is well known in the art, by varying the concentration of the reactants, different equivalent weight products can be formed. For example, in the exemplary embodiment where the sPPEK polymer is produced, Table 1 shows the concentrations of 4.4′-dihalo(or dinitro)-3,3′-disulfonate salt of benzophenone [Monomer 2 in Table 1] and dihalo(or dinitro)phenyl benzophenone [Monomer 1 in Table 1] one would use to produce various EW polymers using the procedures disclosed herein. In Table 1 a fixed concentration of phthalazinone monomer of 10 moles would be used.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0106">It has also been discovered by the inventors that the inventive polymers disclosed herein can be incorporated into various components of fuel cells to form highly desirable products. For example, the inventive polymers can be used as the solid polymer electrolytes in hydrogen-air or in a direct methanol fuel cell. Furthermore, they can be incorporated into a porous polymer substrate material to form thin, strong membranes as shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where substrate <b>20</b> and ionomer <b>21</b> form a composite membrane <b>22</b>. Substrates <b>20</b> can include, but are not limited to porous polyolefins, including polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene. Polytetrafluoroethylene is a particularly desirable porous substrate because of its chemical inertness and high melting temperature. Various methods of forming porous polytetrafluoroethylene are known in the art. One particularly preferable porous polymer substrate is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,953,566, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Using the methods disclosed by Bahar et. al. in U.S. Pat. Nos. RE 37,707, RE 37,756 and RE 37,701, all incorporated by reference in their entirety, a composite solid polymer electrolyte with highly desirable properties can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0107">Additionally, the incorporation of the inventive ionomer within the anode and cathode electrode structures is desirable. It offers the potential for improved cell performance, both in power density and methanol crossover barrier characteristics (with concomitant improvement in voltage and fuel efficiencies) in direct methanol fuel cells.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0108">Fuel cell electrodes comprising the inventive polymers could be inking based, typically prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of the ionomer with catalyst and solvents, producing a slurry or ink. This ink can then be applied directly onto a membrane or onto decal substrates that can transfer the catalyst layer onto the membrane via standard hot pressing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0109">Fuel cell electrodes containing the above ionomer can also be prepared using PTFE-bonded catalyzed gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architectures, in which the methanol transport resistant ionomer is used to impregnate (using brushing, casting, spraying, etc.) the PTFE-catalyst structure. Anodes and cathodes prepared using this ionomer are expected to improve the methanol crossover barrier characteristics of the MEA as well as the electrodic performance of the cell (when compared to NAFION® impregnated electrodes).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0110">Additionally, methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes can also be prepared with the ionomers. Such electrodes can increase the cell performance and voltage efficiency in a DMFC cell as the crossed-over methanol would not adversely affect the oxygen reduction activity of the air electrode. The high methanol permeation resistance of this polymer makes it suitable and advantageous for its selective incorporation as electrode ionomer for DMFC cathode thus yielding an air electrode with methanol tolerant/insensitive characteristics. When the ionomers used in this patent are present in high enough ionomer/metal ratios to effectively block/cover the Pt catalyst, then it is expected that the cathode cell will exhibit large methanol insensitivity due to the high methanol permeation resistance of this polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0111">Methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes can be prepared by pre-treating the electrocatalyst prior to electrode/ink making with a solution of the above polymer. The pre-treatment could consist of effective mixing and contacting of the ionomer solution and the catalyst phases and posterior evaporation of the solvent, thus resulting in a Pt catalyst phase effectively covered with a “skin” of the methanol permeation resistant ionomer. This pre-treated catalyst can be used to make cathode electrodes of diverse architectures using methods known in the art, including inking, gas diffusion electrodes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0112">Another approach to prepare methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes would consist on preparing an ink with the above ionomer, solvent and catalyst but using high ionomer/metal ratio. The resulting dry-ink electrode would have the Pt phase effectively “blocked” by the methanol permeation resistant ionomer.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0113">Finally a methanol tolerant/insensitive cathodes with PTFE-bonded catalyzed GDE architecture can be prepared by dipping the GDE into a solution of the above ionomer. The ionomer will then totally impregnate and saturate the structure thus totally and effectively covering the Pt phase.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0118">A membrane sample about 2 inches by about 3 inches in size was first equilibrated at room conditions of 21 degrees C., 55% RH for 24 hrs. It was then immersed into a plastic beaker containing room temperature deionized water. Two measurements were taken over a 2 hours time period: the first one after 30 minutes and the second one at 2 hours. To take the measurements the membrane sample was taken out of the water and patted dry by paper tissues. The thickness was then measured immediately using an MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display. The gauge was mounted vertically over a flat plate, and measurements were made at eight different locations on the sample, covering the corners and center of the sample. The spring-loaded probe of the gauge was lowered gently on the film for each measurement to minimize compression. The mean of the eight values was used as the sample thickness. The ionic resistance of the membrane <b>10</b> was then measured using a four-point probe conductivity cell shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The sensing probes <b>55</b> of conductivity cell <b>50</b> are approximately one inch long, and approximately one inch apart. A plexiglass spacer <b>51</b> provides insulation between the current probes <b>54</b> and sensing probes <b>55</b>. The cell is held together with nylon screws <b>52</b> and electrical contact is made to the probes through holes <b>53</b>. During the measurement, a 900 g weight (not shown) was loaded onto the cell to ensure good contact. It was found that the resistance value is independent of further pressure onto conductivity cell <b>50</b>. The resistance was measured by connecting leads (not shown) through holes <b>53</b> using 10 mV AC amplitude at 1000 Hz frequency applied by a Solartron SI 1280B controlled by ZPlot software written by Scribner Associates. Measurements were taken in the potentiostatic mode. Under these conditions, the phase angle was found to be insignificant throughout the measurement.

Methanol Transport Resistance
</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0121">A methanol permeation apparatus was used to evaluate the methanol transport resistance characteristics of the solid polymer electrolytes.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0122">Membrane samples to be tested were soaked in DI water for a minimum of 10 minutes prior to testing. The soaking step allowed the membranes to equilibrate in water and to pre-swell before being assembled in the testing fixture. A 5-cm×7-cm membrane piece was then cut to fit the testing fixture, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The membrane sample <b>61</b> was mounted between two pre-cut 1-mil polyethylenenapthalene (PEN) gaskets <b>62</b>. The gaskets were cut in order to leave an opened window of 3-cm×3.5-cm corresponding to a testing area of 10.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. The wet membrane thickness of the testing area was immediately measured with a Mitutoyo snap gauge (Model #7301). Measurements were made at six different locations and the mean of the six values was used as the sample wet thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0123">The membrane-gasket assembly was then placed into the testing fixture <b>67</b> with the opened window towards the outlet end of the cell. A 2M methanol feed solution was introduced into the testing fixture in inlet channel <b>63</b> at a flow rate of 5 ml/min while DI water was introduced into the testing fixture in inlet channel <b>65</b> at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The testing fixture was tilted a few times to assure that no air bubbles were trapped into the flow channels and was then placed tilted, outlet end up, in a water bath set at 60 degrees C. Both the methanol feed solution and the water flush were fed through the testing fixture for a minimum of an hour to allow equilibration and to reach a steady state permeation rate of methanol through the tested samples. During this 1 hour of equilibration time, the methanol solution exited the testing fixture through outlet channel <b>64</b> while the water flush exited the testing fixture through outlet channel <b>66</b>. Both methanol and water effluents were discarded during the equilibration time.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0124">After one hour, the water effluent or water permeate <b>66</b> was then sampled 4 times at intervals of 5 minutes. Each sample was collected into a 5 ml vial and analyzed for methanol concentration by a Perkin Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph.</p>

Each water permeate sample was also sampled twice and the measured methanol peak area was converted into PPM of methanol by using the calibration curve. The methanol feed concentration was also verified by GC after dilution 40-fold.</p>

The slow scan rate was used to assure a steady-state current measurement. The cell was held at 60 degrees C. with anode flowing 2.5 ml/min of 1.0 M CH<sub>3</sub>OH solution and cathode flowing 50 sccm of N<sub>2 </sub>saturated at 65 degrees C. The heat trace lines to the cell were held at 75/70 degrees C. for anode and cathode, respectively. At least three scans were conducted to average a characteristic methanol crossover limiting current, each scan conducted ca. 15 minutes apart to guarantee stabilization of the cell prior every measurement. The methanol crossover was calculated as described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Preparation of MEAs</heading>
<p id="p-0124" num="0159">In order to assess the inventive solid polymer electrolyte under fuel cell conditions, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared for both the inventive solid polymer electrolyte in acid form of Example 3 and two comparative examples, acid form of NAFION® membrane 117 (Comparative Example A) and acid form of NAFION® membrane 112 (Comparative Example B) available from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours Corporation. The two comparative examples are commercial materials of perfluorosulfonic acid solid polymer electrolytes, where the equivalent weight is 1100. The two materials differ only in thickness, with NAFION® membrane 117 having a nominal thickness of 7 mils or 175 microns (actual thickness, 179 microns as measured using an MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Illinois) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display), and NAFION® membrane 112 having a nominal thickness of 2 mils or 50 microns (actual thickness 46 microns). The inventive polymer had a measured thickness of 36 microns, when dry, as determined using an MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0160">To prepare MEAs from the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the comparative examples, electrodes were prepared first. The same anode and cathode was used for both the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the comparative examples. Standard commercial electrodes impregnated with NAFION® 1100 EW ionomer solution were used. The procedure for the electrode preparation was as follows. The anode was a commercial gas diffusion electrode (GDE) purchased from E-Tek Inc. The GDE contained 4.0 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>unsupported Pt RuOx (Pt:Ru=1:1) and 10% PTFE in the catalyst layer and was applied onto non-wetproofed carbon paper gas diffusion media (EFCG/TGPH-060). The cathode was a commercial gas diffusion electrode (GDE) purchased from E-Tek Inc. The GDE contained 4.0 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>Pt black and 20% PTFE in the catalyst layer and was applied onto single sided ELAT gas diffusion media.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0161">The electrodes were die-cut in 5 cm<sup>2 </sup>squares (correspondent to the MEA active surface area) and were individually impregnated with Nafion solution (1100 EW) prior to MEA preparation. The anode and cathode ionomer impregnation levels were selected to be ca. 0.7 mg dry ionomer/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0.3 mg dry ionomer/cm<sup>2 </sup>for the anode and cathode, respectively, following a ratio of metal catalyst-to-ionomer in the anode and cathode of 5.7 and 13.3. The impregnation ionomer solution was prepared from a master Nafion (1100 EW) solution 22% solids (E. I. Du Pont de Nemours Corporation) which was diluted at a ratio of 1:4 with 50% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH—H<sub>2</sub>O solution. The diluted Nafion solution was then uniformly brushed on the surface of the GDE, dried using a heat gun, and weighted. This process was repeated until the desired target ionomer loading was achieved. The process typically took 2 to 3 passes to achieve the target ionomer loading.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0162">Using the electrodes so prepared, an MEA was prepared for the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the two comparatives by standard hot pressing of the ionomer-impregnated GDEs to the electrolyte membrane. Pressing conditions were adjusted to achieve good bonding to the solid polymer electrolyte. The electrode/membrane/electrode elements were placed between two pieces of Kapton tape and hot pressed in a manual press (PHI, model Q230H, with heated platens). For the comparative examples, pressing conditions were 12 tons load, 320° F. (both platens heated) and 3 minutes pressing time. For the inventive example, 12 tons load, 200° F. (both platens heated) and 3 minutes pressing time was used.</p>

<p id="p-0128" num="0163">Fuel cells using the two MEAs having the comparative examples as solid polymer electrolytes, and the one MEA using the inventive solid polymer electrolyte were assembled using the following procedure. The MEA of Example 4 (5 cm<sup>2 </sup>active surface area) was loaded in a standard fuel cell testing fixture (5 cm<sup>2</sup>, single channel serpentine flow field, 8 bolts made by Fuel Cell Technologies, Alburquerque N.Mex.). The bolts were lubricated with Krytox lube (Du Pont) prior to assembly. The MEA was assembled using commercial 7 mils silicon-impregnated glass cloth (Tate Engineering, Aston, Mich.) gasket for the anode and 10 mils gasket for the cathode. All gaskets had a 5 cm<sup>2 </sup>window and covered the entire graphite plate of the fuel cell fixture and membrane border of the MEA, typically 3 in×3 in. The assembly was conducted without alignment pins in order to avoid gas leakage between plates. No additional gas diffusion media was added. Upon alignment of the elements and assembly the fixture was then torqued down to 45 lb-in/bolt compression following 5 lb-in increments in a star configuration for the 8 bolts. A torque-wrench (with maximum torque of 75 lb-in) was used to torque the cell to the desired load. Finally the cell was also checked for electrical shorts between the current collector and compression plates prior to applying load at the fuel cell station.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0165">A 3% solids dimethyl sulfoxide solution using the solid polymer electrolyte membrane of Example 3 was prepared. An ionomer solution of the polymer was produced by dissolving a membrane in appropriate solvents. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was found to be a good solvent for solution preparation. The ionomer membrane of Example 3 was first ion exchanged to the sodium form by neutralization with a 0.5N sodium hydroxide solution. The membrane was allowed to dry at room temperature for a minimum of 4 hours. 8.9 g of methyl sulfoxide was poured into a flask. The solvent was agitated by a magnetic stirrer and the flask was kept under dry nitrogen. 0.3 g of membrane was then added to the flask to prepare a 3% solids solution in DMSO. The content of the flask was heated to 90 degrees C. for about 30 minutes for complete dissolution of the membrane. The resulting ionomer solution, contained 3% solids.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0166">This solution was then used to impregnate the 5 cm<sup>2 </sup>GDEs resulting in prototype anodes and cathodes.

The ePTFE was fixed in a 4-in embroidery hoop. The ionomer solution was painted on both sides of the ePTFE support and then dried with a hair drier to remove the solvents. The painting and drying steps were repeated 4 more times. The ePTFE and the embroidery hoop were then placed into a solvent oven set at 190° C. for 10 minutes to completely remove all solvent traces.

<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Characterization of Examples and Comparative Examples</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0172">To characterize the utility of the inventive polymer when used as a solid polymer electrolyte, the assembled fuel cell fixture of Example 4A was connected to a fuel cell testing plant for cell diagnostics. The fuel cell testing plant consisted of an electronic load, a gas control unit, methanol injection setup and ancillary equipment (condenser, gas line heat tracing, etc.) The electronic load was a Scribner &amp; Assoc. (VA) 10 A model 890B-100 and was used for fuel cell mode H<sub>2</sub>/air and methanol/air polarization analysis. The electronic load box also contained standard temperature controllers for the cell and the reactant humidifiers. The load interfaced with a PC running Scribner &amp; Assoc. fuel cell software (version 3.1a) for data acquisition and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0173">The basic gas unit was made by Globetech (TX) and after “in house” modifications consisted of 3 liter reactant humidifier bottles for H<sub>2 </sub>and air, both with independent temperature control. The station also had mass flow controllers and back-pressure regulators for the gaseous reactants. The gas feeds could also be delivered humidified or dry to the cell via a 3 way valve manifold. The cell is connected to this gas unit with its feeds heat traced and temperature controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0174">The methanol injection was done via a secondary manifold to the anode cell feed. The apparatus consists of a methanol solution reservoir (1 liter 3-head Pyrex flask) in which a N<sub>2 </sub>blanket was continuously bubbled, a 2-syringe injection-withdrawn pump (Kd Scientific, model 210 C) with flow control, and a 100 cc accumulation volume (to avoid flow fluctuations) placed in the injection manifold right before the cell. The injection setup could be isolated from the cell via an array of on/off valves that allowed the switching from H<sub>2 </sub>to methanol solution as the anode fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0175">Once the fuel cell fixture was hooked up to the test station, the cell temperature was then set to 60 degrees C., the anode and cathode bottles were set to 70 degrees C. and 65 degrees C., respectively. The back-pressure was kept at 0 psig on both sides, and the heat-traces on the gas lines were set to 75 and 70 degrees C. for anode and cathode respectively. The hydrogen fuel was then supplied to the anode at a flow rate of 100 ml/min and the air was supplied at the cathode at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. Once the cell temperature had reached the set value, the cell was allowed to condition for a minimum of 6 hours. During this conditioning time, the cell potential was potentiostatically cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V, and 0.8V in 0.2V potential step increments. As is generally practiced in the art, voltages are versus the hydrogen dynamic electrode, i.e., flowing hydrogen gas at the anode with no separate reference electrode used. The cell was maintained at each step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. At the end of the fuel cell potential cycling, the anode reactant and cathode reactant minimum flow rates were dropped to 20 ml/min and 40 ml/min, respectively, to allow for flow to track the load (i.e., stoichiometric control). The cell was then operated under constant stoichiometry using 1.2× stoichiometry on the anode, and at 2.5× stoichiometry on the cathode. Stoichiometric flow is defined as gas flow at any given current density such that the gas would be completely consumed in the fuel cell reaction. The fuel cell was again cycled at least twice between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to reach steady state under stoichiometric control mode. Finally, a polarization curve was obtained by recording the steady state current after 5 to 10 minutes following sequential voltages. The step increment was 0.1 V for the comparative examples, and 0.05V for the inventive example. The polarization curve was started from 0.6V and potential steps were first taken towards lower voltages; then the cell was taken back to 0.6V to equilibrate and the potential steps were taken towards open circuit voltage. The open circuit voltage (OCV) is defined as the maximum voltage obtained from the trace of OCV versus time after the load is removed from the cell. Additionally, at each potential the cell resistance was measured by using a standard current interrupt technique available through the Scribner Version 3.1a (Firmware Version 1.43) software used to control the system.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0176">Once the polarization curve was completed, the fuel cell was shutdown for the night and the cell, humidification bottles and heat trace temperatures were dropped down to room temperature. The fuel cell was re-started the next day according to the same start-up protocol described above. The cell potential was again cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to condition the fuel cell. If the cell performance was comparable to that of the first day, a second polarization curve was recorded to confirm the performance. If the cell performance was better on the second day than the first day, then the cell was cycled for a minimum of four more hours and a polarization curve was obtained at the end of this conditioning period. The polarization curves obtained on the second day were used for MEA comparison and are reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0177">The fuel cell was then switched from hydrogen/air mode to methanol/air mode (direct methanol fuel cell or DMFC mode). The anode side of the fuel cell was first flushed with nitrogen and then a 1M-methanol solution was pumped at 1 ml/min to the anode side using a Kd Scientific injection-withdrawn pump. The cathode was switched to dry air and set at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The fuel cell was cycled between 0.3V, 0.1V and 0.6 V in 0.3 V potential steps to condition the MEA. The fuel cell was maintained at each potential step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. After cycling the cell in DMFC mode for a minimum of 3 hours, a DMFC polarization curve was recorded in a similar fashion as reported before. In this case, the polarization curve was started from 0.3 V and the potential was first lower to 0V in 0.05 V step increments; then the cell was taken back to 0.3V and the potential was increased to open circuit voltage, in 0.05 V step increment. The OCV was measured as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0178">The polarization results of the tests for hydrogen-air and methanol-air are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6 and 7</figref> respectively. In hydrogen-air (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), above ˜0.75 V, the inventive polymer had fuel performance comparable to the comparative examples, while at lower voltages, its fuel performance is between the two comparative examples, a surprisingly good result for a non-fluorinated polymer, particularly given the thickness of the membrane. In methanol-air (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the performance of the inventive solid polymer electrolyte is superior to both comparative examples at all potentials. At 0.3V, the current density of the MEA prepared with the inventive polymer is 80 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>while the current density of the NAFION 112 and the NAFION 117 based MEAs are 50 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 61 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively: a 60% and 31% performance improvement over NAFION® 112 and NAFION® 117 MEAs, respectively. Also, the measured open circuit potential of 0.704 V for the inventive solid polymer electrolyte of Example 3 is higher than either comparative example A, 0.683 V, or Comparative Example B, 0.645, indicative of improved performance.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0179">The results of an electrochemical methanol crossover measurement (Table 2) indicate that the inventive solid polymer electrolyte has lower electrochemical methanol crossover than either Comparative Example A or B. This result is particularly surprising in that the inventive solid polymer electrolyte is about five times thinner than Comparative Example A and still has lower crossover.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0181">In order to assess the inventive solid polymer electrolyte under fuel cell conditions, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared for both the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and a comparative example, NAFION® 115 membrane (Comparative Example X). The comparative example is a commercial material of perfluorosulfonic acid solid polymer electrolyte, where the equivalent weight is 1100 and the nominal thickness is 5 mils (actual thickness 127 microns measured using a MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display). The inventive polymer had a measured thickness of 124 microns, when dry, as determined using a MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display.</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">Electrodes Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0182">The performance characterization of the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the comparative example was done using electrodes developed at Gore. The same anode and cathode was used for both the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0183">The procedure for the electrode preparation was as follows. For the cathode electrode, an ink was prepared by mixing 5.375 g of platinum black (purchased from Alfa Aesar, metal surface area (MSA) of 27 m<sup>2</sup>/g) with 8.333 g of a 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose in water solution (purchased from Sigma Chemical), 16.4 g of HPLC grade ethanol (purchased from Fisher Scientific), 0.195 g of di-ionized water, and 4.698 g of 22% (by weight) NAFION 1100EW in ethanol/water solution (purchased from DuPont). All raw materials were combined in the order listed above and then mixed in a Silverson RotorStator (model L4R) apparatus for one hour. The mix was allowed to rest overnight and then mixed for an additional 40 minutes the next day (on the Silverson RotorStator). The so-prepared ink was then coated on a double-sided Elat GDM sheet (purchased from Etek) on the “glossy” side using a 5-inch Adjustable Micron Film Applicator (Gardco part APMO5) bar set at 6.5 mils height. The coating layer was then drier with a hair dryer for approximately 3 minutes). The targeted catalyst loading was 4 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the targeted NAFION 1100 loading was 0.8 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0184">For the anode electrode, an ink was prepared by mixing 5.39 g of platinum/ruthenium black ratio with 1:1 Pt/Ru atomic ration (purchased from Alfa Aesar) with 16.47 g of di-ionized water, 8.31 g of a 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose in water solution (purchased from Sigma Chemical) and 4.82 g of a 22% (by weight) NAFION 1100EW in ethanol/water solution. All raw materials were combined in the order listed above and mixed in the Silverson RotorStator (Model L4R) apparatus for 30 minutes. The so-prepared ink was coated on Plain (non-hydrophobized) Toray TGPH60 paper (purchased from Etek) using a 5-inch Adjustable Micron Film (Gardco part APMO5) bar set at 16 mils height. The coated ink layer was dried with a hair dryer for approximately 3 minutes. The targeted catalyst loading was 4 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the targeted NAFION 1100 loading was 0.8 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Membrane Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0185">A SPPEK solid polymer electrolyte was prepared as described in Example 3 above.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0186">A membrane was prepared by casting a 14% solution in DMSO on a glass plate in a dust free environment. The membrane was left drying at room temperature overnight and then placed in a vacuum oven set a 120° C. After about 3.5 hours at 120° C., the oven was placed under vacuum. After about 2 hours, the vacuum was turned off and the temperature dropped to allow the film to cool down. The resulting membrane was then ion-exchanged to the acid form. The EW of the polymer as calculated from the constituents was 600 while the EW measured experimentally using the procedure described above was 645.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">MEA Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0187">The electrodes were die-cut in 5 cm<sup>2 </sup>squares. An MEA was prepared for the inventive solid polymer electrolyte and the comparative sample by hot pressing the electrodes to the electrolyte membrane. The electrode/membrane/electrode elements, sandwiched in between two pieces of Kapton tape, were placed in between two stainless steel plates and hot pressed in a manual press (PHI, model Q230H, with heated platens). Pressing conditions were adjusted to achieve good bonding to the solid polymer electrolyte. These conditions were 12 tons load, 320° F. (both platens heated) and 3 minutes. The plates were then removed from the press and the MEA/Kapton assembly was kept sandwiched in between the plates for two hours to allow cooling of the MEA under moderate pressure.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Cell Set-Up</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0188">The MEA (5-cm<sup>2 </sup>electrode active area) was loaded in a standard fuel cell testing fixture (5 cm<sup>2</sup>, triple channel serpentine flow field, 8 bolts made by Fuel Cell Technologies, Alburquerque N.Mex.). The bolts were lubricated with Krytox lube (Du Pont) prior to assembly. The MEA was assembled using commercial 7 mils silicon-impregnated glass cloth (Tate Engineering Systems, Inc., Baltimore, Md.) gasket for the anode and 5 mils gasket+7 mils gasket for the cathode. All gaskets had a 5-cm<sup>2 </sup>window and covered the entire graphite plate of the fuel cell fixture and membrane border of the MEA, typically 3 in×3 in. The assembly was conducted without alignment pins in order to avoid gas leakage between plates. No additional gas diffusion media was added. Upon alignment of the elements and assembly the fixture was then torqued down to 45 lb-in/bolt compression following 5 lb-in increments in a star configuration for the 8 bolts. A torque-wrench (with maximum torque of 75 lb-in) was used to torque the cell to the desired load. Finally the cell was also checked for electrical shorts between the current collector and compression plates prior to load to the fuel cell station.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">PEMFC/DMFC Fuel Cell Station</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0189">The fuel cell fixture was connected to a fuel cell testing plant for cell diagnostics. The fuel cell testing plant consisted of an electronic load, a gas control unit, methanol injection setup and ancillary equipment (condenser, gas line heat tracing, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0190">The electronic load was a Scribner &amp; Assoc. (VA) 10 A model 890B-100 and was used for fuel cell mode H<sub>2</sub>/air and methanol/air polarization analysis. The electronic load box also contained standard temperature controllers for the cell and the reactant humidifiers. The load interfaced with a PC running Scribner &amp; Assoc. fuel cell software (version 3.1a) for data acquisition and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0191">The basic gas unit was made by Globetech (TX) and after “in house” modifications consisted of 3 liter reactant humidifier bottles for H<sub>2 </sub>and air, both with independent temperature control. The station also had mass flow controllers and backpressure regulators for the gaseous reactants. The gas feeds could also be delivered humidified or dry to the cell via a 3 way valve manifold. The cell is connected to this gas unit with its feeds heat traced and temperature controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0192">The methanol injection was done via a secondary manifold to the anode cell feed. The setup consisted of a methanol solution reservoir (1 liter 3-head Pyrex flask) in which a N<sub>2 </sub>blanket was continuously bubbled, a 2-syringe injection-withdrawn pump (Kd Scientific, model 210 C) with flow control, and a 100 cc accumulation volume (to avoid flow fluctuations) placed in the injection manifold right before the cell. The injection setup could be isolated from the cell via an array on on/off valves that allowed the switching from H<sub>2 </sub>to methanol solution as the anode fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0193">The cell liquid exhaust (methanol and water) for the anode and cathode were collected in condenser units for appropriate disposal and the exhaust gas reconnected to the gas unit for backpressure control.</p>
<heading id="h-0036" level="1">EXAMPLE 10 </heading>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Hydrogen/Air Testing</heading>
<p id="p-0159" num="0194">Once the fuel cell fixture was hooked up to the test station, the cell temperature was then set to 60 degrees C., the anode and cathode bottles were set to 70 degrees C. and 65 degrees C., respectively. The backpressure was kept at 0 psig on both sides, and the heat-traces on the gas lines were set to 75 and 70 degrees C. for anode and cathode respectively. The hydrogen fuel was then supplied to the anode at a flow rate of 100 ml/min and the air was supplied at the cathode at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. Once the cell temperature had reached the set value, the cell was allowed to condition for a minimum of 6 hours. During this conditioning time, the cell potential was cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V, and 0.8V in 0.2V potential step increments. The cell was maintained at each step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. At the end of the fuel cell potential cycling, the anode reactant and cathode reactant flow rates were dropped to 20 ml/min and 40 ml/min, respectively. The cell was then operated under constant stoichiometry using 1.2× stoichiometry on the anode, and at 2.5× stoichiometry on the cathode. Stoichiometry is defined as gas flow at any given current density such that the gas would be completely consumed in the fuel cell reaction. The fuel cell was again cycled at least twice between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to reach steady state under stoichiometry controlled mode. Finally, a polarization curve was obtained by recording the steady state current after 5 to 10 minutes following sequential voltages. The polarization curve was started from 0.6V and potential steps were first taken towards lower voltages; then the cell was taken back to 0.6V and the potential steps were taken towards open circuit voltage. Additionally, at each potential the cell resistance was measured by using a standard current interrupt technique available through the Scribner Version 3.1a (Firmware Version 1.43) software used to control the system.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0195">Once the polarization curve was completed, the fuel cell was shutdown for the night and the cell, humidification bottles and heat trace temperatures were dropped down to room temperature. The fuel cell was re-started the next day according to the same start-up protocol described above. The cell potential was again cycled between 0.6V, 0.3V and 0.8V to condition the fuel cell. If the cell performance was comparable to that of the first day, a second polarization curve was recorded to confirm the performance. If the cell performance was better on the second day than the first day, then the cell was cycled for a minimum of four more hours and a polarization curve was obtained at the end of this conditioning period. The polarization curves obtained on the second day were used for MEA comparison and are reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Open Circuit Voltage or OCV Decay Testing</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0196">In order to assess the inventive polymer hydrogen permeability properties, an OCV decay experiment as well as a hydrogen crossover test were performed. The same MEA used for Hydrogen/Air polarization performance was used for the OC decay experiment. The operation conditions of the fuel cell were unchanged: the cell was held at 60° C.; the anode and cathode humidification bottles were held at 70 and 65° C., respectively; the gas lines heat-traced were set at 75 and 70° C. for the anode and cathode, respectively; the anode and cathode stoichiometries were maintained at 1.2 and 2.5× stoichiometry, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0197">To assure that both the inventive polymer MEA and the comparative example A MEA were under the same humidification state, the fuel cell was operated in constant current density mode, at 400 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, for one hour. At time t=0 seconds, the load was removed, and the OCV was recorded versus time at a recording rate of 10 points/second. The OCV time traces of both the inventive polymer and the comparative example are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The maximum OCV for both membranes was also recorded for comparison purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0198">Although both membranes were of comparable thickness (124 and 127 microns for the inventive polymer and the comparative example X, respectively), the maximum OCV of the inventive polymer was 1.032 V versus 1.017V for the comparative example: a 15 mV improvement. Also, the OCV of the inventive polymer decreased slower with time than that of the comparative example X. As shown in the Table 3, the OCV of the inventive polymer decayed by 0.9% over the two hours time period while the OCV of the comparative example decayed by 1.3% over the same time period.</p>

Hydrogen Crossover Testing
</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0200">The measurement was performed in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell by evaluating the electrochemical limiting current originated by electrooxidation of the hydrogen flux from the anode electrode to the cathode electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0201">Briefly, the same MEA used for Hydrogen/Air polarization performance is used for electrochemical crossover testing. The air electrode or cathode is converted to a nitrogen electrode. The anode is unchanged flowing hydrogen. An external power supply or potentiostat is then used in bipolar mode (working electrode=N<sub>2 </sub>electrode, counter/reference electrodes=hydrogen (fuel) electrode) to externally bias the cell. The electrooxidation of crossed-over hydrogen occurs at the N<sub>2 </sub>electrode (working electrode) following the following redox reaction:</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0202"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00017" num="00017">

</chemistry>
<br/>
takes place in the hydrogen electrode (counter/reference). The steady-state hydrogen electrooxidation is then measured versus imposed cell potential (typically 0 to 600 mV): it increases with cell potential and will typically reach a limiting value or plateau. This limiting current is then a measure of the hydrogen crossover rate and its flux can be calculated from the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i><sub>crossover</sub>=(<i>i</i><sub>lim</sub>*1000)/(2<i>F</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where i<sub>lim </sub>is the measured limiting current density in mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, F is the Faraday's constant, equal to 96487 A-s/mol and F<sub>crossover </sub>is in micromol/cm<sup>2</sup>-s. Specifically, the electrochemical methanol crossover measurements was performed on the cell using an externally biased Amel Instrument 2055 High Power Galvanostat/Potentiostat in conjunction with an Amel Programmable Function Generator (Model 568). The cell remained connected to the same Globetech gas unit used for fuel cell polarization experiments described above. The cell was then potentiostatically biased in bipolar mode (working electrode=N<sub>2 </sub>electrode, counter/reference electrodes=methanol electrode) with cell potential (working versus reference) spanning 0→600 mV, slowly scanning at 2 mV/sec. The slow scan rate was used to assure a steady-state current measurement. The cell was held at 60° C. with anode flowing 50 sccm of H<sub>2 </sub>saturated at 70° C. and cathode flowing 50 sccm of N<sub>2 </sub>saturated at 65° C. The heat traced lines to the cell were held at 75/70° C. for anode and cathode, respectively. At least three scans were conducted to average a characteristic hydrogen crossover limiting current, each scan conducted ca. 15 minutes apart to guarantee stabilization of the cell prior every measurement. The hydrogen crossover was calculated as described above.
</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0204">The results of the hydrogen crossover measurement, shown in the Table 4, indicate that the inventive solid polymer electrolyte has lower electrochemical hydrogen crossover than the comparative example X. Although both membranes tested were of comparable thickness (124 and 127 microns for the inventive polymer and the comparative example A, respectively), and the electrodes and GDMs were the same, the hydrogen crossover of the inventive polymer is 34% lower than that of the comparative example X, N115.</p>

<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Methanol/Air Testing</heading>
<p id="p-0171" num="0206">An additional set of Membrane Electrode Assemblies was prepared for both the inventive polymer and the comparative example. The electrodes used for these two MEAs were prepared according to the same protocol described in Example 10. The inventive polymer membrane used was 125 micron thick while the comparative membrane, NAFION 115®, was 128 micron thick (both measured using a MT60M Heidenhain (Schaumburg, Ill.) thickness gauge attached to a Heidenhain ND281B digital display). The MEAs and the fuel cells were assembled according to the procedures described in Example 10.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0207">The MEA was first conditioned in Hydrogen/Air mode and polarization curves were obtained on the second day once steady state had been reached (see Example 10 for conditioning details and polarization curve recording technique).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0208">The fuel cell was then switched from hydrogen/air mode to methanol/air mode (direct methanol fuel cell or DMFC mode). The anode side of the fuel cell was first flushed with nitrogen and then a 1M-methanol solution was pumped at 1 ml/min to the anode side using a Kd Scientific injection-withdrawn pump.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0209">Humidified air (with bottle temperature set at 65 degrees C. and heat-trace gas line set at 70 degrees C.) was maintained on the cathode side. However, the cathode was switched from constant stoichiometry mode to constant flow rate mode: 100 ml/min. The fuel cell was cycled between 0.4V, 0.2V and 0.6 V in 0.3 V potential steps to condition the MEA. The fuel cell was maintained at each potential step for a 5 to 10 minutes time period. After cycling the cell in DMFC mode for a minimum of 3 hours, a DMFC polarization curve was recorded in a similar fashion as reported before. In this case, the polarization curve was started from 0.3 V and the potential was first lower to 0.1V in 0.1 V step increments; then the cell was taken back to 0.3V and the potential was increased to open circuit voltage, in 0.05 V step increment. Once the polarization curve was completed, the fuel cell was shutdown for the night, the cell flushed with N<sub>2 </sub>gas, and the humidification bottles and heat trace temperatures were dropped down to room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0210">The fuel cell was re-started the next day directly in methanol/air mode. The cell temperature was again set at 60 degrees C., the heat-traces on the anode and cathode gas lines at 75 and 70 degrees C. respectively. The back-pressure was kept at 0 psig on both sides. The methanol solution was again fed at 1 ml/min and the humidified air (with cathode bottle set at 65 degrees C.) at 100 ml/min. The fuel cell was again cycled between 0.2V, 0.4V and 0.6V to condition the fuel cell. After a minimum of three hours, a day-2 polarization curve was recorded. For each potential step, the constant voltage was maintained for at least 15 minutes to capture any fluctuations in the current density output. The average current density at each voltage as well as the high and low current density values were recorded and used to plot the polarization curves reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (the markers represent the average current densities while the extreme points of the error bars represent the upper and lower current density values.)</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0211">Once the polarization curve was completed, the cathode flow rate was dropped to 50 ml/min. The cell was then allowed to equilibrate at this new operating condition by maintaining the cell voltage at 0.3V. Once a new steady state was reached, a polarization curve was recorded in a similar fashion as reported above. The polarization curves of the comparative example X and of the inventive polymer are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0216">The error bars, which represent the amplitude of the current density fluctuations at a given potential, are a lot larger for the comparative example than for the inventive polymer indicating that the fuel cell performance of the latter is more stable over time than that of the comparative example.

The fuel cell performance of the inventive polymer remains constant with decreasing air flow rates: at 0.5V, the current density was 77, 76 and 77 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 100, 50 and 25 ml/min of humidified air, respectively. In comparison, the fuel cell performance of the comparative example dropped with decreasing air flow rates: 78, 72 and 46 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 0.5V at 100, 50 and 25 ml/min of humidified air, respectively, and was also more unstable than the inventive polymer</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0218">The comparative example performed best when operated under dry air: the current density appeared fairly stable under this cathode condition as shown by the small error bars on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0219">The sensitivity to cathode stoichiometry (modified by changing the air flow rate), the large current density fluctuations at saturated air flows and the improved performance under dry air indicate that the comparative example tends to flood at the cathode electrode. In comparison, the inventive polymer performed similarly under all sets of cathode conditions and the cell performance appeared more stable over time. The inventive polymer appears less prone to cathode flooding than the comparative example.</p>

<p id="p-0189" num="0230">In order to assess differences in water transport properties between the inventive polymer and the comparative example, water flux measurements were conducted on the MEAs in the fuel cell itself Fully conditioned MEAs were used and the test was performed immediately after the methanol/air performance evaluation was completed.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0231">The anode feed of the fuel cell was switched from a 1M methanol solution to de-ionized water and the cathode feed was switched from air to dry nitrogen. The cell temperature was kept at 60 degrees C. with the fuel cell inlet lines heated at 75 and 70 degrees C. for the anode and the cathode, respectively. Finally, the system was kept under ambient pressure condition. The water flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min while the nitrogen flow rate was set at 100 ml/min. The cell was operated at these conditions for a minimum of 17 hours to allow complete flushing of the cell. The water flow rate was then increased to 2.5 ml/min and the cell was allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 1 hour.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0232">At time t=0 min, the cathode exhaust was connected to a condensing set-up, composed of a long stainless steel coil attached to a closed glass beaker. Both the coil and the glass beaker were placed in ice to assure complete collection of the condensing water of the cathode exhaust. The exhaust gas, nitrogen, was reconnected to the fuel cell station gas unit for backpressure control. After a minimum of 6 hours, the condensing set-up was disconnected from the cathode exhaust and the amount of water collected was measured.</p>

<p id="p-0198" num="0239">Membranes were prepared by spraying a thin coat of a diluted solution of the inventive polymer on GORE-SELECT™ membranes to reduce hydrogen crossover of these membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0240">Precisely, a 3.4% solids dimethyl sulfoxide solution using the inventive polymer was prepared. The solution was prepared by dissolving pellets of the inventive polymer (in the sodium form) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 160 g of DMSO was poured in a 3-neck flask. The solvent was agitated by a magnetic stirrer and the flask was kept under dry nitrogen, 26 g of the inventive polymer pellets was then added to the flask to prepare a 14% solids solution in DMSO. The content of the flask was heated to 90 degrees C. for about 4 hours then cooled down overnight and finally heated at 90 degrees C. for an additional 4 hours the next day. The resulting ionomer solution contained 14% solids.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0241">5.5 g of the so-prepared solution was then further diluted to 3.4% solids. 13.5 g of DMSO was added to the 5.5 g of solution and mixed with a mechanical stirrer for about 1 hour.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0242">A 35-micron thick GORE-SELECT™ membrane (from W. L. Gore &amp; Associates) was place in a wooden embroidery hoop for mechanical restraint. The 3.4% solution of the inventive polymer was then sprayed on one side of the membrane with a spray gun 3 passes were applied in order to obtain a continuous and uniform film of the inventive polymer electrolyte on the GORE-SELECT™ membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0243">The membrane, still on the wooded embroidery hoop, was placed in a vacuum oven at 100 degrees C. with a vacuum pressure of about 6 in of Hg. After 6 hours in the oven, the membrane was removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. The inventive polymer electrolyte layer was estimated to about 1.6 micron thick and was uniform.</p>
