<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to window or sash locks and more particularly improved keepers used with such sash lock assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the more-common window types is the double hung window. Double hung windows are generally defined as two individual glass panels, each panel in separate sash with two sashes movable on a vertical plane. Double hung windows typically have a first sash and a second sash. Each sash has a top stile and a bottom stile and a pair of opposed sides. The sides of the sashes are positioned in a track in the assembly. Each assembly may have two tracks, one track for each sash. One sash is a lower sash and the second sash is the upper. Each sash is capable of moving vertically in its respective channel or a track that is positioned on opposite sides of each sash. The sash may be raised and lowered in the channel as needed by the user for ventilation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous latches for double hung windows are known. Many such latches typically include a catch portion, which is secured to a lower window sash, and a keeper portion, which is secured to an upper window sash. The catch portion is moved into engagement with the keeper portion to latch the sashes against movement relative to one another (the locked position), and the catch portion is moved clear of the keeper and the upper window sash (the unlocked position) to allow movement of the sashes relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the issues with double hung windows is security. Because the windows are raised and lowered on numerous occasions, there is a need to prevent unauthorized movement of the sash by an intruder and others attempting unauthorized entry. As a result, many double hung windows have sash locks present. The sash lock has generally two separate members. The first is the lock mechanism itself which, in many instances, is made up of a base with a locking member that moves from an engaged position to a disengaged position. The lock mechanism is usually secured to the upper stile of upper member of the window sash. The second member of a sash lock is the keeper. The keeper is typically secured to the upper portion of the lower stile of the window sash.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the window is to be locked, the locking member engages the keeper so that at least a portion of the lock member extending from the lock mechanism is secured by the keeper. A problem with this type of lock is that there is no readily visible means for alerting the user that the latch is in the locked or unlocked position. The failure to readily determine whether the sash lock is in a locked position creates a security risk in that the homeowner or others may fail to lock the window and thus leave the premises open to intruders. There is a security issue with traditional sash locks in that they require the homeowner to visually check each lock while being in close proximity to the lock in order to ascertain if the sash lock is in a locked arrangement with the keeper. Since many homes have ten to twenty windows or more, this was a time consuming process and cause for aggravation when the homeowner is in a rush to leave for an appointment. As a result, there is a need for a sash lock that permits a user to readily determine if a sash lock is in locking engagement. The present invention solves this problem by providing an indicator on the latching mechanism that will automatically indicate or signal the status of the latches. Thereby, people in a rush, or young children, or persons with memory deficiencies will be able to easily, readily, visually, or even by tactile means to know if the latch mechanism is in a locked/unlocked status.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a signaling device that indicates the locked/unlocked status of objects that are latched against movement relative to one another; and in a preferred application, to a latch for a double hung window. The present invention can also relate to other types of windows and doors which are retained in position by the combination of a locking mechanism such as a catch and a keeper. The indicator of the present invention includes any type of indicator, flag, signal, or other indicia whether visual, aural, or tactile. The indicator may have two basic positions: locked position and non-locked position. Thus, there can be a visual signal corresponding, respectively, to a locked status and unlocked status of the locking arrangement. The indicator is moved into its respective status by the movement of the locking structure engaging the indicator. In an alternative embodiment, the visual reference can signal an unlocked status and the non visual a locked status of the window.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved sash lock that provides a visual signal when the sash lock actuator is in locking engagement with the respective keeper. This visual signal may be in the form of a flag, a raised member or other visual or other signal that has a first or non locking position such that the flag extends from the keeper and provides a clear indicator of the status of the unlocked arrangement and a second retracted position when the sash lock actuator is in a locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment of the present invention, the actuator on the sash lock assembly contacts a member in the base of the keeper as the actuator is locked causing a flag to rise signaling that the actuator is secured to the keeper and that the window is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Any suitable signal means may be used in the present invention. In the preferred embodiment the signal means may be a flag but it will be appreciated that other signal means may be used. For example, there may be a pair of indicators on the keeper and a sliding door that travels in response to the movement of the actuator to cause one of the indicators to be covered when the actuator and the keeper are in a locked position. When the actuator travels to an unlocked position, the sliding door can travel such that the first indicator is covered and the second indicator is revealed. In one embodiment, the flag can be a flat member that extends upwardly from the keeper body. In another embodiment the flag may be a protrusion of any shape that extends from the keeper but provides an indication of the status.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved sash lock.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the invention to provide a sash lock and keeper that increases window security.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a sash lock that has a means for readily determining whether window sashes are locked by the sash lock and the keeper.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still another object of the invention to provide a sash lock assembly having an improved keeper for providing a visual indication whether a sash window is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a further object of the invention to provide a keeper for a sash lock assembly that has a signal flag for showing whether a sash window is locked.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is a still further object of the invention to provide a keeper having a flag for signaling whether the keeper is locked to the remainder of the sash lock assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a simple, effective and practical device for positively monitoring the status or condition of a locking arrangement for a sash lock.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an inexpensively manufactured and easily installed sash lock that operates on existing, conventional locking arrangements.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawing and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sash window assembly on which the present invention may be used may include an upper sash window and a lower sash window. Each of the sash windows may be mounted within opposed guide rails on a frame. At least one of the sash windows is slidable within the frame relative to the other sash window. The present invention may also be used in a single sash window that is hinged on one end and lockable on the opposite end. These windows typically open inwardly or outwardly and can be held in place by a chain or other means when opened.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> there is a sash lock <b>10</b> having a locking assembly <b>11</b> and a keeper <b>12</b>. The sash lock may be any suitable shape desired. The locking assembly <b>11</b> has a body <b>13</b> with an actuator arm <b>14</b> secured to the catch <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the arm <b>14</b> may be pivot a cam to which the catch is connected. The catch may be any suitable securing means such as a magnet or hook that secures the sash locking assembly to the keeper. The actuator arm <b>14</b> preferably includes a handle <b>15</b> or a driving or gripping portion that permits the user to readily move the catch <b>18</b> into a locked position by engaging the keeper <b>12</b>. In a typical assembly, the catch has a hook shaped portion (see <b>59</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>) that engages member <b>53</b> on the keeper and retains the keeper in a locking position. When the catch moves into this locked position it preferably automatically engages the signaling device <b>16</b> causing it to move to a signaling position. The signaling device which may be a flag or pennant or other suitable signaling means. The signaling device may be rotatable from a first position to a second position by the action of the catch. One of these positions may signal a locking relation and the other position, an unlocked relation. The signaling means may, for example, be axially pinned <b>17</b> to the keeper structure and rotates to a visible status. Alternatively, the signal means be sensed by sound or by a touchable signal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The size and materials of construction of the signaling device or indicator is determined by the size and style of the latching mechanism. It can be appreciated that the indicator can work in a reversed mode; that is visible or tactilely engageable when the latching mechanism is open and non-visible or non tactilely engageable when the latching mechanism is locked. To accomplish the latter mode, the signaling device or indicator may, for example, be spring-biased such that when the catch is not present, the spring forces the flag into an upright or raised position. When the catch is present, the catch hits the bottom portion of the rotating or pivoting flag member it forces the flag into a retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The locking assembly <b>11</b> is secured to a surface on the stile of a sash. The actuator arm <b>14</b> has typically two positions. The first is a locked position as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the arm is moved to the locking position as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the actuator mechanism causes a signal means to reflect the locking arrangement. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, there is a flag which has retracted into the keeper to signal an unlocked relationship. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the catch <b>18</b> that the actuator arm <b>14</b> operates. In this embodiment the catch is a sloped member that is moved by the actuator arm. The catch can perform two functions in the present invention. The first is to secure the locking assembly to the keeper to prevent the window sash from opening. The second is that it can activate the signal means to indicate whether the window is locked or unlocked. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the arm <b>14</b> turns the catch <b>18</b>, the sloped surface <b>19</b> of the catch forces the signal means into position to show a locking relationship. Alternatively, the catch may extend from a cam that is rotated by the actuator arm and an actuating portion of the cam contacts the signal means causing it to indicate the relationship between the keeper and the locking assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The signal means may be a small flat sheet of material that pivots about a pin. As the sloped portion of the actuator means <b>18</b> pushes against the bottom surface of the signal member, the flag is caused to rise through a slot in the upper surface of the keeper signaling a locked relationship. As the actuator arm is pushed in the opposite direction, the sloped portion of the actuator means <b>18</b> causes the flag to be lowered to signal that the keeper and sash lock are in an unlocked arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that there may be a variety of actuator means that can be used to cause a signal means to be raised and lowered as the sash lock and keeper go from a locked to an unlocked relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the indicator mechanism has a spring biased member <b>22</b> movable from a first position <b>27</b> to a second position <b>27</b>A in a slot <b>25</b> at one end of the spring biased member. The slot is preferably generally “C” shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At the other end <b>29</b>, the spring biased member <b>22</b> is attached to the indicator <b>23</b> by means of pivot pin <b>26</b>A. The indicator <b>23</b> moves between a locked, visible position (solid lines) to an unlocked, non-visible position (dotted lines) as the spring based member is moved by the motion of the catch. The indicator rotates about axis <b>24</b>. As a portion of the catch contacts the spring biased member, the spring biased member moves in the slot <b>25</b> from one position to the other. When the pressure of the catch is, released the spring biased member reverts to its initial position. Either the first position or the second position of the spring biased member can be the locked position as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the indicator mechanism has spring-biased member <b>32</b>. At one end <b>35</b> of member <b>32</b> there is a spring <b>38</b> secured to the member <b>32</b> and the body of the keeper. The member <b>32</b> rotates or pivots about axis <b>37</b> into and out of contract with the cam-shaped member <b>33</b>. The cam shaped member pivots about pin <b>34</b> from a locked position to an unlocked position and causes the indicator to be raised and lowered in the keeper. The cam shaped member <b>33</b> pivots about axis <b>34</b> due to movement of the catch. The cam shaped member may have a first engaging section <b>36</b> or a second engaging section <b>36</b>A. As the cam member <b>33</b> rotates the engaging section <b>36</b> or <b>36</b>A. contacts member <b>32</b> at end <b>39</b> causing the member <b>32</b> to pivot into a position in which end <b>39</b> is raised above the surface of the keeper and acts as a signal. When the cam member releases its contact with member <b>32</b> the spring forces the end <b>39</b> to retract into the body of the keeper.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the indicator mechanism contacts a generally L-shaped member <b>42</b> that rotates about axis <b>47</b>. As the L-shaped member rotates, it enters into contact with and out of contact with cam shaped member <b>43</b> that rotates about axis <b>44</b>. The cam shaped member is spring-biased by spring <b>49</b>. The L-shaped member <b>42</b> has a first end <b>41</b> and a second end <b>45</b>. As the cam member <b>43</b> pivots it forces the L shaped member <b>42</b> to pivot from a first position to a second position that causes the first end of the L-shaped member to extend above the surface of the keeper so that it signals that the catch and keeper are in a locked relationship. Alternatively, the device can be arranged so that the positions are reversed so that as the cam member <b>43</b> pivots the first end of the L-shaped member extends above the surface of the keeper and signals an unlocked position instead of a locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-18</figref> show another embodiment of the sash lock of the present invention. The sash lock includes a lock assembly and a keeper. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. There is a locking assembly <b>51</b> and a keeper <b>52</b>. The keeper <b>52</b> includes a keeper surface <b>53</b> that the catch in the locking assembly secures the locking assembly to the keeper. The keeper preferably has a pair of orifices <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, one at each end of the keeper body <b>63</b>. The orifices can be used to secure the keeper to the surface of a sash by means of a screw or other suitable means. The keeper body <b>63</b> is provided with a slot <b>64</b>. The slot is shaped to reflect the size and shape of the indicator <b>65</b> which indicates whether the keeper <b>52</b> and locking assembly <b>51</b> are in a locking arrangement. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the keeper is provided with an indicator assembly <b>66</b> which has an arm <b>67</b>. One end of the arm <b>67</b> is secured to the underside of the keeper <b>52</b>. The other end of the arm is provided with an indicator <b>65</b>. The indicator may be a flag or other type of signal means for indicating whether the sash lock assembly <b>51</b> is secured to the keeper. The arm <b>67</b> may slightly bent downwardly so that it requires a force from the catch means in the lock assembly to push the indicator upwardly through the slot. This catch means may be a cam that is rotatable or pivots on the lock assembly <b>51</b>. As the catch rotates to secure the keeper, it contacts the underside of the arm <b>67</b> and forces the flag <b>65</b> through the slot <b>68</b>. This signals that the window is locked. As the catch releases the keeper, the arm is permitted to retract from the slot thereby signaling that the keeper and the sash lock are in an unlocked relation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sash lock also includes locking assembly <b>51</b> for mounting on an adjacent style of the lower sash window. The locking assembly <b>51</b> may include a housing <b>55</b> having an orifice <b>56</b>, an actuator arm <b>57</b> and a cam <b>58</b>. The cam <b>58</b> has a cam surface <b>59</b> for engaging the keeper surface <b>53</b>. The locking assembly also includes a shaft <b>60</b> extending through the orifice <b>56</b> and operably coupling the actuator arm to the cam.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The keeper and the locker assembly may be made from any suitable material such as metal or plastic. A preferred plastic is a glass filled polypropylene, glass filled nylon or a blend of glass filled polypropylene and nylon. If made of metal, a preferred metal is zinc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The actuator arm and the shaft are preferably a unitary member. The shaft and the cam may have cooperatively mating faces for rotatably securing the shaft to the cam. The shaft and the orifice have corresponding circumferential surfaces. The shaft has a shaft projection extending from its circumferential surface. The hole has two spaced hole projections extending from its circumferential surface. The shaft projection engages one or the other of the hold projections to limit rotational travel of the actuator arm and thereby define locked and unlocked position respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The shaft may have a threaded screw receiving hole to receive a metal screw (not shown) to secure the cam to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The housing has a pair of holes for receiving screws to secure the housing to its style. The keeper has a pair of keeper holes for receiving screws to secure the keeper tot he style.</p>
