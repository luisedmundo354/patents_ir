<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Print paths that are employed by systems such as Microsoft Windows provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. are usually statically defined. Static print paths associate a system or network printer with a computer system or other physical device. To print to a system or network printer, a computer system employs a printer specific print driver to render a document into a printer ready file that is compatible with the specified printer. The printer ready file is then provided to a port monitor that is responsible for transmitting the data contained therein to the specified printer. The print path is statically defined in that the printer driver and the port monitor are both predefined for printing to a specific printer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Statically defined print paths can be burdensome when a user wishes to print to a new printer that is undefined in their computer system. Specifically, in order to print to an undefined printer, a user is required to construct the print path to the new printer identifying the new printer driver, port monitor, and other aspects.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In light of the foregoing, various embodiments including systems, methods, and programs embodied in a computer readable medium for printing using a dynamic print path are provided. In one embodiment, a method is provided that comprises the steps of rendering a document in a computer system into a print ready file without a specification of a destination printer upon which the document is to be printed, specifying the destination printer to which the print ready file is to be transmitted to print the document, and, transmitting the print ready file from the computer system directly to the destination printer using a predefined communications protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment, a program embodied in a computer readable medium is provided that comprises a generic printer driver that renders a document into a print ready file without a specification of a destination printer upon which the document is to be printed. The program also includes a port monitor that writes the print ready file rendered by the generic printer driver to a memory to be transmitted to the destination printer. The program further comprises a print router that facilitates specifying the destination printer from a number of potential destination printers to which the print ready file is to be transmitted to print the document and the print router being capable of directing a data communications protocol suite to transmit the print ready file directly to the destination printer for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In still another embodiment, a system that provides for a dynamic print path with which to interface with a destination printer to print a document is described. In this regard, the system comprises a processor circuit having a processor and a memory. In addition, a dynamic print path is stored in the memory and is executable by the processor. The dynamic print path comprises a generic printer driver that renders a document into a print ready file without a specification of a destination printer upon which the document is to be printed, a port monitor that writes the print ready file rendered by the generic printer driver to a memory to be transmitted to the destination printer, and, a print router that facilitates specifying the destination printer from a number of potential destination printers to which the print ready file is to be transmitted to print the document.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown is a functional block diagram of a print network <b>100</b> that includes various components to perform a print operation according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this respect, the print network <b>100</b> includes a computer system <b>103</b> with a dynamic print path <b>106</b>. The computer system <b>103</b> may be, for example, a computer, personal digital assistant, or other device with like capability. The computer system <b>103</b> is in data communication with a destination printer <b>109</b>. The computer system <b>103</b> includes an application <b>113</b> that generates one or more documents <b>116</b>. For printing, the document <b>116</b> is applied to the dynamic print path <b>106</b> in order to render the document <b>116</b> in a format that is accepted by the destination printer <b>109</b>. The use of the dynamic print path <b>106</b> in the computer system <b>103</b> provides an advantage in that the computer system <b>103</b> communicates directly with the destination printer <b>109</b> without the intervention of a print server or other intermediate device as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dynamic print path <b>106</b> includes a generic print driver <b>119</b>, a port monitor <b>123</b>, and a print router <b>126</b>. During the course of the operation of the dynamic print path <b>106</b>, a print ready file <b>129</b> is created that comprises the document <b>116</b> embodied in a format that is accepted by various printers such as the destination printer <b>109</b>. During the course of a print operation, one or more user interfaces <b>133</b> may be generated by the print router <b>126</b> as will be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Next, the operation of both the computer system <b>103</b> and the dynamic print path <b>106</b> in performing a print operation is described. To begin, the application <b>113</b> generates the document <b>116</b> that is to be printed by the printer <b>109</b>. In this respect, the application <b>113</b> may be any application that can generate a document <b>116</b>. Such applications may include, for example, word processors, drawings programs, or any other application. Once the document <b>116</b> is created, a user indicates a desire to print the document <b>116</b> using the appropriate mechanisms within the application <b>113</b>. Such mechanisms may be, for example, print buttons or other user interface components. When initiating the printing of the document <b>116</b> using such mechanisms in the application <b>113</b>, a user may identify that the dynamic print path <b>106</b> be employed to render the document for printing. Such may be identified as an alternative to existing printer choices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Assuming that the dynamic print path <b>106</b> is selected, then the document <b>116</b> is applied to the generic print driver <b>119</b> to be rendered. The generic print driver <b>119</b> is “printer generic” in that it is not designed for rendering a document into a print ready format that is associated with or compatible with a specific printer. In this respect, the generic print driver <b>119</b> renders the document <b>116</b> into the print ready file <b>129</b> without a specification of the ultimate destination printer <b>109</b> upon which the document is to be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">After the print ready file <b>129</b> is created, the generic print driver <b>119</b> provides the print ready file <b>129</b> to the port monitor <b>123</b>. The port monitor <b>123</b> then writes the print ready file <b>129</b> to a memory in the computer system <b>103</b> for temporary storage before being transmitted to the destination printer <b>109</b>. This is done since the ultimate destination printer <b>109</b> has yet to be selected for printing. The port monitor <b>123</b> then informs the print router <b>126</b> that the print ready file <b>129</b> is to be printed, thereby initiating the functions of the print router <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The print router <b>126</b> facilitates the selection or specification of the destination printer <b>109</b> from a group of potential destination printers <b>109</b>. Also, the print router <b>126</b> directs the transmission of the print ready file <b>129</b> to the destination printer <b>109</b> using a predefined data communications protocol suite. To begin, the print router <b>126</b> facilitates the selection or specification of the printer <b>109</b> by generating an appropriate user interface <b>133</b>. The user interface <b>133</b> may provide a user with the opportunity to select the destination printer <b>109</b> from a group of potential destination printers or may otherwise allow the user to specify the destination printer <b>109</b>. The selection or specification of the destination printer <b>109</b> may be performed subsequent to the rendering of the document <b>116</b> into the print ready file <b>129</b> by the generic print driver <b>119</b> or may be performed in parallel to the operation of the generic print driver <b>119</b>. The user interface <b>133</b> provides a user with the opportunity not only to specify the printer <b>109</b>, but also a particular port within the printer <b>109</b> that is to be used for data communications during the course of the print operation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once the destination printer <b>109</b> has been selected or otherwise specified, then the print router <b>126</b> queries the destination printer <b>109</b> to confirm that the printer <b>109</b> is a printer in fact. For example, the destination printer <b>109</b> may be coupled to the computer system <b>103</b> across a network. In such case, the query may be performed using a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or some other protocol. If the printer status is confirmed, then the print router <b>126</b> queries the printer <b>109</b> to confirm that the print ready format of the print ready file <b>129</b> generated by the generic print driver <b>119</b> is compatible with or is the same as a print ready format <b>129</b> required by the printer <b>109</b>. This query may also be performed using SNMP or other appropriate protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, a translator may be employed that translate the print ready file <b>129</b> from the previously rendered print ready format into a print ready format that is compatible with the selected printer <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Assuming that the printer <b>109</b> can accept the print ready format of the print ready file <b>129</b> or that the print ready file <b>129</b> was properly translated, then the print router <b>126</b> opens a communications channel by opening a socket, for example, with the printer <b>109</b> to facilitate data communications. To facilitate the data communication, the print router <b>126</b> employs a default port number unless an alternate port number is specified using the user interface <b>133</b> as mentioned above. Then, the print router <b>126</b> directs the transmission of the print ready file <b>129</b> to the destination printer <b>109</b> for printing thereon using an appropriate data communications protocol suite. The data communications protocol suite may be, for example, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as described by Braden, R. editor, Requirements for Internet Hosts—Communications Layers, RFC 1122, Internet Engineering Task Force, October 1989, or other appropriate protocol suite as can be appreciated by those with ordinary skill in the art. Upon receiving the print ready file <b>129</b>, the printer <b>109</b> prints the document <b>116</b> embodied therein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The dynamic print path <b>106</b> provides several advantages in that the destination printer <b>109</b> is not statically defined where a printer specific print driver is employed. This provides for greater flexibility in use of portable computer systems such as laptops, personal digital assistants, or other devices. For example, in one scenario assume that computer system <b>103</b> is a portable computer that is temporarily linked to a local area network and that the user wishes to print a document on a nearby printer coupled to the network. If the print path for this printer were to be statically defined, then the user would have to install the printer specific print driver and an appropriate port monitor on the portable computer. Many users may not have the technical savvy necessary to perform the needed installation procedure or such users may not have the necessary processing privileges to perform the needed installation procedure. Also, users may not wish to perform the needed installation procedure as they may not wish to burden their computer system for a quick, one-time print job.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, if the dynamic print path <b>106</b> exists on their portable computer, the user can initiate a print operation and need only enter the printer IP address or other network designation using the user interface <b>133</b> to print the document <b>116</b>. Ultimately, a print operation may be performed without the need to communicate with a print server associated with the destination printer or other intermediate device since the print router <b>126</b> facilitates direct transmission of the print ready file <b>129</b> to the destination printer <b>109</b> over a network or through some other interconnection.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The memory <b>156</b> is defined herein as both volatile and nonvolatile memory and data storage components. Volatile components are those that do not retain data values upon loss of power. Nonvolatile components are those that retain data upon a loss of power. Thus, the memory <b>156</b> may comprise, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), hard disk drives, floppy disks accessed via an associated floppy disk drive, compact discs accessed via a compact disc drive, magnetic tapes accessed via an appropriate tape drive, and/or other memory components, or a combination of any two or more of these memory components.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shown is a view of the print network <b>100</b><i>a </i>that shows an example of the data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> as employed between the computer system <b>103</b><i>a </i>and a select one of the printers <b>109</b>. The data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> facilitates direct communication of the print ready file <b>129</b><i>a </i>from the computer system <b>103</b><i>a </i>to a select one of the printers <b>109</b> without the intervention of a print server or other intermediate device. The data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> includes a transport layer <b>203</b>, a network layer <b>206</b>, and a link layer <b>209</b>. The same protocol suite <b>189</b> is employed on the printer <b>109</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transport layer <b>203</b> may comprise, for example, a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The network layer <b>206</b> may employ, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP). The link layer protocol <b>209</b> may employ an Ethernet network or other network technology. The print router <b>126</b><i>a </i>directs the data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> to communicate the print ready file <b>129</b><i>a </i>to the printer <b>109</b>. The data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> located in the printer <b>109</b> provides the print ready file <b>129</b> to a printer controller <b>213</b> that orchestrates the printing of the document <b>116</b><i>a </i>embodied therein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shown is the user interface <b>133</b><i>a </i>that is generated by the print router <b>126</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to provide a user with the opportunity to select or specify a printer <b>109</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on a network <b>179</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to be used to print the document <b>116</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>is implemented, for example, by the port monitor <b>123</b>/<b>123</b><i>a </i>(FIG. <b>1</b>/<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) after the print ready file <b>129</b>/<b>129</b><i>a </i>(FIG. <b>1</b>/<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) has been created by the generic print driver <b>119</b>/<b>119</b><i>a </i>(FIG. <b>1</b>/<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and stored in the memory <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Alternatively, the operation of the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>may be implemented at another point in time during the print operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Beginning with box <b>256</b>, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>obtains an input that indicates a selection of a desired printer <b>109</b> to which the document <b>116</b> is to be printed. To obtain the input, the user interface <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be generated to facilitate a user selection or specification of the destination printer <b>109</b> from a group of potential destination printers or some other approach may be employed. Then, in box <b>259</b>, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>confirms that the chosen printer <b>109</b> is a printer in fact. This may be done by generating and transmitting a query to the respective printer <b>109</b> to determine whether such device is in fact a printer. To create and transmit such a query, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) may be employed. In box <b>263</b>, if the selected or specified printer <b>109</b> is confirmed to be a printer <b>109</b> then the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>proceeds to box <b>266</b>. Otherwise, in box <b>269</b> an indication of a print failure is made to the user through an appropriate user interface <b>133</b>. Thereafter, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>ends as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Assuming that the destination printer <b>109</b> has been confirmed to be a printer in box <b>263</b>, then in box <b>266</b> the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>next confirms that the destination printer <b>109</b> employs a print ready format that is compatible with the print ready format of the print ready file <b>129</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This may be determined by transmitting an appropriate query to the destination printer <b>109</b> using SNMP or other appropriate protocol. Thereafter, in box <b>273</b>, if the designated printer <b>109</b> employs a print ready format that is compatible with the print ready format of the print ready file <b>129</b>, then the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>proceeds to box <b>276</b>. Otherwise, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>moves to box <b>269</b> to indicate the failure of the print job due to incompatibility. Alternatively, the print ready file <b>129</b> may be applied to an appropriate translator that translates the print ready file <b>129</b> into a print ready format that is compatible with the current destination printer <b>109</b>. Thereafter, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>would proceed to box <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In box <b>276</b>, the print router opens a communications channel with the destination printer. This may be done, for example, by opening a socket with the destination printer using a predefined port. Thereafter, in box <b>279</b> if the connection has been successfully made, then the print router proceeds to box <b>283</b>. In box <b>283</b>, the printer ready file <b>129</b> is transmitted to the printer using the data communications protocol suite <b>189</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or other appropriate protocol suite. In this respect, the print ready file is transmitted directly from the computer system <b>103</b> to the printer <b>109</b> without the intervention of a print server or other intermediate device. In box <b>286</b>, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>determines whether the transmission of the print ready file <b>129</b> is complete. If such is the case, then the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>proceeds to box <b>289</b>. Otherwise, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>reverts back to box <b>283</b> to continue to transmit the print ready file <b>129</b> to the printer <b>109</b>. In box <b>289</b>, the print router <b>126</b>/<b>126</b><i>a </i>closes the communications channel with the destination printer <b>109</b> as the communication of the print ready <b>129</b> file is complete.
