<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from French Application No. 01/00762, filed Jan. 19, 2001, all of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for separating proteins and peptides by capillary electrophoresis and to buffer compositions comprising an additive for use in such separation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The proteins in biological fluids such as serum are analysed for analytical for diagnostic purposes and in particular, usually by separating the proteins by electrophoresis, either gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis. One advantage of capillary electrophoresis lies in the fact that only tiny quantities of biological fluids are required for analysis. Further, separation using that technique can be very rapid, because high voltages can used without the sample heating up too much during separation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To separate blood proteins, capillary electrophoresis is conventionally carried out with alkaline buffers. Usually, the protein profiles obtained comprise five or six fractions, namely the albumin fraction, the α<sub>1 </sub>and α<sub>2 </sub>globulin factions, the β globulin fraction or the β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2 </sub>globulin fractions, and the γ globulin fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such separation can be carried out using capillary electrophoresis with the aid of buffer systems and techniques such as those described in United States Reissued patent U.S. Re. Pat. No. 36 011 or European patent EP-A-0 518 475.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Until now, however, separating albumin and α<sub>1 </sub>globulin by capillary electrophoresis has been unsatisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The Applicant has now demonstrated that improved separation, in particular albumin/α<sub>1 </sub>globulin separation, can be achieved by employing an additive for the buffer system, which additive comprises an anionic pole with a pH of more than 9 and a hydrophobic portion. Such additives are capable of hydrophobic interactions with one or more protein constituents and are also capable of providing the protein constituent or constituents with one or more negative charges and of modifying the electrophoretic mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, the invention concerns an alkaline pH, free solution capillary electrophoresis method for analysing samples comprising protein constituents, in which the sample is introduced into a capillary tube containing a buffer system, said buffer system further comprising at least one additive that is capable of hydrophobic interaction with one or more protein constituents and capable of providing said protein constituent or constituents with one or more negative charges and of modifying the electrophoretic mobility. This step is generally followed by separating the protein constituents by migration and detecting the constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention also concerns a method for separating protein constituents in samples comprising albumin and the following Fractions: α<sub>1</sub>; α<sub>2</sub>; β (or β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2</sub>); and γ globulin, by electrophoresis in a buffer system, in which the buffer system comprises a further additive that is at least capable of a hydrophobic interaction with he albumin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention also concerns a method for electrophoretic separation, by alkaline pH, free solution capillary electrophoresis, of protein constituents in a liquid sample, in which method the sample comprising said constituents is passed into a capillary containing a buffer system further comprising at least one additive, the additive being a compound comprising an anionic pole with a pH of more than 9 and a hydrophobic portion</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The compounds that can be used as an additive to the capillary electrophoresis buffer system of the invention are capable of a hydrophobic interaction with albumin; these compounds can, for example, be anionic surfactants such as those used in MECC (micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography), but at a concentration that is below their critical micellar concentration. In the present invention, we use these compounds in free solution CE: the compound provides the albumin with a negative charge by hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic residues of the albumin and the hydrophobic portion of these compounds, thus reducing the mobility of the albumin compared with that of the other proteins. One consequence is improved separation of albumin from the α<sub>1 </sub>fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Finally, the invention concerns electrolyte compositions for capillary electrophoresis comprising at least one buffer and an additive that is capable of hydrophobic interaction with albumin, in a suitable support.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As will become clear from the examples, the use of the additives of the invention allows improved separation of the albumin and α<sub>1 </sub>globulin fractions. It also improves the base line return between these two fractions compared with the normal buffers.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additives for the buffer in accordance with the invention that are capable of interacting with the hydrophobic portion of albumin that can be cited are compounds comprising an anionic pole with a pH of more than 9 and a hydrophobic portion. The hydrophobic portion can be composed of at least one alkyl chain, which may or may not be branched, containing 4 to 22 carbon atoms, namely 4 to 20 carbon atoms, and/or at least a combination of 1 to 10 cyclic groups, which groups may be aromatic or non aromatic. Preferably, combinations of 1 to 4 cyclic groups are used. As will be readily understood by the skilled person, this hydrophobic portion can comprise residues or functions that do not essentially modify its hydrophobic nature, such as one or more hydroxyl or amine functions, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The anionic pole can be constituted by one or more of the chemical groups or functions from the following list: sulphonates, carboxylates, sulphates, phosphates, carbonates.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following can in particular be cited: cholates, C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl-mono-, di- or tri- sulphonates, tetradecenesulphonate, naphthalenesulphonates, C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkylmono-, di- or trioxylates, C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alciboxysulphonates, naphthalenecarboxylates, C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>14 </sub>alkylsulphates, C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>14 </sub>alkylcarbonates, benzenesulphonates and benzenecarboxylates. The above di- and tri-carboxylates, di- and tri-sulphonates and carboxysulphonates are thus combinations of one or more carboxylate or sulphonate functions on C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl chains. Non limitative examples thereof are the 1,2,3-nonadecanetricarboxylic acid (three carboxylate functions and a C<sub>19 </sub>alkyl chain), the 2-methyl-2-sulfooctadecanoic acid (one carboxylate function and one sulfonate function and a C<sub>18 </sub>alkyl chain) and the 1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acid (two carboxylate functions and a C<sub>12 </sub>alkyl chain).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkylsulphonates are more specifically cited amongst the C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl-mono-, di- or tri- sulphonates and the C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkylcarboxylates amongst the C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl-mono-, di- or tri- carboxylates,</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Within the above denominations, the alkyl radicals are preferably linear.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Biological buffers can be used as additives according to the invention. Particularly zwitterionic buffer of the Good type can be cited, as CAPS (3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulphonic acid) and CHES (2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulphonic acid).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other zwitterionic biological buffer can be used within the context of the invention. The amino acid buffers are however not intended as a buffer or additive according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferred additives from those cited above are C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkylsulphonates, and of the C<sub>6 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkylsulphonates, octanesulphonate is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">These compounds are known per se and are commercially available. They can be in the acid or salt form.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term “sample in accordance with the invention” means the biological sample to be analysed, diluted with a suitable diluting solution or buffer system, for example, or pure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sample for analysis can be any biological liquid from healthy humans or human patients. The human biological liquids can be normal or abnormal serum, and also haemolysed serum, plasma, urine, or cerebro-spinal fluid. In addition to human biological samples, it is possible to analyse samples of animal origin. The samples can also be synthetic proteins, and the method of the invention is then intended for production control, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The additives of the invention are of particular application for analysing serum, and for separating seric proteins in samples from humans.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In serum samples, the seric proteins to be separated are primarily albumin and the α<sub>1</sub>; α<sub>2</sub>; β (or β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2</sub>); and γ globulin fractions.</p>
