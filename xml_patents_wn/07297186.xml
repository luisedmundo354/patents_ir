<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to dispensing, to receptacles, and to flowable material separation using a supported flexible bag.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following ten United States patents show prior art related to the present invention:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 3,391,409, which issued 9 Jul. 1968 to Gatley, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,699,613, which issued 13 Oct. 1987 to Donawick et al., show relatively small, suspended, untethered flexible bags with drains centrally of their lower sides for dispensing liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,989 issued 17 Jun. 1997 to Ophardt et al., and discloses a box-like dispenser having a collapsible bag, the bag having a central, downward outlet secured to the dispenser and an upper end tensioned or otherwise supported above the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,304, which issued 20 Feb. 1990 to Hallen, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,446, which issued 22 Jan. 1991 to Montgomery et al., disclose flexible bladder receptacles, each receptacle being supported by resting on a surface below the receptacle. The bottom of the bladder of U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,304 is flatly disposed on a concrete “anchor ring” and the bladder is secured by “restraining cables” which pass over the top of the bladder to relieve stress in the bladder material. The bladder of U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,446 is, in accordance with its claim 1, in nonattached disposition within an open top containment vessel which is installed in an elevated position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 1,288,241 issued 17 Dec. 1918 to Smyth and shows an unsuspended, downwardly tethered, inflatable flexible bag for aeronautics.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 6,497,156 issued 24 Dec. 2002 to Dageforde and discloses bags for exhaust and dilution gases collected by pumps, no arrangements being disclosed for supporting or otherwise restraining the bags.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,960 issued 13 Aug. 1991 to Seery and shows a flexible bladder disposed within a storage compartment and provided with a pipe extending into the bladder for conducting flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 4,177,844 issued to Kuss et al. on 11 Dec. 1979 and shows a silo breather bag which communicates with the atmosphere through a flexible conduit and which is suspended by a continuous hanger strap engaged by a plurality of hooks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,171 issued 18 Feb. 2003 to Tateishi et al. and discloses cooling exhaust gas before the gas enters a bag filter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention involves a flexible bag or bladder receptacle for receiving, storing, and dispensing flowable materials including gases, liquids, and particulates.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The bag, typically, has rectangular opposite sides joined in sealed relation along their edges. The bag is suspended, as from a gantry, by an upper edge, the other three edges being unrestrained to the extent that the bag can expand to the fullest possible extent when filled.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Since the bag is substantially unrestrained, except at the above-mentioned upper edge, inlet or outlet flow connections to the bag are made through this upper edge. These flow connections may be made through flexible conduits disposed at this upper edge and extended inwardly thereof to piping structure described below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention includes tethers connected to each of the opposite bag sides and extending downwardly and generally normally therefrom. The length of the tethers may be selected to provide wind stability when the bag is located outdoors. Also, the length of the tethers may be selected so that, when the bag is substantially empty, the tethers limit the minimum volume of the bag to prevent the formation of isolated pockets of material remaining in the bag when it is effectively emptied. The length of the tethers may be selected to provide both wind stability and such limitation of the minimum bag volume.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bag may be suspended so that a lower edge of the bag slopes downwardly to a corner of the bag for drainage of material, such as condensate, from the bag through a flexible connection which does not restrain expansion of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For fluid materials which may be provided at a high rate, filling piping structure is extended within the bag and provided with openings disposed to diffuse the inlet flow for mixing, to minimize material fatigue causing movement of the bag material, and to minimize jet reactions which flex the above-mentioned conduits and cause piping strains.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As another way to limit the minimum volume of the bag and prevent the formation of isolated pockets of material remaining in the bag when it is effectively emptied, the present invention includes piping structure within the bag, typically for inlet and having an “H” configuration with side conduits disposed toward the bag sides and extending diagonally of the bag sides so that the bag sides remain somewhat spaced when the bag is substantially emptied. Openings are provided on the facing regions of the side conduits for outlet of material from the bag when the bag is at its minimum volume with the bag sides against the side conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A receptacle arrangement of the present invention may include cooling spray apparatus and a separator for liquids provided to the bag, the separator having a sump for the separated liquids and recovered spray liquid. The cooling spray may be taken from the sump liquid and an inlet conduit opening thereunder may be provided to prevent reverse flow of gas supplied to the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is an object of the present invention to provide, for flowable materials, a receptacle that is economical in construction, requires a small area, and is convenient to set up and to remove.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object is to provide such a receptacle adapted to receive and to dispense materials that are, variously, hot, wet, and corrosive.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A further object is to provide such a receptacle which fully utilizes the available space when filled and yet retains a minimal amount of material when effectively emptied and in which any such retained material is not disposed in isolated regions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A particular object is to provide such a receptacle which is adapted to receive such materials at a high flow rate and to then dispense the materials at a lower, controlled flow rate for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Still another object is to provide such a receptacle meeting the above and other objects with a flexible bag which may be adapted for mixing of the contents, may be effectively drained, may be exposed to the weather, and in which fatigue of the bag material is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional objects include providing such a flexible bag receptacle adaptable for use with a variety of inlet and outlet arrangements including arrangements for diffusing inlet flow, structures to prevent complete collapse of the bag and isolated pockets of material therein on emptying, and fluid flow structures causing minimal stress to themselves and supporting structures from fluid flow reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other objects include providing such a flexible bag receptacle adaptable for use with auxiliary apparatus to control the temperature and liquid content of inlet fluids, to provide interior access for inspection and maintenance, to protect the receptacle from excessive internal pressure and vacuum, and to prevent undesired reverse flows.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Still other objects include providing receptacles which meet the above objects and which may be fully sealed from the environment and are fully effective for their intended purposes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring more particularly to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> show a tethered, flexible bag and associated apparatus embodying the principles of the present invention. The depicted elements, considered generally, are those elements directly connected with the bag, which is indicated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>, elements forming a gantry <b>11</b> for supporting the bag, and flow elements indicated generally by numeral <b>12</b> for providing flowable material to the bag and for circulating and removing such material from the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bag and associated apparatus are adapted to receive hot, wet, corrosive gas, as is emitted during destruction by burning of materials for rocket propulsion, explosives, and explosive devices, where such gas is generated at a rapid rate and stored in the bag for removal at a lower rate for processing. The depicted bag has a capacity of about 2000 cubic feet (56.6 cubic meters) when fully inflated and may be constructed in any suitable manner from any suitable flexible material, such as that used for military fuel storage bladders, for use with gas at temperatures ranging from ambient to about 180° F. (82° C.). Pressures in the burn chamber will range from about 3 psi (20.7 kpascals) to about 10 psi (68.9 kpascals) and will manifest in the gasholder at pressures of about 0 to about 5 inches H<sub>2</sub>O gage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art of flexible bag receptacles that, in view of the present disclosure, the principles of the present invention may be applied to receptacles of a wide range of capacities and for a variety of received materials, including but not limited to, gases and liquids of all kinds and flowable particulate solids such as those transportable by entrainment in air or other gases. It will also be apparent that, while the described embodiment of the present invention is associated with a separate inlet and outlet for the above-identified gas and with a drain for liquids associated with such gas, other embodiments of the invention may use other inlet and outlet arrangements including a single combined inlet/outlet as well as a large number of openings for different materials and their separation. These arrangements may include a variety of piping, valving, and pumping devices disposed both inside and outside of a flexible bag receptacle embodying the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Gantry <b>11</b> is a representative example of suitable structures for supporting bag <b>10</b>. Such structures may be of conventional construction and may be readily assembled and erected on and removed from any suitable surface <b>15</b>, such as the earth surface, where the bag is to be used. Each end of the gantry has an A-frame <b>16</b>, typically provided with casters, and these frames are connected by an I-beam <b>17</b> which is provided with any suitable bag hangers <b>18</b> spaced along the I-beam.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Bag <b>10</b> has a filled configuration, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> and indicated by numeral <b>20</b>, and has a substantially emptied configuration which is indicated by numeral <b>21</b> and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that, in end view, the bag is flattened in configuration <b>21</b> and can expand therefrom into the pillow-like form of configuration <b>20</b>. As a result and in accordance with the principles of the present invention, the bag fully utilizes the available space on surface <b>15</b> on which the bag and the gantry are disposed and yet retains a minimal amount of flowable material when effectively emptied</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Bag <b>10</b> has opposite side panels or sides <b>25</b> which are sheet-like and generally rectangular, particularly when the bag is in its configuration <b>21</b> where sides <b>25</b> are disposed in a predetermined spaced relation for a purpose subsequently described. These sides are joined in sealed relation along their edges so that the bag, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has an upward edge <b>26</b> toward beam <b>17</b>, an opposite lower edge <b>27</b> toward surface <b>15</b> and opposite end edges <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> toward frames <b>16</b>. For purposes of exposition, edge <b>28</b> is at the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and edge <b>29</b> at the right.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Bag <b>10</b> includes a broad strap or band <b>35</b> fitted over and extending along upward bag edge <b>26</b>. This band is of inverted V-shape as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The open edges of the band are individually attached to the bag sides <b>25</b> and the closed edge of the band is connected to the hangers <b>18</b> which support the bag at its upward edge when the bag is supported from gantry <b>11</b>. Centrally of its length, the band has an opening <b>36</b> for certain of the flow elements <b>12</b> which are subsequently described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, that bag <b>10</b> is suspended from gantry <b>11</b> at the upward edge <b>26</b> of the bag and that the other three bag edges, <b>27</b> through <b>29</b> are unrestrained so that the bag can expand to the fullest possible extent when filled into its configuration <b>20</b>. It is also apparent that bag lower edge <b>27</b> is relatively near surface <b>15</b> when the bag is in its emptied configuration and that this edge is raised substantially above surface <b>15</b> when the bag is in its filled configuration. It is further apparent that gantry <b>11</b> and band <b>35</b> are connected to the bag only at its upward edge.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When a bag incorporating the principles of the present invention is utilized with flowable particulates, liquids or, as with bag <b>10</b>, gases which may contain liquids as droplets or condensate, band <b>35</b> may be configured, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that the bag is suspended with lower edge <b>27</b> of the bag sloping downwardly for drainage toward a corner <b>40</b> of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention includes a plurality of tethers <b>45</b> individually connected by loops at one end to each of the opposite bag sides <b>25</b> by triangular attachment pieces of flexible material spaced generally horizontally along the bag sides and secured thereto, the positions of these pieces in filled configuration <b>20</b> being indicated by numeral <b>47</b> and their positions in substantially emptied configuration <b>21</b> being indicated by numeral <b>48</b>. From these pieces, the tethers extend downwardly in a catenary-like configuration as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; and, as seen in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tethers extend transversely of the bag and generally normally from its sides <b>25</b> to any suitable anchors <b>49</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which fix the opposite tether ends to surface <b>15</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lengths of the tethers corresponding to the positions <b>47</b> are represented fragmentarily for illustrative convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with the present invention, the length of tethers <b>45</b> may be selected so that, as bag <b>10</b> empties, the tethers restrain the sides <b>25</b> so as to limit the minimum volume of the bag to that of its configuration <b>21</b> and thus prevent the formation of isolated pockets of flowable material remaining in the bag when it is effectively emptied. The lengths of the tethers <b>45</b> may also be selected to provide wind stability when the bag is located outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, particularly when <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is considered, that the lengths of tethers <b>45</b> can be selected so that the tethers <b>45</b> provide both wind stability and minimum volume control. For this purpose, the anchor point <b>49</b> at surface <b>15</b> for each tether <b>45</b> is positioned so that the anchor point is the same vector distance from the corresponding filled bag tether attachment position <b>47</b> as the anchor point is from the corresponding emptied bag tether attachment position <b>48</b>. Further, the anchor point positions are selected so that, during transitions of bag <b>10</b> between its filled configuration <b>20</b> and its emptied configuration <b>21</b>, the tethers slacken only minimally as necessary to prevent bag damage and to allow minimal bag shifting from any winds present. When the anchor positions are so selected, the exact curvature of the tethers varies with the materials and dimensions involved, but is, typically, less downwardly than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The tether <b>45</b> material may be selected by one skilled in the art. This material may be elastic, akin to bungie materials or inelastic materials, such as strap materials or cables.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Typically, a bag such as bag <b>10</b> is fitted, as at a side <b>25</b>, with a removable panel <b>50</b> for access to the bag interior for inspection and maintenance and is fitted with a combined vacuum and pressure relief valve <b>51</b>. Such features are well-known and are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in their positions occupied when the bag is in its emptied configuration <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The depicted flow elements <b>12</b> associated with bag <b>10</b> will now be described beginning with rigid, tubular conduits within the bag and attached directly to it at its upward edge below opening <b>36</b> in support band <b>35</b>. These conduits are best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and consist of an interior inlet structure of T-configuration, indicated generally by numeral <b>55</b>, and an interior outlet structure which is indicated generally by numeral <b>56</b> and has an H-configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">T-shaped inlet structure <b>55</b> has a stem <b>60</b> extending downwardly from bag upper edge <b>26</b> and transversely centrally through bag <b>10</b> to a cross arm <b>61</b> disposed at a position which is somewhat above and parallel to lower bag edge <b>27</b>. This cross arm is provided with outlet openings <b>63</b> disposed for mixing of material in the bag as additional material is supplied thereto. Since, as before mentioned, the inlet flow to bag <b>10</b> is at a rapid rate, openings <b>63</b> are also disposed to diffuse the inlet flow to minimize “flapping” of the bag and resulting fatigue of its material. Openings <b>63</b> are also disposed oppositely of cross arm <b>61</b> to minimize jet reactions on structure <b>55</b> which would strain this structure and the bag at edge <b>26</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The depicted structure <b>56</b> is constructed in accordance with the present invention so as to determine the emptied configuration <b>21</b> and corresponding volume of bag <b>10</b> and so prevent the formation of isolated pockets of material remaining in the bag when it is effectively emptied. This structure may be used in place of or together with the above-described arrangement and disposition of tethers <b>45</b> for the same purpose. Neither of these arrangements may be utilized with a bag, corresponding to bag <b>10</b> and embodying the principles of the present invention, for purposes wherein the retention of some material in the bag when it is substantially emptied is not objectionable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, structure <b>56</b> has a first conduit or stem <b>65</b> extending downwardly from bag upper edge <b>26</b> and transversely centrally through bag <b>10</b> beside stem <b>61</b> of structure <b>55</b> to the center of a relatively short cross conduit <b>66</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This cross conduit extends transversely between bag sides <b>25</b> to a pair of second or side conduits <b>67</b> which extend diagonally within the bag, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and extend oppositely of inlet structure stem <b>60</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The stem and cross conduit retain the side conduits in their disposition between the bag sides and provide flow communication between the side conduits and the exterior of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conduits <b>67</b> extend generally between an upper and a lower corner of the bag when in its filled configuration <b>20</b>. Conduits <b>67</b> are thus disposed between bag sides <b>25</b> so that, as may be envisioned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, these conduits are engaged by bag sides <b>25</b> when the bag is emptied and the bag sides remain somewhat spaced and define the substantially emptied configuration <b>21</b> of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is apparent that structure <b>56</b> thus restrains sides <b>25</b> so as to limit the minimum volume of the bag to that of its configuration <b>21</b>, and that conduits <b>67</b> are a pair of rigid members fixedly connected in a disposition wherein these conduits are between the sides <b>25</b>, extend generally parallel to these sides, and are spaced transversely of the sides a distance such that engagement of the sides with said conduits maintains a portion of each side in a position corresponding to the above-mentioned and predetermined spaced relation of the sides when the bag is in the flattened configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Conduits <b>67</b> are provided with a plurality of inlet openings <b>68</b> best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and positioned along and around these conduits. As a result, such openings are provided on the facing regions of the side conduits for outlet of material from the bag when the bag is at its minimum volume and flattened configuration with the bag sides against the side conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Flow connections from outside bag <b>10</b> to structures <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are preferably made through flexible conduits <b>70</b> connected to stems <b>60</b> and <b>65</b> at bag upper edge <b>26</b> and extending upwardly therefrom through opening <b>36</b>. Also, a flexible hose <b>72</b> is connected at one end thereof to bag corner <b>40</b> for a purpose subsequently described. Hose <b>72</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in its disposition corresponding to emptied bag configuration <b>21</b>, it being apparent that the hose end at corner <b>40</b> will be drawn upward with flexing of the hose as the bag expands toward its filled configuration <b>20</b>. It is thus apparent that, due to flexible elements <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, expansion and contraction of bag <b>10</b> is not affected by flow connections to its interior.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The depicted flow elements <b>12</b> associated with bag <b>10</b> and external thereto will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These elements include a separation and collection tower <b>75</b> which is represented as a cylinder extending upwardly from surface <b>15</b> to a conduit <b>77</b> which connects to the one of the flexible conduits <b>70</b> associated with inlet structure <b>85</b>. The lower portion of the tower is used as a liquid-containing sump <b>78</b>. This sump is connected by hose <b>72</b> to bag corner <b>40</b> for drainage of any condensate or other liquid in bag <b>10</b> to the sump.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Fluids for processing by the elements shown in the Figures are provided through a main supply conduit <b>80</b> which enters tower <b>75</b> above the liquid in sump <b>78</b> and turns downwardly to an opening <b>82</b> disposed a short distance, typically a few inches, below the level of this liquid. This arrangement prevents reverse flow into conduit <b>80</b>, since as before stated, the operating pressure of the depicted bag <b>10</b> is a few inches of H<sub>2</sub>O gage pressure. A plurality, not shown, of such inlet conduits may be provided for a corresponding plurality of sources of fluids for bag <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Tower <b>75</b> and conduit <b>80</b> are provided with a representative spray cooling or quench system <b>85</b> for hot gas and other fluids which enter the tower through this conduit. System <b>85</b> draws liquid from sump <b>78</b> by a pump <b>86</b> and discharges the liquid into conduit <b>80</b> through a spray nozzle <b>87</b>. Any suitable valves and automatic controls may be used to control the flow of liquid and thus the temperature of fluids entering bag <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Tower <b>75</b> allows entrained droplets of liquid from system <b>85</b> to separate by gravity and not enter bag <b>10</b>. These droplets thus cannot be drawn into outlet structure <b>86</b> to undesirably affect subsequent processing of gas from the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Bag <b>10</b> is provided with a withdrawal and recirculation system indicated generally by numeral <b>90</b>. This system is only representative of arrangements for withdrawing flowable material from a bag which corresponds to bag <b>10</b> and embodies the principles of the present invention. In other arrangements, there may only be a fluid outlet corresponding to hose <b>72</b> for dispensing of liquids from the bag. In still other arrangements, as for processing of environmentally hazardous gases, flow from the bag may be provided by processing apparatus which is directly connected to the one of the flexible conduits <b>70</b> corresponding to outlet structure <b>56</b> and which applies a vacuum to this structure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The depicted system <b>90</b> includes a blower <b>92</b> which may be of any suitable type and have any suitable disposition, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> on surface <b>15</b>. A bag withdrawal conduit <b>93</b> connects the one of the flexible conduits <b>70</b> corresponding to outlet structure <b>56</b> to the blower. Fluid output from the blower goes to a three-way valve <b>94</b> which selectively provides this output to an exit conduit <b>95</b> for removal from the depicted elements or to a recirculation conduit <b>96</b>. Conduit <b>96</b> conducts material from bag <b>10</b> back to tower <b>75</b>. This recirculation may be to obtain additional separation of liquids in gas from the bag or may be to mix the contents of the bag for analysis or in preparation for processing when the contents are finally withdrawn via exit conduit <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the present invention has been herein shown and described in connection with what is conceived as a preferred embodiment, it is recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention, which is not limited to the illustrative details disclosed and which may be practiced within the scope of the following claims by using certain features of the invention to the exclusion of others.</p>
