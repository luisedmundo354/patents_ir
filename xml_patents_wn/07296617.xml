<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat dissipation device for an electronic device, and particularly to a heat sink having at least a serpentine heat pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Along with the continuous boom of computer industry, an electronic device, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is generating more and more heat. To ensure normal operation of the electronic device, accumulated heat must be removed away in time. Various heat sinks therefore have been devised to dissipate heat from electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a typical heat sink conducts and dissipates heat by metal thermal conduction, and generally comprises a heat spreader for contacting the CPU for absorb heat therefrom and a plurality of fins provided on the heat spreader for dissipating heat. Limited to inherent characteristic of metal and cost consideration, heat conduction is not sufficiently fast and heat is mainly accumulated in the heat spreader. Heat dissipation capability of the heat sink does not satisfy the requirement of a high-powered heat-generating electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Nowadays, heat pipes, due to their excellent heat transfer performance, have been widely applied to heat dissipation of electronic devices. A heat pipe is a sealed metal pipe, with a low-pressure therein, in which a wick structure is formed and working fluid is filled. The heat pipe transfers heat from one end to the other by repeated phase change of working fluid between vapor and liquid states. A heat pipe has a high heat transfer performance due to fast circulation of working fluid and can transfer heat over a long distance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Taiwan patent No. 532758 discloses a typical heat sink using heat pipes. The heat sink comprises a heat spreader for contacting a heat source, a plurality of parallel fins erecting on the heat spreader, and two U-shaped heat pipes attached to the heat spreader and extending through the fins to transfer heat from the heat spreader to the fins. The heat sink draws heat from the heat source via the heat spreader, one part of the heat is directly conducted upward to the fins; the remainder is indirectly transferred to the fins via the heat pipes. Generally, to maximize heat dissipation, the fins are made as large as possible; on the other hand, each heat pipe has a small cross-section size due to the limitations of manufacture cost and method; each of the heat pipes is brought to extend through a small circular hole defined in each fin and contact the fin. The contact between the heat pipes and the fins in the conventional heat sink is not adequate to offer a required heat transferring from the heat pipes to the fins. Vapors in heat pipes cannot sufficiently dissipate their heat to the fins through the contact between the fins and the heat pipes, whereby vapors in the heat pipes cannot totally condense into liquid and flow back to ends of the heat pipes thermally contacting with the heat spreader. Accordingly, utilization of heat transfer of the heat pipes is not high and heat dissipation of the heat sink is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is desired to evolve an improved heat sink to overcome above-mentioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, what is needed is to provide an improved heat sink with heat pipes which has an excellent heat transfer performance by increasing contact area between the heat pipes and fins of the improved heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A heat sink for dissipating heat of an electronic device comprises a base, a first fin group comprising a plurality of fins stacked together, a second fin group comprising a plurality of fins and overlapping the first fin group, and a sinuous heat pipe attached to the base. The first and second fin groups are respectively engaged with the heat pipe twice at different locations of the first and second fin groups. The heat pipe has an evaporating portion engaging with the base and a bottom of the first fin group, a first condensing portion engaging with the a top of the first fin group and a bottom of the second fin group, and a second condensing portion engaging with an upper portion of the second fin group. The evaporating portion and the first and second condensing portions are parallel to each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe a heat sink in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the heat sink in accordance with the present invention is used for mounting to a CPU (not shown) to dissipate heat therefrom. The heat sink comprises a heat spreader <b>10</b>, a fin group <b>20</b> adhered to the heat spreader <b>10</b>, and two heat pipes <b>30</b> attached to the heat spreader <b>10</b> and the fin group <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The heat spreader <b>10</b> is a flat metal plate, preferably made of copper, having a bottom face (not visible) for contacting the CPU and a top face (not labeled) opposite to the bottom face and defining two parallel grooves <b>12</b> each having a semi-circular section.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fin group <b>20</b> is adhered to the top face of the heat spreader <b>10</b> and comprises a first fin group <b>24</b> and a second fin group <b>26</b>. The first fin group <b>24</b> contacts the heat spreader <b>10</b> and comprises a plurality of parallel first fins <b>240</b> stacked together. The first fin group <b>24</b> defines a pair of adjacent grooves <b>244</b> at a bottom thereof and a pair of separate grooves <b>246</b> at a top thereof. The first fin group <b>24</b> defines two sets of flanges <b>242</b> bent perpendicularly from top and bottom edges of the first fins <b>240</b> for spacing adjacent first fins <b>240</b>. The grooves <b>244</b> are so defined that they cooperate with the grooves <b>12</b> to form two straight pipe-shaped passages when the bottom flanges <b>242</b> are attached to the top face of the heat spreader <b>10</b>. When the first fin group <b>24</b> is mounted on the heat spreader <b>10</b>, the fins <b>240</b> extend vertically upwardly from the heat spreader <b>10</b>. The second fin group <b>26</b> is mounted on and overlaps the first fin group <b>24</b>. The second fin group <b>26</b> comprises a plurality of parallel second fins <b>260</b> stacked together. The second fin group <b>26</b> and the first fin group <b>24</b> are combined together in such a manner that the first fins <b>240</b> are parallel to the second fins <b>260</b>. The second fin group <b>26</b> defines a pair of separate grooves <b>266</b> at a bottom thereof and a pair of separate slots <b>264</b> adjacent a top thereof. Two sets of flanges <b>262</b> are bent perpendicularly from top and bottom edges of the second fins <b>260</b> for spacing adjacent second fins <b>260</b>. An annular collar <b>268</b> is perpendicularly extended from each second fin <b>260</b> at a circumference of each slot <b>264</b>. The grooves <b>266</b> are so defined that they cooperate with the grooves <b>246</b> to form two straight pipe-shaped passages when the bottom flanges <b>262</b> are engaged with the top flanges <b>242</b> of first fin group <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The heat pipes <b>30</b> each are bent to have an S-shaped configuration and comprises three parallel horizontal portions, namely, an evaporating portion <b>32</b>, a first condensing portion <b>34</b> and a second condensing portion <b>36</b>, accordingly to their functions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The evaporating portion <b>32</b> is accommodated in said passage between the heat spreader <b>10</b> and the first fin group <b>24</b> and is thermally engaged with the heat spreader <b>10</b> and the first fin group <b>24</b>. The evaporating portion <b>32</b> contacts with the flanges <b>242</b> at the bottom of the first fin group <b>24</b> forming a corresponding groove <b>244</b>. The first condensing portion <b>34</b> extends through the passage between the first fin group <b>24</b> and the second fin group <b>26</b>, and thermally engages with the first fin group <b>24</b> and the second fin group <b>26</b>. The first condensing portion <b>34</b> contacts with the flanges <b>242</b> at the top of the first fin group <b>24</b> forming a corresponding groove <b>246</b> and the flanges <b>262</b> at the bottom of the second fin group <b>26</b> forming a corresponding groove <b>266</b>. The second condensing portion <b>36</b> extends through the slot <b>264</b> of the second fin group <b>26</b> and thermally engages with the second fin group. The second condensing portion <b>36</b> contacts with the collars <b>268</b> of the second fin group <b>26</b> forming a corresponding slot <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To ensure that heat can be effectively transferred from the heat spreader <b>10</b> to the heat pipes <b>30</b> and evenly distributed in the fin group <b>20</b>, the evaporating portions <b>32</b> of the heat pipes <b>30</b> are intimately attached to the middle portion of the heat spreader <b>10</b> and the condensing portions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> extend through the fin group <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When applied to the CPU, the heat sink draws heat from the CPU via the heat spreader <b>10</b>. Part of the heat is straightway conducted to the bottom of the first fin group <b>24</b> for dissipation. The other of the heat is transferred along the heat pipes <b>30</b> to the top of the first fin group <b>24</b> and the bottom of the second fin group <b>26</b> via the first condensing portion <b>34</b>, and to the upper portion of the second fin group <b>26</b> via the second condensing portion <b>36</b>, and then dissipated to the surrounding air by the fins <b>240</b>, <b>260</b>. Each fin group <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> absorbs heat from the heat pipes <b>30</b> at multi-points. Heat transfer from the heat pipes <b>30</b> to the fin group <b>20</b> is remarkably increased due to increased contact area between the heat pipes and the fins; accordingly, heat dissipation efficiency of the heat sink is improved/enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is easy to modify the heat sink in accordance with the present invention by removing the heat spreader <b>10</b> from the heat sink, whereby a direct heat transfer path is established between the evaporating portions <b>32</b> of the heat pipes <b>30</b> and the CPU. In this situation, it is preferred that the evaporating portions <b>32</b> of the heat pipes <b>30</b> is processed to have a flat face coplanar with the bottom flanges <b>242</b> of the first fin group <b>24</b> so as to have a better contact with the CPU.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is also clearly seen that the heat pipes <b>30</b> can be shaped to other configuration and contacts the first and second fin groups <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> more than twice for establishing a more effective heat transfer from the heat pipe <b>30</b> to the fin group <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is believed that the present invention and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p>
