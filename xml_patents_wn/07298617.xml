<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to cooling apparatuses and methods for removing heat generated by electronics components (e.g., devices, modules, systems, etc.) and to methods of constructing such cooling apparatuses. More particularly, the present invention relates to cooling apparatuses and methods for extracting heat from heat generating electronics components of a multi-component electronics module.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is known, operating electronic devices produce heat. This heat should be removed from the devices in order to maintain device junction temperatures within desirable limits. Failure to remove the heat thus produced results in increased device temperatures, potentially leading to thermal runaway conditions. Several trends in the electronics industry have combined to increase the importance of thermal management, including heat removal for electronics devices, including technologies where thermal management has traditionally been less of a concern, such as CMOS. In particular, the need for faster and more densely packed circuits has had a direct impact on the importance of thermal management. First, power dissipation, and therefore heat production, increases as device operating frequencies increase. Second, increased operating frequencies may be possible at lower device junction temperatures. Further, as more and more devices are packed onto a single chip, power density (Watts/cm<sup>2</sup>) increases, resulting in the need to remove more power from a given size chip or module. These trends have combined to create applications where it is no longer desirable to remove heat from modern devices solely by traditional air cooling methods, such as by using traditional air cooled heat sinks. These trends are likely to continue, furthering the need for alternatives to traditional air cooling methods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One approach to avoiding the limitations of traditional air cooling is to use a cooling liquid. As is known, different liquids provide different cooling capabilities. In particular, liquids such as refrigerants or other dielectric fluids (e.g., fluorocarbon fluid) exhibit relatively poor thermal conductivity and specific heat properties, i.e., when compared to liquids such as water or other aqueous fluids. Dielectric liquids have an advantage, however, in that they may be placed in direct physical contact with electronic devices and interconnects without adverse affects such as corrosion or electrical short circuits. For example, U.S. Pat No. 6,052,284, entitled “Printed Circuit Board with Electronic Devices Mounted Thereon”, describes an apparatus in which a dielectric liquid flows over and around several, operating electronic devices, thereby removing heat from the devices. Similar approaches are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,655,290, entitled “Method for Making a Three-Dimensional Multichip Module” and U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,663, entitled “Cooling System for Electronic Assembly”.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other cooling liquids, such as water or other aqueous liquids, exhibit superior thermal conductivity and specific heat compared to dielectric liquids. Water-based coolants, however, must be kept from physical contact with electronic devices and interconnects, since corrosion and electrical short circuit problems are likely to result from such contact. Various methods have been disclosed for using water-based coolants, while providing physical separation between the coolant and the electronic devices. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,146, entitled “Apparatus for Cooling High-Density Integrated Circuit Packages”, discloses the use of a conductive foil barrier; U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,629, entitled “Liquid Cooled Multi-chip Integrated Circuit Module Incorporating A Seamless Compliant Member for Leakproof Operation”, and IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 20, No. 2, Jul. 1977, entitled “Liquid Cooled Module with Compliant Membrane”, disclose the use of a flexible barrier with thermal conduction enhancements (thermal studs and heatsinks, respectively); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,032, entitled “Apparatus for Cooling High-Density Integrated Circuit Packages”, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,830, entitled “Apparatus for Indirect Impingement Cooling of Integrated Circuit Chips”, disclose the use of flexible barriers, where pistons are used to maintain contact between the barrier and the devices to be cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Notwithstanding the above, there remains a large and significant need to provide further useful cooling apparatus enhancements for facilitating cooling of electronic modules, and particularly multi-chip modules.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, “heat generating electronics component” may comprise any component of a computer system or other electronic system requiring cooling, and includes one or more integrated circuit devices, semiconductor chips, or other electronic circuitry requiring cooling. The “surface to be cooled” refers to a surface of the heat generating electronics component itself, or to an exposed surface of a thermal spreader, passivation layer, or other surface in thermal contact with the electronics component, and through which heat generated by the electronics component is to be extracted. A “micro-scaled cooling structure” means a cooling structure or cold plate with a characteristic dimension of 200 microns or less. A “biasing mechanism” refers to any biasing structure, such as one or more springs, leafs, etc., with a single spring arrangement per cold plate being illustrated in one embodiment provided herein by way of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One example of coolant for a cooling apparatus in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is water. However, the concepts disclosed herein are readily adapted for use with other types of liquid coolant. For example, one or more of the coolants may comprise a brine, a fluorocarbon liquid, a liquid metal, or other similar coolant, or a refrigerant, while still maintaining the advantages and unique features of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As noted briefly above, power levels in computer equipment (primarily processors) are rising to a level to where they no longer can simply be air cooled. These components will likely be water cooled. Heat dissipated by the processor can be transferred to water via a water cooled cold plate, certain embodiments of which are described in the above-incorporated, co-pending United States Patent Application entitled “Cooling System and Method Employing a Closed Loop Coolant Path and Micro-Scaled Cooling Structure within an Electronics Subsystem of an Electronics Rack”. Further, power produced by leakage current within electronics components is now of the same order as the switching power for the components, and is a strong function of temperature; that is, the lower the temperature, the lower the leakage current/power.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Generally stated, provided herein is a very high thermal performance cooled electronics module, such as a multichip module. High performance micro-scaled cooling structures or cold plates are beginning to exist in the industry, but are geared for single-chip operation. Disclosed herein are various aspects by which these high performance cold plates are individually mounted or attached to multiple electronics components within an electronics module. Further, an enclosure with a common manifold is provided for distributing coolant in parallel to the individual cold plates. Methods of assembly and disassembly are also described, which facilitate an electronics component rework capability.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to the drawings, wherein the same reference numbers used through multiple figures designate the same or similar elements, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> depicts one embodiment of a cooled electronics module, generally denoted <b>100</b>, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. This module includes a substrate <b>110</b>, which may include conductive wiring (not shown) on an upper surface thereof and/or embedded therein. One or more electronics components <b>120</b> are electrically connected to the electrical wiring of substrate <b>110</b> via, for example, solder ball connections <b>121</b>. Multiple discrete cold plates <b>130</b> each have a first surface <b>131</b> configured to couple to the surface to be cooled of a respective electronics component <b>120</b>. Various techniques can be employed to couple each cold plate to its respective electronics component. For example, each discrete cold plate can be fabricated of copper and attached to its respective electronics component by a thermally conductive adhesive or via a suitable solder, such as an indium or an indium-based alloy solder. An example of a suitable thermally conductive adhesive is Ablebond 965-1L, manufactured by Ablestik Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, Calif., while indium solder can be obtained from the Indium Corporation of America, Utica, N.Y. A soldered interface is advantageous in providing a lower thermal resistance, and facilitates reworking of electronics components. In alternate embodiments, one or more of the cold plates could comprise a composite metal structure, or a ceramic material if a thermally conductive adhesive is employed as the cold plate-to-electronics component interface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts one embodiment of a cold plate <b>130</b>, useful in a cooling apparatus in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, cold plate <b>130</b> is a coolant-cooled cold plate configured with a coolant inlet <b>131</b> and a coolant outlet <b>132</b> with at least one coolant chamber <b>133</b> disposed between the coolant inlet and the coolant outlet. Various other cold plate embodiments may also be employed, including, for example, jet orifice cold plates and cold plates having multiple parallel channels between the coolant inlet and the coolant outlet. Further, as noted above, each cold plate may comprise a micro-scaled cooling structure, with a characteristic dimension of 200 microns or less.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a plurality of coolant-carrying tubes <b>140</b> extend from cold plates <b>130</b> and couple cold plates <b>130</b> in fluid communication with an inlet plenum <b>162</b> and an outlet plenum <b>164</b> of an enclosure comprising a cap <b>150</b> and a manifold <b>160</b>. As shown, at least two coolant-carrying tubes <b>140</b> extend from a second surface <b>132</b> of each cold plate <b>130</b>. The coolant-carrying tubes <b>140</b> are, in one embodiment, identical cylindrical tubes having a common geometric cross-section, e.g., circular, square, rectangular, etc. In the embodiment shown, tubes <b>140</b> project normal to second surface <b>132</b> of the associated cold plate <b>130</b>, and may be formed integral with the associated cold plate or sealed thereto. Alternatively, coolant-carrying tubes <b>140</b> may be of two or more differing cross-sections, in either or both geometry and size. For example, both tubes extending from a cold plate may be cylindrical, but one tube may be larger in flow cross-sectional area, or one tube may be cylindrical and the other tube square, or elliptical in cross-section. As a further example, one tube may be cylindrical and smaller in cross-sectional area, while the other tube may be elliptical and larger in cross-sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Cap <b>150</b> is configured with a plurality of bores (or openings) <b>151</b>, with each bore being sized and located to at least partially receive a respective coolant-carrying tube <b>140</b> extending from a cold plate <b>130</b> aligned beneath the bore. Each tube <b>140</b> is sealed to an inner wall of cap <b>150</b> defining the respective bore <b>151</b> by a sealant, which in this embodiment, comprises a double O-ring or equivalent elastomeric seal <b>152</b> disposed between the tube and the cap <b>150</b>. To facilitate positioning of the O-rings, multiple circumferential grooves <b>154</b> are provided in the outer surface portion of each tube <b>140</b> disposed within the associated bore. Although shown as a double O-ring for reliability, the sealant could alternatively be a single O-ring if desired. The purpose of the sealant is to isolate the coolant from directly contacting the electronics components and their interconnect wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional plan view of the electronics module <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> taken along line <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>B through manifold <b>160</b> of the enclosure. In this embodiment, a single inlet plenum <b>162</b> and a single outlet plenum <b>164</b> are provided within manifold <b>160</b>. A single coolant inlet <b>163</b> feeds coolant to inlet plenum <b>162</b>, while a single coolant outlet <b>165</b> exhausts coolant from outlet plenum <b>164</b>. Each plenum <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> includes a plurality of fingers or coolant distribution passages which extend over each coolant-carrying cold plate <b>130</b>. The fingers of each plenum expose a central flow passage of each tube, with a first set of tubes <b>161</b> shown in fluid communication with inlet plenum <b>162</b>, and a second set of tubes <b>167</b> in fluid communication with outlet plenum <b>164</b>. Note that in this embodiment, each exposed tube <b>161</b>, <b>167</b> is shown to comprise an identically-sized coolant flow passage. In alternate embodiments, the coolant-carrying tubes could be differently sized (and/or shaped) to facilitate the delivery of different amounts of coolant to different cold plates with different coolant flow characteristics within the electronics module. A further variation of this concept is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A &amp; 4B</figref>, and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref>, cap <b>150</b> can be fabricated of any suitably strong metal or plastic. Manifold <b>160</b> can either be metallurgically, mechanically or chemically attached to cap <b>150</b>, depending on the choice of cap material, and the type of seal desired between the cap and the manifold. For example, if the cap were to be made of copper or aluminum, the manifold could be brazed to the cap employing a copper-to-copper braze or an aluminum-to-aluminum braze. Further, the cooling apparatus includes an enclosure, comprising cap <b>150</b> and manifold <b>160</b>, which has a perimeter region that engages substrate <b>110</b> to form an at least partially enclosed cavity <b>157</b>, with the multiple heat generating electronics components <b>120</b> and the multiple cold plates <b>130</b> disposed within cavity <b>157</b>. Thus, the cooling apparatus and electronics assembly together define a cooled electronics module.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an alternative embodiment of a cooled electronics module <b>300</b> having the same or similar components to those described above in connection with the electronics module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref>. A substrate <b>110</b> again supports multiple heat generating electronics components <b>120</b>, each of which has coupled thereto a cold plate <b>130</b>. Extending from each discrete cold plate <b>130</b> are at least two tubes <b>140</b>, each in fluid communication with one of the inlet plenum <b>162</b> and outlet plenum <b>164</b> configured in the enclosure comprising cap <b>150</b> and manifold <b>160</b>. Again, cap <b>150</b> has a perimeter region for engaging substrate <b>110</b> to form an at least partially enclosed cavity <b>157</b> within which the multiple electronics components <b>120</b> and multiple cold plates <b>130</b> are disposed. In this embodiment, cap <b>150</b> is again configured with a plurality of bores <b>151</b>, each of which is sized and located to at least partially receive a respective coolant-carrying tube <b>140</b> extending from aligned cold plate <b>130</b>. In this alternate embodiment, each tube <b>140</b> is sealed to the inner wall of the associated bore <b>151</b> via a soldered annular seal <b>305</b> disposed between the outer surface of each tube and the inner wall of cap <b>150</b> defining bore <b>151</b>. Beveling at an upper portion of each bore <b>151</b> facilitates positioning of solder <b>305</b> between each tube <b>140</b> and the respective inner wall of cap <b>150</b>. In this embodiment, cap <b>150</b> might comprise copper, as would tubes <b>140</b>. Further, as with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref>, cold plates <b>130</b> may be attached to the respective electronics components <b>120</b> via an appropriate thermally conductive adhesive, or a metallurgical joint.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As referenced above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A &amp; 4B</figref> depict a further embodiment of an electronics module <b>400</b> in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Similar to the above-referenced embodiments, module <b>400</b> includes a substrate <b>110</b>, which supports multiple heat generating electronics components <b>120</b>, each of which has coupled thereto a cold plate <b>130</b>. Extending from each discrete cold plate <b>130</b> are at least two tubes <b>140</b>, each in fluid communication with one of the inlet plenum <b>162</b> and outlet plenum <b>164</b> configured in the enclosure comprising cap <b>150</b> and manifold <b>160</b>. Again, cap <b>150</b> has a perimeter region for engaging substrate <b>110</b> to form an at least partially enclosed cavity <b>157</b> within which the multiple electronics components <b>120</b> and multiple cold plates <b>130</b> are disposed. In this embodiment, cap <b>150</b> is configured with a plurality of bores <b>151</b>, each of which is sized and located to at least partially receive a respective coolant-carrying tube <b>140</b> extending from an aligned cold plate <b>130</b>. Each tube <b>140</b> is sealed to an inner wall of cap <b>150</b> defining the respective bore <b>151</b> by a sealant, which in this embodiment, comprises a double O-ring or equivalent elastomeric seal <b>152</b> disposed between the tube and the cap <b>150</b>. To facilitate positioning of the O-rings, multiple circumferential grooves <b>154</b> are provided in the outer surface portion of each tube <b>140</b> disposed within the associated bore. Further, as with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref>, cold plates <b>130</b> may be attached to the respective electronics components <b>120</b> via appropriate thermally conductive adhesive, or a metallurgical joint.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, electronics module <b>400</b> further includes an orifice plate <b>405</b> disposed between cap <b>150</b> and manifold <b>160</b>. This orifice plate is a customized flow plate that allows for the tailoring of coolant flow through the individual cold plates <b>130</b>. As shown, plate <b>405</b> is configured with different sized openings which align with different coolant-carrying tubes <b>140</b>, thereby tailoring the flow through the tubes either from inlet plenum <b>162</b> or to outlet plenum <b>164</b>. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A &amp; 4B</figref>, an opening <b>410</b> is provided in orifice plate <b>405</b>, which aligns between inlet plenum <b>162</b> and a first, leftmost coolant-carrying tube <b>140</b>, while a second opening <b>412</b> is provided in orifice plate <b>405</b> to align between outlet plenum <b>164</b> and a second coolant-carrying tube <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, openings <b>410</b> &amp; <b>412</b> are similarly sized. In the middle of the module, a smaller opening <b>420</b> is provided in orifice plate <b>405</b> between inlet plenum <b>162</b> and a tube <b>140</b> in communication with the inlet of the center cold plate <b>130</b>, while a slightly larger opening <b>422</b> is aligned between outlet plenum <b>164</b> and tube <b>140</b> in fluid communication with the coolant outlet of this cold plate. By differently sizing the openings, the pressure drop and the flow rate of fluid through the cold plate can also be controlled, in addition to the amount of fluid in the cold plate. Orifice plate <b>405</b> further includes an opening <b>430</b> aligned between inlet plenum <b>162</b> and a corresponding tube <b>140</b> coupled in fluid communication with the coolant inlet for the rightmost cold plate <b>130</b>, and an opening <b>432</b> aligned between outlet plenum <b>164</b> and a second tube <b>140</b> in fluid communication with the coolant outlet of the rightmost cold plate <b>130</b>. Although of equal size, these openings are shown to be of smaller size than the openings <b>410</b> &amp; <b>412</b> for the leftmost cold plate illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Advantageously, employing an orifice plate to tailor the coolant flow through the multiple cold plates allows for a single sized coolant carrying tube to be employed throughout the module, while still allowing for tailoring of the cooling achieved by each cold plate, which would be advantageous should the heat generating capacity of the electronics components differ when in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> are multiple springs <b>450</b>, each disposed between a respective cold plate <b>130</b> and cap <b>150</b>. If the interface between cold plates <b>130</b> and electronics components <b>120</b> is a compliant thermal interface (e.g., a paste, grease, oil or gel interface), a biasing mechanism, such as springs <b>450</b>, may be used to provide a desired force against the cold plates to ensure a favorable thermal contact between each cold plate and its respective electronics component, as well as provide cold plate compliance which allows the electronics components to vary in height and/or orientation within the electronics assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various methods of fabrication of an electronics module and/or cooling apparatus such as described above can be employed. The particular fabrication or assembly approach depends upon, in one embodiment, the type of tube-to-cap seal to be employed. If O-ring seals similar to that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref> or <b>4</b>A &amp; <b>4</b>B are employed, and the O-rings can withstand the cold plate-to-electronics component interface reflow/curing temperature, then the tubes affixed to the cold plate are partially inserted into the cap, and the cap assembly is brought down onto the substrate to cause the cold plates to contact the electronics components. This intermediate assembly is then taken through the appropriate temperature cycle to make the cold plate-to-electronics component joint. Springs can be added between the cold plates and the cap to ensure good contact at the cold plate-electronics component interface. Alternatively, if the manifold is already in place above the cap, the manifold could be pressurized using air or an inert gas. Pressurizing the manifold region results in a net force on the cold plates that will cause the cold plates to be in compression with the electronics components, thus assuring a properly formed low thermal interface joint. If the O-ring seal cannot withstand the desired joining temperature, then a separate fixture can be used to position and join the cold plates to the electronics components without the O-rings present. The O-rings would then be added to the coolant-carrying tubes, and finally the cap or cap/manifold assembly would be placed onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the solder seal version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is to be employed, then assembly depends on the reflow temperature of the tube-to-cap joint/seal. If the reflow temperature of this seal is less than that for the cold plate-electronics component joint, then the cold plates would be joined to the electronics components first using the proper fixturing, and then the cold plate tubes would be joined to the cap in a second operation. Note that it is assumed in this discussion that the coolant-carrying tubes are affixed to or integral with the cold plates. If the tube-cap joint reflow temperature is higher than that of the cold plate-electronics component joint, then the cap-cold plate-module subassembly can be reflowed in one step.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Electronics module disassembly for component rework is also possible. For an O-ring seal version such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A &amp; 1B</figref> or <b>4</b>A &amp; <b>4</b>B, the cap and manifold subassembly can be removed, leaving the cold plates on the electronics components, with the cold plates then being removed from the electronics components prior to component rework. For the soldered seal version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the tube-cap joint reflow temperature is less than the joining temperature at the cold plate-electronics component interface, then a reflow and cap/manifold removal can be performed first, followed by the cold plate removal employing the different reflow temperatures. If the tube-cap joint reflow temperature is higher than that of the cold plate-electronics component interface, then only one reflow step is required to remove the cooling apparatus from the electronics assembly.</p>
