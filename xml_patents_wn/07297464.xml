<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a radiation curable composition, a storing method thereof, a forming method of a cured film, a patterning method, an use of a pattern, electronic components and an optical waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As insulating films for use in LSIs and PDPs there have conventionally been used SiO<sub>2 </sub>films formed by CVD methods, and organic SOG (Spin On Glass) or inorganic SOG films formed by coating methods, because of their excellent heat resistance and electrical reliability. With insulating films of the prior art, however, it is impossible to directly form wiring grooves or contact holes, and usually a photoresist is patterned on the insulating film, followed by either dry etching with plasma or wet etching with a chemical solution, after which the film is subjected to a resist removal step or washing step to form a pattern. On the other hand, imparting photosensitive properties to an insulating film material with excellent heat resistance, electrical reliability and transparency eliminates the need for the resist material required in the steps mentioned above, thereby allowing the plasma dry etching, chemical solution wet etching, resist removal and washing steps to be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years there have been proposed radiation curing polysiloxane materials with excellent heat resistance, electrical reliability and transparency. For example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-148895 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-24696 there are disclosed photosensitive resin compositions comprising an alkali-soluble siloxane polymer, a photoacid generator and a solvent, from which the water and catalyst have been removed. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-181069 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-72502 disclose photosensitive polysilazane compositions comprising polysilazane and a photoacid generator. Also, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-288364 discloses a radiation curable composition comprising a hydrolyzable silane compound, a photoacid generator and an acid diffusion controller.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the present inventors conducted a detailed investigation of patterning using such conventional insulating film materials imparted with photosensitive properties, it was found that when employing the photosensitive resin compositions comprising an alkali-soluble siloxane polymer, a photoacid generator and a solvent, from which the water and catalyst have been removed as disclosed in Patent documents 1 and 2, for example, a large light exposure dose is required in both cases, and therefore mass production cannot be advantageously accomplished. In addition, when using the photosensitive polysilazane compositions comprising polysilazane and a photoacid generator, as disclosed in Patent documents 3 and 4, the light exposure dose is low but the steps of dipping in purified water after exposure or steps requiring humidification treatment are obviously complicated, making it difficult to obtain high pattern precision. On the other hand, when using a radiation curable composition comprising a hydrolyzable silane compound, a photoacid generator and an acid diffusion controller, as disclosed in Patent document 5, the acid diffusion controller controls diffusion of the acid generated by the radiation, thereby allowing the pattern precision of the silane compound to be increased. Nevertheless, since the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the acid, the curing property is impaired in cases with a low amount of photoacid generator or a low exposure dose, thereby often leading to lower pattern precision. Conversely, increasing the exposure dose in an attempt to improve the patterning precision is clearly an unsuitable strategy for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was accomplished in light of the circumstances described above, and it provides a radiation curable composition which yields a cured product with excellent pattern precision even with a relatively low light exposure dose, a method for its storage, a forming method of a cured film and a patterning method, as well as an use of a pattern, electronic components and an optical waveguide which employ the above.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When forming patterns by generation of acid with radiation according to the prior art, the generated acid is inactivated with an acid diffusion controller to improve the pattern precision. This requires an increased exposure dose for generation of extra acid to compensate for the inactivation, and therefore it has been difficult to achieve both improvement in pattern precision and reduction in exposure dose.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Different strategies that have been considered for controlling diffusion of acid, other than by inactivation of the acid with an acid diffusion controller, include the strategy of reducing the exposure dose to reduce the amount of acid generated, lowering the temperature of the post-exposure baking (PEB) step after exposure, or eliminating the PEB step. However, the basic concepts of such strategies have not been elucidated, nor have radiation curable compositions suited for such strategies existed. A radiation curable composition suited for such strategies would allow formation of highly precise patterns without using an acid diffusion controller. Nevertheless, when patterning is carried out using conventional radiation curable compositions, reducing the amount of acid generated prevents curing from proceeding to an adequate degree. In addition, curing of the exposed sections also fails to adequately proceed when the temperature of the post-exposure baking (PEB) step after exposure is lowered or PEB is not carried out. As a result, it has been difficult to form highly precise patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result of much diligent research, the present inventors have completed the present invention after finding that the various problems of the prior art can be overcome by a radiation curable composition comprising specific components, a forming method of a cured film and a patterning method.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a radiation curable composition comprising (a): a siloxane resin, (b): a photoacid generator or photobase generator, (c): a solvent capable of dissolving component (a), and (d): a curing acceleration catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the siloxane resin includes a resin obtainable by hydrolytic condensation of a compound represented by the following general formula (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sup>1</sup><sub>n</sub>SiX<sub>4-n</sub>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein R<sup>1 </sup>represents an H or F atom, a group containing a B, N, Al, P, Si, Ge or Ti atom, or a C1-20 organic group, X represents a hydrolyzable group and n represents an integer of 0-2, with the proviso that when n is 2, each R<sup>1 </sup>may be the same or different, and when n is 0-2, each X may be the same or different.
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention still further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the curing acceleration catalyst is an onium salt. An onium salt is preferred because it can improve the electrical properties and mechanical strength of the obtained cured film, while also increasing the stability of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention still further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the curing acceleration catalyst is a quaternary ammonium salt. Using a quaternary ammonium salt as the curing acceleration catalyst will more notably produce the aforementioned effects of improving the electrical properties and mechanical strength while increasing the stability of the composition.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The mechanism responsible for the exhibited effect of the invention, which has not been achieved in the prior art, is not yet fully understood. However, the present inventors conjecture that the reduced exposure dose required for ensuring adequately excellent pattern precision is realized because, for example, there is no need to use an acid diffusion controller to inhibit diffusion of generated acid, and a curing acceleration catalyst is further included as an additive.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The improvement in pattern precision is assumed to result because curing of the radiation curable composition occurs before diffusion of the acid or base when a curing acceleration catalyst is used as an additive. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of the prior art, whereby the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the generated acid to improve the pattern precision. According to the invention, it is conjectured that both pattern precision improvement and exposure dose reduction is achieved based on the aforementioned mechanism which is different from that of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The radiation curable composition, method for its storage, forming method of a cured film and patterning method of the invention can produce cured films with excellent pattern precision at relatively low exposure doses. The present invention is therefore useful for uses of a pattern, electronic components and optical waveguides.</p>

If the amount used is less than 0.0001 wt %, the photocuring property will tend to be reduced or a greater exposure dose will tend to be necessary for curing, while if it exceeds 50 wt %, the stability and film-forming property of the composition will tend to be inferior, and the electrical properties and process adaptability of the cured film will tend to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0086">A photosensitizing agent may be used together with the aforementioned photoacid generator or photobase generator. Using a photosensitizing agent will allow efficient absorption of the radiation energy beam, thereby improving the sensitivity of the photoacid generator or photobase generator.

The lower limit for the temperature is preferably above the congealing point of the solvent in the radiation curable composition, and more preferably −50° C.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0089">Component (c) is a solvent capable of dissolving component (a), and as examples there may be mentioned aprotic solvents and protic solvents, although an aprotic solvent is preferably included. It is the conjecture of the present inventors that an aprotic solvent is probably effective for reducing the exposure dose and improving the pattern precision.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0090">Protic solvents, typically alcohols, have a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom exhibiting high electronegativity. Consequently, the protic solvent molecules solvate by forming hydrogen bonds with nucleophilic reagents and the like. Specifically, since protic solvents solvate with siloxane resins obtained by hydrolysis of compounds represented by general formula (1), the solvent molecules must be removed in order to condense the siloxane resin, as they tend to inhibit curing at low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0091">Aprotic solvents, on the other hand, are solvents without hydrogen atoms on highly electronegative elements, and are therefore less a cause of reaction inhibition than are protic solvents. Consequently, curing reaction proceeds with generation of acidic active substances and basic active substances at the exposed sections, thereby minimizing any reduction in pattern precision due to diffusion of the acid or base, so that the pattern precision is improved. This is a different mechanism from that of the prior art whereby the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the generated acid to improve the pattern precision. It is believed that this mechanism is responsible for the greater effects of improved pattern precision and reduced exposure dose exhibited when an aprotic solvent is added to component (c).</p>

From the standpoint of sensitivity and pattern precision during pattern formation and mechanical strength of the cured film, ether-based solvents, ester-based solvents, ether acetate-based solvents and ketone-based solvents are preferred. Solvents containing no nitrogen are also preferred. Among these, it is the opinion of the present inventors that ether acetate-based solvents are the most preferable, ether-based solvents are the second most preferable, and ketone-based solvents are the third most preferable. They may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0093">When the stability of the radiation curable composition is considered, component (c) is preferably soluble in water or has the solubility of water, and more preferably it is soluble in water and has the solubility of water. Thus, a protic solvent is preferably added when the aprotic solvent is not soluble in water or does not have the solubility of water. When the aprotic solvent is not soluble in water or does not have the solubility of water, and contains no protic solvent, the compatibility with the solvent of component (a) will be reduced, tending to lower the stability. However, if sensitivity is desired even at the expense of some degree of stability, a smaller amount of protic solvent is preferred.</p>

These may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0095">The proportion of the aprotic solvent used is preferably at least 50 wt %, more preferably at least 70 wt %, even more preferably at least 90 wt % and most preferably at least 95 wt % of the total solvent. If the proportion is too low, the exposed sections will tend to be inadequately cured with a low exposure dose. A low proportion may also require heat treatment at high temperature for adequate curing, while diffusion of the generated acid or base will be more likely and the pattern precision will tend to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0096">The method of using component (c) is not particularly restricted, and for example, it may be a method of using it as a solvent for preparation of component (a), an addition method or a solvent-exchange method after preparation of component (a), or a method of adding the solvent (c) after removing component (a) by solvent distillation or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0097">The radiation curable composition of the invention may also contain water if necessary, but preferably in a range which does not impair the desired characteristics. The amount of water used is preferably no greater than 10 wt %, more preferably no greater than 5 wt % and even more preferably no greater than 2 wt % with respect to the total amount of the radiation curable composition. If the amount of water used exceeds 10 wt %, the coatability and coating solution stability will tend to be inferior. Although the exact reason is unknown, addition of a small amount of water can sometimes permit reduction of the exposure dose.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0098">The amount of solvent used (the total of the aprotic solvent and protic solvent) is preferably an amount which gives a concentration of 3-60 wt % for component (a) (siloxane resin) If the amount of solvent is excessive so that the concentration of component (a) is less than 3 wt %, it will tend to be difficult to form a cured film with the desired film thickness, while if the amount of solvent is insufficient so that the concentration of component (a) is greater than 60 wt %, the film-forming property of the cured film will be poor and the stability of the composition itself will tend to be reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&lt;Component (d)&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0099">Component (d) according to the invention is a curing acceleration catalyst, and its addition to the radiation curing composition can presumably heighten the effect of reducing the amount of photoacid generator or photobase generator, the effect of reducing the exposure dose or the effect of lowering the PEB temperature. The curing acceleration catalyst differs from an ordinary photoacid generator or photobase generator for component (b) which generates an active substance by light. It will therefore usually be distinguished from an onium salt used as the photoacid generator or photobase generator. Nevertheless, a material which comprises both the photoacid generator or photobase generator and the curing acceleration catalyst may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0100">The catalyst may be a specific one which does not exhibit a catalytic effect in solution but exhibits its activity in the coating after application. Presumably, since the curing reaction accelerated by the curing acceleration catalyst proceeds simultaneously with generation of an acidic active substance or basic active substance at the exposed sections, the reduction in the pattern precision due to diffusion of the acid or base is further inhibited, or in other words, the pattern precision is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0101">A process for determining the curing acceleration catalyst power of the curing acceleration catalyst will now be explained in four steps.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0102">1. A composition comprising component (a) and component (c) is prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0103">2. The composition prepared in 1. above is applied onto a silicon wafer so that the post-baking film thickness is 1.0±0.1 μm, and then baked for 30 seconds at a prescribed temperature, and the film thickness of the coating is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0104">3. The coating-formed silicon wafer is immersed for 30 seconds into a 2.38 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solution at 23±2° C., washed and dried, and then the coating film loss is observed. The insolubility temperature is defined as the minimum temperature during baking at which the change in the coating film thickness before and after immersion in the TMAH aqueous solution is less than 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0105">4. The compound whose curing acceleration catalyst power is to be confirmed is added to the composition prepared in 1. above at 0.01 wt % to obtain a composition, and the insolubility temperature is determined in the same manner as 2. and 3. above. If the insolubility temperature is lowered by addition of the compound whose curing acceleration catalyst power is to be confirmed, the compound is judged as having curing acceleration catalyst power.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0106">As examples of the curing acceleration catalyst of component (d) there may be mentioned alkali metals such as sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, potassium hydroxide and potassium chloride, and onium salts. These may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0107">Onium salts are preferred among these, with quaternary ammonium salts being more preferred, from the standpoint of improving the electrical properties and mechanical strength of the obtained cured film while also increasing the stability of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0108">One example of an onium salt compound which may be mentioned is a salt formed from (d-1) a nitrogen-containing compound and (d-2) at least one selected from among anionic group-containing compounds and halogen atoms. The atom bonded to the nitrogen of the (d-1) nitrogen-containing compound is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of H, F, B, N, Al, P, Si, Ge, Ti and C atoms. As examples of anionic groups there may be mentioned hydroxyl, nitrate, sulfate, carbonyl, carboxyl, carbonate and phenoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0109">As examples of onium salt compounds there may be mentioned ammonium salt compounds such as ammonium hydroxide, ammonium fluoride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, ammonium iodide, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium borate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium formate, ammonium maleate, ammonium fumarate, ammonium phthalate, ammonium malonate, ammonium succinate, ammonium tartrate, ammonium malate, ammonium lactate, ammonium citrate, ammonium acetate, ammonium propionate, ammonium butanoate, ammonium pentanoate, ammonium hexanoate, ammonium heptanoate, ammonium octanoate, ammonium nonanoate, ammonium decanoate, ammonium oxalate, ammonium adipate, ammonium sebacate, ammonium butyrate, ammonium oleate, ammonium stearate, ammonium linolate, ammonium linoleate, ammonium salicylate, ammonium benzenesulfonate, ammonium benzoate, ammonium p-aminobenzoate, ammonium p-toluenesulfonate, ammonium methanesulfonate, ammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate and ammonium trifluoroethanesulfonate.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0110">There may also be mentioned the aforementioned ammonium salt compounds wherein the ammonium portion of the ammonium salt compounds are replaced with methyl ammonium, dimethyl ammonium, trimethyl ammonium, tetramethyl ammonium, ethyl ammonium, diethyl ammonium, triethyl ammonium, tetraethyl ammonium, propyl ammonium, dipropyl ammonium, tripropyl ammonium, tetrapropyl ammonium, butyl ammonium, dibutyl ammonium, tributyl ammonium, tetrabutyl ammonium, ethanol ammonium, diethanol ammonium or triethanol ammonium.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0111">Among these onium salt compounds there are preferred tetramethylammonium nitrate, tetramethylammonium acetate, tetramethylammonium propionate, tetramethylammonium maleate and tetramethylammonium sulfate, from the standpoint of curing acceleration for the cured film.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0112">These may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0113">The amount of component (d) used is preferably 0.0001-5 wt % and more preferably 0.0001-1 wt %, with respect to the total amount of component (a) in the radiation curable composition. If the amount used is less than 0.0001 wt %, a greater exposure dose will tend to be necessary for curing. If the amount used is greater than 5 wt %, the stability and film-forming property of the composition will tend to be poor, while the electrical properties and process adaptability of the cured film will tend to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0114">From the viewpoint of sensitivity and stability, the amount of the curing acceleration catalyst of component (d) used is preferably 0.0001-0.1 wt %, more preferably 0.0001-0.05 wt % and even more preferably 0.0005-0.01 wt %, with respect to the total amount of component (a) in the radiation curable composition.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0115">These onium salts may also be added after dissolution or dilution to the prescribed concentration in water or another solvent, as necessary. There are no particular restrictions on the timing for the addition, and for example, it may be carried out at the start of hydrolysis of component (a), during the hydrolysis, after completion of the reaction, before or after solvent distillation or at the point of adding the acid generator.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Other Components&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0116">A pigment may also be added to the radiation curable composition of the invention. Addition of a pigment can produce a sensitivity-adjusting effect or a stationary wave-inhibiting effect.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0117">In addition, surfactants, silane coupling agents, thickeners, inorganic fillers, thermal decomposing compounds such as polypropylene glycol, volatile compounds and the like may be added in ranges which do not interfere with the object or effect of the invention. Thermal decomposing compounds and volatile compounds decompose or volatilize by heat (preferably 250-500° C.), and preferably are capable of forming gaps. The siloxane resin as component (a) may also exhibit a gap-forming property.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0118">When the radiation curable composition of the invention is to be used in an electronic component, it preferably contains no alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, or maximally at a metal ion concentration of no greater than 1000 ppm and more preferably no greater than 1 ppm in the composition. If the concentration of these metal ions is greater than 1000 ppm, the metal ions will more readily enter into the electronic component, e.g. semiconductor element comprising the cured film obtained from the composition, potentially having an adverse effect on the device performance. Thus, if necessary, it may be effective to remove the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals from the composition using an ion-exchange filter, for example. However, no such restriction exists for use as an optical waveguide or for other uses, so long as the intended purpose is not impeded.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0119">A method of forming a patterned cured film on a substrate using a radiation curable composition of the invention will now be explained through an example of a spin coating method, which generally has excellent film formability and film uniformity. However, the forming method of a cured film is not limited to a spin coating method. Also, the substrate may have a flat surface or it may be irregular, with electrodes or the like formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0120">First, the radiation curable composition is coated onto a substrate such as a silicon wafer or glass substrate at preferably 500-5000 rpm and more preferably 500-3000 rpm to form a coating. If the rotation rate is less than 500 rpm, the film uniformity will tend to be poor, and if the rotation rate is greater than 5000 rpm, the film-forming property may be impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0121">The film thickness of the cured film will differ depending on the intended use, and for example, the film thickness for use as an interlayer insulating film in an LSI or the like is preferably 0.01-2 μm, while the film thickness is preferably 2-40 μm for use as a passivation layer. The film thickness for liquid crystal uses is preferably 0.1-20 μm, the film thickness for photoresist uses is preferably 0.1-2 μm, and the film thickness for optical waveguide uses is preferably 1-50 μm. Generally speaking, the film thickness will be preferably 0.01-10 μm, more preferably 0.01-5 μm, even more preferably 0.01-3 μm, still more preferably 0.01-2 μm and most preferably 0.1-2 μm. The concentration of component (a) in the composition may be adjusted to control the film thickness of the cured film. When a spin coating method is used, the film thickness may be controlled by adjusting the rotation rate and number of applications. When the film thickness is controlled by adjusting the concentration of component (a), the concentration of component (a) may be increased for a greater film thickness or the concentration of component (a) may be decreased for a smaller film thickness. When the film thickness is controlled using a spin coating method, the rotation rate may be decreased or the number of applications increased for a greater film thickness, or alternatively the rotation rate may be increased or the number applications decreased for a smaller film thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0122">The solvent in the coating is then dried with a hot plate at preferably 50-200° C. and more preferably 70-150° C., and the drying temperature must be adjusted so that the coating will dissolve under the conditions used for subsequent development. If the drying temperature is below 50° C., drying of the solvent will tend to be inadequate, and if it is above 200° C., the film may not dissolve during development and a pattern may not be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0123">Next, the film is exposed to radiation via a mask having the desired pattern. The exposure dose is preferably 5-5000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 5-1000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, even more preferably 5-500 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>and most preferably 5-100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. If the exposure dose is less than 5 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>it may be difficult to achieve control depending on the light source, and if it is greater than 5000 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>the exposure time will be longer, tending to lower productivity. The exposure dose for an ordinary siloxane-based radiation curable composition of the prior art is about 500-5000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0124">The radiation employed may be visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, X-rays, α-rays, β-rays, γ-rays or the like, although ultraviolet rays are particularly preferred. As examples of ultraviolet ray generating sources there may be mentioned ultrahigh voltage mercury lamps, high voltage mercury lamps, low voltage mercury lamps, metal halide lamps and excimer lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0125">The unexposed sections are adequately soluble in the developing solution, but acidic active substances or basic active substances are generated at the exposed sections, producing hydrolytic condensation reaction and lowering the solubility in the developing solution. This results in formation of a pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0126">If necessary, the exposure may be followed by a heating step (post-exposure baking: PEB). The heating may be accomplished by heating the coating on a hot plate or the like, and preferably the heating is in a temperature range at which the solubility of the unexposed sections in the developing solution is not lowered. The temperature is preferably 50-200° C., more preferably 70-150° C., even more preferably 70-110° C. and most preferably 70-100° C. A lower temperature is preferred because a higher temperature will tend to facilitate diffusion of the generated acid. The heating temperature is usually about 115-120° C. in the PEB step for an ordinary siloxane-based radiation curable composition of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0127">A developing solution such as an aqueous alkali solution may be used for development, i.e. for removal of the unexposed sections of the radiation curable composition. As examples of aqueous alkali solutions there may be mentioned inorganic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium metasilicate and ammonia; primary amines such as ethylamine and n-propylamine; secondary amines such as diethylamine and di-n-propylamine; tertiary amines such as triethylamine and methyldiethylamine; alcohol amines such as dimethylethanolamine and triethanolamine; and quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The aqueous alkali solution may be an aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of an added water-soluble organic solvent or surfactant as appropriate. Since contamination by alkali metals is undesirable for electronic components, an aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution is preferred as the developing solution.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0128">The preferred developing time will differ depending on the film thickness and solvent, but in most cases it is preferably from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, more preferably from 30 seconds to 3 minutes and most preferably from 30 seconds to 1 minute. If the developing time is shorter than 5 seconds it may be difficult to control the time on the total surface of the wafer or substrate, while if it is longer than 5 minutes the productivity may be lower. The treatment temperature for development will generally be 20-30° C. The developing method may be, for example, a spray, paddle, immersion or ultrasonic system. The pattern formed by development may subsequently be rinsed with distilled water or the like if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">The patterned cured film of the invention may be also used directly as a resist mask.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">In cases where the patterned cured film of the invention is in the form of a residual interlayer insulating film or clad layer, the coating may be fired at a heating temperature of, for example, 100-500° C. for final curing. The final curing is preferably carried out in an inert atmosphere of N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He or the like, in air or under reduced pressure, but there are no particular restrictions so long as it yields the properties required for the intended use. If the heating temperature is below 100° C. the curing may tend to be insufficient, leading to a poor electrical insulation property, whereas heating at a temperature of above 500° C. may result in deterioration of the underlying materials.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">The heating time for the final curing is preferably 2-240 minutes and more preferably 2-120 minutes. A heating time of longer than 240 minutes may not be suitable for mass production. As heating apparatuses to be used there may be mentioned furnaces such as quartz tube furnaces, and heat treatment apparatuses such as hot plates and rapid thermal annealers (RTA).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">Examples of electronic components employing the cured film described above include devices comprising insulating films, such as semiconductor elements, multilayer wiring boards and the like. Specifically, the cured film may be used as a surface protective film (passivation film), buffer coat film or interlayer insulating film for a semiconductor element. It may also be suitably used as an interlayer insulating film for a multilayer wiring board.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133">As examples of semiconductor elements there may be mentioned discrete semiconductors such as diodes, transistors, compound semiconductors, thermistors, varistors and thyristors, memory elements such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), SRAM (Static Random Access Memory), EPROM (Erasable/Programmable Read Only Memory), Mask ROM (Mask Read Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrical/Erasable/Programmable Read Only Memory) and flash memory, logic circuit elements such as microprocessors, DSP and ASIC, integrated circuit elements such as compound semiconductors including MMIC (Monolithic Microsave Integrated Circuit), hybrid integrated circuits (hybrid IC), and photoelectric conversion elements such as light emitting diodes and charge coupled devices. As examples of multilayer wiring boards there may be mentioned high-density wiring boards such as MCM.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">The cured film may also be used for liquid crystal parts, optical waveguides and photoresists, with no particular limitation to these.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic edge-on view of an embodiment of a TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) according to the invention, as an electronic component for installation in a TFT liquid crystal display.

<p id="p-0128" num="0137">Concrete examples of the present invention will now be explained, with the understanding that the invention is in no way limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0138">Each of the examples was carried out in an environment without the photosensitive wavelength of the photoacid generator or photobase generator and sensitizing agent used until completion of the development step for the radiation curable composition, to avoid exciting the photoacid generator or photobase generator.</p>

After completion of the dropwise addition, reaction was conducted for 3 hours and then a portion of the produced ethanol and the diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether were distilled off under reduced pressure in a warm bath to obtain 1077.0 g of a polysiloxane solution. To 525.1 g of the polysiloxane solution there was added 53.0 g of diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, a tetramethylammonium nitrate aqueous solution prepared to 2.38 wt % (pH 3.6) and 3.0 g of water, and the mixture was dissolved by 30 minutes of stirring at room temperature (25° C.) to obtain a polysiloxane solution for a radiation curable composition. The weight-average molecular weight of the polysiloxane was 830 as measured by GPC. Next, 0.193 g of a photoacid generator (PAI-1001, product of Midori Kagaku) was added to 10.0 g of the radiation curable composition polysiloxane solution to prepare a radiation curable composition. The amount of component (a) used was 15 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition, the amount of component (b) used was 1.9 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition, and the amount of component (d) used was 0.075 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0140">A 2 mL portion of the radiation curable composition was added dropwise onto the center of a 5-inch silicon wafer and subjected to spin coating (30 seconds of rotation at 700 rpm) to form a coating on the wafer, and this was dried for 30 seconds on a 70° C. hot plate. Next, the dried coating was exposed to ultraviolet rays at 200 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>using an exposing apparatus (PLA-600F, Canon) through a negative mask bearing a line pattern with a minimum line width of 10 μm.

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0144" num="0153">When the radiation curable composition obtained in Example 2 was stored for 30 days in an atmosphere at −20° C., the storage stability was superior compared to storage of the same radiation curable composition for 30 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature. The radiation curable composition stored in an atmosphere at −20° C. was successfully patterned even after storage for 30 days, but the radiation curable composition stored for 30 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature could not be patterned even after 7 days. This is attributed to progressive condensation of the siloxane resin, with concomitant production of water, in the radiation curable composition stored for 7 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0154">According to the radiation curable composition, method for its storage, forming method of a cured film and patterning method of the invention, it is possible to obtain cured films with excellent pattern precision even with a relatively low exposure dose. The invention is therefore useful for uses of a pattern, electronic components and optical waveguides.</p>
