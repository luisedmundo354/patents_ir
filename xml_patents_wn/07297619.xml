<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates generally to the field of nanotechnology. More specifically, the invention provides a method and system for making nanoparticles using an atmospheric-pressure plasma microreactor. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to making silicon nanoparticles, but it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The promise of silicon-based optoelectronics has spurred intense interest in silicon nanoparticles (np-Si). Direct band gap transitions have been observed for np-Si. For example, stable photoluminescence (PL), tunable in the range between 700 and 350 nm, has been reported for np-Si smaller in size than the excitonic radius for bulk Si, which is about 4 nm. np-Si have been produced using a variety of techniques including colloidal growth, aerosol processes, plasma synthesis, and electrochemical etching. Many of these techniques involve a capping agent for protection from uncontrolled oxidation which, however, may introduce surface recombination states that alter the emission characteristics. From this perspective, aerosol techniques have an advantage since particles can be grown without capping agents and deposited directly onto a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows simplified conventional aerosol processes. Within an aerosol flow reactor, the following processes occur at different time scales and locations. For example, initial nucleation of particles results from the formation of a supersaturated vapor of gas precursors. Possible means of generating a vapor source include pyrolysis, laser ablation, spark ablation, and plasmas. In the early stages, particles grow by condensation of vapor at their surface and coalescent coagulation. Normally, these processes occur in a region near the vapor source where the temperature is high. As the particle concentration increases, collisions between particles become more frequent and agglomeration begins. Formation of these undesirable aggregates is usually found away from the vapor source as the temperature drops off. Hence the particles synthesized by the conventional aerosol processes often have a broad size distribution, which often necessitates post-synthesis size-selection and particle agglomeration. Notably, production of blue-light emitting np-Si has been challenging because of difficulties in limiting aerosol growth to small sizes and preventing particle coagulation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hence it is desirable to improve techniques for making silicon nanoparticles.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Many benefits are achieved by way of the present invention over conventional techniques. For example, some embodiments of the present invention provide high-pressure microdischarges for the synthesis of nanometer-size silicon particles. For example, atmospheric-pressure microdischarges are used as short-residence time reactors for silicon nanoparticle synthesis. In one embodiment, the residence time of particle nucleation can be limited in the reactor to time scales on the order of milliseconds. In another example, charging of particles in plasma may prevent coagulation. In yet another example, high-pressure operation can accelerate particle growth.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Certain embodiments of the present invention can limit particle growth in the reaction zone allowing the production of ultrasmall nanoparticles with relatively narrow size distributions. For example, silicon nanoparticles are synthesized from a mixture of argon and silane in an atmospheric pressure plasma microreactor. Particles nucleate and grow to a few nanometers in diameter before their growth is abruptly terminated in the short afterglow. In another example, samples collected in solution can exhibit strong PL emission with a peak at 440 nm, indicative of particles with a core size smaller than 2 nm. In yet another example, size classification of the aerosol shows relatively narrow size distributions of agglomerates in the 2-5 nm range with σ<sub>g</sub>=1.3. Some embodiments of the present invention collect silicon nanoparticles in solution immediately after synthesis. These collected particles exhibit strong blue photoluminescence that peaks at 420 nm, and the emission remains stable for months in ambient air. Certain embodiments of the present invention provide applications for luminescent properties of our np-Si in optical devices and fundamental studies to clarify the luminescence mechanism. Some embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods whose synthetic routes can readily be applied to grow a range of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention relates generally to the field of nanotechnology. More specifically, the invention provides a method and system for making nanoparticles using an atmospheric-pressure plasma microreactor. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to making silicon nanoparticles, but it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref> each show a simplified system for making silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. These diagrams are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. A system <b>200</b> includes a cathode <b>210</b>, an anode <b>220</b>, a sealing tube <b>230</b>, particle collector <b>260</b>, a size classifier <b>270</b>, and an electrometer <b>280</b>. Although the above has been shown using a selected group of components for the system <b>200</b>, there can be many alternatives, modifications, and variations. For example, some of the components may be expanded and/or combined. Other components may be inserted to those noted above. Depending upon the embodiment, the arrangement of components may be interchanged with others replaced. For example, the size classifier <b>270</b> and the electrometer <b>280</b> are removed. Further details of these components are found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cathode <b>210</b> is made of a metal tube. For example, the metal tube includes a stainless steel capillary tube. The metal tube has an outer diameter and an inner diameter. For example, the inner diameter ranges from 10 μm to 250 μm. In another example, the inner diameter equals about 180 μm. The cathode <b>210</b> is connected a voltage source. For example, the cathode <b>210</b> is biased to the ground level.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The anode <b>220</b> is made of a metal tube. The metal tube has an outer diameter and an inner diameter. For example, the inner diameter ranges from 250 μm to 2.0 mm. In another example, the inner diameter ranges from 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm. In yet another example, the inner diameter equals about 1 mm. The cathode <b>220</b> is connected to a voltage source. For example, the cathode <b>210</b> is biased to a voltage level ranging from 0 volts to 2000 volts. In other embodiments, the anode <b>220</b> is made of a screen, a ring, a point, and/or a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the inner diameter of the anode <b>220</b> is larger than the inner diameter of the cathode <b>210</b>. For example, the inner diameter of the anode <b>220</b> is at least twice as large as the inner diameter of the cathode <b>220</b>. In another example, the inner diameter of the anode <b>220</b> is at least three times as large as the inner diameter of the cathode <b>220</b>. In another embodiment, the anode <b>220</b> is shorter than the cathode <b>210</b>. For example, this arrangement reduces particle loss to the walls of the metal tube for the anode <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, the cathode <b>210</b> has an end <b>212</b>, and the anode <b>220</b> has an end <b>222</b>. The two ends <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> are separated by a gap <b>224</b>. For example, the gap <b>224</b> has a length ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm. In another example, the length of the gap <b>224</b> is equal to about 1 mm. In yet another example, the length of the gap <b>224</b> can be adjusted using a micrometer. At least part of the cathode <b>210</b> and at least part of the anode <b>220</b> are pressure sealed in the sealing tube <b>230</b>. For example, the sealing tube <b>230</b> is a Pyrex glass tube or a quartz tube.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sealing tube <b>230</b> has an gas inlet <b>232</b>. The gas inlet <b>232</b> can be placed at various locations. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>, the gas inlet <b>232</b> is located next to the gap <b>212</b> instead of on either the anode side or the cathode side. In another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, the gas inlet <b>232</b> is located on the anode side. Along the anode direction, the gas inlet <b>232</b> is away from the end <b>222</b> by a distance <b>234</b>. For example, the distance <b>234</b> ranges from 2 to 4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The particle collector <b>260</b> is used to collect silicon nanoparticles. In one embodiment, the particle collector <b>260</b> includes liquid for collection. For example, dispersions of particles are obtained in solution by bubbling the aerosol stream through a glass frit into an organic solvent, which has been out-gassed for 1 to 2 hours to remove dissolved oxygen. In another example, 1-octanol is used as the organic solvent to stabilize silicon particles. After collecting particles for 24 hours, the solvent is removed by vacuum evaporation and the particles are re-dispersed in hexane. In another embodiment, the particle collector <b>260</b> includes a substrate used for collection. As an example, films of particles are deposited on a molybdenum substrate in stagnation flow downstream from the discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The size classifier <b>270</b> includes a radial differential mobility analyzer (RDMA) which can detect charged particles. The RDMA is often preceded by a bipolar charger, such as a sealed <sup>85</sup>Kr β-source, to ensure proper charging of the particles. The inventors of the instant application discovered that the bipolar charger enhances particle coagulation thus shifting the distribution to larger sizes. In one embodiment of the present invention, the bipolar charger is not used. Instead, the silicon nanoparticles are directed straight into the RDMA, which could then measure distributions of particles charged by a plasma. The electrometer <b>280</b> is coupled to the size classifier <b>270</b>. For example, the electrometer <b>280</b> is Keithley Model 6514.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified method for making silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The method <b>300</b> includes a process <b>310</b> for providing plasma microreactor, a process <b>320</b> for supplying gases, a process <b>330</b> for starting plasma, a process <b>340</b> for maintaining plasma, a process <b>350</b> for collecting silicon nanoparticles, and a process <b>360</b> for analyzing silicon nanoparticles. Although the above has been shown using a selected sequence of processes, there can be many alternatives, modifications, and variations. For example, some of the processes may be expanded and/or combined. Other processes may be inserted to those noted above. Depending upon the embodiment, the specific sequence of processes may be interchanged with others replaced. For example, the process <b>360</b> is skipped. In another example, the method <b>300</b> is used to make nanoparticles other than silicon nanoparticles. In one embodiment, nanoparticles other than silicon nanoparticles are made, collected, and/or analyzed. Further details of these processes are found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At the process <b>310</b>, a plasma microreactor is provided. For example, the plasma microreactor includes the system <b>200</b>. At the process <b>320</b>, certain gases are supplied to the plasma microreactor. For example, a gas mixture <b>322</b> flows through the cathode <b>210</b>. The gas mixture <b>322</b> includes a gas precursor and an inert gas for diluting the gas precursor. In one embodiment, the gas precursor is silane, and the inert gas is argon. For example, the silane concentration within the gap <b>224</b> is controlled between 1 to 5 ppm by varying the flow rate of a 50-ppm SiH<sub>4</sub>/Ar mixture while maintaining a constant total flow rate with a balance of argon.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, an inert gas <b>324</b> flows through the gas inlet <b>232</b> to regions outside of the cathode <b>210</b> within the system <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the inert gas <b>324</b> is argon. For example, an argon gas with 99.9995% purity is run through a copper getter gas purifier heated to 350° C. to completely remove oxygen before flowing into the plasma microreactor <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the gas <b>324</b> has a flow rate approximately three times larger than the gas mixture <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the process <b>330</b>, a plasma discharge is started. For example, the discharge exists in the hollow cathode <b>210</b> and extends towards the anode <b>220</b>. In one embodiment, the discharge is formed by applying a voltage to the anode <b>220</b> while keeping the potential of the cathode <b>210</b> at the ground level. For example, the voltage ranges from 1000 to 2000 volts. In another embodiment, the discharge is formed by reducing the length of the gap <b>212</b>, and applying a voltage to a voltage to the anode <b>220</b> while keeping the potential of the cathode <b>210</b> at the ground level. For example, the voltage is lower than 1000 volts. In another example, the plasma discharge is started at a pressure equal to or higher than one atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At the process <b>340</b>, the plasma discharge is maintained. In one embodiment, the length of the gap <b>224</b> ranges from 0.5 to 2 mm. For example, the voltage for sustaining the discharge ranges from 300 to 500 volts. In another example, the current ranges from 3 to 10 mA. In another embodiment, the plasma discharge is maintained at a pressure equal to or higher than one atmospheric pressure. In yet another embodiment, the process <b>340</b> includes making nanoparticles. For example, silicon nanoparticles are formed within the plasma discharge. In another example, the silicon nanoparticles have a dimension, e.g., a diameter, less than 100 nm, or equal to or less than 5 nm, or equal to or less than 2 nm. In yet another example, the silicon nanoparticles have a quantum yield higher than 23%. In one embodiment, the quantum yield is equal to about 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At the process <b>350</b>, the silicon nanoparticles are collected. For example, the nanoparticles are collected in liquid and/or on a substrate. In another example, the silicon nanoparticles are collected by the particle collector <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As discussed above, at the processes <b>330</b> and <b>340</b>, the plasma discharge is started and maintained. For example, the discharge exists in the hollow cathode <b>210</b> and extends towards the anode <b>220</b>. In one embodiment, the plasma density is higher in part of the hollow cathode <b>210</b> than in the gap <b>224</b>. In another embodiment, silicon nanoparticles are mostly synthesized in the hollow cathode <b>210</b>. At the gap <b>224</b>, the inert gas <b>324</b> starts quenching the nanoparticles, and the quenching continues in the hollow anode <b>220</b>. As an example, the quenching can terminate the growth of the silicon nanoparticles. In another example, the quenching can reduce or prevent particle agglomeration by gas dilution.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At the process <b>360</b>, the silicon nanoparticles are analyzed. For example, the process <b>360</b> is performed before and/or after the process <b>350</b>. In one embodiment, the sizes of the silicon nanoparticles are measured by the size classifier <b>270</b> and the electrometer <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As discussed above and further emphasized here, the method <b>300</b> can be used to make nanoparticles with the system <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, silicon nanoparticles are synthesized with the gas <b>322</b> including silane. In another example, metal nanoparticles are synthesized with the gas <b>322</b> including metal carbonyls. In one embodiment, nickel nanoparticles are made with the gas <b>322</b> including Ni(CO)<sub>6</sub>. In another embodiment, metal nanoparticles are iron, cobalt, and/or nickel nanoparticles. In yet another example, iron nanoparticles are made with the gas <b>322</b> including ferrocene (Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). In yet another example, germanium nanoparticles are made with the gas including Germane (GeH<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In yet another embodiment, multiple systems <b>200</b> are used in parallel to make nanoparticles according to the method <b>300</b>. In another embodiment, the system <b>200</b> produces a direct-current (dc), atmospheric-pressure microdischarge for particle synthesis. In yet another embodiment, the system <b>200</b> uses the inert gas <b>324</b> to reduce coagulation of the nanoparticles downstream of the plasma reaction zone.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, the inert gas <b>324</b> flows through the gas inlet <b>232</b>. In one embodiment, the gas inlet <b>232</b> is located on the anode side instead of on the cathode side. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that such arrangement provides certain advantages over placing the gas inlet <b>232</b> next to the gap <b>224</b> or on the cathode side. For example, placing the gas inlet <b>232</b> on the cathode side can lower the temperature of the cathode and thus produce undesirable effects. In another example, placing the gas inlet <b>232</b> on the anode side can improve uniformity of the gas <b>324</b> flowing into the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to another embodiment, an inert gas <b>324</b> flows through the gas inlet <b>232</b> to regions outside of the cathode <b>210</b> within the system <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the inert gas <b>324</b> is argon. For example, an argon gas with 99.9995% purity is run through a copper getter gas purifier heated to 350° c. to completely remove oxygen before flowing into the plasma microreactor <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the gas <b>324</b> has a flow rate approximately three times larger than the gas mixture <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to yet another embodiment, silicon nanoparticles are made with the system <b>200</b> according to the method <b>300</b>. For example, the gas mixture <b>322</b> includes silane and argon. The synthesized nanoparticles can be either positive charged or negative charged. For both charge polarities, the silicon nanoparticles are characterized by the size classifier  <b>270</b> and the electrometer <b>280</b>. For example, the size classifier <b>270</b> includes a radial differential mobility analyzer (RDMA).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As discussed above and further emphasized here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A)</figref>, <b>2</b>(B), and <b>3</b> are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. For example, in the system <b>200</b>, the sealing tube <b>230</b> does not include the gas inlet <b>232</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows simplified size distributions of silicon nanoparticles as classified by RDMA for two silane concentrations according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system  <b>200</b>. For example, the total flow rate of the gas <b>322</b> is about 150 sccm, and the argon quench gas <b>324</b> has a flow rate of about 450 sccm. The electrode gap <b>224</b> is about 1-mm long, and the discharge current is about 6 mA. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, curves <b>410</b> and <b>430</b> each correspond to negatively charged particles, and curves <b>420</b> and <b>440</b> each correspond to positively charged particles. Additionally, the curves <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> each correspond to a silane concentration of 2.5 ppm, and the curves <b>430</b> and <b>440</b> each correspond to a silane concentration of 4.0 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For the RDMA, the particle size measurement is based on their electrical mobility in a carrier gas and thus, corresponds to the projected area of the aerosol nanoparticles. In the range of silane concentrations explored here, the discharge is stable and the particle size distributions are reproducible. Below a silane concentration of 1 ppm, particles can not be detected. For example, the particles are smaller than the 2.5 nm detection limit of the RDMA. As the silane concentration is raised from 2.5 to 4.0 ppm, the mean particle size increases and the size distribution broadens significantly. Fitting to a log-normal distribution has provided estimates of the geometric mean diameter (D<sub>g</sub>) and standard deviation (σ<sub>g</sub>). At a silane concentration of 2.5 ppm, D<sub>g </sub>and σ<sub>g </sub>have been found to be 2.9 nm and 1.32, respectively. The observed σ<sub>g </sub>compares favorably with values measured by other growth processes without size-selection. Increasing the silane concentration to 4.0 ppm increases D<sub>g </sub>and σ<sub>g </sub>to 6.2 nm and 1.45, respectively. The observed dependencies and the overall shape of the size distributions are consistent with particle growth by coagulation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, more positively-charged particles are detected. This is consistent with silicon cluster nucleation in low-pressure discharges where photo-detachment studies have found very little negative charge on crystallites smaller than 2 nm. Remarkably, the peak number density for each charge polarity does not change appreciably with silane concentration. The latter observation suggests that the particle density exceeds that of ions and electrons in the discharge available for attachment, thus most of the particles should be at most singly charged. Large particles such as ones larger than 10 nm charge up negatively in a plasma as a result of the larger electron mobility. Thus, observation of both charge polarities corroborates the existence of very small particles.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another embodiment, vapor-phase synthesis of nanoparticles enables coupling of the reactor setup with aerosol instrumentation that measures the size and distribution of particles in situ. For example, size-classification is performed using a radial differential mobility analyzer (RDMA). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified RDMA used as the size classifier <b>270</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an RDMA <b>500</b> includes a capacitor in which charged aerosol particles migrate in an electric field across a laminar flow of sheath gas. The aerosol stream enters the RDMA <b>500</b> at a position on the outer radius and flows inward towards the center where the classified aerosol is collected. The particle size measurement is based on their electrical mobility in the carrier gas and thus, corresponds to the projected area of the aerosol particles. For a given voltage, particles within a narrow range of mobilities transverse the gap between the electrodes and are extracted by a sampling orifice opposite to the aerosol inlet. Particles with higher mobilities deposit on the bottom electrode. Particles with too low mobility are carried out with the excess sheath gas flow. By varying the voltage, particles of different mobilities are transmitted through the instrument. The concentration of classified nanoparticles is measured by flowing the aerosol into the electrometer <b>280</b>. Combined operation of the RDMA <b>500</b> used as the size classifier <b>270</b> and the electrometer <b>280</b> allows determination of the nanoparticle size distribution. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, values for Q<sub>a</sub>, Q<sub>sh</sub>, Q<sub>s</sub>, and Q<sub>e </sub>are, for example, equal to 600 sccm, 5.5 slm, 600 sccm, and 5.5 slm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To impart a known charge distribution on particles, the aerosol is normally passed through a bipolar charger (sealed 85Kr-β source), commonly referred to as a “neutralizer,” before entering the RDMA. For particles in the size range explored here, the neutralizer has been found to cause growth by agglomeration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows simplified sizes of silicon nanoparticles with and without a neutralizer in-line according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. A curve <b>610</b> corresponds a size distribution without a neutralizer, and a curve <b>620</b> corresponds to a size distribution with a neutralizer. When a neutralizer is used, the measured size distribution appeared broad with an extended tail indicating a coagulated aerosol. A narrower size distribution with a smaller mean diameter is obtained by removing the neutralizer and collecting plasma-charged particles directly. The residence time for particle growth in the plasma discharge is estimated to be on the order of 1 millisecond according to an embodiment of the present invention. At an aerosol flow rate of 600 sccm, the neutralizer increases the residence time to 10 seconds, artificially causing broadening. Shortening the residence time of particles between the reactor and size classifier should provide a more accurate representation of the distribution of particles synthesized in our process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows simplified size distributions of silicon nanoparticles without neutralizer according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. For example, the flow rate for the gas <b>322</b> is about 150 sccm, and the flow rate for the argon gas <b>324</b> is about 450 sccm. The length of the gap <b>224</b> is about 1 mm, and the discharge current is about 6 mA at the process <b>340</b>. For silicon nanoparticles, the flux ranges from 3.1×10<sup>7 </sup>to 5.8×10<sup>7</sup>/ml, which amounts about 1 μg/hour with about 600 ml/min. Curves <b>710</b>, <b>720</b>, <b>730</b>, and <b>740</b> represent size distributions that correspond to silane concentrations of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 ppm, respectively. These size distributions have been measured without charge neutralizer.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The orientation of the electric field in the RDMA for these experiments is such that positively charged particles are transmitted. In the range of silane concentrations explored here, the discharge is stable with highly reproducible size distributions. Below a silane concentration of 1 ppm, particles cannot be detected. For example, the particles are smaller than the 2.5 nm detection limit of the RDMA. As the silane concentration is raised from 2.5 to 4.0 ppm, the mean particle size increases and the size distribution broadens significantly. Fitting to the following log-normal distribution provides estimates of the geometrical mean diameter (D<sub>g</sub>) and geometrical standard deviation (σ<sub>g</sub>):</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">where μ is the mobility constant, q is the charge, m is the mass, and v<sub>m </sub>is the momentum transfer frequency. It is the large mass difference between ions and electrons that often leads to a difference in mobility. Charging of small particles, less than 3 nm in diameter, is complicated, however, by statistical fluctuations. Note that in our case more positively charged particles are detected at both the low and high silane concentration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This is consistent with silicon cluster nucleation in low-pressure discharges where photo-detachment studies found very little negative charge on crystallites smaller than 2 nm. Large particles, such as ones equal to 10 nm, charge up negatively in a plasma as a result of the larger electron mobility. Thus, observation of both charge polarities corroborates the existence of very small particles. Remarkably, the peak number density for each charge polarity does not change appreciably with silane concentration. This suggests that the particle density exceeds that of ions and electrons in the discharge available for attachment and most of the particles should be at most singly charged. Particles in this size range are not likely to carry multiple charges.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows simplified charging probabilities for silicon nanoparticles passing through a neutralizer according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. At the neutralizer, negative and positive ions are responsible for charging. For example, the neutralizer includes a bipolar charger (<sup>85</sup>Kr β). The results are obtained by approximating an empirical expression of the Fuchs model. It is apparent that particles less than 10 nm in diameter have a very low probability of acquiring more than a single charge, supporting our observations. Since the RDMA measures particle mobility which is a function of size and charge, the existence of only singly charged particles signifies that the distributions are reflective of the particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Size measurements by other techniques have also been attempted according to another embodiment of the present invention. TEM imaging of silicon particles deposited on carbon grids reveals particle assemblies of sizes larger than those measured by the RDMA suggesting particle agglomeration during the deposition process. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has also been used on np-Si samples suspended in hexane after dispersion on a silicon wafer and solvent evaporation. The mean particle height is 1.6 nm while particles as small as 1.0 nm and as large as 6.6 nm has been measured. Observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been inconclusive as to the crystalline nature of the particles. The particles may have been oxidized during air transfer to the microscope reducing the core size to below the resolution limit of the TEM.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to another embodiment of the present invention, silicon nanoparticles are collected either on a substrate or in liquid without size-selection for characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). For example, particles are deposited onto carbon-coated copper TEM grids by flowing the aerosol stream into an electrostatic precipitator. Films of particles are obtained by placing a molybdenum substrate in the system <b>200</b> in a stagnation flow geometry with the plasma discharge. Dispersions of particles in a solution phase can be obtained by bubbling the aerosol stream through a glass frit into a solvent that has been outgassed for 1 to 2 hours. For example, 1-octanol has been used for its low volatility and since it has been shown to stabilize silicon particles. After collecting silicon nanoparticles for about 24 hours, the solvent is removed by vacuum evaporation and the particles are redispersed in hexane.</p>

The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized and deposited by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. The image <b>1000</b> shows the presence of large aggregates more than 10 nm in size. Since structures of this size have not been observed in the RDMA, agglomeration may have occurred during the deposition process. The aggregates appear to be made up of smaller spherical particles approximately 5 nm in diameter. These primary particles appear to be uniform in size, consistent with the narrow size distributions obtained using the RDMA. The image <b>1010</b> for electron diffraction is characteristic of an amorphous material. Since the samples have been exposed to air during loading into the TEM, oxidation of the particles may have occurred, preventing the preservation of the crystalline core. It has been reported that for particles in this size limit, such as less than 4 nm, crystal structure is difficult to observe because the surface energy is higher than the lattice energy. The formation of a silicon oxide shell could also be responsible for the larger particle sizes observed by TEM.</p>

This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. AFM is used to determine the size of silicon nanoparticles in hexane solution by evaporating a drop of the dispersion on a crystalline silicon wafer. Diluting the dispersion appropriately allows particles to be well isolated as shown in an AFM image <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The particles have been sized by measuring the height of approximately 500 particles. From a histogram <b>1110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the mean particle height is calculated to be 1.6 nm. Particles as small as 1.0 nm and as large as 6.6 nm have also been observed.

The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. For example, these nanoparticles are deposited on molybedenum for about 1 hour to form a silicon nanoparticle film. The peak corresponds to the sum of two Gaussian peaks at 477 cm<sup>−1 </sup>and 507 cm<sup>−1 </sup>attributed to amorphous silicon, a-Si:H, and grain boundaries in nanocrystalline silicon films, respectively. This spectrum has been compared to that of a crystalline silicon substrate which shows a single sharp peak at 519 cm<sup>1</sup>. The broad shape of the peak as well as the shift from crystalline silicon confirms that deposited films are amorphous and made up of nanoparticles. For example, analysis by EDS has confirmed that the films consist of only silicon and oxygen, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Peaks from the molybdenum substrate are also evident but no other contaminants have been detected.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to an embodiment of the present invention, PL measurements have been performed at room temperature on both suspended and deposited np-Si samples. For hexane-suspended np-Si, excitation and emission spectra have been obtained using a spectrophotometer. For example, the spectrophotometer is Model QM by Photon Technology International. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows simplified PL spectra from suspended silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. For example, the flow rate of silane is about 2.5 ppm. A curve <b>1410</b> represents a room-temperature absorbance spectrum, a curve <b>1420</b> represents a PL excitation spectrum collected by fixing the detection at 420 nm, and a curve <b>1430</b> represents a PL emission spectra with fixed excitation wavelength at 360 nm. These curves have been taken for silicon nanoparticles in hexane solution. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the spectra <b>1420</b> and <b>1430</b> exhibit an excitation peak at 360 nm and an emission maximum at 420 nm. The strong blue emission is readily observable by naked eye. The band gap for silicon nanoparticles, for example, equals about 2.9 eV. In the absorbance spectrum <b>1410</b>, there is a characteristic yellow absorption tail from 370 nm across the visible that has been observed for np-Si colloids.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the UV-visible absorbance spectrum as the curve <b>1410</b>. The yellow absorption tail corresponds to the indirect gap of bulk Si. Some of the features in the spectrum, including the peak at approximately 320 nm, have also been reported for 2.0 nm Si colloids and attributed to a higher energy, direct transition. It is apparent that the absorption edge and excitation peak are at similar energies, while the emission peak is red-shifted. In general, the absorption gap in np-Si has been found to be larger than the emission gap. When light is absorbed, the particle undergoes an electronic excitation in which an electron-hole pair (exciton) is formed. Recombination of the electron and hole by emission of a photon occurs at a lower energy because of structural relaxation processes in the particle. The difference between the absorption and emission energy is known as the Stokes shift:

</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">where E<sup>absorption </sup>is the energy required to excite the cluster from its ground state to the lowest excited state, E<sup>emission </sup>is the energy released during recombination, and E<sup>Stokes </sup>is the Stokes shift. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the E<sup>absorption</sup>, E<sup>emission</sup>, and E<sup>Stokes </sup>for np-Si are approximately 3.4 eV, 2.9 eV, and 0.5 eV, respectively. The shift of the optical gap from the bulk value for Si of 1.12 eV represents the effect of quantum confinement.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Assuming that the PL emission at 420 nm or 2.95 eV is excitonic, the silicon particle core size can be estimated from calculations to be less than 2 nm. This size is closer to the AFM result but significantly smaller than the RDMA measurement. The size discrepancy could be related to smaller particle agglomeration in the aerosol measurements or larger particle oxidation upon exposure to ambient air. Particles grown at higher silane concentrations, which appear to be bigger according to the RDMA, do not exhibit red-shifted PL peaks as expected from quantum confinement. Hence the short residence time in the microreactor may have limited the primary particle size in the 1-2 nm range. Larger silane concentrations result in the production of more particles in the same size range.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a simplified comparison of PL spectra according to another embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. A curve <b>1510</b> represents a spectrum corresponding to a np-Si thin film, and a curve <b>1520</b> represents a spectrum corresponding to np-Si solution. For example, the PL spectrum <b>1510</b> has been acquired at temperature using a 20-mW GaN laser at about 405 nm and collecting the emission with a 27.5-cm focal length grating spectrograph equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device detector. In another example, the np-Si thin film is deposited on molybdenum substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the curve <b>1510</b> exhibits a peak at 511 nm with a considerable red-shift from the peak of 420 nm for the hexane suspended silicon nanoparticles. This shift may be a result of uncontrolled oxidation of the directly deposited np-Si, or the excitation at the longer wavelength. To distinguish the effect of the latter, a PL spectrum of the hexane-suspended np-Si has been collected using an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. This spectrum is represented by a curve <b>1520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which shows a PL peak at approximately 465 nm, smaller than that seen for the directly deposited np-Si films. The difference may have resulted from surface oxidation of the films. Apparently, the octanol-capped nanoparticles suspended in hexane are protected from oxidation. Also, the sharp peak at 438 nm in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an artifact of the cut-off filter used in the set-up.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows simplified PL spectra as a function of excitation wavelength according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. Curves <b>1610</b>, <b>1620</b>, <b>1630</b>, <b>1640</b>, and <b>1650</b> represent PL spectra corresponding to excitation wavelengths of 300 nm, 320 nm, 360 nm, 400 nm, and 500 nm, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the emission spectra of np-Si in hexane are strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength. Although excitation at 370 nm results in the maximum PL emission, luminescence has been observed at other excitation wavelengths. As the excitation is increased from 300 to 400 nm, the emission peak shifted from 370 to 450 nm. Exciting at 500 nm has resulted in virtually no visible emission. The PL shift as a function of excitation wavelength is caused by the size distribution in the sample. At longer wavelengths, larger particles with lower HOMO→LUMO band gap energies are excited and the emission peak red-shifts. At wavelengths longer than 500 nm, the excitation energy is insufficient to excite any of the particles in the sample. Accordingly, the Stokes shift has been calculated as a function of the excitation wavelength as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As the excitation energy is decreased, emission is obtained from larger particles in the sample. Therefore, the observed decrease in the Stokes shift can be inferred to be related to particle size. Calculations have shown a similar trend approximated by E<sup>Stokes</sup>˜D<sup>−n </sup>with the Stokes shift becoming independent of the size of the cluster at diameters larger than 3 mn. Because this parameter is related to a relaxation mechanism in the particle, it depends on specific bonds at the surface. For larger particle diameters, surface states have been observed to be inconsequential to PL emission. The sensitivity of the Stokes shift to particle size suggests that the silicon nanoparticles have a diameter of about 1 to 2 nm according to certain embodiments of the present invention. Particles in this size range have important implications in studies of the PL mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a simplified diagram showing quantum yield of silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. To estimate the quantum efficiency of these nanoparticles, PL emission spectra have been collected for various particle dilutions. The integrated emission intensity for each sample is plotted in as a curve <b>1710</b> against the corresponding absorbance at the same excitation wavelength. Under the same excitation conditions, the same lamp energy, and the same spectrometer band-pass, similar measurements have also been performed for various dilutions of 9,10-diphenylanthracene in cyclohexane, which emits with a known efficiency of 90% between 400 and 500 nm. The experimental results are plotted as a curve <b>1720</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the curve <b>1710</b> has a slope of 1.6×10<sup>9 </sup>based on linear fitting, and the curve <b>1720</b> has a slope of 5.78×10<sup>9 </sup>also based on linear fitting. A comparison of these two slopes indicates that the quantum efficiency of the octanol-capped silicon nanoparticles is higher than 23% and equal to about 30%. As discussed above and emphasized here, the silicon nanoparticles used for this experiment are as-grown particles without any further processing or special treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a simplified diagram showing life time of silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method <b>300</b> with the system <b>200</b>. The radioactive lifetime τ of the PL emission of as-grown silicon nanoparticles have been evaluated. PL decay measurements have been performed at 295 K by exciting np-Si in hexane with an Ar ion laser at 454.8 nm with a cw power density of 5 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>at the sample. The PL emission has been monitored at 570 nm through a cutoff filter at 500 nm. The beam has been pulsed at 1000 Hz using an acoustic optical modulator with 50% duty cycle and the data have been collected with a temporal resolution of 5 ns. The results, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, can be approximated by a stretched exponential curve <b>1810</b> with τ=30 ns and a stretch fitting parameter τ=0.9. The obtained lifetime of 30 ns is longer than the lifetimes typically attributed to surface state recombination of electron-hole pairs but shorter than transitions believed to be associated with band-to-band recombination. For example, the lifetimes typically attributed to surface state recombination of electron-hole pairs are equal to or smaller than 1 ns, and transitions believed to be associated with band-to-band recombination usually take about 10 to 100 μs. While the light emission mechanism in np-Si is still under debate, it seems that both theory and experiment agree on a trend of decreasing PL lifetimes for smaller nanoparticles. For certain embodiments of the present invention, given the size of silicon nanoparticles, short lifetimes should be expected, perhaps even shorter than the 30 ns measured, which is based on an excitation wavelength that is significantly red-shifted from the excitation optimum.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As discussed above and further emphasized here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-18</figref> are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. For example, the aerosol synthesis route for nanoparticle growth can be adapted to different materials by changing the gas precursor, such as the gas <b>322</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Consequently, the properties of silicon nanoparticles and other semiconductors can be compared. For example, while germanium is an indirect band gap material like silicon, it has a band gap energy of 0.76 eV as compared to 1.12 eV for silicon. Experimental investigations on Ge nanocrystals have shown quantum confinement effects similar to Si. Some studies have suggested that below a critical size, Ge nanoparticles should show stronger quantum confinement than Si. Measuring the PL of similarly sized particles can confirm if the band gap indeed shifts to higher energies.</p>

Some embodiments of the present invention provide high-pressure microdischarges for the synthesis of nanometer-size silicon particles. For example, atmospheric-pressure microdischarges are used as short-residence time reactors for silicon nanoparticle synthesis. In one embodiment, the residence time of particle nucleation can be limited in the reactor to time scales on the order of milliseconds. In another example, charging of particles in plasma may prevent coagulation. In yet another example, high-pressure operation can accelerates particle growth.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Certain embodiments of the present invention can limit particle growth in the reaction zone allowing the production of ultrasmall nanoparticles with relatively narrow size distributions. For example, silicon nanoparticles are synthesized from a mixture of argon and silane in an atmospheric pressure plasma microreactor. Particles nucleate and grow to a few nanometers in diameter before their growth is abruptly terminated in the short afterglow. In another example, samples collected in solution can exhibit strong PL emission with a peak at 440 nm, indicative of particles with a core size smaller than 2 nm. In yet another example, size classification of the aerosol shows relatively narrow size distributions of agglomerates in the 2-5 nm range with σ<sub>g</sub>=1.3. Some embodiments of the present invention collect silicon nanoparticles in solution immediately after synthesis. These collected particles exhibit strong blue photoluminescence that peaks at 420 nm, and the emission remains stable for months in ambient air. Certain embodiments of the present invention provide applications for luminescent properties of our np-Si in optical devices and fundamental studies to clarify the luminescence mechanism. Some embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods whose synthetic routes can readily be applied to grow a range of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that there are other embodiments that are equivalent to the described embodiments. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited by the specific illustrated embodiments, but only by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
