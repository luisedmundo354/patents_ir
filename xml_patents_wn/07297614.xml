<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated chip package structure and method of manufacturing the same is by adhering dies on an organic substrate and forming a thin-film circuit layer on top of the dies and the organic substrate. Wherein the thin-film circuit layer has an external circuitry, which is electrically connected to the metal pads of the dies, that extends to a region outside the active surface of the dies for fanning out the metal pads of the dies. Furthermore, a plurality of active devices and an internal circuitry is located on the active surface of the dies. Signal for the active devices are transmitted through the internal circuitry to the external circuitry and from the external circuitry through the internal circuitry back to other active devices. Moreover, the chip package structure allows multiple dies with different functions to be packaged into an integrated package and electrically connecting the dies by the external circuitry.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacture the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacture the same using organic substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the recent years, the development of advanced technology is on the cutting edge. As a result, high-technology electronics manufacturing industries launch more feature-packed and humanized electronic products These new products that hit the showroom are lighter, thinner, and smaller in design. In the manufacturing of these electronic products, the key component has to be the integrated circuit (IC) chip inside any electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The operability, performance, and life of an IC chip are greatly affected by its circuit design, wafer manufacturing, and chip packaging. For this present invention, the focus will be on chip packaging technique. Since the features and speed of IC chips are increasing rapidly, the need for increasing the conductivity of the circuitry is necessary so that the signal delay and attenuation of the dies to the external circuitry are reduced. A chip package that allows good thermal dissipation and protection of the IC chips with a small overall dimension of the package is also necessary for higher performance chips. These are the goals to be achieved in chip packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are a vast variety of existing chip package techniques such as ball grid array (BGA), wire bonding, flip chip, etc . . . for mounting a die on a substrate via the bonding points on both the die and the substrate. The inner traces helps to fan out the bonding points on the bottom of the substrate. The solder balls are separately planted on the bonding points for acting as an interface for the die to electrically connect to the external circuitry. Similarly, pin grid array (PGA) is very much like BGA, which replaces the balls with pins on the substrate and PGA also acts an interface for the die to electrically connect to the external circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Both BGA and PGA packages require wiring or flip chip for mounting the die on the substrate. The inner traces in the substrate fan out the bonding points on the substrate, and electrical connection to the external circuitry is carried out by the solder balls or pins on the bonding points. As a result, this method fails to reduce the distance of the signal transmission path but in fact increase the signal path distance. This will increase signal delay and attenuation and decrease the performance of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) has an advantage of being able to print the redistribution circuit directly on the die by using the peripheral area of the die as the bonding points It is achieved by redistributing an area array on the surface of the die, which can fully utilize the entire area of the die. The bonding points are located on the redistribution circuit by forming flip chip bumps so the bottom side of the die connects directly to the printed circuit board (PCB) with micro-spaced bonding points.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although WLCSP can greatly reduce the signal path distance, it is still very difficult to accommodate all the bonding points on the die surface as the integration of die and internal components gets higher. The pin count on the die increases as integration gets higher so the redistribution of pins in an area array is difficult to achieve. Even if the redistribution of pins is successful, the distance between pins will be too small to meet the pitch of a printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore the present invention provides an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacturing the same that uses the original bonding points of the die and connect them to an external circuitry of a thin-film circuit layer to achieve redistribution. The spacing between the redistributed bonding points matches the pitch of a PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention presents an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacturing the same by adhering the backside of a die to an organic substrate, wherein the active surface of the die has a plurality of metal pads. A thin-film circuit layer is formed on top of the die and the organic substrate, where the thin-film circuit layer has an external circuitry that is electrically connected to the metal pads of the die. The external circuitry extends to a region that is outside the active area of the dies and has a plurality of bonding pads located on the surface of the thin-film layer circuit. The active surface of the die has an internal circuitry and a plurality of active devices, where signals can be transmitted from one active device to the external circuitry via the internal circuitry, then from the external circuitry back to another active device via the internal circuitry. Furthermore, the organic substrate has at least one inwardly protruded area so the backside of the die can be adhered inside the inwardly protruded area and exposing the active surface of the die. Wherein the organic substrate is composed of an organic layer and a heat conducting material formed overlapping and the inwardly protruded areas are formed by overlapping the organic substrate with openings on the heat conducting layer. Furthermore, the present chip package structure allows multiple dies with same or different functions to be packaged into one integrated chip package and permits electrically connection between the dies by the external circuitry.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an organic substrate <b>110</b> with a surface <b>112</b> is provided. The material of the organic substrate comprises polymer resin, epoxy resin, imide resin, or the like, plastic, or thermosetting plastic. The fabrication of the organic substrates can be accomplished by existing printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technique. The method includes heat pressing a plurality of insulating core boards or injection molding to form organic substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A plurality of dies <b>120</b> having an active surface <b>122</b> and a corresponding backside <b>124</b> is provided, where the active devices are formed on active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>. Furthermore, dies <b>120</b> have a plurality of metal pads <b>126</b> located on active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b> acting as the output terminal of dies <b>120</b> to transmit signals to the external circuitry. Backside <b>124</b> of dies <b>120</b> is adhered to surface <b>112</b> of organic substrate <b>110</b> by a conductive paste or adhesive tape. Therefore, active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b> is facing upwards along surface <b>112</b> of organic substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, when adhering die <b>120</b> to organic substrate <b>110</b>, a filling layer <b>130</b> is formed on top of surface <b>112</b> of organic substrate <b>110</b> surrounding the peripheral of dies <b>120</b> to fill the gap between dies <b>120</b>. Wherein the top face of filling layer <b>130</b> is approximately planar to active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>. The material of filling layer <b>130</b> can be epoxy, polymer, or the like. After curing of filling layer <b>130</b>, a grinding or etching process is applied to planarize filling layer <b>130</b> so the top face of filling layer <b>130</b> is planar to active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, after the formation of filling layer <b>130</b> on organic substrate <b>110</b>, a dielectric layer <b>142</b> is formed on top of filling layer <b>130</b> and active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>. Dielectric layer <b>142</b> is patterned according to metal pads <b>126</b> on dies <b>120</b> to form thru-holes <b>142</b><i>a</i>. The material of dielectric layer <b>142</b> can be poly-Imide (PI), benzocyclobutene (BCB), porous dielectric material, stress buffer material, or the like. Patternization of dielectric layer <b>142</b> can be performed by photo via, laser ablation, plasma etching, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Please continue to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, filling layer <b>130</b> is used to support dielectric layer <b>142</b> so dielectric layer <b>142</b> can be formed planarized on top of organic substrate <b>110</b> and dies <b>120</b> without an uneven surface. As a result, after dielectric layer <b>142</b> is formed on surface <b>112</b> of organic substrate <b>110</b> and active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>, dielectric layer <b>142</b> also fills the peripheral of dies <b>120</b>, meaning the gap between dies <b>120</b>. Therefore the bottom structure of dielectric layer <b>142</b> can replace the structure of filling layer <b>130</b> covering entirely surface <b>112</b> of organic substrate <b>110</b> and surrounding dies <b>120</b>. The method of forming dielectric layer <b>142</b> includes first depositing a layer of dielectric layer <b>142</b> entirely over dies <b>120</b> and organic substrate <b>110</b>, then after curing, grinding or etching process is performed to planarize dielectric layer <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, after forming dielectric layer <b>142</b> and patterning dielectric layer <b>142</b> to form thru-holes <b>142</b><i>a</i>, a patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> is formed on top of dielectric layer <b>142</b> by photolithography and sputtering, electroplating, or electro-less plating. Wherein part of the conductive material from patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> will be injected into thru-holes <b>142</b><i>a </i>to form vias <b>142</b><i>b</i>, copper (Cu) is used as the material for patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>. Moreover, thru-holes <b>142</b><i>a </i>can be pre-filled with a conductive material such as a conductive glue to form vias <b>142</b><i>b</i>. Therefore no matter if the thru-holes are filled with the conductive material from patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> or pre-filled with a conductive material, patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> is electrically connected to metal pads <b>126</b> of dies <b>120</b>. It is to be noted that part of patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> extends to a region outside active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>. Dielectric layer <b>142</b> and patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> form a thin-film circuit layer <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, after the formation of patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>, another dielectric layer <b>146</b> can be formed similarly to dielectric layer <b>142</b> on top of dielectric layer <b>142</b> and patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>. Dielectric layer <b>146</b> is also patterned to form thru-holes <b>146</b><i>a</i>, whereas thru-holes <b>146</b><i>a </i>correspond to bonding pads <b>144</b><i>a </i>of patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, after the formation and patternization of dielectric layer <b>146</b> to form thru-holes <b>146</b><i>a</i>, a patterned wiring layer <b>148</b> can be formed on dielectric layer <b>146</b> in a similar way as patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>. Wherein part of the conductive material from patterned wiring layer <b>148</b> will be injected into each thru-hole <b>146</b><i>a </i>for forming a via <b>146</b><i>b</i>. By the same token, patterned wiring layer <b>148</b> is electrically connected to patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> by vias <b>146</b><i>b</i>, and further electrically connected to metal pads <b>126</b> of die <b>120</b> by vias <b>142</b><i>b </i>of thru-hole <b>142</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, thin-film circuit layer <b>140</b> further comprises dielectric layer <b>146</b>, a plurality of vias <b>146</b><i>b</i>, and patterned wiring layer <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Please continue to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, in order to redistribute all metal pads <b>126</b> of dies <b>120</b> on organic substrate <b>110</b>, the number of patterned wiring layers (<b>144</b>, <b>148</b> . . . ) and dielectric layers (<b>142</b>, <b>146</b> . . . ) for electrical insulation may be increased. All patterned wiring layers (<b>144</b>, <b>148</b> . . . ) are electrically connected by vias (<b>146</b><i>b </i>. . . ) of thru-holes (<b>146</b><i>a </i>. . . ). However if only the first patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> is required to entirely redistribute metal pads <b>126</b> of dies <b>120</b> on organic substrate <b>110</b>, extra dielectric layers (<b>146</b> . . . ) and patterned wiring layers (<b>148</b> . . . ) will no longer be required in the structure. In other words, thin-film circuit layer <b>140</b> comprises at least one dielectric layer <b>142</b>, one patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>, and a plurality of vias <b>142</b><i>b</i>. Wherein patterned wiring layer (<b>144</b>, <b>148</b> . . . ) and vias (<b>142</b><i>b</i>, <b>146</b><i>b </i>. . . ) of thin-film circuit layer <b>140</b> form an external circuitry of thin-film circuit layer <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, after the formation of patterned wiring layer <b>148</b>, a patterned passivation layer <b>150</b> is formed on top of dielectric layer <b>146</b> and patterned wiring layer <b>148</b>. Patterned passivation layer <b>150</b> is used to protect patterned wiring layer <b>148</b> and expose the plurality of bonding pads <b>148</b><i>a </i>of patterned wiring layer <b>148</b>, whereas some of bonding pads <b>148</b><i>a </i>are in a region outside active surface <b>122</b> of dies <b>120</b>. As previously mentioned, the redistribution of metal pads <b>126</b> on organic substrate <b>110</b> requires multiple layers of patterned wiring layers (<b>144</b>, <b>148</b> . . . ) and a patterned passivation layer <b>150</b> formed on the very top, which is furthest away from organic substrate <b>110</b>. However, if only patterned wiring layer <b>144</b> is required to redistribute all metal pads <b>126</b> of dies <b>120</b> on organic substrate <b>110</b>, patterned passivation layer <b>150</b> will be formed directly on patterned wiring layer <b>144</b>. The material of patterned passivation layer <b>150</b> can be anti-solder insulating coating or other insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, after the formation of patterned passivation layer <b>150</b>, a bonding point <b>160</b> can be placed on bonding pads <b>148</b><i>a </i>serving as an interface for electrically connecting dies <b>120</b> to the external circuitry. Wherein bonding point <b>160</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref> is a ball but it is not limited to any formation, which might include a bump, pin, or the like.

Afterwards, the chip package structure of the die is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the above, the first embodiment of the present invention is a chip package structure with an organic substrate and a plurality of dies on the organic substrate. The external circuitry of the thin-film circuit layer allows the metal pads of the die to fan out. By forming bonding pads corresponding to the metal pads of the dies such as solders balls, bumps, or pins as the signal input terminals, the distance of the signal path is effectively decreased. As a result, signal delay and attenuation are reduced to increase performance of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention uses existing technology on and equipment for fabricating PCB for the fabrication of the organic substrate by heat pressing a plurality of insulating core boards. Alternatively, the organic substrate can also be fabricated in large volume by injection molding. As a result of the low fabrication and material cost of the organic substrate, the cost of chip packaging is also lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second embodiment of the present invention differs from the first embodiment by having inwardly protruded areas in the organic substrate. This area is for placement of the die with the backside of the die adhered to the bottom of the area so the overall thickness of the chip package structure is reduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A to 2C</figref> are schematic diagrams of the sectional view of the second embodiment illustrating the fabrication of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an organic substrate <b>210</b> with a surface <b>212</b> is provided.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, backside <b>224</b> of dies <b>220</b> is adhered to the bottom of inwardly protruded areas <b>214</b> so dies <b>220</b> are inlayed in inwardly protruded areas <b>214</b>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second embodiment of the present invention is an organic substrate with a plurality of inwardly protruded areas for inlaying dies by adhering the backside of the dies to the bottom of the inwardly protruded areas and exposing the active surface of the dies. A thin-film circuit layer is formed on top of the dies and the organic substrate to fan out the metal pads of the dies by using the external circuitry of the thin-film circuit layer. Due to the inlay of the dies in the organic substrate, thinning of the thickness of the chip package structure is effectively achieved and the surface of the organic substrate provides enough planarity and support for the formation of the thin-film circuit layer.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The third embodiment of the present invention is an integrated organic substrate with an organic layer with a plurality of openings and a heat conducting layer. The openings in the organic layer will form the inwardly protruded areas in the integrated organic substrate. The backside of the die adheres to the bottom of the inwardly protruded areas so the dies are inlayed in the inwardly protruded areas and exposing the active surface of the dies. This integrated organic substrate can efficiently dissipate heat from the dies to the outside because the bottom of the inwardly protruded area is the surface of the heat conducting material.
