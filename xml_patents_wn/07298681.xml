<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a high-frequency superimposing method for superimposing a high-frequency component on a semiconductor laser drive current when recording information on an optical disk in an optical disk drive and to an optical disk drive using the high-frequency superimposing method. More specifically, the present invention relates to a high-frequency superimposing method capable of high-speed, high-density recording and an optical disk drive using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among recordable optical disks there are write-once type optical disks that allow the user to record data only once (e.g., CD-R and DVD-R) and rewritable type optical disks that permit rewriting a number of times (e.g., CD-RW and DVD-RW).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To start recording data, the optical disk drive needs to position its optical head at a desired track (groove) on a disk and start recording from a desired position (tangential direction position). This positioning of the head is done by reading address information marked in advance on the disk. To make the drive compatible with read-only disks (CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs), address information corresponding to the recording position on the disk is added to user data when the user data is recorded on the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of CD-R and CD-RW, the address information on the disk is formed in units of frame (equivalent to 1/75 second for a normal speed playback) by slightly wobbling the groove in a radial direction (a reproduced signal from the wobbled groove is hereinafter referred to as a wobble signal) and modulating a wobble frequency. In the case of DVD-R and DVD-RW, although the groove is slightly wobbled in the radial direction, the wobble frequency is not modulated. Instead, tiny dents called land pre-pits (LPPs) are located at predetermined positions along the groove wobble so that the presence or absence of these pits forms address information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To recognize positions on the disk correctly for information recording, the groove wobble must be read (i.e., address information must be identified) with high precision also during recording. However, since a semiconductor laser is affected by a reflected light from the disk, a resonance state of the interior of the semiconductor changes, resulting in a change in its laser power. That is, a so-called optical feedback causes noise. Semiconductor lasers capable of generating a high output, in particular, are more likely to be affected by the optical feedback than read-only semiconductor lasers with a low output (High-power semiconductor lasers have a reduced reflectivity at the laser end facet to allow an increased power to be output to the outside. Hence, the reflected light easily enters through this end facet into an oscillation portion in the interior of the laser, changing the resonance state and making it more likely for noise to occur.)</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To reduce noise of such a semiconductor laser there has been a high-frequency superimposing method that involves superimposing a high-frequency component on a drive current of the semiconductor laser. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,314 discloses a method in which not only is a high-frequency signal superimposed on a semiconductor laser drive current during playback but the high-frequency signal of an optimum frequency and/or amplitude for forming spaces (erasing) and marks is superimposed during recording by using a common high-frequency superimposing circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, it has been a conventional practice to superimpose a high-frequency component on a semiconductor laser drive current to reduce noise caused by optical feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, when a recording current, which is based on the semiconductor laser drive current superimposed with a high-frequency component, is supplied, the leading edge position or trailing edge position of the recording current may get shifted due to the effects of the high-frequency component, resulting in the mark leading or trailing edge position on the disk being shifted. This problem becomes more significant as pit miniaturization proceeds to meet requirements for higher recording density of the recordable optical disks or as the recording speed increases.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the recording speed and density of recordable optical disks are increased, variations in mark leading edge position and mark trailing edge position pose a serious problem. First, the cause of this problem is discussed in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Information (or data) to be recorded on a disk is recorded according to a binarized modulation signal, as with the EFM modulation and 8-16 modulation. Of the two values, one corresponds to a pit (mark) and the other a land (space), and pits (marks) are formed on the disk to record data. The lengths of pit (mark) and land (space) are multiples of a period or cycle Tw of a recording reference clock (also referred to as chCLK), and the shortest lengths in the case of the EFM modulation and <b>8</b>-<b>16</b> modulation are 3 Tw. A pit (mark) of a length corresponding to the modulation signal to be recorded (also referred to as an NRZ signal) needs to be formed on a disk.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, when this modulation signal is used to emit a laser beam, the following problem occurs. That is, because a spot size of the laser beam on the disk surface is equivalent to the shortest mark length (3Tw) and because, as described above, both the write-once disk and re-writable disk utilize heat changes in the recording layer caused by the application of the laser beam and thus the recording layer itself tends to built up and disperse heat, the length of the pit (mark) and positions of the leading and trailing edges of the pit (mark) on the disk may differ from the desired ones. As a result, jitter occurs during playback, increasing a playback error rate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To deal with this problem, a recording correction generally called a write strategy has conventionally been employed during recording. More specifically, the laser beam emission start timing and end timing to form a mark are changed according to the mark length to obtain desired mark leading edge position and mark trailing edge position. Another write strategy currently in use considers the thermal effect of the land (space) period. This write strategy corrects the laser beam emission start timing according to a combination of the preceding space length and the length of the mark being formed and also the laser beam emission end timing according to a combination of the length of the mark being formed and the subsequent space length. These timing corrections (edge corrections) are carried out in units of 1/20 to 1/30 of the recording reference clock cycle Tw.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the case of CD-R, the recording speed, which was a normal to 4-time speed until a few years ago, is now a 10 to 16-time speed and will further increase to a 24 to 32-time speed. As for DVD, the recording speed is currently an 1 to normal-time speed and expected to approach a 4 to 8-time speed. Reference clock frequencies fchCLK (cycle Tw) for these recording speeds are fchCLK=43.218 MHz (Tw=23 ns) for CD with the 10-time speed, 138.3 MHz (7.2 ns) for the 32-time speed for CD, 26.16 MHz (38.2 ns) for DVD with the normal speed, 104.6 MHz (9.6 ns) for the 4-time speed for DVD, and 209.3 MHz (4.8 ns) for the 8-time speed for DVD. At these recording speeds, one-step durations (in the case of Tw/20) in the recording pulse edge correction by the so-called write strategy are 1.2 ns for the 10-time speed for CD, 0.36 ns for the 32-time speed for CD, 1.9 ns for the normal speed for DVD, 0.48 ns for the 4-time speed for DVD, and 0.24 ns for the 8-time speed for DVD. As the recording speed increases and the one-step duration in the recording pulse edge correction decreases, variations in the recording pulse edge that have presented no problem at low recording speeds can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">One of the causes for the recording pulse edge variations is influence of high-frequency components superimposed during recording. There are the following three types of influences from the high-frequency components.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(1) Variations or shifts of the edge of a recording current that drives a semiconductor laser</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(2) Edge shifts of a recording light pulse caused by delays of semiconductor laser oscillations</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(3) Variations of supplied light energy at the mark leading edge caused by variations of interval between a high-frequency-superimposed light pulse and a recording light pulse</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">These are caused by differences between an optimum frequency of the high-frequency component and the recording reference clock frequency, i.e. by variations in the phase of the high-frequency component with respect to the edge position of the mark recording current.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows how an edge of the semiconductor laser drive current varies (cause (1) listed above). In this example a high-frequency component is shown added in a direct current, rather than an alternating current, manner. (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents a semiconductor laser drive current not superimposed with a high-frequency component. In the diagram, the drive current increases in amplitude at point P to record a mark (this point P is also called a leading edge of the recording current). (b) and (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represent recording currents superimposed with a high-frequency component. These diagrams are prepared using photographs taken with multiple exposures and thus the current waveforms are shown to have some width due to phase shifts of the high-frequency component and the mark recording current edge (at point P). (b) represents a case where the high-frequency component was minimum in magnitude at point P (or where it frequently assumed the minimum value at point P), and (c) represents a case where the high-frequency component was maximum in magnitude at point P (or where it often assumed the maximum value at point P). As can be seen from comparison between (b) and (c), a phase shift of the high-frequency component at point P causes the leading edge position of the current waveform superimposed with the high-frequency component to change. The comparison between (b) and (c) shows that the edge positional shift is as large as about 1 ns pp (peak-to-peak), greater than the one-step duration in the edge correction by the write strategy described earlier (0.36 ns for the 32-time speed for CD and 0.24 ns for the 8-time speed for DVD). This shift increases as the high-frequency component increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency. While in this diagram the mark recording start point has been described, the similar change or shift occurs also at the mark recording end point.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An edge shift of the recording light pulse due to a delay in the semiconductor laser oscillation (cause (2) and (3) above) will be explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the relation between a semiconductor laser drive current and a light output when a space changes to a mark on CD-R and DVD-R. A high-frequency component is shown superimposed in an alternating current manner. In the figure, (a) represents a case where the high-frequency component returns from a negative side to zero at point P (the leading edge position of the mark recording current), and (b) represents a case where the high-frequency component returns from a positive side to zero at point P. In both cases the superimposition of the high-frequency component was stopped after the point P (in the mark forming duration or period).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, an operation before the point P in a space duration or period (a narrow pulse train formed by high frequency superimposition) will be described. In the space (land) duration before point P in CD-R and DVD-R, a high frequency superimposition is performed to read a wobble signal, address information and a servo signal with high S/N (signal-to-noise ratio) and to drive the semiconductor laser so that an average light power is equivalent to that during the normal playback. At this time, assuming that Ith denotes an oscillation threshold current of the semiconductor laser, the semiconductor laser drive current is changed from less than Ith to over Ith by superimposing a high-frequency component and then returned to less than Ith in order to produce narrow light pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In more concrete terms, when the drive current is rapidly changed from below Ith to over Ith, the semiconductor laser starts oscillation with a time delay (The semiconductor laser does not immediately initiate oscillation when the drive current exceeds Ith). The lesser (or the greater, the amplitude of high-frequency component to be superimposed), the drive current value less than Ith becomes (or the greater, the amplitude of high-frequency components becomes), the greater, the oscillation delay time becomes. Normally, the oscillation delay time is on the order of 1-2 ns. A high power semiconductor laser, when turned on, starts oscillating with a relaxation oscillation. A spectrum of the laser beam has a plurality of frequency components (called a multimode), rather than a single frequency (a single mode). After the relaxation oscillation, the laser changes to a single mode. The high frequency superimposition takes advantage of this oscillation delay to stop oscillation (emission) during the relaxation oscillation period to emit narrow light pulses having a plurality of frequency components and thereby alleviate influences of the optical feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, an outputting of light after the point P in a mark forming duration or period (edge delay of a recording light pulse) will be explained. As described above, when the drive current is changed rapidly from below Ith to over Ith, the semiconductor laser starts oscillation (i.e., produces light) with a time delay. The oscillation delay time varies depending on how much the current value immediately before a start point of the mark forming drive current is less than Ith or higher than Ith, thus changing the timing at which to start outputting the mark forming light (i.e., start oscillating and producing light).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the case of (a-<b>1</b>) and (a-<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the drive current changes from below Ith to IPw and therefore an oscillation delay occurs, delaying the timing at which to start outputting a mark forming light as during the high frequency superimposition. In the case of (b-<b>1</b>) and (b-<b>2</b>), the drive current changes from Ith to IPw and thus the semiconductor laser performs a linear operation (in which the power of emitted light is proportional to the drive current) and does not cause an oscillation delay such as observed in (a-<b>1</b>) and (a-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the start timing of the mark forming drive current (point P) and the high-frequency component are not synchronous, the value of the high-frequency component at point P and immediately before that point changes randomly, resulting in random variations in the mark forming light output start timing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, variations of supplied light energy at the mark leading edge caused by variations of interval between a high-frequency-superimposed light pulse and a recording light pulse will be explained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when viewed from the standpoint of supplied light energy near the mark forming light output start timing, the interval between the high-frequency-superimposed light pulse and the mark forming light pulse is wide in the case of (a-<b>1</b>) and (a-<b>2</b>). In the case of (b-<b>1</b>) and (b-<b>2</b>), the interval between the high-frequency-superimposed light pulse and the mark forming light pulse is narrow. That is, the high-frequency-superimposed light pulse and the mark forming light pulse are very close to each other. This difference between the two cases results in a difference in the light energy supplied to the disk when starting to form a mark. This means that the position of the leading edge of a mark formed on the disk can randomly change depending on the phase of the high-frequency component. Particularly in the case of (a-<b>1</b>) and (a-<b>2</b>), since the supplied energy is small and the timing at which to start producing a mark forming light pulse is delayed by the oscillation delay, the leading edge of a mark on the disk shifts backward in time when compared with the case of (b-<b>1</b>) and (b-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It has been shown above that the mark start position on a disk is changed by a random change in the phase relation between a high-frequency component and a mark forming drive current start position that is caused by the superimposition of the high-frequency component. That is, (1) when a high-frequency component is superimposed near (before or after) the mark forming drive current start position, the leading edge of the mark forming drive current itself varies in phase. Even if the superimposition of a high-frequency component is stopped at the mark forming drive current start position, (2) the oscillation delay varies according to the value of the directly preceding high-frequency component, changing the mark forming light output start timing. Further, (3) the supplied light energy near the mark forming light output start timing is changed by the variation of the phase relation between the high-frequency component and the mark recording drive current. These variations in turn randomly change the mark start position on the disk, causing jitter during playback. An influence of jitter-induced degradation becomes large particularly during high-speed recording. What has been described above similarly holds also for the mark end position.</p>

The phase comparator performs a frequency comparison and a phase comparison between the clock CLK from the controller <b>1</b> and the output signal chCLK from the tapped VCO and, based on detected errors, controls the oscillation frequency and phase of the output signal of the tapped VCO. The output signal chCLK of the tapped VCO constitutes a recording clock. The tapped VCO has 40 variable delay elements to form an open loop to construct an oscillation circuit (ring oscillator). An output of each variable delay element is output as a tap. Suppose that the tap outputs range from subclk<b>0</b> to subclk <b>39</b>. Then, a time difference between subclk n and subclk n+1 is one-fortieth of the cycle Tw of the recording clock chCLK. The sub-clocks subclk<b>0</b>-<b>39</b> are supplied to a timer described later so that the OUTE_Pw, OUTE_Per, OUTE_Pb and HF<b>1</b>_cont signals can be controlled in units of Tw/40.</p>

(<b>8</b>) shows how the output current Ihf of the high-frequency component generation circuit (HFM) <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> is turned on or off. Here, control delay times of the output current Ihf with respect to the HF_on/off_cont signal are shown as Thf<b>1</b>_turn_off and Thf<b>1</b>_turn_on. Normally, the on-off control of large currents (on the order of several tens of mA) results in some control delay.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thf<b>1</b>_off time shown at (<b>4</b>) indicates a time which elapses from the high-frequency component Ihf being cut off to the mark recording start timing (leading edge of OUTE_Pw). Thf<b>1</b>_on indicates a time which passes from the mark recording end timing (more precisely, Tf time after the end of OUTE_Pw, where Tf is a mark recording current fall time) to the start of high-frequency component superimposition.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this embodiment, the value of Thf<b>1</b>_off timing parameter is set considering a range of change of the Tsfp value (mark recording start timing) so that the (Thf<b>1</b>_turn_off+Thf<b>1</b>_off) time is greater than a predetermined value. Similarly, Thf<b>1</b>_on time is set considering a range of change of the Tecp value (mark recording end timing) so that Thf<b>1</b>_off time is not less than zero. As a result, the Thf<b>1</b>_off time and the Thf<b>1</b>_on time can be set equal to or higher than zero, thus avoiding the mark edge shifting caused by high-frequency component superimposition that is experienced with conventional technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a case where the Thf<b>1</b>_off time is set to more than half a cycle Tosc of a high-frequency component. In this case the superimposition of a high-frequency component is stopped at point Q, rather than at point P. Dotted line in the figure indicates a waveform when the high frequency superimposition is stopped at point P, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Because the superimposition of the high-frequency component is stopped for the duration between point Q and point P in both cases of (a) and (b), the semiconductor laser drive currents for the Q-to-P period in the two cases are equal, causing the mark forming light output to be started at the same timing. In the case of (a) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an oscillation was delayed to delay the laser output and in the case of (b) the mark forming light output was initiated without the oscillation delay.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, by increasing the Toff time (Thf_off time), it is possible to reduce variations in the supplied light energy at the mark start point that are caused by the phase shift of start timing of the high-frequency component and the mark forming drive current.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above example, the parameters stored in RAM(<b>3</b>) <b>132</b>-<b>1</b><i>a </i>were two timing parameters, HF<b>1</b>_off and HF<b>1</b>_on, as shown at (<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Hence, changing the mark start timing according to the mark/space lengths results in the high frequency superimposition halt durations, Thf<b>1</b>_on and Thf<b>1</b>_off, being changed. The minimum value of the halt duration needs to be set such that variations in the supplied light energy at the mark leading and trailing edges are small and that the mark edge shifts on the disk are negligible.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">With this arrangement, HF<b>1</b>_off(as−bm) can be set so that the halt time Thf<b>1</b>_off is constant at all times for a particular space/mark length combination corresponding to the set value of Tsfp(as-bm) where “a” represents a space length and “b” represents a mark length. In other words, this can be realized by setting HF<b>1</b>_off(as-bm) so that a difference between the two set values is constant for the same space/mark length combination. As a result, the effect the high-frequency component has on a leading edge of mark can be made equal for all mark lengths. Similarly, HF<b>1</b>_on(bm−as) can be set so that the halt time Thf<b>1</b>_on is always constant for a particular mark/space length combination corresponding to the set value of Tecp(bm-as). As a result, the effect of the high-frequency component on the trailing edge of mark can be made equal for all mark lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It is also possible to stop the superimposition of a high-frequency component for a particular space length by setting a particular timing parameter value HF<b>1</b>_on(bm-as) to 00h. For example, when a space length is short, the superimposing of a high-frequency component can be stopped. This allows the Thf<b>1</b>_off and Thf<b>1</b>_on times to be set large even when the space length is short, thereby reducing the influence of the high-frequency component superimposition (variations in the supplied optical energy at the mark leading and trailing edges).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As described above, in the first embodiment, the high frequency superimposition method for superimposing a high-frequency component in a space duration on CD-R involves stopping the high-frequency component superimposition for a Thf<b>1</b>_off time before the start of a mark forming semiconductor laser drive current and then resuming the high-frequency component superimposition a Thf<b>1</b>_on time after the end of the mark forming semiconductor laser drive current. This can avoid adverse effects of the high-frequency component (e.g., overlapping due to control delays of high-frequency component and oscillation delay variations) that occur at the start or end timing of the mark forming semiconductor laser drive current and the mark forming light output. Further reductions in the influences of the high-frequency component (variations in the supplied optical energy at the mark leading and trailing edges) can be realized by increasing Thf<b>1</b>_off and Thf<b>1</b>_on times.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A second embodiment represents a case where a high-frequency component is superimposed in space and mark periods during recording. More specifically, the second embodiment controls the start and stop of the superimposition of a high-frequency component in space periods using a first high frequency superimposition control circuit and also controls the start and stop of the superimposition of a high-frequency component in mark periods using a second high frequency superimposition control circuit. Example cases of this embodiment include one in which a CD-R is contemplated to be recorded and played back by superimposing a high-frequency component during space periods and a different high-frequency component during mark periods, and one in which a CD-RW is contemplated to be played back by superimposing a high-frequency component and recorded by superimposing another high-frequency component with different frequency and amplitude in space periods.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, an example of the second embodiment as applied to CD-R recording, in which space periods (and read periods) are superimposed with a high-frequency component and mark periods with a different high-frequency component, will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an operation timing of the write strategy &amp; HF on/off controller <b>13</b>-<b>2</b> when the second embodiment is applied to CD-R recording. What differs from the operation timing of the write strategy &amp; HF on/off controller <b>13</b>-<b>1</b> of the first embodiment is that an operation of the second high frequency superimposition control circuit <b>133</b> shown at (<b>12</b>-<b>2</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and its output signal HF<b>2</b>_cont shown at (<b>6</b>-<b>2</b>) are added.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In this embodiment, Timer(<b>4</b>) <b>133</b>-<b>2</b> takes in a timing parameter HF<b>2</b>_on at the start of, for example, T<b>2</b> period and an internal timer is started. The second high frequency superimposition control circuit controls the start/stop of superimposition of a high-frequency component during the mark period. In order to start the high frequency superimposition after the time-out of Tsfp, the HF<b>2</b>_on timing parameter is taken in at the same timing as Tsfp. Since the stopping of a high-frequency component during the mark period is done prior to Tecp (mark recording current end timing), the timing at which to take in the HF<b>2</b>_off timing parameter is advanced 1T from the pickup timing of Tecp.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown at (<b>6</b>-<b>2</b>) in the figure, the HF<b>2</b>_cont signal is reset at the time-out of HF<b>2</b>_off (i.e., at the timing of the terminal end of arrow) and is set (high) at the time-out of HF<b>2</b>_on. It is noted that the arrow representing the operation of Timer(<b>4</b>) <b>133</b>-<b>2</b> triggered by HF<b>2</b>_on at the start of T<b>2</b> period is shown as a dotted line. This indicates that Timer(<b>4</b>) <b>133</b>-<b>2</b> is made inactive by setting to 00h the value of the HF<b>2</b>_off(as−bm) timing parameter with this mark/space length combination. Setting this timing parameter value to a valid value other than 00h will cause the Timer(<b>4</b>) <b>133</b>-<b>2</b> to operate as shown by the dotted line arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">This means that whether a particular mark is to be superimposed with a high-frequency component can be controlled by setting the value of HF<b>2</b>_on(as−bm) to 00 h or a valid value according to a mark/space length combination. For example, it is possible to perform the high frequency superimposition on only those marks 6T or more long. Further, as in the first embodiment, it is also possible to control whether or not the high frequency superimposition is to be performed on a particular space by setting HF<b>1</b>_on(bm−as) timing parameter value to 00h or a valid data.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Therefore, the high frequency superimposition can be stopped for marks and spaces that are shorter than a predetermined length, thereby reducing adverse effects of the superimposition of high-frequency components (variations of supplied optical energy at mark leading and trailing edges).</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Also in the superimposition of the second high-frequency component in mark periods, the setting value of the HF<b>2</b>_off timing parameter HF<b>2</b>_off(bm-as) is set according to the value of Tecp (marking recording end timing) to make the (Thf<b>2</b>_turn_off+Thf<b>2</b>_off) time not less than a predetermined value. Further, the setting value of the HF<b>2</b>_on timing parameter HF<b>2</b>_on(as-bm) is set according to the value of Tsfp (mark recording start timing) to make the Thf<b>2</b>_on time not less than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As a result, the superimposition of a high-frequency component is stopped for the Thf<b>1</b>_off time preceding the mark recording start timing and for the Thf<b>2</b>_on time following the mark recording start timing.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As described above, in the method of the second embodiment for superimposing different high-frequency components in space and mark periods during CD-R recording, since the high frequency superimposition is stopped for the Thf<b>1</b>_off time and the Thf<b>2</b>_on time before and after the start of the mark forming semiconductor laser drive current and also for the Thf<b>2</b>_off time and the Thf<b>1</b>_on time before and after the end of the mark forming semiconductor laser drive current.

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The HF VCO <b>156</b> uses outputs of eight variable delay elements, which form the VCO, as tap output signals Tap_<b>0</b> to Tap_<b>7</b> for transfer to the HF duty control circuit <b>159</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an operation timing of the HF duty control circuit <b>159</b>. (1) in the figure represents tap signals Tap_<b>0</b> to Tap_<b>7</b>. (2) represents an example output signal of the HF duty control circuit <b>159</b>. An output (<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>) is generated by outputting the Tap_<b>0</b> signal as is and has a duty of 50%. An output (<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>) is generated by performing AND logic on Tap_<b>0</b> and Tap_<b>1</b> and has a duty of 37.5%. An output (<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>) is generated by performing AND logic on Tap_<b>0</b> and Tap_<b>2</b> and has a duty of 25%. An output (<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>) is generated by performing AND logic on Tap_<b>0</b> and Tap_<b>3</b> and has a duty of 12.5%.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Output signals (<b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) to (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) are generated by using Tap_<b>4</b> to Tap_<b>7</b> signals. (<b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) is a frequency signal with a 75% duty, (<b>2</b>-<b>6</b>) is a frequency signal with a 50% duty and (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) is a frequency signal with a 25% duty. Generation logic for these signals are shown in the figure. As shown at (<b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) to (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>), since high-frequency components can be generated which have two times the oscillation frequency of the HF VCO <b>156</b>, the variable frequency range can be expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Which of these high-frequency components (<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>) to (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) is to be output is selected by the set values of the Duty<b>1</b> register <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> and Duty<b>2</b> register <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">By varying the duty of the high-frequency component, the duration of the drive current higher than the oscillation threshold value Ith of the semiconductor laser diode <b>4</b>, tover, can be varied. This is almost equivalent to changing the tover time by changing the frequency of the ordinary high-frequency component with a 50% duty.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows an operation timing when the third embodiment is applied to the above-described CD-R recording in which a high-frequency component is superimposed in space and mark periods. In this example, the synchronous/asynchrohous_sel signal as shown at (<b>9</b>) is set high (asynchronous) when the /WR signal is high (Read) and is set low (synchronous with clock) when the /WR signal is low (Write). Hence, during the Read period a high-frequency component with a frequency corresponding to the set value of the FREQ<b>1</b> register <b>17</b>-<b>1</b> is superimposed, as in the conventional technology. During the Write period, the HF VCO <b>156</b> is controlled by the HF phase compare circuit <b>155</b> and outputs a signal synchronous with the clock signal CLK supplied from the controller <b>1</b>. The write strategy circuit <b>131</b> also operates using the recording clock chCLK which is generated by multiplying the clock signal CLK from the controller <b>1</b> by the PLL <b>131</b>-<b>4</b>. Therefore, the recording clock and the high-frequency component signal are synchronized through CLK.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As shown at (<b>7</b>-<b>1</b>) and (<b>7</b>-<b>2</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, when the HF_on/off_cont signal is high (HF on) and the HF_½_select signal is high (HF<b>1</b>), the dividing N<b>1</b> register <b>22</b>-<b>1</b>, the Duty<b>1</b> register <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> and the AMP<b>1</b> register <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> are selected and a high-frequency component with the corresponding frequency, duty and amplitude is superimposed on the semiconductor laser drive current by the high-frequency component generation circuit (HFM) <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>. When the HF_½_select signal is low (HF<b>2</b>), the dividing N<b>2</b> register <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>, the Duty<b>2</b> register <b>23</b>-<b>2</b> and AMP<b>2</b> register <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> are selected and a high-frequency component with the corresponding frequency, duty and amplitude is superimposed on the semiconductor laser drive current.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The output current Ihf of the high-frequency component generation circuit (HFM) <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> is shown at (<b>8</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. (<b>4</b>) shows Ihf superimposed on the semiconductor laser drive current.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As described above, in the third embodiment, since the high-frequency component signal is synchronized with the recording clock, the phase relation between the high-frequency component and the mark recording start and end positions does not change, as it does in the first and second embodiments, and remains constant at all times, with the result that the effects of the high-frequency component on the leading and trailing edges of the mark being formed become constant. Thus, it is possible to avoid variations in the supplied optical energy at the mark recording start and end positions caused by the asynchronous high-frequency component.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Further, in synchronizing the high-frequency component with the recording clock, the multiplier N for the reference clock CLK and the duty of the high-frequency component signal are made variable, allowing an optical output of a desired pulse width to be produced. Therefore, a light pulse that is equivalent to one set at an optimum frequency can be produced. This in turn makes it possible to set an optimum condition equivalent to that obtained by the conventional high-frequency component generation method.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Further, reducing the duty at a lower frequency than is used in the conventional technique can equivalently produce the same effect that is obtained by the superimposition at a higher frequency. This in turn allows the operation frequency of the high-frequency component generation circuit itself to be reduced, compared with conventional methods. Further, by using a high-frequency component with a low frequency, the power consumption and unwanted radiation can be mitigated.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 4</heading>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the first to third embodiments, our explanations concerned example cases in which a new HF on/off control timer is provided for each of the first and second high frequency superimposition control circuits. It is also possible to use the timer in the write strategy circuit to equivalently perform the HF on/off control.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, during the Read and Per periods the output signal of the write strategy circuit may be used to perform the HF superimposition and, during the space period, the HF stop control may be executed by inserting, prior to the mark recording start timing, a power state (e.g., Pb and Per<b>1</b>) different from that of Per at the same power level as Per.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Similarly, the HF superimposition start control may be done by inserting, for a predetermined duration after the mark recording end timing, a power state (e.g., Pb and Per<b>2</b>) different from that of Per at the same power level as Per. In this case, the HF control logic needs to be formed so that the HF superimposition is executed during the power state of Per and stopped during Pb, Per<b>1</b> and Per<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">This arrangement allows the HF on/off control to be executed without having to increase the number of timers, thus reducing a size of the timer circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As described above, with this invention, positional variations on a disk of the mark leading and trailing edges caused by the superimposition of a high-frequency component can be eliminated. This in turn prevents jitter-induced degradations during high-speed recording.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p>
