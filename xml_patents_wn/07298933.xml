<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2004-99479, filed Nov. 30, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an optical module, and more particularly, to an optical module using a matching circuit which includes a double stub or a double balanced open stub, a grounded waveguide, a microstrip line transition region and a microstrip line.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, with the development of wireless communications, technologies for transmitting broadband signals to subscribers have been developed. A radio over fiber (ROF) technology for transmitting RF signals through a fiber has been popularly used as a method for transmitting various data from a base station to subscribers without loss.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Researches have been made on impedance matching of an optical modulator module, a laser diode module and an optical receiver module used for an ROF link for minimizing loss of RF signals by transmitting the signals through an optical fiber. Generally, a lumped type device has been used for impedance matching. However, since a maximum frequency is restricted by an RC time constant by a capacitance of the device and a load resistance, the device has difficulty in processing high speed electric signals of 40 GHz and 60 GHz. In addition, a bandwidth is fixed in a specific frequency and not efficiently controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One example of the impedance matching structure of the lumped type optical device has been disclosed under U.S. Pat. No. 6,101,295. A conventional lumped type optical module will now be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating an optical module having an impedance matching structure for the conventional lumped type optical device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a device <b>1</b> and a signal line <b>5</b> of a microstrip line of a dielectric substrate <b>3</b> on which an impedance matching circuit is formed are coupled to each other by using a gold wire or gold ribbon <b>4</b>. Impedance matching is performed through double open stub <b>2</b> formed in the orthogonal direction to the series microstrip line <b>5</b>. In the case that impedance matching is not accurately performed through the open stubs <b>2</b>, one or both of the two stubs <b>2</b> are trimmed in the width or length direction, so that impedance matching can be performed in a target frequency to obtain a maximum return loss.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the aforementioned method is used for the lumped type device whose substrate is an n-type substrate and electrode is formed on a metal on a p-type semiconductor formed on the top surface. In the lumped type device, a capacitance and a load resistance are combined, to cause frequency restrictions by an RC time constant. Therefore, the lumped type device cannot be efficiently applied to high frequency such as 40 GHz, 60 GHz</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, since the open stubs <b>2</b> for impedance matching are formed in one direction of the microstrip line <b>5</b>, a spurious mode may occur by interactions between the microstrip line <b>5</b> and the open stubs <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Devices used for a high speed optical module are classified into a lumped type device and a traveling wave type device. The traveling wave type device can efficiently process 40 GHz and 60 GHz of high speed electric signals. That is, the traveling wave type device prevents frequency restrictions caused by a capacitance with evenly distributing the capacitance. Conversely, a capacitance of the lumped type device is concentrated and coupled to a load resistance, which results in frequency restrictions by the RC time constant. Accordingly, the lumped type device is not appropriate to process high speed signals.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the impedance is matched for the optical device at a specific frequency, a bandwidth may need to be adjusted so that the signals with different bandwidth which is specified by channel environment, numbers of subscribers, kind of data and so on, can be transferred to subscribers. When the conventional lumped type device is used, an open type termination resistance is applied. Therefore, a bandwidth can be adjusted only by using a few open stubs and the variations are limited.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is directed to maximization of gains of an ROF link and easy control of a bandwidth for obtaining a bandwidth required in a specific frequency, by maximizing a return loss of a high speed optical module on which a traveling wave type optical device is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One aspect of the present invention is to provide an optical module, including: a microstrip line; a traveling wave type optical device positioned in the end of the microstrip line; and at least one stub coupled to the microstrip line, wherein a transition region including the microstrip line and a coplanar waveguide is formed to be coupled to the optical device, and a termination resistor is formed to face the microstrip line with the optical device therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The optical device is an optical modulator, a laser diode or a photodiode. The optical modulator has a waveguide structure in which a passive optical waveguide, an active optical waveguide and a passive optical waveguide are sequentially formed. Preferably, in the optical module including the traveling wave type optical device, the stub crosses the microstrip line in the orthogonal direction and is protruded from at least one surface of the microstrip line. Two or more stubs can be formed in parallel. The stub can be a balanced open stub. The width of the microstrip line decreases in the transition region. The stub is formed in a rectangular flat plate shape. An orthogonal-transition structure (mitred) can be formed at both ends of the stub in parallel to the proceeding direction of a RF signal through the microstrip line if the stub length is larger than the width of the substrate. At least partial area of the vertically-transited structure is trimmed to maintain a predetermined capacitance. The optical device is interconnected to the transition region and the impedance matching circuit through a gold wire or ribbon. The termination resistance is a thin film resistor. A bandwidth of a predetermined frequency is controlled by adjusting a resistance value of the termination resistor. A bandwidth of a predetermined frequency is also controlled by adjusting a number of the stubs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed below, but can be implemented in various types. Therefore, the present embodiment is provided for complete disclosure of the present invention and to fully inform the scope of the present invention to those ordinarily skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic plan view and a cross-sectional view illustrating an optical module in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the optical module includes a microstrip line <b>90</b>, a traveling wave type optical device <b>60</b> positioned at the end of the microstrip line <b>90</b>, and at least one stub <b>100</b> coupled to the microstrip line <b>90</b>. A transition region <b>80</b> is formed between the optical device <b>60</b> and the microstrip line <b>90</b>, and a termination resistance <b>120</b> is formed to face the microstrip line <b>90</b> with the optical device <b>60</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In more detail, the optical module includes a base substrate <b>190</b> having a protruding part, first and second dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>, the optical device <b>60</b> disposed on the protruding part of the base substrate <b>190</b>, and a thermoelectric cooler (TEC; not shown) disposed at the lower portion of the base substrate <b>190</b>. The aforementioned elements are packaged in a module housing (not shown). Preferably, the optical device <b>60</b> is an optical modulator, a laser diode or a photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base substrate <b>190</b> has electric conductivity. A hexahedral protruding part is formed on the base substrate <b>190</b>. The microstrip line <b>90</b>, the transition region <b>80</b> between the microstrip line <b>90</b> and a grounded coplanar waveguide, the open stub <b>100</b> are disposed on the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The traveling wave type optical device <b>60</b> includes ground <b>170</b>—signal line <b>180</b>—ground <b>170</b> electrodes on a semi-insulating substrate. The first dielectric substrate <b>150</b> having an impedance matching circuit and the second dielectric substrate <b>160</b> having the termination resistor <b>120</b> are mounted at both sides of the device <b>60</b>. The transition structure <b>80</b> between the grounded coplanar waveguide and the microstrip line <b>90</b> is formed on the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b> on which the impedance matching circuit is disposed. The transition structure <b>80</b> serves to transfer an RF between the microstrip line <b>90</b> and the coplanar waveguide without loss. The transition structure is required because of the structure difference of the device <b>60</b> and the microstrip line <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since a half via <b>110</b> is formed on the ground surface for the grounded coplanar waveguide, the ground on the top surface of the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b> is electrically connected to the ground on the bottom surface thereof. Instead of using the half via <b>110</b>, the top surface ground can be connected to the bottom surface ground through the side surface of the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b>. Considering that a pitch of the ground <b>170</b>—signal line <b>180</b>—ground <b>170</b> of the device <b>60</b> is small, the signal line of the microstrip line <b>90</b> is preferably narrowed in the transition region <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The impedance matching circuit is formed on the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b>. The matching circuit includes the balanced open stub <b>100</b>, and is aligned in the orthogonal direction to the RF proceeding direction. The open stub <b>100</b> is preferably formed in a rectangular flat plate shape and connected to the microstrip line <b>90</b> to cross the microstrip line <b>90</b> at the right angle. The open stub <b>100</b> is formed on the first dielectric substrate <b>150</b>. Preferably, the open stub <b>100</b> and the microstrip line <b>90</b> connected to the open stub <b>100</b> compose the matching circuit. The number of the open stubs <b>100</b> can be varied according to the semiconductor structure of the optical device <b>60</b>. Preferably, two or more balanced open stubs <b>100</b> are formed in parallel to each other. A bandwidth of a predetermined frequency can be controlled by adjusting the number of the stubs <b>100</b>. Preferably, the open stub <b>100</b> is formed to cross the microstrip line <b>90</b> at the right angle. Also, the open stub <b>100</b> can be protruded from one side surface of the microstrip line <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the balanced open stub is used as the stub <b>100</b>. The advantage of the balanced open stub <b>100</b> is to restrict interactions reaction between the microstrip line <b>90</b> formed in parallel to the RF proceeding direction and the stub <b>100</b>. The stub <b>100</b> matches the impedance in a target frequency with an external circuit such as a driver or amplifier, thereby transmitting signals without loss.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">On the other hand, in design of the stub <b>100</b>, a length of the stub <b>100</b> may be restricted. Since a width of a dielectric substance is restricted to align the device <b>60</b> with an optical fiber, the length of the stub <b>100</b> is inevitably limited for the impedance matching. In this case, the end of the stub <b>100</b> has orthogonal transition in parallel to the RF proceeding direction to increase the length of the stub <b>100</b>. Preferably, the some part of the orthogonal transition is removed to reduce a increased capacitance because of the increased area.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The structure of ground—signal line—ground is formed on the second dielectric substrate <b>160</b> having the termination resistor <b>120</b> in the same pitch as that of the device <b>60</b>. The grounds are incorporated. The ground on the top surface of the dielectric substance <b>160</b> is electrically connected to the ground on the bottom surface thereof through a via <b>130</b>. The termination resistor <b>120</b> (preferably, the thin film resistance) is formed between the signal line and the ground. The resistance value can be 30Ω, 50Ω, 100Ω, 500Ω or a specific impedance of the device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A bandwidth of a target frequency can be controlled by adjusting the value of the termination resistor <b>120</b>. The device <b>60</b> and the dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> can be interconnected through a gold wire or gold ribbon <b>140</b>. When the value of the termination resistor <b>120</b> is open, the gold thread is not connected between the signal lines of the device <b>60</b> and the termination resistor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Since the device <b>60</b> and the first and second dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> have different heights, the device <b>60</b> and the first and second dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> are mounted on the base substrate <b>190</b> having irregular parts by using a conductive epoxy or solder. Since an inductance related with the gold wire <b>140</b> for electrically connecting the device <b>60</b> to patterns of the first and second dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> is minimized by minimizing the length of the gold wire <b>140</b>, the height of the device <b>60</b> and the substrates <b>105</b> and <b>160</b> should be same. Preferably, the base substrate <b>190</b> is made of CuW having high thermal conductivity, for efficiently dissipating heat generated in the device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, in order to precisely match the impedance, after the module is fabricated, the return loss is measured by a network analyzer, both ends of the open stub <b>100</b> are evenly trimmed by a trimming process, and the return loss is re-measured. This procedure is repeated until a maximum return loss is obtained in a target frequency, which results in precise impedance matching.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a schematic plan view illustrating the optical module formed by installing the optical device impedance-matched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in the module housing and coupling the optical device to the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, continuous wave (unmodulated) light is transmitted to the device <b>60</b> from a lensed fiber <b>200</b>, modulated, and transmitted to an opposite side lensed fiber <b>200</b>. Here, lenses can replace the lensed fibers <b>200</b> to perform the same function. The fibers <b>200</b>, the device <b>60</b>, the dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> and the base substrate <b>190</b> are mounted in the module housing <b>210</b>. The module housing <b>210</b> includes a connector <b>220</b> for RF signal transmission. The RF signals from an external circuit are transmitted to the traveling wave type device <b>60</b> through the connector <b>220</b> and the impedance matching circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When a too long stub <b>100</b> is designed for impedance matching, the width of the dielectric substance may not be sufficiently wide enough. In this case, when the optical device <b>60</b> is an optical modulator, the width of the dielectric substrates <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> is increased by increasing the size of the device <b>60</b> in the light proceeding direction by changing the design of the optical waveguide <b>70</b> in the light proceeding direction, thereby designing necessary stubs <b>100</b>. That is, because the optical waveguide <b>70</b> of the optical modulator includes a passive waveguide, an active waveguide and a passive waveguide, the length of the passive waveguide or active waveguide can be appropriately increased.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the base substrate <b>190</b> is formed under the traveling wave type optical device <b>60</b>, and the TEC <b>230</b> for maintaining a constant temperature is formed under the base substrate <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing the return loss before and after performing the trimming process in the optical module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a target frequency is about 40 GHz. In 40 GHz, the return loss is about 5 dB before the trimming process (x) and about 40 dB after the trimming process (y).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The vertical axis indicates the return loss property (dB) known as S<b>11</b> parameter, and the horizontal axis indicates the frequency (GHz). For better understating, the return loss is expressed from 0 and the vertical axis is expressed in a negative direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the other hand, the return loss is represented by the following equation.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Return loss(dB)=−10 log<sub>10</sub>(<i>P</i><sub>2</sub><i>/P</i><sub>1</sub>)  [Equation 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, under the condition presuming that an RF signal is input from the side surface of the microstrip line <b>90</b>, the power P<sub>1 </sub>is an input from an input terminal (not shown) and the return power P<sub>2 </sub>is reflective power returning to the input terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing bandwidth variations with termination resistor value in the measured return loss in the optical module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, traveling wave type optical devices with the same properties are mounted on modules whose termination resistance value is open and 30Ω, respectively, and the return loss is maximized in the target frequency by the trimming process described above. As a result, the bandwidth bw<b>2</b> of the module whose termination resistor value is 30Ω is at least twice as large as the bandwidth bw<b>1</b> of the module whose termination resistor value is open.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Therefore, when the ROF link needs to transmit wide bandwidth to subscribers, the bandwidth can be increased by adjusting the termination resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As discussed earlier, in accordance with the present invention, the impedance matching and optical module structure for the traveling wave type optical device matches the impedance between the traveling wave type optical device and the external circuit for driving the optical device. When it is necessary to control the bandwidth in the target frequency, the bandwidth can be controlled by adjusting the termination resistance value.</p>
