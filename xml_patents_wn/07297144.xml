<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the reduction of regions of blood stasis and ultimately thrombus formation in such regions, particularly in the atrial appendages for patients with atrial fibrillation. More specifically, the invention relates to procedures and devices for affixing the atrial appendages in an orientation that reduces subsequent formation of thrombus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The atria must enable organized electrical propagation from the SA Node to the AV Node to stimulate the atria to contract in an organized way to transport blood from the atria to the ventricles, and to provide timed stimulation of the ventricles. The atrial appendages are especially important in the transport of blood because they have a sack-like geometry with a neck potentially more narrow than the pouch. In this case, contraction of the appendage is essential to maintain an average absolute blood velocity high enough to eliminate potential stasis regions which may lead to thrombus formation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Atrial fibrillation and abnormalities which may lead to atrial fibrillation (such as mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation) are often associated with abnormal electrical propagation through the heart leading to inefficient transport of blood in certain regions of the atria, and/or an enlargement of one or both atria to up to 2-3 times the normal size.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, atrial fibrillation has often been treated either by administration of drugs or through surgical procedures, for example, procedures which surgically create a maze pattern in the atria which reduces the probability of fibrillation. The typical access points into the interior of the atria during a surgical procedure are the atrial appendages. Therefore, at the conclusion of the surgical procedure, the region occupied by the atrial appendages is eliminated by surgically removing the appendages. This mitigates subsequent problems resulting from blood stasis in the atrial appendages as well as from electrical isolation of the appendages from the rest of the atria.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More recently, maze-like procedures have been developed utilizing catheters which may create long thin lesions to effectively create a maze for electrical conduction in a predetermined path. However, such minimally invasive procedures may result in regions of continued blood stasis, particularly in the atrial appendages due to electrical isolation of the appendages or decreased contractility of the tissue due to the destruction of large regions of atrial tissue. Also, the response of the atria to permanent conversion from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm after a catheter-based and/or surgical maze procedure has not been proven to return appendage function to normal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since such catheterization procedures do not admit themselves to surgical removal of the appendages, a need has developed for procedures and devices which reduce stasis regions to effectively minimize subsequent thrombus formation within the appendages. Specifically, procedures and devices which reposition the atrial appendages and affix them in the altered position to reduce stasis regions and ultimately thrombus formation would be desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An important aspect of the invention involves providing methods and devices to reposition the atrial appendages, for example by inversion thereof either totally or partially. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, several embodiments of devices are provided for grabbing or otherwise attaching themselves to an appendage wall and either inverting or otherwise pulling the walls of the appendage together to reduce the size of the region of potential blood stasis, and consequently the volume of the affected atrium. In accordance with this aspect, it is an object of the invention to reduce the region of potentially static blood and, hence the thrombogenicity of the atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one embodiment addressing this aspect of the invention, a device is provided which uses a distal helical coil to penetrate the appendage wall and, thus, provide an attachment for pulling the appendage inwardly into the atrium. In accordance with a further, alternative, embodiment, a multi-pronged grabbing device is provided on the distal end of a catheter which enables grabbing of the appendage surface with the prongs for pulling on the walls to cause an inversion thereof and/or to reduce atrial volume. In accordance with a still further alternative embodiment, a device is provided which perforates the appendage wall and then this, or another member is inserted to expand on the exterior appendage wall surface, thereby anchoring the catheter to the appendage wall so that the wall may be pulled into the atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another important aspect of the invention involves methods and devices for affixing the appendages in a predetermined position for permanent reduction of potential stasis regions. In accordance with one embodiment addressing this aspect of the invention, the appendages are chemically bonded in a predetermined position such as the inverted position. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, it is preferred that a biocompatible chemical bonding agent be introduced into the area outside of the appendages to chemically bond them in position, without bonding the epicardial surface of the atria to the pericardium. In accordance with this constraint, the chemical bonding can be assisted by utilizing an encircling tying means which may either be formed of a material designed to permanently stay in place around the appendage or, alternatively, which may be a temporary support structure for maintaining the appendage's shape during the affixing process.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, alternative devices are provided for introduction of chemical bonding agents into the area outside of the appendage epicardium. In accordance with one such embodiment, a helical grasping device is provided which uses a hollow helical coil, which thereby provides a lumen for injecting a bonding agent therethrough after the appendage wall has been penetrated by the helical device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an alternative embodiment related to this aspect, a separate probe is provided for introduction of a chemical bonding agent. The separate probe may take the form of a sharply pointed elongated hollow tubular canula which forms an injection port separate from the appendage surface grasping device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with yet another alternative embodiment addressing this aspect of the invention, several alternative devices and procedures for mechanically fixing the appendages in a desired orientation are provided. In accordance with one such embodiment of the invention, an appendage encircling lasso device is utilized to encircle and affix the appendages into the desired orientation. In accordance with a related alternative embodiment, the lasso device may be of the zip-tie type which utilizes a ratcheting mechanism on the surface of the encircling material so that the lasso is of the type that can be tightened but cannot loosen once affixed in the tightened position. In accordance with a still further alternative embodiment addressing this aspect of the invention, a pre-shaped memory elastic material such as nickel titanium or a similar material may be introduced around or into the appendage and allowed to resume its shape either by elastic memory or temperature transition memory to thereby affix the position of the inverted appendage. Such devices may either be pre-shaped to encircle the inverted appendage or may be extended through the appendage walls to mechanically affix them together.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with yet another procedure for affixing the appendage walls together, there is provided a catheter having RF energy emitting electrodes which can thermally fuse the inverted appendage walls together.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with a still further alternate embodiment, a device such as a nitinol mesh is introduced into the atrial appendage interior without inversion thereof in order to form a reinforcement for anchoring thrombi in position where collagen may accumulate to fill the appendage with natural materials which are thus anchored in place so that they do not enter the bloodstream.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a yet further embodiment of the invention, a suture material may be secured to the appendage walls, in an arrangement resembling a purse drawstring, which can be pulled together to compress the appendage walls against each other into a tightened sack where the pouch of the appendage is effectively separated from the blood pool of the atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, the claims and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring more specifically to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> show, in fragmentary fashion, the right atrium <b>10</b>, the superior vena cava <b>12</b>, the inferior vena cava <b>13</b>, the ascending aorta <b>14</b>, the right atrial appendage <b>16</b>, the membranous septum <b>18</b>, the right atrial freewall <b>20</b>, the tricuspid valve <b>22</b>, the opening of the coronary sinus <b>24</b>, the valve of the coronary sinus <b>26</b>, and the fossa ovalis <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A left atrium <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. There are also seen therein the aortic valve <b>15</b>, the left atrial appendage <b>17</b>, the left superior pulmonary vein <b>19</b>, the mitral valve <b>21</b>, and the left ventricle <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A catheter <b>40</b> is shown generally being introduced into the atria of a heart through various cardiovascular introduction passageways as will be discussed hereinafter. The point of attachment of catheter <b>40</b> to the wall of an atrial appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> is indicated generally at <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, various ways of entering a heart chamber and positioning a catheter tip on the interior wall of the atrial appendages are illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a catheter <b>40</b> is shown being advanced through the jugular vein past the superior vena cava <b>12</b> and into the right atrium <b>10</b> where it is steered so the tip is positioned on the endocardial surface of the right atrial appendage <b>16</b> where attachment is made. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a procedure for introducing the catheter <b>40</b> through the femoral vein into the right atrium <b>10</b> and then into the right atrial appendage <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the inversion of the right atrial appendage <b>16</b> using the catheter <b>40</b> introduced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the positioning of a catheter distal tip at a point <b>42</b> on the endocardial surface of the left atrial appendage <b>17</b> utilizing a retrograde procedure. A sheath with a preformed configuration may be required to maneuver the catheter tip down through the aorta <b>14</b> and up through the mitral valve <b>21</b>. In addition, such a sheath would provide additional support for maneuvering the tip of the catheter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows positioning of a catheter tip at a point <b>42</b> on the endocardial surface of the left atrial appendage <b>17</b> utilizing a transeptal introduction. Transeptal introduction is achieved by inserting an introducer or sheath with an internal dilator through the femoral or jugular vein and into the interior of the right atrium. Once in the right atrium, a long hollow needle with a preformed curve and a sharpened distal tip is introduced through the dilator and is forcibly inserted through the fossa ovalis <b>28</b>. A radiopaque contrast material is injected through the needle to ensure the needle is in the left atrium as opposed to being in the pericardial space, aorta, or other undesired location. Once the position of the needle in the left atrium is confirmed, the dilator and sheath are advanced over the needle and into the left atrium. Then, the needle and dilator are removed leaving the sheath as an access point to the left atrium. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the inversion of the left atrial appendage <b>17</b> after catheter <b>40</b> has been attached at point <b>42</b> and by using a transeptal approach as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Methods &amp; Devices for Repositioning Appendage Walls</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>, there is seen one type of catheter <b>50</b> provided for attachment of the distal tip thereof to the wall of an atrial appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>. The catheter <b>50</b> includes a catheter body <b>52</b> having a distal tip portion <b>54</b>. In this embodiment a hollow coil <b>58</b> is attached to the catheter distal tip <b>54</b> and has a lumen <b>55</b> extending from the proximal end of the coil at the distal tip attachment point to the catheter handle assembly (not shown), The coil <b>58</b> is rotated by torquing the catheter body <b>52</b>. The catheter body <b>52</b> may be provided with a steering mechanism <b>57</b>, for example, of the type shown in Lundquist and Thompson U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,088, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the distal tip portion <b>54</b> of the catheter <b>50</b> is provided with an opening <b>56</b> through which the helically coiled distal tip element <b>58</b> can be advanced by rotation. Upon rotation of an inner supporting member <b>59</b> relative to catheter body <b>52</b>, the distal helical tip portion <b>58</b> is rotated into the wall of atrial appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>. This opening <b>56</b> may constitute a single isolated hole which fits only the outer diameter of the helical coil assembly or a larger hole in the distal portion of the tip. An isolated hole provides support for the helical coil assembly during advancement and withdrawal as well as providing a blunt surface masking the sharp distal tip needle <b>58</b> during manipulation of the catheter through the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the helical coil may alternatively be permanently attached to the distal tip of the catheter thus requiring rotation of the catheter body <b>52</b> to screw the helical coil into or out of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The distal tip of the helical element <b>58</b> is sharpened so that it has the capability of impaling the tissue wall. The rotatable supporting member <b>59</b> constitutes separate torque assembly that can be rotated manually from a point outside the body to cause rotation of element <b>59</b> relative to the catheter body <b>52</b>. This rotatable supporting member may be made of braided composite assembly such as stainless steel braid with polyamide, or a slotted hollow tube with an outer layer of shrink tubing. Once the helical coil assembly <b>58</b> is screwed into the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, the appendage may be pulled into the inverted position by applying pulling forces to the catheter body <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Since the distal helical member <b>58</b> is preferably hollow and attached to a tube with an internal lumen passing from the distal tip to the handle assembly, radiopaque contrast material <b>60</b> may be injected to detect the location of the distal tip of catheter <b>50</b> using, for example, fluoroscopy. This is important so as to ensure that the distal end of the helical coil needle <b>58</b> is in the pericardial space and has not perforated the pericardium <b>53</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In addition, the helical coil assembly and/or the distal catheter tip may be radiopaque.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Alternatively, an echoluscient material may be injected to locate the distal tip using transthoracic, transesophageal, and/or intracardiac echocardiography. Also, transponders may be attached to the helical coil assembly for locating thereof by echocardiography.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The hollow lumen <b>55</b> in the distal helical member <b>58</b> can also be used for introduction of an adhesive or bonding material therethrough as will be further set forth hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>, there is seen an alternative type of grasping catheter <b>70</b> provided on a catheter body <b>52</b>. The catheter tip <b>74</b> includes a plurality of grasping prongs <b>72</b> which are movable from an expanded position to a retracted position as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref> for grasping the wall of the atrial appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, so that pulling forces can be applied for inversion thereof. Preferably, the pronged tips are enclosed in a tubular tip <b>74</b> which facilitates introduction of the catheter through the vasculature and into a heart chamber and subsequent withdrawal thereof once the procedure is completed. Prongs <b>72</b> are preferably mounted in a mounting block <b>76</b> in such a fashion that they are biased toward the expanded position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 13</figref>. This block <b>76</b> is connected to a handle assembly through a stylet <b>62</b>. As the stylet <b>62</b> is retracted at the handle, the block <b>76</b> is withdrawn into tubular tip <b>74</b>; the prongs are caused to contact the interior surface of the tip <b>74</b> and move toward each other, thus impaling the surface of the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The prongs are provided with sharp distal ends to readily penetrate tissue and with a wide section at the apex of the curvature to contact a larger amount of tissue thus forming a large surface with which to pull tissue. The appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> is then inverted by pulling the catheter body sufficiently to cause inversion. The prongs can subsequently be released by distal extension of the stylet <b>62</b> and the block <b>76</b> thereby allowing the prongs to expand again to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. After the prongs <b>72</b> are withdrawn from the wall of appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, they can be returned to the compact position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> so the catheter may be withdrawn from the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, prongs <b>73</b> are provided which in the expanded form extend radially outward. During introduction of this embodiment into the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>, the prongs <b>73</b> are collapsed into a low profile and once they have passed through the appendage wall <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> or inside the myocardium, the stylet <b>62</b> and thereby the block <b>76</b> is extended, allowing the prongs <b>73</b> to expand from the low profile necessary for insertion to a radiating outward profile which provides a surface with which to pull the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Yet another form of catheter attachment and pulling mechanism <b>80</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</figref>, <b>16</b>B and <b>17</b>. In accordance with this embodiment, a radially expandable flexible member <b>82</b> is positioned within a hollow needle <b>66</b> located inside the interior of the catheter body <b>52</b> and distal tip element <b>83</b>. Member <b>82</b> is attached to stylet <b>62</b> which extends from the distal tip <b>83</b> to the handle assembly. Flexible member <b>82</b> may be made from a memory elastic material such nickel titanium or stainless steel <b>17</b>/<b>7</b>. More than one flexible member <b>82</b> may be attached to a stylet <b>62</b>, if desired, to increase the surface provided for pulling on the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Externally operable control means, such as extendable/retractable proximal knobs, are provided for advancing the stylet <b>62</b> and hollow needle <b>66</b> independently of one another. Preferably, the distal end of the hollow needle <b>66</b> is extended through the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> and accesses the pericardial space. As previously described, a contrast material may be injected to confirm the location of the distal tip of hollow needle <b>66</b>. Then, the stylet <b>62</b> is advanced thereby expelling the flexible member <b>82</b> and allowing it to expand from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. The distal tip of the hollow needle <b>66</b> is provided with a sharpened point suitable for penetration of the appendage wall <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> when the flexible member <b>82</b> is in the retracted position. Then, after penetration of the wall <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>, the flexible member <b>82</b> expands into its predetermined shape and the catheter is thereby attached to the wall as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. In this position, a substantial pulling force can be applied to the atrial appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> to cause inversion of the same.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The hollow needle <b>66</b> may be retracted into its retracted or resting position in element <b>83</b> to minimize any damage the sharp distal needle tip may cause while pulling the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. In addition, the flexible member <b>82</b> may be coiled at its distal end to prevent perforation of the tissue especially that of the pericardium while manipulating the member <b>82</b> by means of stylet <b>62</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the member <b>82</b> can have a blunt end instead of a coiled tip. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref> &amp; <b>17</b>, the member <b>82</b> is attached to the stylet <b>62</b>. An alternative configuration of the flexible member <b>82</b> (fully expanded) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A number of additional shapes not shown in the FIGURES can function as member <b>82</b>. Any flexible self-expanding member or configuration which may be extended into a low profile to fit inside a hollow needle or a catheter body and when extended beyond the distal end of the constraining tube will expand, may be used to provide an attachment point to pull the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> into an inverted position.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">To retract the flexible member <b>82</b> from the attachment point <b>42</b>, the sharpened hollow needle <b>66</b> is reinserted into the tissue to the proximal surface of the tissue and the flexible member <b>82</b> is removed by pulling the stylet <b>62</b>. Thereafter, the hollow needle <b>66</b> and flexible member <b>82</b> are positioned in their retracted positions so the catheter may be safely removed from the vasculature. The handle <b>64</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref> can be used for this purpose. The rod <b>69</b> can be removed from the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</figref> and a stylet <b>62</b> and flexible member <b>82</b> substituted therefor.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Methods &amp; Devices for Affixing the Inverted Appendages</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B, there is shown a compound loop assembly <b>77</b> carried on the distal end of a catheter <b>52</b>. Loop assembly <b>77</b> may be used as a support structure for pulling therethrough of appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, assembly <b>77</b> is housed in an introducer sheath <b>74</b>A. An extendable/retractable support block <b>76</b>A is manipulated by extension and retraction of catheter body <b>52</b> relative to sheath <b>74</b>A. A central opening <b>75</b> in support block <b>76</b>A allows for introduction of a separate attachment catheter, for example, catheter <b>70</b> through the central lumen of catheter <b>52</b>. One or more supporting splines <b>78</b> are attached to block <b>76</b>A and support another loop <b>79</b> which is of a size adapted to encircle the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> when inverted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A AND 19B</figref>, catheter <b>70</b> is introduced separately from catheter <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">This compound loop assembly <b>77</b> provides a support structure to appropriately deform the atrial appendage into a necked pouch to facilitate subsequent attaching methods as described below. Any of the attaching catheters described above may be used in conjunction with the compound loop structure. The compound loop catheter <b>77</b> may contain multiple loops to enable pulling of the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> into multiple small inverted sections of tissue instead of one larger inverted section.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An alternative support structure, which may also be used itself to fix inverted appendage tissue in an altered position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref>. Here there is seen the use of a dual catheter system including a tying catheter <b>88</b> which inserts a lasso member <b>90</b> around a grasping catheter <b>70</b>, which is shown for purposes of illustration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22A</figref>, the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> is shown in the inverted position. Subsequently, the lasso member <b>90</b> is elevated around the inverted appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> and thereafter tied by pulling the free end of the lasso member <b>90</b> by means of a stylet <b>62</b>, which extends proximally into a handle assembly. Lasso member <b>90</b> is thus formed into a tightened configuration which holds and assists in moving the inverted appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> shows one embodiment of a lasso member <b>91</b> which has a ratcheting mechanism to permanently tighten when the member <b>91</b> is pulled by the operator. In this case teeth <b>92</b> are adapted to slide through a slot <b>93</b> in a direction which allows tightening of the lasso, but does not allow loosening thereof. After the lasso member <b>91</b> has been tightened to maintain the position of the inverted appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>, the lasso member <b>91</b> is cut, leaving the tightened lasso in place. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, the lasso <b>91</b> is compressed to fit within an introducer sheath <b>74</b> for introduction into the atrium. The lasso <b>91</b> is formed in a size sufficient to encircle the inverted atrial appendage. As seen, slot <b>93</b> is formed as a constriction between an anchoring member <b>94</b> and an opposed finger <b>98</b> which engages ratchet projections <b>92</b>. Finger member <b>98</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> allows the ratchet projections to slide in a downward direction, but prevents them from moving upwardly. A cutter <b>100</b> is provided to cut the lasso <b>91</b> loose from the catheter. Cutter <b>100</b> is actuated by pulling in a proximal direction on stylet <b>62</b>. The back of cutter <b>100</b> is contoured to slide over a projection <b>102</b> that causes the cutter to engage lasso <b>91</b> and force it against a backing member <b>103</b> so that the sharpened tip of cutter <b>100</b> will sever the lasso <b>91</b>. After lasso <b>91</b> has been severed, the anchor member <b>94</b> remains with the lasso and is disconnected from the catheter body <b>105</b> by rotation of the catheter body to disconnect a threaded connection as shown. A retaining ring <b>104</b> holds the cutter and backing member in place centrally within the catheter body <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An alternative embodiment for attaching the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> uses an inverting catheter described above and the tying catheter <b>88</b> with a lasso member <b>90</b> previously described via a thoracostomy. The probe system is inserted through an opening made in the intercostal space of the rib cage and advanced through the pericardium where it contacts the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. The inverting catheter is attached to the distal end of the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> with techniques previously described and is pulled so as to stretch the appendage structure <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> away from the main body of the atrium. Then, the lasso member <b>90</b> is wrapped over the stretched appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> as far toward the main atrial body as possible. The lasso member <b>90</b> or <b>91</b> is subsequently tightened using techniques described above to isolate as much of the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> as possible. Subsequently, the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> may be cut and permanently removed by advancing another probe with a cutting surface to cut the neck of the appendage pouch leaving the lasso member <b>90</b> or <b>91</b> holding the rest of the appendage in place. Additionally, the lasso member <b>90</b> or another cauterizing probe may be used to fuse the appendage walls <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> together as will be described below for additional support after cutting off the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A further modified affixing embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24B</figref>. In this embodiment, a helical coil catheter <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is used in conjunction with a lasso applying catheter <b>88</b> which applies a lasso member <b>90</b> around the inverted appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>. The hollow lumen of the helical distal end <b>58</b> of catheter <b>50</b> is used to infuse a chemical fixing agent such as a cyanoacrylate <b>89</b>, which after curing, affixes the inverted appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. While a cyanoacrylate is the preferred adhesive used in conjunction with this embodiment of the invention, other materials, for example other acrylate based adhesives such as polymethyl methacrylate or other biocompatible materials can be substituted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The catheter infusion lumen may have a Teflon™ polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or similar inert material surface inside to reduce the extent of adhesive curing in the lumen prior to injecting the adhesive into the desired region. Also, more than one lumen may be contained within the catheter body to connect the helical coil hollow distal section to the injection site at the handle. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, separate lumens <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> may be used to inject adhesive <b>89</b> and a contrast material to enable the injection of either contrast material or adhesive into the desired region without needing to displace the dead volume of another material from the lumen. Thus, one is able to quickly inject contrast at any point during the procedure to ensure the catheter has not moved while injecting the chemical adhesive. Also, an additional lumen may be required to inject simultaneously a catalyst and an adhesive to enhance the curing of the adhesive in the desired region. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> lumens <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> both discharge into a enlarged area <b>47</b> in distal tip member <b>54</b>A, which in the case of two part curable materials can be used to provide for mixing of the two components. The desired ratio of catalyst to adhesive for proper curing may be achieved by designing the ratio of the respective lumen diameters to match this ratio and controlling the respective infusion stylets to move simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The infusion lumens are preferably formed by extruding a PTFE tube and braiding a layer thereover of metal or polymeric plastic material. Thereafter and outer layer, preferably of a polyamide or polyester polymer is applied by dipping or extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">After the adhesive material has solidified, the lasso member <b>90</b> may be expanded free from the appendage walls <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> preferably by releasing backward pressure on the retracting stylet <b>62</b> thus allowing the lasso member to loosen. Alternatively, an extending handle assembly may be actuated to open the lasso member <b>90</b> thereby loosening it. For this application, lasso member <b>90</b> should not have a latching mechanism, as shown in a prior embodiment, <b>91</b>, so it may be readily released upon demand. After loosening the lasso member <b>90</b>, the catheters may be removed from the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a releasable lasso member <b>142</b> may be manufactured from electrical conductors such as platinum/iridium, gold, stainless steel, or other metallic coils or rings and may be attached through electrically conductive wires <b>141</b> traversing the catheter lumen <b>140</b> to a radiofrequency generator, such as the EPT-1000, which transmits current at 500 kHz to the lasso member <b>142</b> to resistively heat the appendage walls <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. This electrically isolates the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> to ensure no arhythmogenic fibrillation, tachycardia, and/or flutter originates from the trabeculated appendage. In addition, heating the appendage walls can thermally fuse the adjacent appendage walls together producing a bond to hold the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> in the inverted position. Alternatively, heating changes the structure of the tissue through desiccation to change the shape of the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> even if a thermal bond of adjacent walls is not achieved because the required bonding temperatures are not reached. These changes in structure will help maintain the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> in the altered position. Of course, temperature sensors placed in the lasso member <b>142</b> may be used to regulate the heating to controllably ablate the appendage walls and/or thermally fuse adjacent walls together. Devices usable for this purpose are shown in greater in commonly owned copending application Ser. No. 08/439,824 filed May 12, 1995, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The composite loop structure <b>78</b> previously described may also be formed of an electrically conductive material and used to thermally heat and/or fuse the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another method for affixing the appendage walls in an inverted or alternative position involves to insertion of an attachment member into or over the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. This technique may be implemented when attaching the appendage in an inverted position or pulling adjacent appendage walls together to produce a sack with the appendage pouch separated from the atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> illustrates a mesh <b>95</b> constructed from a memory elastic material with temperature responsive transitional properties and/or superelastic properties, for example nickel titanium. Alternatively, a plastic material with elastic properties or stainless steel <b>17</b>/<b>7</b> may be utilized. The mesh <b>95</b> may be expanded over the inverted appendage with the catheter <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27B and 27C</figref>. Alternatively, the mesh <b>95</b> may be introduced into the pericardial space with a catheter of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>. In this case, a sharpened hollow needle <b>66</b> is introduced through the appendage wall <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> into the pericardial space. Then, a separately actuated stylet <b>62</b> is manually or automatically extended to insert the mesh attachment member <b>95</b> through the end of the hollow needle where it expands to its resting shape at body temperature to maintain the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> in said shape.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-C</figref> more particularly, there is seen an attaching catheter <b>50</b> which is sized to fit within an inner lumen <b>128</b> located in mesh introducing catheter. The attaching catheter <b>50</b> and the mesh introducing catheter <b>130</b> may be simultaneously introduced into the atrium. Alternatively, the attaching catheter <b>50</b> can be introduced into the atrium and attached to an appendage wall <b>16</b>-<b>17</b>. The introducer catheter <b>130</b> can then be guided over the appendage attaching catheter <b>50</b>. The mesh <b>95</b> is seen in its resting configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Mesh <b>95</b> is supported within an introducer sheath <b>132</b> and on a base plate or cylinder <b>134</b> which is provided with an annular opening <b>136</b> to allow catheter <b>50</b> to fit therethrough. Preferably, a retaining ring <b>138</b> is provided to hold the wires <b>140</b> which may be, for example, in the form of a suture or wire.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In use, catheter <b>130</b> is introduced over catheter <b>50</b> in the appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. The introducer sheath <b>132</b> and the retaining ring <b>138</b> and thus the pull wires <b>140</b> are retracted proximally forcing the distal end of the mesh to expand radially. The expanding mesh <b>95</b> is then advanced over the inverted appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. Subsequently, the wires <b>140</b> are released from retaining ring <b>138</b> allowing the mesh <b>95</b> to close over the atrial appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>. The wires <b>140</b> are then retracted into sheath <b>132</b> and the assembly is then removed from the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Two alternative handle designs for the various catheters referred to above are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>.

Ultimately, the appendage walls <b>16</b>/<b>17</b> will be pulled together by the suture material <b>126</b> in the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>. To separate the pouch from the atrium, a filler material such as silicone or collagen may be inserted into the appendage pouch to fill the pouch and minimize or eliminate blood flow into or out of the pouch. Also, a memory elastic mesh <b>95</b> may be inserted into the pouch or over the sack entrance for additional support and to prevent thrombus movement from the pouch into the atrium. Also, in this embodiment, the blood inside the pouch will clot, forming a naturally occurring support structure for the separated appendage <b>16</b>/<b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When the form of expandable anchors <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> are used, suture material <b>126</b> may be continuously fed through a central lumen <b>124</b> of pushing stylet <b>124</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>, there is seen a procedure for reducing the volume of an appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> by means of a thoracostomy. In this case, the pericardium is penetrated by means of an incision passing through the rib cage. The incision is entered by a grasping catheter, for example catheter <b>70</b> as already described hereinabove. Thereafter, a lasso <b>90</b> or <b>91</b> can be utilized to tie off the neck of the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> utilizing a catheter <b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The appendage can also be fixed in a repositioned location with reduced volume by sutures, staples, memory wire, biocompatible adhesives, or by tissue ablation as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, catheter <b>170</b> includes a flexible catheter body <b>172</b> having a distal tip portion <b>174</b>. A lumen or tubular guide <b>176</b> is provided for allowing the lasso <b>90</b> to be freely axially movable so that the lasso <b>90</b> can be expanded or contracted. Also as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the lasso <b>90</b> may have an enlarged end <b>8</b> for the purpose of anchoring the same in catheter distal tip <b>174</b> as shown. Utilizing this arrangement, the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b> can be permanently fixed in the altered position utilizing staples, sutures, chemical bonding agents or by means of ablation. Alternatively, also a locking or ratcheting loop <b>91</b> of the type described above can be permanently put in place to tie off the neck of the appendage <b>16</b> or <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">It should be appreciated that the repositioning and affixing methods and devices described above may apply to aneurysms, or any other body cavities that naturally or pathologically exist.</p>
