<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication system for a vehicle traveling over a road surface is provided with at least one detector for sensing speed detection signals impinging on the vehicle, to monitor the speed of the vehicle or a nearby vehicle. A radiofrequency transmitter communicates the detector output to a receiver adjacent the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The receiver controls one or more annunciators to output one or more annunciator indications to the system user. The radiofrequency transmitter in one embodiment directs transmissions along a ground skip path, reflecting information over the road surface so as to enter the receiver located in or near a passenger compartment of the vehicle. A wireless control unit provides indication of system operating status and allows a user to input commands to the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to communication systems for use with moving vehicles and in particular to moving vehicles undergoing speed detection utilizing an external probing signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With increasing miniaturization of electronics, vehicles are being provided with an ever widening array of information systems. Mapping and position detecting systems, for example, provide the motorist with important data which must be continuously updated. Detection systems have long been popular with motorists to provide an electronic early-warning of nearby speed detection units. Such systems provide either proximity sensing for surrounding speed detection activity or detection of probing signals directed to the motorist's vehicle. Today, speed detection systems monitor traffic from both radar emitting and laser emitting probing systems of the type used by various law-enforcement agencies to sense and gauge the speed of passing motor vehicles. Traditionally, the range of the typical radar-sensing device exceeds that of most probing devices, thus providing an early warning to motorists of the presence of probing activities. Typically, the warning is early enough to provide a motorist ample time to monitor and adjust vehicle speed, if necessary, before entering the effective operating range of a probing site.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In typical speed detection systems, an antenna and receiver is mounted at the front most portion of the vehicle, the location most likely targeted by probing signals. Electronic processing of the signals is required before being presented to the motorist at a location within the passenger compartment adjacent the driver's position. Electronic circuitry for processing the received signals and providing the motorist with an indication of various aspects of speed detecting activity can be located at the front end of the vehicle, in the engine compartment or in the passenger compartment. It has been necessary to run wiring from the antenna/receiver to the various components and ultimately to a destination adjacent the driver's position. Routing of wiring is costly, especially so if great care is taken to avoid cluttering the appearance of the motor vehicle. Appearance problems are aggravated in ever increasing ways by the growing number of aftermarket onboard vehicular electronic systems being offered today. As wiring is secreted deeper and deeper within the vehicle so as to remain out of sight, there is a possibility that pinch points and other types of wiring-degrading situations will be encountered, compromising the functional integrity of the installed system. Accordingly, labor and other installation costs for speed detection and other onboard systems which must communicate throughout the length of the vehicle is becoming increasingly costly, even to the point of approaching or perhaps exceeding the cost of the system electronics and hardware.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide communication systems which extend throughout substantial portions of a vehicle's length. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide communication systems which extend from the front end of the vehicle, through the engine compartment and firewall to the passenger compartment, to a location in or under the dash adjacent the driver's seat.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, it has been found important in providing improved detection of speed sensing activity, that antennas and signal receivers be located at both the front end and rear end of the vehicle. Accordingly, communication signals for the systems must travel throughout the length of the vehicle, being presented to the motorist adjacent the driver's seat. While the placement of special wiring to the rear end of a front engine vehicle may be somewhat less complicated than wiring extended through the engine compartment, great care must still be taken if unsightly alteration of the vehicle is to be avoided. Accordingly, another object of the present invention is to provide communications systems extending from either the front or the rear end of the vehicle without requiring dedicated additional wiring. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide wireless communications systems or to adapt existing wiring runs extending from the front end and/or rear end of the vehicle to a position adjacent the driver's seat.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of a communication system is provided for a vehicle traveling over a road surface and having a front end, a forward compartment, a passenger compartment, a wall dividing the forward compartment and the passenger compartment, and a rear end. A detector is provided at the front end for sensing speed detection signals impinging on said vehicle, to monitor the speed of said vehicle or a nearby vehicle and to generate an output signal in response thereto. A radio frequency transmitter is provided adjacent the front end for receiving said detector output signal and for transmitting a transmit signal indicative of said speed detection signals in response thereto directed toward said road surface so as to be deflected toward the passenger compartment. A receiver is provided adjacent said wall, either in said front compartment or in said passenger compartment, for receiving said transmit signal from the road surface and for outputting an annunciator signal in response thereto. An annunciator is provided in the passenger compartment, coupled to said receiver to receive said annunciator signal and for outputting an annunciator indication in response thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, a communication system is provided for a vehicle traveling over a road surface and having a front end, a forward compartment, a passenger compartment, a wall dividing the forward compartment and the passenger compartment, and a rear end. A detector is provided at the front end for sensing speed detection signals impinging on said vehicle, to monitor the speed of said vehicle or a nearby vehicle and to generate an output signal in response thereto. A radio frequency transmitter is provided adjacent the front end for receiving said detector output signal and for transmitting a transmit signal indicative of said speed detection signals in response thereto. A receiver is provided adjacent said wall, either in said front compartment or in said passenger compartment, for receiving said transmit signal and for outputting an annunciator signal in response thereto. An annunciator is provided in said passenger compartment, coupled to said receiver to receive said annunciator signal and for outputting an annunciator indication in response thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, a communication system is provided for a vehicle traveling over a road surface and having a front end, a forward compartment, a passenger compartment, a wall dividing the forward compartment and the passenger compartment, a rear end and wiring from the front and rear ends to the passenger compartment carrying signals unrelated to monitoring of the speed of the vehicle. A detector is provided at the front end for sensing speed detection signals impinging on said vehicle, to monitor the speed of said vehicle or a nearby vehicle and to generate an output signal in response thereto. A radio frequency injector is provided adjacent the front end for receiving said detector output signal and for injecting a transmit signal indicative of said speed detection signals in response thereto on said wiring for delivery to said passenger compartment. A receiver is operatively associated with said wiring for receiving said transmit signal and for outputting an annunciator signal in response thereto. An annunciator is provided in said passenger compartment, coupled to said receiver to receive said annunciator signal and for outputting an annunciator indication in response thereto.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As will be seen herein, the present invention is concerned with providing an early warning to a motorist of various surveillance and probing signals directed to the user's vehicle. While such detection systems can be quite simple, the more desirable systems sense a variety of different types of probing signals coming from different directions. The present invention is particularly directed to warning systems which are built into the vehicle in a manner so as to be inconspicious as possible. The present invention is concerned with eliminating additional wiring as may be required for a detecting system. As will be seen herein, the present invention contemplates wireless communication to throughout the vehicle and alternatively, adapting existing wiring not intended for use with detecting systems, which is nonetheless provided by the vehicle manufacturer. Accordingly, the communications systems according to principles of the present invention can be embodied in a variety of forms.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to the drawings and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a motor vehicle <b>10</b> has a front end <b>12</b> and a rear end <b>14</b>. As is customary, the vehicle <b>10</b> is provided with bumpers at the front end and rear end and a license plate frame assembly <b>16</b> mounted to the front bumper is visible in the figures. Law enforcement officers and other people engaged in surveillance activities are typically taught to target the license plate when probing the vehicle. In the preferred embodiment, the license plate assembly <b>16</b> includes a laser detector and defuser module commercially available from the assignee of the present invention. In the preferred embodiment, a detector <b>18</b> for radar radiation is also provided and is located in a forward part of the vehicle, usually separate from the laser detector <b>16</b>. An additional detector is optionally installed at the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the radar detector <b>18</b> comprises a portion of a remote unit generally indicated at <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the front face <b>21</b> of the radar detector <b>18</b> contains a radar receiving antenna, not visible in the figure. At the opposed end of remote unit <b>20</b> an interface or communication block <b>22</b> transmits radar detection signals to a control unit in or near the passenger compartment or cockpit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, (which does not show block <b>22</b>) a connector <b>24</b> provides local power to the radar detector <b>18</b>. One feature of the present invention is that the communication block <b>22</b> is retrofitted to existing radar detector units <b>18</b>, without requiring modification to the radar detector unit.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As mentioned, the license plate assembly <b>16</b> is typically chosen as a target for laser probing of the vehicle. The license plate is also typically chosen as a target point for radar probing signals although the radiation beam of the radar probing signals is typically much wider than that for laser probing signals. Also, the radar signals directed to adjacent vehicles and reflections from nearby objects may be sensed by the radar detector in vehicle <b>10</b>, thus providing useful information to the driver, in addition to radar probing signals directed specifically at vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, laser probing signals typically have a much smaller beam limited generally to the area of the license plate <b>32</b>. Frame work <b>34</b> surrounding the license plate contains active circuitry that responds to laser radiation and which emits a laser detecting signal carried on cable <b>26</b>, which is received on remote unit <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, laser and radar detection signals are wirelessly transmitted to a receiver or control unit <b>36</b> located either outside the firewall <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or behind firewall <b>38</b> within the passenger compartment <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, laser and radar detection signals are impressed on existing power wiring <b>42</b> such as that installed by the vehicle manufacturer, and which is not intended for use with a detection system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>6</b>, the laser and radar detection signals are passed through a forward compartment <b>44</b> of vehicle <b>10</b>, located in front of passenger compartment <b>40</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, vehicle <b>10</b> also includes a rear compartment <b>46</b> and a second remote unit <b>20</b> passes detector signals through rear compartment <b>46</b> to control module <b>36</b> located in the passenger compartment. The rear remote unit <b>20</b> is usually limited to reception of radar signals only. Thus, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, vehicle <b>10</b> is said to be provided with forward and rearward looking radar detection capability. The communication system according to principles of the present invention conducts detecting signals from various sources over various paths to the receiver or control unit <b>36</b> which advises the driver of surveillance and probing activity, preferably via one or more annunciators. It should be noted that communication systems according to principles of the present invention work equally well for front engine, mid engine and rear engine vehicles. For purposes of explanation herein, it will be assumed that vehicle <b>10</b> is a front engine vehicle and that front compartment <b>44</b> contains the usual engine components, while compartment <b>46</b> at the rear of the vehicle comprises a conventional trunk space.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, remote unit <b>20</b> includes communication block <b>22</b>. Other relative orientations of the radar receiving antenna and radio frequency transmitting antenna are possible. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the radio frequency transmitting antenna is transmitted in a sideways direction to bounce off of nearby objects so as to enter the passenger compartment <b>40</b> from the side. If desired, a radio receiver <b>54</b> can be located at the side of the vehicle for connection to control unit <b>36</b> with a relatively short wiring run <b>56</b>. Preferably though, the wireless communication path provided by the communication system accordingly to principles of the present invention traverses generally longitudinal paths from the front and rear of the vehicle to the passenger compartment or a firewall located adjacent a front or rear compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the wireless communication paths are shown in the engine compartment <b>44</b>. As indicated, the communications paths of the radio frequency signals emitted from the remote unit <b>20</b> are reflected within the engine compartment, eventually passing to the control unit <b>36</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one signal path <b>58</b> is reflected from the ground so as to be received at control unit <b>36</b>. This ground skip path comprises one of the paths of radiation emitted from remote unit <b>20</b> (and subsequently detected in a receiver). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is assumed that no ground skip signal is present and that radiation of the wireless signal from remote unit <b>20</b> to control unit <b>36</b> is contained within vehicle <b>10</b>. In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, additional signals otherwise provided by ground skip paths are unavailable for improved detection capability by wireless receivers located in control unit <b>36</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, control unit <b>36</b> is located within the forward compartment <b>44</b> and is attached to firewall <b>38</b> or another convenient mounting site. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, control unit <b>36</b> which receives the wireless signals is located behind firewall <b>38</b>, and passenger compartment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the firewalls of conventional vehicles are perforated with passageways for equipment and wiring and radio frequency signals can conveniently travel through these firewall openings (in addition to the ground skip paths, previously mentioned). If signal attenuation at the control unit <b>36</b> is excessive, the control unit can be mounted in the forward compartment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and relatively short wiring can pass through the firewall to visual and audible annunciators located within the passenger compartment. In the preferred embodiment, the radio frequency link between remote unit <b>20</b> and control unit <b>36</b> operates on a frequency approved for use by the Federal Communications Commission. Preferably, the radio link uses a 2.4 GHz carrier frequency although other carrier frequencies such as possible future frequencies in the unlicensed spectrum in the 450 MHz and 900 MHz bands could be used as well. In the present invention, a cost effective conventional interface is employed to ensure orderly and reliable transmission of data bits between remote units <b>20</b> and control unit <b>36</b>. It is generally preferred that the Bluetooth radio interface standard is employed, to accommodate optional features such as the wireless control unit to be described herein, and to take advantage of future integration opportunities with other motor vehicle devices. The invention contemplates other popular interfaces such as Wi-Fi, CDMA, TDMA, TDD, FDD and analog, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One problem to be dealt with in a practical wireless link is a situation where two radio frequency signals or vectors arrive at the control unit at the same time. For example, one vector could bounce over the ground surface while another vector could bounce from surfaces of the vehicle. The Bluetooth interface standard preferred in the present embodiment has provision for distinguishing one simultaneous vector from another using a predetermined timing assignment. Once a vector is received with sufficient strength to be reliably demodulated, other vectors with the same time stamp are ignored. The ability to have additional vectors traveling along ground skip paths provides a substantial advantage in system operation and reliability. Also, wireless reception in the control unit <b>36</b> can be processed such that an incoming signal is considered to be reliable only when multiple vectors carrying that signal are considered to be reliable. In this latter instance, the ability to receive the additional vectors traveling over ground skip paths can provide a substantial operating advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Depending upon the path preferences within vehicle <b>10</b>, the antenna for transmitting radio frequency information from remote unit <b>20</b> can be tailored to prefer one communication path over another to avoid unusually strong attenuation circumstances which may arise due to vehicle construction. With the present invention, different communication blocks can be provided with the radar detector module at the time of installation, to customize the communication system for a particular vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Before proceeding to a more detailed explanation of the wireless embodiments of communications according to principles of the present invention, attention will be directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where existing vehicle wiring is adapted to provide a communication system for detection devices. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a remote unit <b>20</b> is connected to internal wiring <b>42</b> of the vehicle provided by the vehicle manufacturer, for delivering direct current power, for example. Radio frequency detection signals from the remote unit(s) <b>20</b> are impressed on the wiring which typically carries a direct current power signal. The radio frequency data is virtually identical to the radio frequency data in a wireless embodiment. Conventional equipment such as that provided by Cambridge Silicon Radio, Zeero or TI can be employed for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the remote unit <b>20</b> will be described in greater detail. Component <b>60</b> contains the radio interface protocols. The choice of protocols is independent and Bluetooth is selected for illustration because of its cable replacement use. The electronics component <b>60</b> obtains the electrical power necessary to operate by using power circuit <b>62</b> of conventional construction. The power circuit <b>62</b> is connected to a DC voltage source of 12 volt potential, capable of delivering a minimum current of 100 milliamperes. The connection is made through an external wire cable <b>65</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> which enters the internal components through communication block <b>22</b>. A controller is used to collect the output of the radar module <b>18</b> as indicated at <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The controller <b>66</b> preferably comprises a micro controller, catalog number PIC16F627-04I/SS, available from Microchip Technology located at Chandler, Ariz. Other types of controllers or microprocessors could be employed, as desired. The controller is chosen so as to accommodate the inputs <b>66</b> of the radar module and inputs <b>68</b> of the laser module. The radar and optionally laser detector signals are analyzed and sent along using one of the radio interfaces and vector paths between remote unit <b>20</b> and control unit <b>36</b> as indicated in the Figures. The software necessary to run the communication system of remote unit <b>20</b> is loaded through an interface using SPI techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The control unit <b>36</b> uses the circuit depicted in block form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (shown divided between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>for clarity). The radar detector data transmitted from remote unit <b>20</b> is received at host module <b>76</b>, via antenna <b>77</b>. The antenna <b>77</b> is internal to the body of the control unit and preferably comprises a surface mount component on the printed circuit board of the wireless control unit <b>36</b> so as to maintain a clean profile and to allow installation in the largest population of different vehicle configurations. Information received at host module <b>76</b> is passed along to a main control unit <b>78</b>, a micro controller, catalog number PIC16LF873A-I/SS from Microchip. The main control unit <b>78</b> processes received information and alerts the driver of the vehicle <b>10</b> by activating an appropriate light emitting diode <b>80</b> or <b>82</b>. In addition, a voice alert code is sent to an optional voice recognition unit <b>86</b>. The voice recognition unit <b>86</b>, when employed, preferably comprises a conventional voice recognition integrated circuit commercially available as part number RSC-4128 commercially available from the Sensory Company located at Santa Clara, Calif. The voice recognition unit <b>86</b> uses the code given by main control unit <b>78</b> to access a preprogrammed sound file and external EEProm <b>90</b> so as to play the appropriate message at speaker <b>92</b>. In the preferred embodiment, commands are given to the control system <b>36</b> by the driver, using vocal directives. Other input techniques known in the art, can also be used. In an optional control unit voice recognition capabilities are provided by voice recognition unit <b>86</b>, using microphone <b>94</b>. The voice commands delivered to the voice recognition unit <b>86</b> by the microphone are processed and matched according to values stored in the external memory unit <b>90</b>. If desired, the voice recognition unit can be omitted, for example, in favor of a wireless remote control unit <b>130</b> to be described later, herein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More detailed electronic schematic diagrams for the remote and control units are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<b>11</b><i>d</i>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>and <b>13</b>. For example, module <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> which delivers data to transmitting antenna <b>61</b> is indicated in the electrical schematic diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c </i>as module U<b>7</b> which preferably comprises a Bluetooth radio module, catalog number BC219159DN-E4 available from CSR located in Cambridge, UK. The PIC controller <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c </i>is commercially available as part no. PIC 16F627-041/SS from Microchip Technology of Chandler, Ariz. Data outputted from unit U<b>7</b> is transmitted via RF link <b>102</b> from controller <b>66</b>. Output signals are sent by control unit <b>66</b> in response to radar data signals on line <b>104</b> and laser data signals on line <b>106</b> coupled to the radar detector module <b>18</b> and laser detector module <b>16</b> respectively of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>c</i>, a connector <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>) is provided for Bluetooth programming, using the interface circuit <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> which couples connector <b>110</b> to a connector <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>c. </i></p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, a wireless control unit <b>130</b> is provided to allow a user to wirelessly communicate with the warning system, without requiring extensive modification to the interior of the user's vehicle. As will be seen herein, the wireless control unit <b>130</b> allows a user to input commands to the warning system and to receive status indications of various portions of the system. Preferably, the wireless control unit <b>130</b> is Bluetooth enabled, operating as a remote module communicating with the aforementioned Bluetooth system which includes, for example, the Bluetooth host module <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, wireless control unit <b>130</b> includes a housing <b>140</b>, enclosed at one end by a battery door <b>142</b>. Disposed within housing <b>140</b> are a plurality of battery contacts <b>146</b> and a pair of batteries <b>148</b>. Electrical leads <b>150</b> connect the batteries to a main printed circuit board <b>154</b> which is coupled to a lower, radio frequency (RF) printed circuit board <b>158</b> by connectors <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>g</i>). A graphic overlay member <b>166</b> includes a plurality of dome switches <b>168</b>. The dome switches make electrical contact with contacts <b>170</b> carried on main printed circuit board <b>154</b>, in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33</figref><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>i</i>, an electrical schematic diagram for circuitry carried on printed circuit boards <b>154</b>, <b>158</b>, is shown. A microprocessor <b>176</b> is carried on the lower, RF printed circuit board <b>154</b> and has connections coupled to connector <b>160</b>. Microprocessor <b>176</b> is commercially available as part no. BC219159BN-E4, from CSR located in Cambridge, UK. Microprocessor <b>176</b> is connected to an antenna <b>180</b> for radio frequency communication with the Bluetooth host module <b>76</b> described above. Asynchronous communication with a microprocessor <b>184</b> carried on main printed circuit board <b>154</b> is made by leads <b>182</b> which connect terminals J<b>10</b>, J<b>11</b> of microprocessor <b>176</b> to terminals <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> of microprocessor <b>184</b> via connectors <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. Microprocessor <b>184</b> is commercially available as part no. PIC16LF627A-041/SS, from Microchip Technology of Chandler, Ariz. Also associated with microprocessor <b>176</b> is a crystal-controlled clock circuit <b>188</b> and a connector <b>190</b> to provide external control programming for the Bluetooth functions of microprocessor <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A Bluetooth enabler circuit <b>194</b> is coupled to terminal <b>7</b> of microprocessor <b>184</b> to enable its Bluetooth operations. Included in circuit <b>194</b> is a microprocessor, part no. MAX4795EUK. In effect, circuit <b>194</b> functions as an external electronic switch that provides power to the Bluetooth circuit carried on the lower, RF printed circuit board <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>d</i>, the main printed circuit board <b>154</b> is provided with three membrane switches, including a filter switch <b>200</b>, a volume switch <b>202</b> and a mode switch <b>204</b>. These switches are connected to terminals <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> of microprocessor <b>184</b> and provide input control signals. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>i</i>, the main printed circuit board is also provided with a plurality of indicator lights arranged in a bank or array <b>206</b>. The indicator lights preferably comprise light emitting diodes, although virtually any type of indicator can be used whether visual, audible or vibratory. LED <b>210</b>, when illuminated, indicates high volume operation of the detection system, while LED's <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> indicate a low volume and a volume off operation of the detector system. Indicator light <b>216</b> indicates that power to the detector system has been turned off, confirming to the user that the detector system is not emitting signals which might possibly be detected by outside observers. Indicator lights <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> indicate familiar “city” and “highway” operation (i.e. low gain and high gain operation, respectively) of the detector system. Indicator lights <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, are provided for optional functions such as voice control and audible “tones” outputs of the detector system.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The detector system of the preferred embodiment uses a wireless control link between wireless control unit <b>130</b> and Bluetooth host module <b>76</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the wireless protocol is chosen to be a Bluetooth protocol although virtually any wireless protocol can be employed, as desired. The wireless control unit <b>130</b> is expected to be operated from within the vehicle passenger compartment to provide control over the detector system and to provide an indication of system status to the user. If desired, the wireless link can be replaced with a wired connection. Programming of microprocessor <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>) and microprocessor <b>176</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>f</i>) preferably includes an algorithm which provides current state recall, defined herein as the current operational mode of the overall detector system. According to one aspect of the present invention, the detector system employs current state recall which not only allows the wireless control unit <b>130</b> to consume very small amounts of power and to have an ultra small size, but which also requires a minimum amount of electronics to implement the overall system. For example, the current state recall operation of the detector system, in the preferred embodiment, requires only two micro controllers (microprocessor <b>184</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>h </i>and microprocessor <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>c</i>) and two Bluetooth transceivers (microprocessor <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a </i>and microprocessor <b>176</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>f</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref><i>d</i>, upon the pressing any of the switches <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> the respective terminals of microprocessor <b>184</b> connected to the switches detects a voltage rise. In response, code associated with microprocessor <b>184</b> closes a circuit or switch internal to the microprocessor that outputs a command signal on terminal <b>7</b> which in turn is delivered to terminal <b>3</b> of the microprocessor of Bluetooth enabler circuit <b>194</b>. The Bluetooth enabler circuit <b>194</b> responds by applying power to the Bluetooth circuit associated with microprocessor <b>176</b>, enabling the microprocessor of the wireless control unit <b>130</b> to receive a status signal from host module <b>76</b>, via the wireless Bluetooth link. The microprocessor <b>184</b> processes the incoming status signal and determines which of the appropriate indicator lights <b>210</b>-<b>224</b> should be illuminated to indicate visual status of system operation to the user. For example, concerning the current volume mode of the detector system, only one of the indicator lights <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> should be illuminated at any one time to indicate only one of the three possible volume operating modes (i.e. volume high, volume low, or volume off). If the incoming status signal received from host module <b>76</b> by wireless control unit <b>130</b> indicates that system volume is turned off, microprocessor <b>184</b> would issue a signal to indicator light <b>214</b> to illuminate that indicator light. Similarly, only one of the indicator lights <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> is expected to be illuminated at a particular time so as indicate to the user that the system is operating in city (low gain) mode or highway (high gain) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> a sequence diagram indicating operation of the overall detector system is shown. In step <b>240</b>, a key press or “any—key—down” is sensed by microprocessor <b>184</b>. In response, the microprocessor sends a power up signal to the Bluetooth circuitry associated with microprocessor <b>176</b>. As mentioned, a “Bluetooth enable” signal is sent to external solid-state switch circuit <b>194</b>, through which power is applied to the Bluetooth portion of microprocessor <b>176</b>. In step <b>246</b> the last state of the overall system is sent to the array of indicator lights. Upon powering up, the Bluetooth circuitry attempts to connect to the host module <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Upon a successful connection, the host Bluetooth module <b>76</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>) syncs the RF link with the wireless remote <b>130</b> and confirms the connection using the standard Bluetooth connection protocols outlined in the Bluetooth standard, as indicated in step <b>248</b>. At this time, the host module <b>76</b> sends a status signal to the Bluetooth module <b>176</b>, using system status information stored in the host module memory. The Bluetooth module of the wireless control unit <b>130</b> then communicates to the microprocessor <b>184</b> that an RF link has been established between the wireless control unit <b>130</b> and host module <b>76</b>, (as indicated in step <b>250</b>) and passes the status signal information to microprocessor <b>184</b>, updating or confirming the present system status to the wireless control unit <b>130</b>. If desired, the indicator lights of the wireless control unit can be cleared upon an initial key press, with reception of the status signal from the host module determining the state of the indicator lights, rather than serving as a data update. At this point, a timed interval is initiated. In the preferred embodiment, the time interval has a 5-second duration, although virtually any duration can be employed. During the time interval each key press of the wireless control unit <b>130</b> is passed to the host module <b>76</b> as indicated at <b>254</b>. Only key presses made during the timed interval, i.e. while the Bluetooth connection is active, are passed to the host module <b>76</b>. If there is no key press activity during the time interval, the timer of the wireless control unit <b>130</b> expires, and microprocessor <b>184</b> triggers Bluetooth enable circuit <b>194</b> to open, thus breaking the Bluetooth connection with the host module <b>76</b>. The microprocessor <b>184</b> then returns to a sleep mode drawing only a minimal amount of current from the small power system, preferably the batteries <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> if Bluetooth connection between host <b>76</b> and wireless control unit <b>130</b> is not established within 5 seconds, the wireless control unit <b>130</b> sends a command to Bluetooth enable circuit <b>194</b> to open a Bluetooth transmission link and to enter a sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As mentioned, the preferred embodiment employs Bluetooth protocols between the wireless control unit <b>130</b> and the host module <b>76</b>, to allow the host module to communicate with the wireless control unit as if it were another remote sensor of the system. Although less preferable, other, mixed protocols can be employed, if desired, with different protocols used for the remote sensors and for the wireless remote unit <b>130</b>.</p>
