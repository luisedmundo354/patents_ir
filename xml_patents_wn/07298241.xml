<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority under 35 USC 119 based on Japanese patent application No. 2003-355490, filed Oct. 15, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to vehicles, and to remote control devices therefor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a remote control apparatus for a saddle-type, scooter type vehicle which includes a handlebar lock module having a knob which enables at least a starting operation of an engine. The knob is disposed on a leg shield which covers the front of the legs of a rider seated on a riding seat. The remote control apparatus may also include a handlebar lock cancellation operation, in response to reception of an ID signal from a normal portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of remote control devices for saddle-type, scooter type vehicles are known. One example of a known remote control apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-278154. However, conventional remote control apparatus do not provide a mechanism for access to operation of the vehicle, when the remote control is not functioning or is unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a conventional remote control apparatus, as found in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-278154, the knob of the handlebar lock module is enabled for operation in response to reception of an ID signal from the normal portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user. In order to cope with situations in which the vehicle user loses the portable transmitter or the transmission is disabled due to an inadequate charge of the power cell of the portable transmitter, for example, there exists a need for a remote control apparatus configured to allow an emergency lock cancellation operation by a mechanical key for emergency unlocking. Also, a need exists for a keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder to be disposed at an inconspicuous place, so as to reduce the risk that the keyhole could be tampered with.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle which allows a user to operate the scooter type vehicle using an emergency unlocking mechanical key, even if a portable transmitter is not available, while configuring the key access to minimize risk of tampering therewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to attain the object described above, according to a first aspect of the invention, a remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle includes a handlebar lock module having a knob which enables at least a starting operation of an engine. The remote control apparatus also includes a handlebar lock cancellation operation in response to reception of an ID signal from a conventional portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user. The knob is disposed on a leg shield which is provided to cover the front of the legs of a rider seated on a riding seat. An article accommodation section is provided on the leg shield on one of the left and right sides of the handlebar lock module such that an accommodation recess formed on the leg shield is covered for opening and closing movement by a lid member hinged to the leg shield. An emergency unlocking key cylinder lock for enabling at least starting of the engine and for handlebar lock cancellation without the necessity for the portable transmitter is disposed in the leg shield such that a keyhole thereof faces an inner side face of the accommodation recess.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second aspect of the invention, the remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle is characterized in that, in addition to the configuration of the invention as set forth in the first aspect, the riding seat is formed as a tandem type riding seat. The riding seat includes a front seat mounted for opening and closing movement so as to open an accommodation box disposed below the riding seat, and a rear seat disposed behind the front seat. A link mechanism, provided beneath the riding seat and connected to a seat catcher for changing over the front seat between a catching state wherein the seat catcher catches the front seat in the closed position and a seat catch releasing state wherein the seat catcher permits the opening and closing operation of the front seat, is connected to a seat lock actuator which operates in response to a signal from the conventional portable transmitter. The link mechanism is further connected to the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the invention as set forth above, even if the vehicle user loses the portable transmitter, or the power cell of the portable transmitter has inadequate charge, the scooter type vehicle can still be driven, if the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is operated by the emergency unlocking mechanical key. In addition, since the keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is disposed such that it faces the inner side face of the accommodating recess, which is disposed at an inconspicuous place and is normally closed by the lid member, the likelihood of mischief occuring to keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, with the invention as set forth above, since the link mechanism for operating the seat catcher is used both for the first case wherein the portable transmitter is effective and for the second case wherein the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is used, the number of parts is reduced.</p>

The pivotal lever <b>236</b><i>a </i>is connected to the other end side of the link <b>233</b> through a cable <b>237</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b> is operated for unlocking, then the link <b>233</b> pivots to pull the motion transmitting cable <b>143</b>. Thus, by any of the operation of the seat lock actuator <b>228</b> and the unlocking operation of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b>, the link <b>233</b> is pivoted to pull the motion transmitting cable <b>143</b>. In response to the pivotal motion of the link <b>233</b>, the seat catcher <b>142</b> is changed over from the seat catching state to the seat catch releasing state.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the seat catcher <b>142</b> is in the seat catch releasing state, the front seat <b>32</b> is released to allow opening therof, and if a predetermined part disposed in the storage box <b>30</b> is operated, then the control unit <b>223</b> enters a control mode similar to that upon reception of an ID signal from the normal portable transmitter <b>226</b> and allows the scooter type vehicle to be steered.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Operation of the present working example is described below. The rear enlarged portion <b>121</b> is enlarged at a location behind the support pipe <b>62</b>, which serves as the attaching portion of the upper portion of the rear shock absorber <b>64</b> to the rear end of the rear seat <b>33</b> and the rear portion of the vehicle body frame F. The rear enlarged portion <b>121</b> is provided at the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b>. The storage box <b>30</b> has the front helmet accommodation portion <b>119</b> disposed below the front seat <b>32</b> provided on the riding seat <b>31</b> of the tandem type and the rear helmet accommodation portion <b>120</b> disposed below the rear seat <b>33</b> provided on the riding seat <b>31</b>. Therefore, the volume of the storage box <b>30</b> is increased so as to allow an elongated article such as a golf club, which extends rearwardly farther than the rear end of the riding seat <b>31</b>, to be accommodated in the storage box <b>30</b>. Additionally, also it becomes possible to accommodate a small article other than a helmet in a rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b>, and an article which is used less frequently such as a tool is accommodated suitably in the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, since the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b> is enlarged toward the rear to a position substantially the same as that of the rear end of the grab rail <b>118</b> disposed around the rear seat <b>33</b>, the capacity of the storage box <b>30</b> is further increased and the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b> is protected by the grab rail <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, since the reduced width portion <b>121</b><i>a</i>, which extends to the location between the left and right tail lamp units <b>123</b>, <b>123</b> as viewed from above, is provided at the rear portion of the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b>, the space produced between the pair of left and right tail lamp units <b>123</b>, <b>123</b> is efficiently utilized to increase the capacity of the storage box <b>30</b>. It also becomes easy to provide a space for exchanging a bulb of any of the tail lamp units <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The storage box <b>30</b> has the upper face cover <b>111</b> disposed below the rear seat <b>33</b>, and since the accommodating space <b>128</b>, which is used upon removal of the rear seat <b>33</b>, is formed on the upper face of the upper face cover <b>111</b>, a space for accommodating a small article at a location other than the inside of the storage box <b>30</b> is provided while preventing an increase in the number of required parts and complication of the structure. In addition, the accommodation space <b>128</b> is formed between the first rib <b>127</b> and the second rib <b>128</b>. First rib <b>127</b> projects upward from the upper face cover <b>111</b> and is formed in a ring shape. The second rib <b>129</b> projects downward from the bottom plate <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the rear seat <b>33</b> and is also formed in a ring shape. The second rib <b>129</b> cooperates with the first rib <b>127</b> to form a labyrinth structure, and this simple structure prevents admission of rainwater, dust or the like into the accommodation space <b>128</b> from around the accommodation space <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Additionally, the light source <b>116</b> for illuminating the inside of the storage box <b>30</b> is attached to the inner side face of the storage box <b>30</b> at a location corresponding to the front portion of the upper face cover <b>111</b>. The inside of the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b>, which is likely to become dark due to the provision of the upper face cover <b>111</b>, is illuminated effectively without having to place an illuminating article within the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b>. Additionally, at the location corresponding to the front portion of the upper face cover <b>111</b>, the inner side face of the storage box <b>30</b> is likely to be viewed, and thus dunning down of a bulb of the light source <b>116</b> or the like is readily confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, since the rear upper cover <b>165</b> and the rear center cover <b>166</b> which cover the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b>, the pair of left and right tail lamp units <b>123</b>, and the rear fender <b>181</b> are attached to the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b>, a plurality of parts disposed around the rear portion of the storage box <b>30</b> are removed at one time by only removing wiring lines for the tail lamp units <b>123</b>. Consequently, superior facility in maintenance is assured.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The storage box <b>30</b> includes the shallow bottom portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>disposed between the front helmet accommodation portion <b>119</b> and the rear helmet accommodation portion <b>120</b>. The throttle body <b>68</b>, for which the control box <b>76</b> which houses the controller <b>75</b> therein is provided, and the fuel injection valve <b>74</b> are disposed below the shallow bottom portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>such that the positions of the top ends thereof are all substantially at the same height. Accordingly, by forming the shallow bottom portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>flat between the front and rear helmet accommodation portions <b>119</b> and <b>120</b>, the shallow bottom portion <b>110</b><i>c </i>is utilized effectively as a container. Additionally, part of the intake system of the engine E is disposed effectively in the space below the shallow bottom portion <b>110</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The lower portion of the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b> is disposed below the upper attaching portion of the rear shock absorber <b>64</b> to the rear portion of the vehicle body frame F such that the container portion <b>124</b> is formed within the rear enlarged portion <b>121</b>. In container portion <b>124</b>, the enlarged portion <b>110</b><i>d</i>, formed by partly enlarging the bottom wall of the storage box <b>30</b> upward, is interposed between the rear helmet accommodation portion <b>120</b> and the container portion <b>124</b>. The rear helmet accommodation portion <b>120</b> and the container portion <b>124</b> behind of the rear helmet accommodation portion <b>120</b> are partitioned by the enlarged portion <b>110</b><i>d </i>so that improved convenience in use is achieved, and so that an article placed in the container portion <b>124</b> toward the rear is prevented from moving forward or rearward by means of the enlarged portion <b>110</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, the fuel tank <b>28</b>, formed to be elongate and oriented in the vertical direction as viewed from the side, is disposed in front of the storage box <b>30</b>. The front enlarged portion <b>122</b> is provided at the lower portion of the front end of the storage box <b>30</b> such that it is enlarged toward the front at a location near the bottom portion of the fuel tank <b>28</b>. Thus, the front portion of the storage box <b>30</b> is formed deep to facilitate accommodation of an elongated article therein, and the capacity of the storage box <b>30</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Additionally, since the battery <b>147</b> and other electric equipment <b>148</b> to <b>150</b> are accommodated in the front enlarged portion <b>122</b>, they are accommodated in the storage box <b>30</b> so as not to obstruct accommodation of the helmet H<b>1</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Further, since the second maintenance lid <b>151</b>, which partitions the inside of the front enlarged portion <b>122</b> and the front helmet accommodation portion <b>119</b> from each other, is attached for opening and closing movement to the storage box <b>30</b>, an article accommodated in the front enlarged portion <b>122</b> and the helmet H<b>1</b> accommodated in the front helmet accommodation portion <b>119</b> are prevented from contacting with and damaging each other.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, since the lower portion of the damper rod <b>152</b>, which extends generally vertically in such a manner as to assist the opening or closing movement of the front seat <b>32</b>, is accommodated in the front enlarged portion <b>122</b>, there is no need to provide a space to position the damper rod <b>152</b> outside of the storage box <b>30</b>. Additionally, when the front seat <b>32</b> is open, the damper rod <b>152</b> is minimally exposed to the outside so that it does not provide an obstruction when an article is to be placed into the storage box <b>30</b>, and the appearance and the form is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The fuel tank <b>28</b> and the radiator <b>29</b> are disposed below the floor tunnel portion <b>167</b>, which is formed from part of the vehicle body cover <b>34</b> which covers the vehicle body frame F. The vehicle body frame F includes the head pipe <b>27</b>, the pair of left and right upper down frames <b>37</b> extending rearward and downward from the head pipe <b>27</b>, and the pair of left and right lower down frames <b>38</b> having the inclined portions <b>38</b><i>a </i>extending rearward and downward from the head pipe <b>27</b> below the connecting portions of the upper down frames <b>37</b> to the head pipe <b>27</b>. The fuel tank <b>28</b>, extending generally vertically from a location behind the lower portion of the head pipe <b>27</b> to the lower portions of the lower down frames <b>38</b>, is disposed in the space surrounded by the upper down frames <b>37</b> and the lower down frames <b>38</b> and positioned immediately rearwardly of the front wheel WF.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Accordingly, since the fuel tank <b>28</b>, elongate in shape and extending generally vertically, is disposed immediately behind the front wheel WF, the location corresponding to the lower portion of the head pipe <b>27</b> is prevented from becoming an unused space, and arrangement of parts making effective use of the space below the floor tunnel portion <b>167</b> is possible. Additionally, since the fuel tank <b>28</b>, which has a comparatively high weight, is positioned nearer to the front wheel WF, the distribution load to the front wheel WF is raised resulting in an improvement in the turning performance. Further, the level of the remaining amount of fuel within the fuel tank <b>28</b> appears to be relatively high even when the remaining amount of the fuel is small because of the vertical orientation of the fuel tank <b>28</b>. Thus, the high level is advantageous for suction by the pump unit <b>97</b> due to the advantageous placement of the pump unit <b>97</b> at the lower end of the fuel tank <b>28</b> as in the present working example.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, since the radiator <b>29</b> is disposed behind the fuel tank <b>28</b> and the battery <b>147</b> is disposed between the radiator <b>29</b> and the fuel tank <b>28</b>, the space behind the fuel tank <b>28</b> is made relatively large by forming the fuel tank <b>28</b> in a vertically elongated configuration. Further, the battery <b>147</b>, which is a heavy article, is disposed at the center in the forward and backward direction of the vehicle body, and this contributes to improved steering performance. Furthermore, since the battery <b>147</b> is disposed between the radiator <b>29</b> and the fuel tank <b>28</b>, the fuel tank <b>28</b> is shielded from the influence of heat from the radiator <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Since the pump unit <b>97</b>, housed within and positioned at the lower portion of the inside of the fuel tank <b>28</b>, is attached to the fuel tank <b>28</b> from the rear face side of the fuel tank <b>28</b>, the pump unit <b>97</b> is attached to the fuel tank <b>28</b> so that it is not influenced by an irregular road surface.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Additionally since the pump unit <b>97</b> is attached to the fuel tank <b>28</b> in a posture wherein the axis of rotation thereof is inclined forward and downward, the intake port of the pump unit <b>97</b> is positioned as close as possible to the bottom portion of the fuel tank <b>28</b> to minimize the amount of unused fuel in the fuel tank <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The reservoir tank <b>104</b> of the radiator <b>29</b> is disposed below the step floor <b>159</b>. Step floor <b>159</b> forms part of the vehicle body cover <b>34</b>. The water supply port of the reservoir tank <b>104</b> is disposed below the first maintenance lid <b>117</b>, which is removably attached to the bottom wall of the storage box <b>30</b> disposed below the riding seat <b>31</b>. Accordingly, since the radiator <b>29</b> is disposed behind the fuel tank <b>28</b>, it is easy to make the water supply port <b>107</b> of the reservoir tank <b>104</b> face the bottom portion of the riding seat <b>31</b>, and the water supply port <b>107</b> is disposed higher than that where the water supply port faces the step floor <b>159</b> or the like, which is positioned immediately above the reservoir tank <b>104</b>. Thus the operability in supplying water is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Additionally, since the water supply port forming member <b>108</b>, which forms the water supply port <b>107</b>, is supported on the attaching portion <b>54</b> to the vehicle body frame F side of the tension rod <b>53</b> provided between the vehicle body frame F and the unit swing engine UE, the water supply port forming member <b>108</b> is supported by the vehicle body frame F, and thus it is unnecessary to take special measures to support the water supply port forming member <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, the fuel from the fuel tank <b>28</b> is supplied to the fuel injection valve <b>74</b>, and the fuel in the fuel tank <b>28</b> is supplied effectively to the fuel injection valve <b>74</b> using the pump unit <b>97</b> which is urged by the fuel tank <b>28</b> wherein the remaining amount of the fuel appears to be at a comparatively high level when the amount of remaining fuel is small.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The swing arm <b>48</b>, disposed on the right side of the rear wheel WR and supporting the rear wheel WR thereon, is formed in a substantially triangular shape as viewed from the side. The brake caliper <b>85</b> of the rear brake <b>84</b> is supported on the swing arm <b>48</b> within the opening <b>81</b> provided at a substantially central portion of the swing arm <b>48</b>. Thus, the brake caliper <b>85</b> is disposed at a relatively low position thereby to lower the center of gravity of the scooter type vehicle. Further, since the brake caliper <b>85</b> is surrounded by the swing arm <b>48</b> therearound, it is possible to assure a substantial dimension in the generally vertical direction of the swing arm <b>48</b> as viewed from the side, raising the rigidity in the vertical direction and the torsional rigidity of the swing arm <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Further, since the exhaust muffler <b>78</b> is disposed laterally outward and to the side of the swing arm <b>48</b> in such a manner as to cover the brake caliper <b>85</b> from the outside, the appearance is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Additionally, since the opening <b>81</b> is formed such that the vertical dimension thereof decreases toward the rear, and the brake caliper <b>85</b> disposed in the rear portion of the opening <b>81</b> is supported on the swing arm <b>48</b> at a location behind the opening <b>81</b>, the brake caliper <b>85</b> is supported at a portion of the swing arm <b>48</b> having a high rigidity. Thus the rigidity in attachment of the brake caliper <b>85</b> is also high.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The lower portion of the exhaust muffler <b>78</b> is fastened to the swing arm <b>48</b> at two places so as to sandwich the axle <b>80</b> of the rear wheel WR on opposing front and rear sides of the the axle <b>80</b>. A straight line L is defined that interconnects these two fastening places. Since the fastening portions of both the rear shock absorber <b>64</b> and the rear axle <b>80</b> to the swing arm <b>48</b> are disposed between the straight line L and the exhaust muffler <b>78</b>, assembly of the exhaust muffler <b>78</b> and the rear shock absorber <b>64</b> to the swing arm <b>48</b> is facilitated. Further, the axle <b>80</b> and the fastening portions are not easily viewed from a position to the side and above the scooter type vehicle thereby improving the appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The electric motor <b>42</b> for varying the transmission gear ratio of the continuously variable transmission M interposed between the engine E and the rear wheel WR, is disposed below the passenger step <b>162</b> provided at the rear portion of the step floor <b>159</b> provided on the vehicle body cover <b>34</b>. Since the electric motor <b>42</b> is disposed at a relatively low position, this contributes to lowering the center of gravity of the scooter type vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Since the continuously variable transmission M is of the belt type and forms the unit swing engine UE together with the engine E, wherein the axis of the cylinder <b>45</b> extends substantially horizontally and the electric motor <b>42</b> is disposed to the side of the cylinder <b>45</b> forward of the continuously variable transmission M, the electric motor <b>42</b> is protected by the cylinder <b>45</b> of the engine E and the continuously variable transmission M. Additionally, since the support frame <b>41</b> which supports the step floor <b>159</b> from below is provided on the vehicle body frame F, and the electric motor <b>42</b> is disposed below the support frame <b>41</b>, the electric motor <b>42</b> is protected further effectively by the rigid support frame <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, since the electric motor <b>42</b> is disposed such that the axis of rotation thereof is directed in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body, the electric motor <b>42</b> is disposed to the side of the cylinder <b>45</b> provided on the engine E such that it does not project laterally outward and to the side from the outer side face of the continuously variable transmission M.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The grab rail <b>118</b> is attached to the rear portion of the vehicle body frame F. The back rest <b>135</b>, which has, on the upper face thereof, the front inclined face <b>135</b><i>a </i>inclined forward and downward and the rear inclined face <b>135</b><i>b </i>inclined rearward and downward as viewed from the side such that it has a substantially streamlined shape. The back rest <b>135</b> is attached to the upper face of the rear portion of the grab rail <b>118</b> and is disposed behind the rear seat <b>33</b> provided on the riding seat <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Accordingly, the waist portion of the passenger on the rear seat <b>33</b> is supported firmly by the forward and downwardly inclined front inclined face <b>135</b><i>a </i>from within the upper face of the back rest <b>135</b>. Additionally, since the back rest <b>135</b> has a substantially streamlined shape, the appearance and the aerodynamic performance of the back rest <b>135</b> is improved. Further, since the rearward and downwardly inclined rear inclined face <b>135</b><i>b </i>from within the upper face of the back rest <b>135</b> is utilized, a load which projects toward the rear from the rear seat <b>33</b> is placed on the back rest <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Further, since the back rest <b>135</b> is formed such that the width thereof gradually decreases toward the rear as viewed from above, the back rest <b>135</b> is compactly formed, the design coordination is assured together with the shape of the vehicle body cover <b>34</b>, and the aerodynamic performance is further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Furthermore, since the upper face of the rear portion of the grab rail <b>118</b> is set to a height substantially equal to that of the upper face of the rear seat <b>33</b>, and the back rest <b>135</b> is removably attached to the upper face of the rear portion of the grab rail <b>118</b>, when the user wants to place a greater amount of luggage on the rear seat <b>33</b>, the upper face of the rear portion of the grab rail <b>118</b> behind the back rest <b>135</b> is removed and is utilized effectively to receive the luggage.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> and a second article accommodating portion <b>192</b> are provided in the leg shield <b>158</b> of the vehicle body cover <b>34</b>. The first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> is formed as an article accommodation section of the drawer type including the accommodating case <b>193</b> which is drawn out and removed from the leg shield <b>158</b>. The second article accommodation portion <b>192</b> includes the accommodating recess <b>214</b> formed on the leg shield <b>158</b> which is covered for opening and closing movement by the lid member <b>215</b> hinged to the leg shield <b>158</b>. The first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> and a second article accommodating portion <b>192</b> are disposed separately on the respective left and right sides of the vehicle. Thus, the comparatively great space of the leg shield <b>158</b> is utilized effectively to accommodate an article in the leg shield <b>158</b>. Additionally, since the accommodating case <b>193</b> is formed to be larger than the accommodating recess <b>214</b>, a relatively large amount of articles are accommodated in the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> as compared to the second article accommodating portion <b>192</b>. Since the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> is of the drawer type, when the lid is opened, the articles stored in the inside of the accommodating case <b>193</b> do not unintentionally fall out, and articles are fully accommodated within the accommodating case <b>193</b>. Further, if the accommodating case <b>193</b> is completely removed from the leg shield <b>158</b>, then the comparatively great opening <b>196</b> is formed in the leg shield <b>158</b>, and consequently, maintenance is easily performed on the bulb <b>171</b><i>a </i>of the headlamp <b>171</b> disposed in front of the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Further, the locking mechanism <b>208</b> is provided between the accommodating case <b>193</b> of the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> and the leg shield <b>158</b>. The locking mechanism <b>208</b> performs changeover between connection and cancellation of the connection of the accommodating case <b>193</b> to the leg shield <b>158</b> in response to a key operation from the keyhole <b>207</b> facing the front face of the accommodating case <b>193</b>. When the key is inserted into the keyhole <b>207</b> of the locking mechanism <b>208</b> to operate the locking mechanism <b>208</b>, a drawing out operation of the accommodating case <b>193</b> is enabled. Consequently, prevention of the theft of an article accommodated in the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> is ensured. Further, since the key is used as a knob to draw out the accommodating case <b>193</b>, the necessity for provision of a knob on the accommodating case <b>193</b> is eliminated, and a greater number of articles are accommodated into the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The accommodating case <b>193</b> is formed such that, when it is in the retracted state, it covers the head pipe <b>27</b> from the left side to the right side. The locking mechanism <b>208</b> is disposed at a position at which it is opposed to the head pipe <b>27</b> when viewed from the rear. Thus, the locking mechanism <b>208</b> is disposed effectively in the space behind the head pipe <b>27</b> to further maximize the accommodation capacity of the accommodating case <b>193</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The handlebar lock module <b>211</b>, which can disable a steering operation of the steering handlebar bar <b>26</b>, is disposed in the proximity of the head pipe <b>27</b> on the opposite side to the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b>. The second article accommodating portion <b>192</b> is disposed such that the handlebar lock module <b>211</b> is sandwiched between the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b> and the second article accommodating portion <b>192</b>. Therefore, the first article accommodating portion <b>191</b>, handlebar lock module <b>211</b> and second article accommodating portion <b>192</b> are disposed in a juxtaposed relationship in the leg shield <b>158</b> to further effectively utilize the comparatively great space of the leg shield <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Further, since the transmission antenna <b>225</b> is disposed at a position spaced away from the handlebar lock module <b>211</b>, the degree of freedom in arrangement of the transmission antenna <b>225</b> is raised.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The receiver <b>227</b> can be disposed in the storage box <b>30</b> or the riding seat <b>31</b>. In the present working example, it is disposed in the storage box <b>30</b>. Thus the receiver <b>27</b> is protected from the adverse environmental effects of mud, dust, water, external force and so forth, and it is unnecessary to cover the receiver <b>227</b> with a cover member made of a synthetic resin material. Accordingly, the necessity for re-adjustment of the receiver <b>227</b> is eliminated, and the water-proof performance is assured.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Additionally, the receiver <b>227</b> is configured such that the board <b>229</b> has the antennae <b>230</b>, <b>230</b> disposed on one face thereof and has the reception circuit <b>231</b> provided on the other face thereof, and the board is housed within the case <b>232</b>. Thus, the receiver <b>227</b> is compactly formed, the required space for mounting the receiver <b>227</b> within the storage box <b>30</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Furthermore, the first maintenance lid <b>117</b> allows maintenance to be performed relating to the engine E and is disposed below the storage box <b>30</b>. First maintenance lid <b>117</b> provides opening and closing movement with respect to the bottom wall of the storage box <b>30</b>. The receiver <b>227</b> is disposed in the storage box <b>30</b> in such a manner as to be covered with part of the first maintenance lid <b>117</b>, thus the receiver <b>227</b> is disposed at a position suitable to receive maintenance thereon while preventing interference with an article accommodated in the storage box <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Further, the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b>, which enables at least starting of the engine E and handlebar lock cancellation while eliminating the necessity for the portable transmitter <b>226</b>, is disposed in the leg shield <b>158</b>. Thus, even if the user of the vehicle loses the portable transmitter <b>226</b> or the power cell of the portable transmitter <b>226</b> has insufficient charge for operation, if the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b> is operated using the mechanical key for emergency unlocking, then the scooter type vehicle is operable.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The second article accommodating portion <b>192</b> is provided on the leg shield <b>158</b> on the right side of the handlebar lock module <b>211</b>, and the keyhole <b>238</b> of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b> faces the inner side face of the accommodating recess <b>214</b> of the second article accommodating portion <b>192</b>. Since the accommodating recess <b>214</b> is normally covered by the lid member <b>215</b>, the keyhole <b>238</b> is disposed at an inconspicuous place, and the keyhole <b>238</b> of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b> is maximally prevented from being made an object of mischief.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Furthermore, the seat catcher <b>142</b> performs the changeover between the seat catch state wherein the front seat <b>32</b> which can release the storage box <b>30</b> is held in the closed state and the seat catch releasing state wherein it allows opening and closing movement of the front seat <b>32</b>. The link mechanism <b>234</b> is connected at a first end to the seat catcher <b>142</b>, and is connected at a second end to the seat lock actuator <b>228</b>, which operates in response to an operation upon reception of a signal from the conventional portable transmitter <b>226</b>. The link mechanism is also connected at the second end to the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b>. Therefore, the link mechanism <b>234</b> for operating the seat catcher <b>142</b> is commonly used for a case wherein the portable transmitter <b>226</b> is effective, and another case wherein the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock <b>236</b> is used. By using a single link mechanism, the number of parts is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">While a working example of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the working example described above, but various design alterations may be carried out without departing from the present invention as set forth in the claims.</p>
