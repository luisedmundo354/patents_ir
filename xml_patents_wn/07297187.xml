<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a gas separation apparatus, and more particularly, to a gas separation apparatus based on a vacuum swing absorption (VSA) method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Conventional Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a gas separation apparatus is for separating nitrogen and oxygen that are main components of the air from each other, and is used for domestic or industrial use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The gas separation apparatus serves as both an oxygen generator and a nitrogen generator. As the oxygen generator, the gas separation apparatus is variously used for individual, domestic, automobile, emergency, industrial use, etc., and is recently used to increase a dissolved oxygen inside drinking water by being supplied to drinking water of a domestic water purifier. Also, as the nitrogen generator, the gas separation apparatus is used to generate nitrogen of a high purity for an industrial use, and is used to control a storage atmosphere for a long-term storage of food. The gas separation apparatus separates specific gas by sucking the air and thus transmitting the air to an adsorbent for absorbing specific gas or an enrichment membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method for sucking the air and thus transmitting to an absorbent or an enrichment membrane includes a pressure swing absorption (PSA) method for applying a pressure and generating a gas flow, and a vacuum swing absorption (VSA) method for lowering a pressure inside a conduit and generating an air flow using a pressure difference between the pressure inside the conduit and the air pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional gas separation apparatus based on the VSA method comprises: first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> including an absorbent for absorbing specific gas; a vacuum pump <b>113</b> for forming a vacuum state inside the first and second absorption bends <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>; a discharge pump <b>114</b> for discharging gas separated by the absorbent of the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>; a filter <b>115</b> for filtering external gas introduced into the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>; and first and second three-way valves <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> installed on a conduit that respectively connects the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, the vacuum pump <b>113</b>, and the filter <b>115</b>, for selectively connecting the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> to the vacuum pump <b>113</b>, or selectively connecting the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> to the filter <b>115</b>, that is, the air.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Operation of the conventional gas separation apparatus based on the VSA method will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">First, a process for separating gas from the first absorption bed <b>111</b> and thereby discharging will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the first absorption bed <b>111</b> and the vacuum pump <b>113</b> are connected to each other by an operation of the first three-way valve <b>121</b>, the vacuum pump <b>113</b> is operated and thereby an inner pressure of the first absorption bed <b>111</b> is reduced thus to form a vacuum state. Also, when the first absorption bed <b>111</b> and the filter <b>115</b> (that is, outside of the gas separation apparatus) are connected to each other by the operation of the first three-way valve <b>121</b>, a pressure difference between inside of the first absorption bed <b>111</b> and outside of the gas separation apparatus is generated. According to this, gas that has passed through the filter <b>115</b> is introduced into the first absorption bed <b>111</b>. Among the gas introduced into the first absorption bed <b>111</b>, certain gas is absorbed by the absorbent, and gas that has not been absorbed by the absorbent is discharged to outside of the gas separation apparatus by the operation of the discharge pump <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the first absorption bed <b>111</b> and the vacuum pump <b>113</b> are connected to each other by an operation of the first three-way valve <b>121</b>, gas that has been absorbed by the absorbent in the first absorption bed <b>111</b> is detached from the absorbent by a suction force of the vacuum pump <b>113</b>. The gas detached from the absorbent passes through the vacuum pump <b>113</b> thus to be discharged to outside of the gas separation apparatus. At the same time, inside of the first absorption bed <b>111</b> is again in a vacuum state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A process for separating gas from the second absorption bed <b>112</b> is the same as the process for separating gas from the first absorption bed <b>111</b>. If operation periods of the first and second three-way valves <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are alternately set, a discharge of separated gas by the vacuum pump <b>113</b> and the discharge pump <b>114</b> is consecutively performed. That is, when the vacuum pump <b>113</b> and the first absorption bed <b>111</b> are connected to each other by the first three-way valve <b>121</b>, the filter <b>115</b> and the second absorption bed <b>112</b> are connected to each other by the second three-way valve <b>122</b>. Also, when the filter <b>115</b> and the first absorption bed <b>111</b> are connected to each other by the first three-way valve <b>121</b>, the vacuum pump <b>113</b> and the second absorption bed <b>112</b> are connected to each other by the second three-way valve <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Said operation is repeatedly performed, and gas that has not been absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> is discharged out through the discharge pump <b>114</b>. Also, gas absorbed by the absorbent is discharged through the vacuum pump <b>113</b>. Under this operation, when the absorbent has a characteristic to be absorbed with nitrogen, oxygen among the air introduced into the gas separation apparatus is discharged through the discharge pump <b>114</b>, and nitrogen is discharged through the vacuum pump <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in the conventional gas separation apparatus based on the VSA method, the vacuum pump <b>113</b> for discharging gas absorbed by the absorbent and the discharge pump <b>114</b> for discharging gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent have to be all provided thus to have a high cost and have a complicated construction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a gas separation apparatus capable of simplifying a construction thereof and reducing a fabrication cost by providing a vacuum pump for simultaneously discharging gas absorbed by an absorbent and gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a gas separation apparatus comprising: at least two absorption beds respectively including an absorbent for absorbing certain gas; at least two three-way valves respectively installed on conduits for respectively connecting the absorption beds and outside of the apparatus; and a pump respectively connected to each end of the absorption beds and the three-way valves, for discharging gas absorbed by the absorbent and gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The mechanism <b>70</b> is composed of: a rotation shaft <b>71</b> extended to both sides of the driving motor <b>60</b>; a crank arm <b>72</b> connected to the rotation shaft <b>71</b> thus to be rotated; a crank shaft <b>73</b> connected to the crank arm <b>72</b> with an eccentric state from the rotation center of the crank arm <b>72</b>; and a connecting rod <b>74</b> connected to the crank shaft <b>73</b> and the pistons <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>. The mechanism <b>70</b> converts a rotation motion of the driving motor <b>60</b> into a linear reciprocation of the pistons <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the first and second discharge units <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> are operated as follows. First, capacities inside the cylinders <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> are varied by a linear reciprocation of the pistons <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, and gas is sucked into the cylinders <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> through the suction ports <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> and discharged through the discharge ports <b>44</b> and <b>54</b>. The open/close members <b>45</b><i>d</i>, <b>55</b><i>d</i>, <b>45</b><i>e</i>, and <b>55</b><i>e </i>are elastically deformed by pressures inside the cylinders <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>, thereby opening or closing the suction opening <b>45</b><i>b </i>and <b>55</b><i>b </i>and the discharge openings <b>45</b><i>c </i>and <b>55</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pistons <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> of the first and second discharge units <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> can reciprocate in the same direction or in a different direction from each other. That is, the pistons <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can reciprocate separately from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first discharge unit <b>40</b> discharges gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The second discharge unit <b>50</b> reduces pressures inside the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> thus to form a vacuum state, and detaches gas sucked by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> from the absorbent thus to discharge. According to this, a suction pressure of the first discharge unit <b>40</b> has to be a degree that gas absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is not detached from the absorbent. Also, a suction pressure of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> has to be enough for gas absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> to be detached from the absorbent. Therefore, it is preferable that the suction pressure of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> is set to be greater than that of the first discharge unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The suction pressure of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> can be greater than that of the first discharge unit <b>40</b> by several methods. As a representative example, a stroke distance of the piston <b>52</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> can be longer than that of the piston <b>42</b> of the first discharge unit <b>40</b> by controlling the crank arm <b>72</b> or the connecting rod <b>74</b> of the mechanism <b>70</b>, or a capacity of the cylinder <b>51</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> can be greater than that of the cylinder <b>41</b> of the first discharge unit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, operation of the gas separation apparatus according to the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as the first three-way valve <b>21</b> is operated, the first absorption bed <b>11</b> and the vacuum pump <b>30</b> are connected to each other, and as the driving motor <b>60</b> is operated, the second discharge unit <b>50</b> is operated. Then, gas absorbed by the absorbent in the first absorption bed <b>11</b> is detached from the absorbent thus to be sucked into the cylinder <b>51</b> through the first and fourth conduits <b>1</b> and <b>4</b> and the suction port <b>53</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b>, and inside of the first absorption bed <b>11</b> becomes a vacuum state. Gas inside the cylinder <b>51</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> is discharged to a position that gas having a characteristic to be absorbed by an absorbent is used through the discharge port <b>54</b>. Herein, gas inside the third conduit <b>3</b> is prevented from backwardly flowing to the first absorption bed <b>11</b> by the check valve <b>23</b> installed between the first absorption bed <b>11</b> and the third conduit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At the same time, when the second absorption bed <b>12</b> and the filter <b>15</b> (that is, outside of the gas separation apparatus) are connected to each other as the second three-way valve <b>22</b> is operated, external gas is introduced into the second absorption bed <b>12</b> through the second conduit <b>2</b>. Also, when the first discharge unit <b>40</b> is operated as the driving motor <b>60</b> is operated, gas that is not absorbed by an absorbent in the second absorption bed <b>12</b> is sucked into the cylinder <b>41</b> through the third conduit <b>3</b> and the suction port <b>43</b> of the first discharge unit <b>40</b>. Then, the gas is discharged to a position that gas having a characteristic not to be absorbed by the absorbent is used through the discharge port <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the first absorption bed <b>11</b> and the filter <b>15</b> (that is, outside of the gas separation apparatus) are connected to each other as the second three-way valve <b>22</b> is operated, external gas is introduced into the second absorption bed <b>12</b> through the second conduit <b>2</b>. Also, when the first discharge unit <b>40</b> is operated as the driving motor <b>60</b> is operated, gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent in the second absorption bed <b>12</b> is sucked into the cylinder <b>41</b> through the third conduit <b>3</b> and the suction port <b>43</b> of the first discharge unit <b>40</b>. Then, the gas is discharged to a position that gas having a characteristic not to be absorbed by an absorbent is used through the discharge port <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At the same time, when the second absorption bed <b>12</b> and the vacuum pump <b>30</b> are connected to each other as the second three-way valve <b>22</b> is operated and the second discharge unit <b>50</b> is operated as the driving motor <b>60</b> is operated, gas that has been absorbed by the absorbent in the second absorption bed <b>12</b> is detached from the absorbent thus to be introduced into the cylinder <b>51</b> through the second and fourth conduits <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> and the suction port <b>53</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b>, and inside of the second absorption bed <b>12</b> becomes a vacuum state. Then, the gas inside the cylinder <b>51</b> of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> is discharged to a portion that gas having a characteristic to be absorbed by an absorbent is used through the discharge port <b>54</b>. Herein, gas inside the third conduit <b>3</b> is prevented from backwardly flowing to the second absorption bed <b>12</b> by the check valve <b>24</b> installed between the first absorption bed <b>12</b> and the third conduit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If operation periods of the first and second three-way valves <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are alternately set, a discharge of gas having a characteristic to be absorbed by an absorbent and a discharge of gas having a characteristic not to be absorbed by an absorbent are consecutively performed by the vacuum pump <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Said operation is repeatedly performed, and gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is discharged by an operation of the first discharge unit <b>40</b> of the vacuum pump <b>30</b>. Also, gas that is absorbed by the absorbent in the first and second absorption beds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is discharged by an operation of the second discharge unit <b>50</b> of the vacuum pump <b>30</b>. In case that the absorbent has a characteristic to be absorbed with nitrogen, oxygen among the air introduced into the gas separation apparatus is discharged through the first discharge u nit <b>40</b>, and nitrogen is discharged through the second discharge unit <b>50</b>. An absorption rate of gas absorbed by the absorbent is varied according to a kind of the absorbent, a size of the absorption bed, and a capacity of the pump, and thereby a concentration of discharged separation gas is varied.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The gas separation apparatus of the present invention is provided with a single vacuum pump for discharging gas that is absorbed by the absorbent and gas that is not absorbed by the absorbent, thereby having a simple structure and reducing an installation space.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, the vacuum pump is provided with two discharge units respectively having a suction port and a discharge port, thereby increasing a gas separation efficiency. Additionally, since suction pressures of the discharge units can be controlled differently, a performance of the gas separation apparatus can be optimized.</p>
