<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a radio transmitting apparatus and radio transmission method for use in a radio communication system that employs CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technologies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, in a radio communication system combining OFDM and CDMA (hereinafter referred to as “OFDM-CDMA”), the combination of the characteristic of resistance to frequency selective fading that is an advantage of OFDM modulation, and the characteristic of excellent interference resistance through spreading gain that is an advantage of CDMA, results in an ability to implement high-speed, high-quality communications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">OFDM-CDMA methods broadly comprise a time domain spreading method and a frequency domain spreading method. With the time domain spreading method, spread data that have been spread on a chip-by-chip basis by means of a spreading code are arranged in the time direction within the same subcarrier. With the frequency domain spreading method, on the other hand, spread data that have been spread on a chip-by-chip basis are assigned to different subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The frequency domain spreading method will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the state of digital symbols before OFDM-CDMA processing, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram showing the arrangement of chips after OFDM-CDMA processing using frequency domain spreading. With frequency domain spreading, each of N digital symbols constituting a serial data sequence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is multiplied by, for example, a spreading code with a spreading factor of M, the same value as the number of subcarriers M.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After spreading, the chips, arranged with M chips in parallel, undergo IFFT (inverse fast Fourier transform) processing sequentially, one symbol at a time. As a result, N OFDM symbols for M subcarriers are created. That is to say, with frequency domain spreading, spread chips are arranged on the frequency axis at their respective times (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In other words, spread chips are allocated to different subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A sample configuration of a conventional OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus that implements this frequency spreading method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. First, transmitting system <b>2</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. In the OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>1</b>, a plurality of transmit signals <b>1</b> through k, . . . , (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through <b>5</b><i>k </i>are input to spreaders A<b>1</b> through A(<b>5</b><i>k</i>) that perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spread signals are added by adders C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b>, as a result of which code division multiplexed signals are obtained. In the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, k transmit signals are multicode-multiplexed by each of adders C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The code division multiplexed signals output from adders C<b>1</b> through C<b>5</b> undergo parallel/serial conversion by a parallel/serial converter (P/S) <b>4</b>, and then undergo orthogonal frequency division multiplexing by means of inverse fast Fourier transform processing by an inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) <b>5</b>. By this means, an OFDM-CDMA signal is formed in which spread chips are distributed among a plurality of subcarriers that have a mutually orthogonal relationship, and this OFDM-CDMA signal is transmitted via a radio transmitting section (RF) <b>10</b> that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and an antenna AN.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Next, receiving system <b>3</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>1</b>, an OFDM-CDMA signal transmitted from an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus with a similar configuration is input to a fast Fourier transform circuit (FFT) <b>6</b> via an antenna AN and a radio receiving section (RF) <b>11</b> that performs radio reception processing such as analog/digital conversion. FFT <b>6</b> executes fast Fourier transform processing on the input signal, and thereby extracts a code division multiplexed signal distributed among a plurality of subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A propagation path compensation circuit <b>7</b> compensates for phase fluctuations, etc., occurring in the propagation path, based on a known signal such as a propagation path estimation preamble included in the signal. After propagation path compensation, the signal is despread by a despreader <b>8</b>, and the received signal for that station is extracted from the spread plurality of transmit signals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the arrangement of OFDM-CDMA signals formed by OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>1</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, radio transmitting apparatus divides <b>5</b><i>k </i>transmit signals <b>1</b> through <b>5</b><i>k </i>into 5 groups, forms code division multiplexed signals on a group-by-group basis, and performs frequency domain spreading of the code division multiplexed signals in subcarriers of different groups.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Specifically, code division multiplexed transmit signals <b>1</b> through k are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #<b>1</b> through #m, the same number as the spreading ratio m, code division multiplexed transmit signals k+1 through <b>2</b><i>k </i>are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #<b>4</b><i>m</i>+1 through #<b>5</b><i>m</i>, and so on through to code division multiplexed transmit signals <b>4</b><i>k</i>+1 through <b>5</b><i>k</i>, which are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #m+1 through #<b>2</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The number of subcarriers need not coincide with the spreading ratio. Here, a case has been shown in which subcarriers are divided into 5 subcarrier groups, and the spreading ratio is made 1/5 the number of subcarriers in order for code division multiplexed signals to be allocated within each subcarrier group. However, the spreading ratio is not limited to this case, and may be set arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus, it is necessary to increase the degree of signal multiplexing in order to improve spectral efficiency. However, in a multipath environment, for instance, orthogonality between spreading codes is lost and error rate characteristics degrade. This is because multipathing occurs independently in each subcarrier, and therefore inter-chip orthogonality is lost when each spread chip is spread along the frequency axis.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As the degree of signal multiplexing is increased, in particular, interference between spreading codes also increases, resulting in greater degradation of error rate characteristics. Thus, a problem with conventional OFDM-CDMA communication apparatuses is the difficulty of making spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference now to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the degree of signal multiplexing is set individually for each subcarrier. For example, the spreading ratio may be set as 1/5 the number of subcarriers, with all subcarriers being divided into 5 subcarrier groups. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the degree of signal multiplexing is set low for one subcarrier group G<b>1</b> (indicated by shading in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the 5 subgroups.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As a result, within the 5 subcarrier groups, error rate characteristics can be improved for subcarrier group G<b>1</b> without lowering spectral efficiency at all for the subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G<b>1</b>. By this means, it is possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, a signal for a communicating party whose channel quality is poor, such as a distant radio station or a radio station with a poor SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio), for example, is allocated to subcarrier group G<b>1</b> for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low. By this means, it is possible to improve the error rate characteristics of a communicating party with poor channel quality, with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Here, a case has been described in which the spreading ratio is made 1/5 the number of subcarriers, but the spreading ratio is not restricted to this case, and can be set arbitrarily. For example, it is possible to divide all the subcarriers into 4 subcarrier groups, and to set the spreading ratio of one of those subcarrier groups at twice that of the other groups.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Thus, according to this embodiment, by setting the degree of signal multiplexing individually for each subcarrier and reducing the degree of signal multiplexing for a user with poor channel quality, it is possible to improve error rate characteristics with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The actual configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment will now be described, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Transmitting system <b>101</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>100</b> divides n transmit signals <b>1</b> through n into 5 groups, and performs frequency domain spreading of transmit signals within each group onto the same plurality of subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In actuality, in transmitting system <b>101</b>, transmit signals <b>1</b> through n are input to spreaders A<b>1</b> through An, which perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spread signals are added by adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>5</b> as signal multiplexing degree selecting sections, one of which is provided for each group (in this embodiment, each of 5 groups), and by this means, code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> corresponding to the predetermined number of groups are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Here, in transmitting system <b>101</b>, adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>4</b> form code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> in each of which k transmit signals are multiplexed, whereas adder B<b>5</b> forms code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> in which fewer than k transmit signals are multiplexed. That is to say, the number of signals (n−<b>4</b><i>k</i>) of transmit signals (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through n that are code division multiplexed by adder B<b>5</b> is selected so that 1&lt;(n−<b>4</b><i>k</i>)&lt;k. By this means, code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b>, and S<b>5</b>, with different chip rates, are output by adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>4</b> and adder B<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> obtained by adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>5</b>, respectively, are input to a parallel/serial converter (P/S) <b>102</b> as a multiplex signal allocation selecting section. Parallel/serial converter <b>102</b> rearranges code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> in a predetermined order, and outputs them as a serial signal S<b>6</b>. In this embodiment, this arrangement order determines which subcarrier groups in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> are allocated to by frequency domain spreading.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Serial signal S<b>6</b> output from parallel/serial converter <b>102</b> is input to an inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) <b>103</b> as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing section. Inverse fast Fourier transform circuit <b>103</b> executes inverse fast Fourier transform processing on serial signal S<b>6</b> for each of code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b>, and thereby allocates spread chips by distributing them among a plurality of subcarriers that are in a mutually orthogonal relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At this time, code division multiplexed signal S<b>1</b> that was code division multiplexed by adder B<b>1</b>, for example, is allocated by frequency domain spreading to a certain subcarrier group, and code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> that was code division multiplexed by adder B<b>5</b> is allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarrier group G<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In this way, it is possible to form an OFDM-CDMA signal S<b>7</b> in which a transmit signal with a smaller degree of multiplexing than other subcarrier groups is allocated to subcarrier group G<b>1</b>. Obtained OFDM-CDMA signal S<b>7</b> is then transmitted via a radio transmitting section (RF) <b>104</b> that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and an antenna AN.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, receiving system <b>110</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>100</b> will be described. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>100</b>, an OFDM-CDMA signal transmitted from an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus with a similar configuration is input to a fast Fourier transform circuit (FFT) <b>111</b> via antenna AN and a radio receiving section (RF) <b>114</b> that performs radio reception processing such as analog/digital conversion. FFT <b>111</b> executes fast Fourier transform processing on the input signal, and thereby extracts a code division multiplexed signal distributed among a plurality of subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A propagation path compensation circuit <b>112</b> compensates for phase fluctuations, etc., occurring in the propagation path, based on a known signal such as a propagation path estimation preamble included in the signal. After propagation path compensation, the signal is despread by a despreader <b>113</b>, and the received signal for that station is extracted from the spread plurality of transmit signals.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With the above configuration, transmit signals (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through n allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing are subject to less inter-code interference on the propagation path than transmit signals <b>1</b> through k, . . . , (<b>3</b><i>k</i>+1) through <b>4</b><i>k </i>allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As a result, compared with the case in which the degree of signal multiplexing is decided uniformly for all subcarriers, if transmit signals (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through n carrying important information or for which it is desired to improve the error rate are allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing, and transmit signals <b>1</b> through k, . . . , (<b>3</b><i>k</i>+1) through <b>4</b><i>k </i>for which the error rate need not be improved so much are allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of signal multiplexing, degradation of error rate characteristics can be prevented without lowering spectral efficiency significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Thus, an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>100</b> can be implemented that enables spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics to be made compatible.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention is that, by selecting as a transmit signal for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low, described in Embodiment 1, a transmit signal such as retransmission information or control information for which better channel quality is required than for other data, the quality of data for which better channel quality is required than for other data is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>200</b> according to this embodiment, the special feature lies particularly in the transmitting system <b>201</b>, and therefore a description of the receiving system will be omitted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in which parts corresponding to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are assigned the same codes as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>200</b> transmits retransmission signals <b>1</b> through m as transmit signals for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">That is to say, number of signals m of retransmission signals <b>1</b> through m is selected so that 1&lt;m&lt;k. As a result, code division multiplexed retransmission signals <b>1</b> through m are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarrier group G<b>1</b> with a low degree of signal multiplexing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, thereby enabling the error rate characteristics of those retransmission signals <b>1</b> through m to be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In performing retransmission as referred to here, the propagation path environment between the local station and the far-end station are often poor, and as the number of retransmissions increases the same signal must be transmitted numerous times, resulting in lower transmission efficiency.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to the above configuration, by allocating data such as retransmission information or control information, for which better channel quality is required than for other data, to subcarriers for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low, the quality of data for which better channel quality is required than for other data can be improved with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 32 of the present invention is that amplitude limiting is performed independently for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low and for other subcarriers. For example, amplitude limiting may be performed for subcarriers with a high degree of multiplexing, while amplitude limiting is not performed for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low. By this means, it is possible to make an improvement in error rate characteristics compatible with a reduction of peak power for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low, to a greater extent than in other embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Peak power is a problem when transmitting an OFDM-CDMA signal. Therefore, processing is generally carried out to reduce peak power by performing amplitude limiting. However, a drawback of amplitude limiting is that it results in degradation of error rate characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">In consideration of this point, in this embodiment the error rate characteristics of subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low are significantly improved by not performing amplitude limiting on subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low. Amplitude limiting is performed for other subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">As the number of subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low represents a small proportion of the total number of subcarriers, and a low degree of multiplexing implies proportionally low peak power, the effect of reducing peak power is scarcely lessened by not performing amplitude limiting on subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Thus, by not performing amplitude limiting on subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low, compatibility between error rate characteristics and peak power reduction for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low can be achieved to a significantly greater extent than in other embodiments described above.</p>

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, a case is illustrated in which amplitude limiting is not performed on code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> for which the degree of multiplexing is set low, but the present invention is not limited to this, and virtually the same effect as in the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> can be achieved, for example, by making the amplitude limiting for code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> allocated to subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low less stringent than the amplitude limiting applied to code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> allocated to subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is made high; the essential point being to perform amplitude limiting independently for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low and for other subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">According to the above configuration, by performing amplitude limiting independently for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low and for other subcarriers, the adverse effects of peak power are kept to a minimum, and the error rate characteristics of subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low can be significantly improved.</p>

<p id="p-0290" num="0289">A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 33 of the present invention is that, in contrast to the above-described embodiments, the number of a preamble for propagation path estimation is set independently for each subcarrier. In the case of this embodiment, a large number of propagation path estimation preamble is inserted for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low than for other subcarriers. By this means, the error rate characteristics of transmit signals superimposed on subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low can be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The more numerous the propagation path estimation preamble inserted, the better are the error rate characteristics. However, as the number of the propagation path estimation preamble inserted increases, transmission efficiency decreases, as correspondingly fewer other signals can be transmitted. In the case of channel conditions in which adequate error rate characteristics can be obtained even if a low propagation path estimation preamble is set, in particular, transmission efficiency will only fall even if a large number of propagation path estimation preamble is set, and the effect will be small.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In consideration of these points, in this embodiment a large number of propagation path estimation preamble is set only for subcarriers for which a low degree of multiplexing is set. As a result, compatibility can be achieved to a significant extent between an improvement in the error rate and transmission efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0297" num="0296">According to the above configuration, by setting a large number of propagation path estimation preamble for subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low than for other subcarriers, it is possible to significantly improve the error rate of a signal transmitted by subcarriers for which the degree of multiplexing is set low, while suppressing a drop in transmission efficiency.</p>

This multiplexed signal is then transmitted assigned to a plurality of subcarriers. By this means, error rate characteristics can be improved when subcarriers are subjected to fluctuations independently.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">In a multipath environment, each subcarrier is subjected to amplitude fluctuations independently, and therefore amplitude deviation occurs between chips, and orthogonality between spreading codes is disrupted. Thus, depending on the propagation environment, disruption of orthogonality may be severe. For example, disruption of orthogonality will be severe in the event of either +1 code or −1 code bias in subcarriers whose reception level has declined.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Focusing on this point, a code division multiplexed signal is multiplexed with a code division multiplexed signal representing the first-mentioned code division multiplexed signal shifted by one or more chips before being transmitted. The receiving side is provided with a first despreading section that despreads the code division multiplexed signal that is not shifted, and a second despreading section that despreads the code division multiplexed signal that is shifted. These two despreading sections can have a configuration whereby a correlator coefficient is shifted by the number of chips by which the spreading code was shifted on the transmitting side.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Since the probability of disruption of orthogonality being severe for both the unshifted code division signal and the shifted code division signal is low, a received signal with good error rate characteristics can be obtained by selecting the despread value of one or other of these code division multiplexed signals.</p>

<p id="p-0389" num="0388">As a result, it is possible to significantly improve error rate characteristics for subcarrier group G<b>1</b>, with no decrease in spectral efficiency whatever for subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G<b>1</b> among the five subcarrier groups. By this means, it is possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">In this embodiment, a signal for a communicating party whose channel quality is poor, such as a distant radio station or a radio station with a poor SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio), for example, is allocated to subcarrier group G<b>1</b>. By this means, it is possible to improve the error rate characteristics of a communicating party with poor channel quality, with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">As chips that have undergone spreading processing are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for subcarrier group G<b>1</b>, even if the spreading ratio of a spread signal allocated to this subcarrier group G<b>1</b> is made larger than the spreading ratio of spread signals allocated to other groups, it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarrier groups from decreasing.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">In this embodiment, the spreading ratio of subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G<b>1</b> is made 1/5, and the spreading ratio of subcarrier group G<b>1</b> is set to twice that of other subcarrier groups. However, spreading ratios are not limited to these, and a spreading ratio can be set individually for each subcarrier group.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">An actual sample configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment will now be described, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>. Transmitting system <b>4601</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>4600</b> divides n transmit signals <b>1</b> through n into 5 groups, and forms an OFDM-CDMA signal by spreading transmit signals in each group in the frequency axis direction only of a plurality of subcarriers, or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (so-called “two-dimensional spreading”).</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">In actuality, in transmitting system <b>4601</b>, transmit signals <b>1</b> through n are input to spreaders A<b>1</b> through An, which perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spreading ratio of spreaders A(<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through An is set to a higher value than the spreading ratio of the other spreaders A<b>1</b> through A(<b>4</b><i>k</i>) For example, the spreading ratio of spreaders A(<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through An may be set to 1/5 the number of subcarriers while the spreading ratio of spreaders A<b>1</b> through A(<b>4</b><i>k</i>) is set to twice that value.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Spread signals are multiplexed by adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>5</b>, one of which is provided for each group (in this embodiment, each of 5 groups), and by this means, code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> corresponding to the predetermined number of groups are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">Here, in transmitting system <b>4601</b>, adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>4</b> form code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> in each of which k transmit signals are multiplexed, whereas adder B<b>5</b> forms code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> in which fewer than k transmit signals are multiplexed. That is to say, the number of signals (n−<b>4</b><i>k</i>) of transmit signals (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through n that are code division multiplexed by adder B<b>5</b> is selected so that 1&lt;(n−<b>4</b><i>k</i>)&lt;k.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> obtained by adders B<b>1</b> through B<b>5</b>, respectively, are input to a parallel/serial converter (P/S) <b>4602</b> as a spread signal assigning section. Parallel/serial converter <b>4602</b>, comprising memory and a flip-flop circuit, rearranges code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> in a predetermined order, and outputs them as a serial signal S<b>6</b>. In this embodiment, this arrangement order determines which subcarrier groups in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b> are allocated to, and also determines whether allocation is performed only in the frequency axis direction or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">In this embodiment, code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low and the spreading ratio is set high is allocated spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, and the other code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b> are allocated spread only in the frequency axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">Serial signal S<b>6</b> output from parallel/serial converter <b>4602</b> is input to inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) <b>103</b>. Inverse fast Fourier transform circuit <b>103</b> executes inverse fast Fourier transform processing on serial signal S<b>6</b> for each of code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>5</b>, and thereby allocates spread chips by distributing them among a plurality of subcarriers that are in a mutually orthogonal relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">At this time, code division multiplexed signal S<b>1</b> that was code division multiplexed by adder B<b>1</b>, for example, is allocated by frequency domain spreading to a certain subcarrier group, and code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> that was code division multiplexed by adder B<b>5</b> is allocated by spreading in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction to subcarrier group G<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">In this way, it is possible to form an OFDM-CDMA signal S<b>7</b> in which a spread signal spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is allocated to subcarrier group G<b>1</b>, and spread signals spread only in the frequency axis direction are allocated to other subcarrier groups. Obtained OFDM-CDMA signal S<b>7</b> is then transmitted via radio transmitting section (RF) <b>104</b> that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and antenna AN.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> shows an example of OFDM-CDMA signal S<b>7</b> formed by OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>4600</b>. As can be seen from this drawing, code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b> obtained by spreading with a spreading ratio twice that of other code division multiplexed signals S<b>1</b> through S<b>4</b>, is allocated by two-dimensional spreading to subcarriers in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (that is, the spread signal is allocated over a plurality of symbols).</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">In the above configuration, by providing a subcarrier group G<b>1</b> in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarrier groups from being decreased even if the spreading ratio of a spread signal allocated to this subcarrier group G<b>1</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Also, by providing subcarrier groups in which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, wasteful band usage due to subcarriers that do not transmit any data can be prevented as compared with the case where spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">Moreover, by making the degree of multiplexing of transmit signals <b>4</b><i>k</i>+1 through n of subcarrier group G<b>1</b>, in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, lower than the degree of signal multiplexing of other subcarrier groups, inter-code interference on the propagation path is reduced, and therefore the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction can be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">As a result, compared with a case in which the degree of multiplexing and spreading direction are decided uniformly for all subcarriers (for example, when it is decided that spread signals are to be allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers) if transmit signals (<b>4</b><i>k</i>+1) through n for which it is desired to improve error rate characteristics, such as important information, are spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction and also allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing, and transmit signals <b>1</b> through k, . . . , (<b>3</b><i>k</i>+1) through <b>4</b><i>k </i>for which the error rate need not be improved so much are spread only in the frequency axis direction and also allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of signal multiplexing, degradation of error rate characteristics can be prevented without lowering spectral efficiency significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Thus, by selecting independently for each subcarrier whether spread signals are to be allocated only in the frequency axis direction, or are to be allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>4600</b> can be implemented that enables spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics to be made compatible.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">Furthermore, by making the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers for which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction higher than the degree of signal multiplexing of other subcarriers, it is possible to significantly improve the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on these subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">In this embodiment, a case has been described in which a code division multiplexed signal for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set lower than for others is spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, but the present invention is not limited to this, and it is possible to select independently for any subcarrier whether a signal spread only in the frequency axis direction is to be allocated, or a signal spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is to be allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> of this embodiment a case has been illustrated in which a signal spread over two symbols is allocated as regards the time axis direction, but the present invention is not limited to this, and allocation is also possible over any number of symbols.</p>
<heading id="h-0052" level="1">Embodiment 47</heading>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 47 of the present invention is that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, for subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, the degree of signal multiplexing is further decreased, and spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction at intervals of a plurality of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">By this means, the receiving side need only perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward for symbols to which a signal is allocated, enabling power consumption to be further reduced compared with Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> shows the configuration of the transmitting system of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, in which parts corresponding to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> are assigned the same codes as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, in transmitting system <b>4701</b> of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus <b>4700</b>, users allocated to subcarriers for which spread signals are assigned in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (transmit signals <b>4</b><i>k</i>+1 through n) are divided into two groups, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Specifically, a code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b>-<b>1</b> is obtained by multiplexing spread signals of half of the users by means of adder B<b>5</b><i>a</i>, and a code division multiplexed signal S<b>5</b>-<b>2</b> is obtained by multiplexing spread signals of the other half of the users by means of adder B<b>5</b><i>b</i>. These code division multiplexed signals S<b>5</b>-<b>1</b> and S<b>5</b>-<b>2</b> are then sent to parallel/serial converter (P/S) <b>102</b> in a predetermined order via parallel/serial converter (P/S) <b>4702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">By this means, in transmitting system <b>4701</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, half of the users are allocated to the first symbol (transmit signals <b>4</b><i>k</i>+1 through n/2) and the other half of the users are allocated to the second symbol (transmit signals n/2+1 through n) (that is, they are allocated in the time axis direction). Looking at subcarriers of the same time, code division multiplexed signals of half of the users are allocated in the frequency axis direction. Thereafter, spread signals continue to be allocated to alternate symbols in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">According to the above configuration, when allocating spread signals in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, a plurality of transmit signals <b>1</b> through n are divided into at least two groups, a code division multiplexed signal of first group <b>4</b><i>k</i>+1 through n/2 and a code division multiplexed signal of second group n/2+1 through n are allocated alternately in the time axis direction, and a first or second group code division multiplexed signal is allocated in the frequency axis direction within the same time, so that on the receiving side, it is only necessary to process code division multiplexed signals (symbols) of the same group in the same time—that is, to perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward only for symbols allocated to subcarriers of the same time—thereby enabling power consumption to be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In this embodiment, a case has been described in which spread signals are allocated every other symbol, but the present invention is not limited to this, and spread symbols can be allocated at intervals of any number of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various variations and modifications may be possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration comprising a plurality of spreading sections that spread a plurality of transmit signals using different spreading codes, and a spread signal assigning section that assigns a spread signal obtained by a spreading section to a plurality of subcarriers, wherein the spread signal assigning section assigns a spread signal only in the frequency axis direction, or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, independently for each subcarrier.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">According to this configuration, by providing subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction., it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarriers from decreasing even if the spreading ratio of spread signals allocated to those subcarriers is increased. Also, by providing subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, wasteful band usage due to subcarriers that do not transmit any data can be prevented as compared with the case where spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers. As a result, spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics can be made compatible.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration wherein the spreading ratios of the above-described plurality of spreading sections are set to different values.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration further comprising a first multiplexing section that multiplexes a first number of spread signals among the plurality of spread signals obtained by the above-described spreading sections, and a second multiplexing section that multiplexes a second number of spread signals smaller than the first number among the spread signals not multiplexed by that first multiplexing section, wherein the above-described spread signal assigning section assigns a code division multiplexed signal obtained by the first multiplexing section to frequency axis direction subcarriers, and assigns a code division multiplexed signal obtained by the second multiplexing section to both frequency axis direction and time axis direction subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">According to this configuration, inter-code interference on the propagation path is lower for subcarriers for which the degree of transmit signal multiplexing is low than for subcarriers for which the degree of transmit signal multiplexing is high, and it is therefore possible to significantly improve the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration wherein, of the above-described spreading sections, the spreading ratio of a spreading section that forms spread signals assigned in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is set to a value greater than the spreading ratio of a spreading section that forms spread signals assigned only in the frequency axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">According to this configuration, since the spreading ratio of subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is increased, the signal-to-noise ratio of spread signals superimposed on these subcarriers increases, and error rate characteristics improve. Also, as signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, even if the spreading ratio is increased, spread signals can be accommodated within the stipulated subcarrier frequency band, and the frequency band of other subcarriers need not be narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration further comprising first and second multiplexing sections that multiplex respective predetermined numbers of spread signals among the plurality of spread signals obtained by the above-described spreading sections, wherein the spread signal assigning section, when assigning in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, allocates signals multiplexed by the first and second multiplexing sections alternately in the time axis direction, and, within the same time, allocates a signal multiplexed by the first or second multiplexing section in the frequency axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">According to this configuration, on the receiving side that receives this OFDM-CDMA signal, it is only necessary to process code division multiplexed signals (symbols) of the same group in the same time—that is, to perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward only for symbols allocated to subcarriers of the same time—thereby enabling power consumption to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">As described above, according to the present invention an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus and radio receiving apparatus are implemented that make it possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics, by forming subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, and subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, when performing radio transmission using the OFDM-CDMA method.</p>
