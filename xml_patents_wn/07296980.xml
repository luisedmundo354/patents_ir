<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an intake valve for a high-pressure pump, in particular for internal combustion engine fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known, the fuel injected into internal combustion engine cylinders must be compressed to around 1600-bar pressure. Modern feed systems comprise a high-pressure piston pump for feeding the compressed fuel to a common rail communicating with the various engine injectors, and which in turn is supplied with fuel at around 5-bar pressure by a low-pressure pump.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each pump cylinder has an intake valve comprising a shutter normally closed by a spring, and which opens the valve when the difference in the fuel supply pressure in the cylinder exceeds the force or pressure exerted by the spring on the shutter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pump normally comprises a group of radial pistons, e.g. three pistons spaced 120° apart, which are activated by a common cam actuator fitted to a shaft; and each shutter spring is appropriately calibrated, but so located that its pressure is unaffected by the position of the relative piston.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above known intake valve (valve <b>1</b>) has various drawbacks, by resulting in unbalance of both the operating shaft and the delivery pressure of the cylinders when low flow, e.g. less than 30% of maximum flow, is demanded of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, the delay with which the various valves open varies, so that the pistons compress different amounts of fuel. In very low flow conditions, as when the engine is run at idling speed, some of the valves may not even open at all, so that unbalance of the operating shaft of the pump is considerable and greatly reduces the working life of the pump. Moreover, given its high elastic constant, the spring can only be calibrated within a tolerance range relatively wide.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To reduce the unbalance on the pump caused by the intake valve described above, a high-pressure pump has recently been proposed in which the shutter spring is located between the shutter and the piston (valve <b>2</b>), so that, during the intake stroke of the piston, the pressure of the spring is reduced rapidly, while still allowing the valve to open.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above known valve <b>2</b> has a valve body with a substantially truncated-cone-shaped lateral surface. The valve body is fixed to the cylinder by a ring nut acting on the lateral surface, and has an intake conduit sloping with respect to the valve body axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This known valve <b>2</b> also has several drawbacks. In particular, the shutter spring has a high elastic constant and therefore requires a considerable pressure drop to open; on account of its location, the spring cannot be calibrated, so that numerous versions of the spring must be provided for different applications; the shape of the valve body makes automated preassembly of the valve difficult; and, finally, location of the intake conduit weakens the valve body, which, in use, is subject to cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">From document U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,873, it is also known a piston pump having a coaxial intake valve, the shutter of which is kept closed by the sum of pressures of two different helical compression springs. One of these springs is relatively strong and permanently exerts a closing pressure on the shutter, whereas the other spring is relatively weak and is supported on a spring plate, which is axially displaceable in a chamber communicating with the intake fluid for damping purpose.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the invention to provide a high-pressure pump intake valve enabling calibration of the opening pressure of the shutter, and which is easy to preassemble, is highly reliable and durable, and eliminates the aforementioned drawbacks typically associated with known intake-valves.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, there is provided an intake valve for a high-pressure pump, in particular for internal combustion engine fuel, having at least one cylinder, and a corresponding piston sliding therein through an intake stroke and a compression stroke; said valve comprising a seat coaxial with said cylinder and cooperating with an axially movable shutter; and a pair of compression helical springs for keeping closed said shutter, said shutter being opened during said intake stroke in opposition to the sum of pressures of said springs; a first one of said springs being a substantially constant pressure, said constant pressure being adjustable; a second one of said springs being located between said shutter and said piston so that the relevant pressure decreases sinusoidally during said intake stroke and increases sinusoidally during said compression stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">More specifically, the pressures of the two springs are summed on the shutter, and the pressure of the first spring is adjustable; said seat is carried on the valve body; the shutter is a mushroom type having a plate engaging said seat, and a stem extending in an opposite direction to the piston; the two springs are helical compression types; the first spring is located between the valve body and a flange fixed to the stem in an axially adjustable position; the second spring is located between the plate and the cylinder; and the ratio between the pressure of the first spring and that of the second spring at the bottom dead center position of the piston ranges between 1.5 and 6.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a known high-pressure pump comprises a cylinder a in which slides a piston b; and an intake valve c (valve <b>2</b>) carried by a valve body d having a truncated-cone-shaped lateral surface. Valve c is defined by a mushroom-shaped shutter comprising a plate e coaxial with cylinder a and guided inside a hole f in valve body d. A spring g is located between plate e and a shoulder of piston b, and acts variably on plate e during the stroke of piston b.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Spring g must provide a given opening pressure also at the bottom dead center position of piston b, and therefore has a high elastic constant. Valve body d is fixed to cylinder a by a threaded ring nut h having a cavity complementary in shape to that of body d, and has an intake conduit i which must leave the edge of ring nut h free. Intake conduit i therefore slopes, and forms in valve body d a weak region m which is easily cracked as a result of the impact of plate e.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, number <b>5</b> indicates as a whole a high-pressure pump for internal combustion, e.g. diesel, engine fuel. Pump <b>5</b> is a radial-piston type, and comprises three cylinders <b>6</b> spaced 120° apart, and in each of which slides a corresponding piston <b>7</b>. The three cylinders <b>6</b> are carried by a common pump body, which forms a closed central operating chamber housing a cam actuator <b>8</b> carried by a shaft <b>10</b> and common to all three pistons <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each cylinder <b>6</b> is equipped with an intake valve indicated as a whole by <b>9</b>; and with a delivery valve <b>11</b>. The three intake valves <b>9</b> are supplied by a low-pressure pump (not shown) by means of a feed conduit <b>12</b>, an electromagnetic proportional inlet valve <b>13</b>, and three inlet conduits <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The three delivery valves <b>11</b> are connected to three corresponding delivery conduits <b>16</b> communicating with a high-pressure fuel common rail <b>17</b>, which supplies a series of injectors <b>18</b> of the internal combustion engine cylinders in known manner. Injectors <b>18</b> are controlled electromagnetically but-activated in known manner by the pressurized fuel in common rail <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Common rail <b>17</b> is fitted with an overpressure valve <b>15</b> by which any surplus fuel is drained into a return conduit <b>21</b> at atmospheric pressure; the fuel used to operate injectors <b>18</b> is also fed to return conduit <b>21</b>; and, to lubricate the bearings of shaft <b>10</b> and the contact surfaces of cam actuator <b>8</b> and pistons <b>7</b>, feed conduit <b>12</b> supplies a certain amount of fuel into the central chamber of the pump body via a choke <b>22</b> and an overpressure valve <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lubricating fuel from both the central chamber and overpressure valve <b>23</b> is fed to return conduit <b>21</b>. To dispose of fuel leakage through proportional inlet valve <b>13</b>, the incoming fuel pressure is greater than the return pressure, and inlet conduits <b>14</b> communicate with return conduit <b>21</b> via a choke <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">High-pressure pump <b>5</b> is normally supplied by the low-pressure pump with fuel at around 5-bar pressure, and supplies common rail <b>17</b> with around 1600-bar pressure; and the intake valve <b>9</b> of each cylinder <b>6</b> should be calibrated to open at a roughly 1.8-bar pressure drop, but with a roughly 0.01-bar tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pump <b>5</b> comprises a pump body <b>26</b> with three cylinders <b>6</b> (only one shown). In each cylinder <b>6</b> slides a corresponding piston <b>7</b>, which is pushed towards cam actuator <b>8</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) by a corresponding compression spring <b>27</b>, so that, as cam actuator <b>8</b> rotates, the three pistons <b>7</b> are activated sequentially to perform an intake stroke between a top dead center position and a bottom dead center position, and a compression stroke in the opposite direction; both strokes being performed in harmonic motion. More specifically, the intake stroke is performed negatively by spring <b>27</b>, and the compression stroke positively by cam actuator <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Delivery conduit <b>16</b> of each cylinder <b>6</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) comes out inside cylinder <b>6</b> through a hole <b>28</b> forming a conical seat <b>29</b> for delivery valve <b>11</b>, which comprises a ball shutter <b>30</b> pushed against seat <b>29</b> by a compression spring <b>31</b>. At the outer end, each cylinder <b>6</b> communicates with a coaxial cylindrical opening <b>32</b>, which is larger in diameter than cylinder <b>6</b>, has a threaded axial portion <b>33</b>, and forms an annular shoulder <b>34</b> with cylinder <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Intake valve <b>9</b> of each cylinder <b>6</b> comprises a valve body <b>36</b> defined by a cylindrical plate. Valve body <b>36</b> is housed inside opening <b>32</b> and held resting on shoulder <b>34</b> by a threaded ring nut <b>37</b> having a projecting edge <b>35</b> at the bottom, and a hexagonal socket <b>38</b> at the top for an Allen wrench.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Using an Allen wrench, and with the interposition of a low-pressure fuel seal <b>39</b>, ring nut <b>37</b> is screwed inside threaded portion <b>33</b> of opening <b>32</b> until edge <b>35</b> effectively forces valve body <b>36</b> against shoulder <b>34</b>, so that valve body <b>36</b> forms the end surface of cylinder <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Intake valve <b>9</b> comprises an opening <b>41</b> formed in valve body <b>36</b> and forming at the bottom a conical seat <b>42</b> coaxial with cylinder <b>6</b>. Conical seat <b>42</b> is closed by a mushroom-type shutter <b>43</b>, which comprises a plate <b>44</b> carried by a cylindrical stem <b>46</b> extending in the opposite direction to piston <b>7</b> and housed in a cavity <b>40</b> in ring nut <b>37</b>. Plate <b>44</b> has a conical annular surface <b>45</b> hermetically engaging conical seat <b>42</b>; and shutter <b>43</b> is movable axially between a closed position closing seat <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and an open position opening seat <b>42</b>. For which purpose opening <b>41</b> comprises an axial portion <b>47</b> for axially guiding stem <b>46</b> of shutter <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the invention, shutter <b>43</b> is kept in the closed position by elastic means comprising a first spring <b>48</b> and a second spring <b>49</b>: the first spring <b>48</b> acting on shutter <b>43</b> with substantially constant force or pressure during the movement of the corresponding piston <b>7</b>; and the second spring <b>49</b> acting on shutter <b>43</b> with a pressure varying during at least a portion of the movement of piston <b>7</b>. More specifically, both springs <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are helical compression types and act on shutter <b>43</b> by summing the respective pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First spring <b>48</b> is located between a recess <b>51</b> of opening <b>41</b>, in the top surface of valve body <b>36</b>, and a flange <b>52</b> carried by a sleeve <b>53</b> fixed to stem <b>46</b> of shutter <b>43</b>. More specifically, sleeve <b>53</b> has an inside diameter interfering slightly with the outside diameter of stem <b>46</b>, and is force-fitted onto stem <b>46</b> in an adjustable position, so as to calibrate the pressure of spring <b>48</b> extremely accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Second spring <b>49</b> is located between plate <b>44</b> and piston <b>7</b>. For which purpose, plate <b>44</b> has an underside recess <b>54</b> on which one end of spring <b>49</b> rests, and piston <b>7</b> has a smaller-diameter portion <b>56</b> forming a shoulder <b>57</b> on which rests the other end of spring <b>49</b>. In the top dead center position of piston <b>7</b>, the free end of portion <b>56</b> is obviously positioned a given minimum distance from the bottom surface of plate <b>44</b>, so that the pressure of spring <b>49</b> on plate <b>44</b> therefore decreases sinusoidally during the intake stroke of piston <b>7</b>, and increases sinusoidally during the compression stroke of piston <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hole <b>28</b> of delivery conduit <b>16</b> comes out inside cylinder <b>6</b> at portion <b>56</b> of piston <b>7</b>, when the piston is in the top dead center position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Inlet conduit <b>14</b> of intake valve <b>9</b> comprises a radial hole <b>58</b> of cylinder <b>6</b>, which comes out inside the corresponding cylindrical opening <b>32</b> of cylinder <b>6</b> at valve body <b>36</b>. For which purpose, the lateral surface of valve body <b>36</b> has a recess <b>59</b> which, together with the lateral wall and shoulder <b>34</b> of opening <b>32</b>, forms an annular channel <b>60</b>. Inlet conduit <b>14</b> also comprises a radial hole <b>61</b> of valve body <b>36</b>, which comes out inside an annular groove <b>62</b> of opening <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The pressure exerted by first spring <b>48</b> is less than that of second spring <b>49</b>, and is preferably selected as low as possible to reduce its elastic constant.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For intake valve <b>9</b> to open when the fuel pressure in cylinder <b>6</b> falls below a value ranging between 1.3 and 5 bars, the total pressure on plate <b>44</b> is obtained by adding the pressures of first spring <b>48</b> and second spring <b>49</b> with a ratio ranging between 1.5 and 6. More specifically, with a roughly 2.3-bar total pressure value, first spring <b>48</b> may be designed to ensure a roughly 1.8-bar constant pressure on plate <b>44</b>, and second spring <b>49</b> may be designed to vary in pressure so as to ensure a 0.5-bar intake opening pressure on plate <b>44</b>. Tests have shown that, with the above pressure values of springs <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, spring <b>48</b> can be calibrated between 1 and 5 bars, with a tolerance of ±0.05 bar.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Accordingly, the ratio of the elastic constant of first spring <b>48</b> to that of second spring <b>49</b> may range between 1 and 20. Advantageously, the elastic constant of the first spring may be less than 1 N/mm, e.g. between 0.1 N/mm and 0.8 N/mm, and that of second spring <b>49</b> may be around 0.07 N/mm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Operation of pump <b>5</b> and intake valve <b>9</b> is obvious, and therefore requires no further explanation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each curve A, B and C shows, as a function of the rotation angle of shaft <b>10</b>, the opening pressure required by plate <b>44</b> for variable spring <b>49</b> of corresponding intake valve <b>9</b> for pump <b>5</b>; line D shows the nominal constant opening pressure required for constant spring <b>48</b>; and the maximum and minimum pressure differences of the three variable springs <b>49</b> depend on various factors, and must fall within the range indicated by lines E and F.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, curve G shows the opening pressure required by plate <b>44</b> as a function of the rotation angle of shaft <b>10</b>, when plate <b>44</b> is kept closed by two springs <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>; and line H shows the constant opening pressure of known valve <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Curve M, on the other hand, shows the variable pressure of spring g in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, i.e. the pressure required by the plate of known valve <b>2</b>. As can be seen, much less force is required of spring <b>49</b> than spring g in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, so that spring <b>49</b> can be made of smaller-diameter music wire, thus greatly reducing its size and elastic constant. The lower elastic constant of spring <b>49</b> reduces the mean opening pressure of valve <b>9</b>, thus increasing fuel intake into the cylinder and improving the efficiency of pump <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The advantages of the intake valve according to the invention, as compared with those of known pumps, will be clear from the foregoing description. In particular, neither spring <b>48</b> nor spring <b>49</b> generates the entire opening pressure of valve <b>9</b>, so that both have a lower elastic constant; constant spring <b>48</b> can be calibrated easily to meet the requirements of different applications; variable spring <b>49</b> may have a low elastic constant, thus reducing its size about portion <b>56</b> of piston <b>7</b>; the cylindrical shape of valve body <b>36</b> and the radial location of hole <b>58</b> do not overly weaken valve body <b>36</b>, thus reducing the risk of in-service cracking; and, finally, to fit valve <b>9</b> to respective cylinder <b>6</b>, the valve <b>9</b> assembly, defined by valve body <b>36</b>, shutter <b>43</b>, spring <b>48</b> and sleeve <b>53</b>, can be preassembled easily.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Clearly, changes may be made to the intake valve as described herein without, however, departing from the scope of the accompanying claims. For example, valve body <b>36</b> may have more than one radial hole <b>58</b>; the ratios between the elastic constants of springs <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, or the respective absolute values, may be different; and variable-pressure spring <b>49</b> may be designed to only vary in pressure during part of the relative piston stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Given the possibility of calibrating spring <b>48</b>, the same springs <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> can be used for mass producing intake valves <b>9</b> for different pump <b>5</b> models, thus reducing manufacturing cost; pump <b>5</b> may have a different number of cylinders <b>6</b>, which may be activated by independent actuators; and finally, each piston <b>7</b> may be activated positively at both strokes, e.g. by a connecting rod and crank mechanism.</p>
