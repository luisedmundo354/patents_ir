<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a semiconductor device having a dual isolation structure, and a method of fabricating the same, an epitaxial layer is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor device. A device region including the semiconductor device and the epitaxial layer is defined by a device isolation layer. The device isolation layer has a dual structure that includes a diffused isolation layer and a trench isolation layer. The diffused isolation layer is formed in the semiconductor substrate, and surrounds the base and the bottom sidewall of the device region, and the trench isolation layer surrounds the upper sidewall of the device region by vertically penetrating the epitaxial layer. The method of fabricating a semiconductor device is performed by forming a diffused bottom isolation layer at a predetermined region in the semiconductor substrate, and forming a trench exposed at a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate by patterning the epitaxial layer formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate. A diffused isolation wall is formed to be connected to the diffused bottom isolation layer under the trench. A trench isolation structure is formed to be connected to the diffused isolation wall by filling an insulating layer inside the trench.</p>

No. 6,927,452, which relies for priority upon Korean Patent Application No. 02-11623, filed on Mar. 5, 2002, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device having a dual isolation structure and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the semiconductor arts, there continues to be an ever-increasing demand for a high level of power transmission, for high speed switching ability during power conversion, and for various applications of power IC products in power control systems. Power IC products are widely used in automotive electronic componentry as well as in hard disk drive (HDD) and in video tape recording (VTR) systems. Double-diffused MOS transistors (DMOS Tr) offer the combination of high-current processing ability and low on-resistance per surface area; therefore DMOS transistors are an important element of the power IC in the processing of high voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the DMOS device is operated at high voltage, a device isolation layer having a high breakdown voltage is required between adjacent DMOS devices or between the DMOS device and other control circuits. Conventionally, junction isolation technology using an impurity-diffused layer for device isolation was employed for this purpose. However, in the case of junction isolation technology, the junction isolation structure requires a wide surface area in order to form deep device isolation structures, as the structure of the DMOS device requires thick epitaxial layers. In order to overcome this limitation, there has been introduced a method of forming a trench device isolation structure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,822, entitled “Method for making all complementary BICDMOS devices” introduces a method of isolating devices by forming a DMOS device on a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a conventional DMOS device having a device isolation structure employing the junction isolation technology.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a DMOS device of the junction isolation structure includes a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, a first conductivity type buried layer <b>6</b> placed on a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>, and a second conductivity type buried layer <b>2</b> slightly spaced apart from the first conductivity type buried layer <b>6</b> and surrounding the buried layer <b>6</b>. A first conductivity type epitaxial layer <b>8</b> is deposited on the entire surface of the first conductivity type layer <b>6</b>, the second conductivity type layer <b>2</b>, and the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. The epitaxial layer <b>8</b> is more lightly doped than the first conductivity type buried layer <b>6</b>. A second conductivity type junction isolation layer <b>4</b> is connected to the second conductivity type buried layer <b>2</b> while surrounding a predetermined region of the epitaxial layer <b>8</b>. The junction isolation layer <b>4</b> and the second conductivity type buried layer <b>2</b> form a device isolation structure <b>5</b> of the DMOS device. The device isolation structure <b>5</b> defines the device region of the DMOS device. A field oxide layer <b>16</b> is placed in a predetermined region of the device region surrounded by the device isolation structure <b>5</b> to define a first active area and a second active area. The field oxide layer <b>16</b> surrounds the first active area spaced apart from the device isolation structure <b>5</b>. A gate electrode <b>14</b> is placed on the first active area with a gate insulating layer <b>22</b> interposed there between. A source region is formed in the first active area adjacent to the gate electrode <b>14</b>, and a drain region is formed in the second active area. The source region <b>26</b> includes a first conductivity type diffused layer <b>18</b> formed on the surface of the first active area adjacent to the gate electrode <b>14</b>, a second conductivity type diffused layer <b>20</b> spaced apart from the gate electrode <b>14</b> adjacent to the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>18</b>, and a second conductivity type body region <b>26</b> surrounding the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>18</b> and the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>20</b>. The drain region includes a sink region <b>10</b> vertically penetrating the epitaxial layer <b>8</b> and connected to the first conductivity type buried layer <b>6</b>, and a heavy doped region <b>12</b> formed on the surface of the second active area on the sink region <b>10</b>. A field oxide layer <b>15</b> is further formed on the junction isolation layer <b>4</b> for device isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Normally, the breakdown voltage of the DMOS device is proportional to the thickness of the epitaxial layer <b>8</b>. That is, the epitaxial layer <b>8</b> is typically formed to have a thickness of over 10 μm, in order to provide a high breakdown voltage in the DMOS device. Therefore, when forming the second conductivity type junction isolation layer <b>4</b> through the thick epitaxial layer <b>8</b>, and considering the diffusion of the impurity to form the second conductivity type junction isolation layer <b>4</b>, the junction isolation layer and the drain region should be positioned a suitable distance apart. As a result, the area size occupied by the device isolation structure in the DMOS device employing the junction isolation technology is over 25% of the entire device region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of a DMOS device having a trench device isolation structure that was introduced in order to overcome the above-mentioned limitations in the traditional junction isolation structures.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as in the junction isolation structures described above, a DMOS device having a trench device isolation structure includes a first conductivity type buried layer <b>36</b> formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>, an epitaxial layer <b>38</b> covering the buried layer <b>36</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>, a gate electrode <b>34</b> formed on the epitaxial layer <b>38</b>, a source region and a drain region.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated hereinafter. Instead, the embodiments described herein are introduced in order to provide a complete understanding of the scope and spirit of the present invention.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic representation of a portion of the power IC having a DMOS device according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plane view of the DMOS device according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the power IC includes various devices that operate at high frequency and high voltages. As shown in the drawings, the power IC includes a MOS transistor (MOS Tr.), a bipolar transistor (Bipolar Tr.), a double diffused MOS transistor (DMOS Tr.), etc. Recently, the power IC primarily employs a vertical double diffused MOS (VDMOS) device having excellent performance characteristics in a relatively small chip area. Each device is isolated from neighboring devices by a device isolation structure having a high breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The DMOS device of the present invention includes a first conductivity type buried layer <b>54</b> formed on a predetermined region of a semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. A first conductivity type epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is formed over the buried layer <b>54</b> and the entire surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. The buried layer <b>54</b> is formed of an impurity diffused layer wherein phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) are diffused into the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> with a predetermined thickness. In addition, the buried layer <b>54</b> is formed to be diffused into the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> with predetermined thickness. The epitaxial layer <b>56</b> also has an n-type conductivity type impurity including phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb). The epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is more lightly doped than the buried layer <b>54</b>. A device isolation structure <b>90</b> is placed to penetrate the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> and a portion of the semiconductor substrate to define the device region of the DMOS device. The device isolation structure <b>90</b> includes a diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> formed at the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> and surrounding the lower side of the device region, and a trench isolation structure <b>64</b> formed at the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> and surrounding the upper sidewall of the device region. The diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> is formed to be an impurity diffused layer having a second conductivity type impurity that is diffused into the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. For example, the diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> is formed to be an impurity diffused layer including boron (B), boronfluoric (BF<sub>2</sub>), indium (In). The diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> includes a diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b>, and a diffused isolation wall <b>62</b>. The diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> is formed along the base of the device region, and the diffused isolation wall <b>62</b> surrounds the bottom sidewall of the device region and is connected to the diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b>. That is, the diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> operates to isolate the semiconductor substrate region of the device region from the surrounding semiconductor substrate. The diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> may extend horizontally down to a neighboring DMOS device or to the bottom of a device region on which a high voltage control circuit will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A field oxide layer <b>66</b> is placed on a predetermined region of the device region defined by the device isolation structure <b>90</b> to define a first active area a<b>1</b> and a second active area a<b>2</b>. The first active area a<b>1</b> is the region surrounded by the field oxide layer <b>66</b>, and the second active area a<b>2</b> is the region between the field oxide layer <b>66</b> and the device isolation structure <b>90</b>. The field oxide layer <b>66</b> is formed by using LOCOS technology.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A gate electrode <b>74</b> is placed on the first active area a<b>1</b>. A gate insulating layer <b>72</b> is interposed between the gate electrode <b>74</b> and the first active area a<b>1</b>. The gate electrode <b>74</b> has an overlapped region with the field oxide layer <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the gate electrode <b>74</b> may have a mesh-shaped structure in a typical DMOS device. That is, the gate electrode <b>74</b> has a plurality of openings to expose the first active area a<b>1</b>. A source region is formed in the first active area a<b>1</b> exposed on the opening, and a drain region is formed in the second active area a<b>2</b>. The source region includes the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the second conductivity type body region <b>76</b>. The first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> is formed in the first active area a<b>1</b> adjacent to the gate electrode <b>74</b>. The second conductivity type body region <b>76</b> is more deeply diffused than the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b>, surrounding the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b>, and has an overlapped region with the gate electrode <b>74</b>. That is, the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> is formed on the surface of the second conductivity type body region <b>76</b>. The source region may further include the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> on the surface of the second conductivity type body region <b>76</b> to prevent the parasitic bipolar transistor from turning on in the DMOS device. For example, the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> is formed on the peripheral region of the first active area a<b>1</b> exposed on the opening to have a loop structure, and the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> is formed in the region surrounded by the loop structure. The second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> is more heavily doped than the body region <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The field oxide layer <b>66</b> is formed on the device region spaced apart from the device isolation structure <b>90</b>. The field oxide layer <b>66</b> is loop-shaped and defines the first active area a<b>1</b> in the region surrounded by the field oxide layer <b>66</b>, and defines the second active area a<b>2</b> between the field oxide layer <b>66</b> and the device isolation structure <b>90</b>. The drain region is formed in the second active area a<b>2</b>, and includes a first conductivity type sink region <b>70</b> which is formed in the second active area a<b>2</b> and vertically connected with the buried layer <b>54</b>, and a heavily doped region <b>82</b> formed on the surface of the second active area a<b>2</b> having the sink region <b>70</b> formed thereon. The drain region and the source region are connected to a drain electrode (DC) and a source electrode (SC) respectively. Since the source electrode (SC) is commonly connected to the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b>, the parasitic bipolar transistor is restricted to turn on while the DMOS is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the device isolation structure of the present invention has a dual structure of a trench device isolation structure formed on the diffused isolation layer and the epitaxial layer on the semiconductor substrate. For this reason, formation of the trench device isolation structure of the present invention is relatively simple, and the area occupied by the device isolation structure can be reduced as compared with the junction isolation structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 13</figref> are sectional views that illustrate a process of fabricating a DMOS device according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a second conductivity type impurity is implanted into a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> to form the diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b>. The diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> can be formed by implanting a p-type impurity such as boron (B), boronfluoric (BF<sub>2</sub>), indium (In) into the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. For example, the boron may be implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> with a flux density of 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Then, a first conductivity type impurity is implanted to the surface of the semiconductor substrate on the diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> to form a first conductivity type buried layer <b>54</b>. The buried layer <b>54</b> can be formed by implanting an n-type impurity such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) into a predetermined region of the upper side of the diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> with a high flux density.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a first conductivity type epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is grown on the buried layer <b>54</b> and the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. The epitaxial layer <b>56</b> can be formed with a thickness of about 10 μm. While the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is grown, the first conductivity type buried layer <b>54</b> is externally diffused down to the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the buried layer <b>54</b> may have a thickness of about 3 μm to 10 μm. Adding to this, the buried layer <b>54</b> can be diffused by using a thermal process on the substrate before or after forming the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>. The epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is preferably doped with a lower density than the buried layer <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a hard mask pattern <b>58</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>, and the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> is etched by using the hard mask pattern <b>58</b> as an etch mask so as to form a trench <b>60</b> to expose a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. The trench <b>60</b> is formed as a loop shape surrounding a predetermined region of the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>. Then, a second conductivity type impurity is implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> which is exposed at the bottom of the trench <b>60</b> by using the hard mask pattern <b>58</b> as an ion implantation mask. As a result, a diffused isolation wall <b>62</b> is formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. The diffused isolation wall <b>62</b> is connected to the diffused bottom isolation layer <b>52</b> so as to form a diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> to isolate a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b> from its surrounding semiconductor substrate. That is, the diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> surrounds the sidewall and the base of a predetermined region of the semiconductor substrate <b>50</b>. The hard mask pattern <b>58</b> is preferably formed of a silicon nitride layer. A buffer oxide layer may be further formed between the hard mask pattern <b>58</b> and the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an insulating layer is formed on the upper side of the epitaxial layer to fill the trench, and a trench isolation structure <b>64</b> is formed inside the trench by grinding the insulating layer by a chemical and mechanical grinding process. Then, the hard mask pattern <b>58</b> is removed to expose the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>. The trench isolation structure is formed by using a typical shallow trench isolation technology. The insulating layer selected to fill the inside of the trench is preferably one that has excellent step coverage, and for example, PEOX (plasma enhanced oxide), or HDP oxide layer (high density plasma oxide) can be used. The device isolation structure <b>90</b> includes the diffused isolation layer <b>63</b> and the trench isolation structure <b>64</b>. The region surrounded by the device isolation structure <b>90</b> is a device region.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a field oxide layer <b>66</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> of the device region so as to define the first active area a<b>1</b> and the second active area a<b>2</b>. The field oxide layer <b>66</b> is formed as a loop shape spaced apart from the device isolation structure <b>90</b>. The region surrounded by the field oxide layer <b>66</b> is the first active area a<b>1</b>, and the region between the field oxide layer <b>66</b> and the device isolation structure <b>90</b> is the second active area a<b>2</b>. The field oxide layer can be formed by using a typical LOCOS process. A first conductivity type impurity is implanted into the second active area a<b>2</b> so as to form a sink region <b>70</b> connected to the buried layer <b>54</b>. The sink region <b>70</b> may be formed after or before forming the field oxide layer <b>66</b>. In case of forming the sink region <b>70</b> before forming the field oxide layer <b>66</b>, a thermal oxidation process to form the field oxide layer <b>66</b> may be performed, and during the process, the resistance of the sink region <b>70</b> can be reduced. However, in case of forming the sink region <b>70</b> after forming the field oxide layer <b>66</b>, the thermal process is preferably performed on the substrate having the sink region after forming the sink region <b>70</b> to reduce the resistance of the sink region <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sink region <b>70</b> can be formed by implanting an n-type impurity into the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>. That is, phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) can be implanted into the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> so as to form the sink region <b>70</b>. It is preferable to dope the sink region <b>70</b> with a higher density than the epitaxial layer. For example, the implantation can be performed with 100 KeV to 500 KeV of energy and 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 5×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>of flux density into the epitaxial layer <b>56</b> to form the sink region <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a gate pattern <b>74</b> is formed on the first active area. The gate pattern <b>74</b> may have an overlapped region with the upper side of the field oxide layer <b>66</b>. In addition, the gate pattern <b>74</b> may be formed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as a mesh-shaped structure having a plurality of openings exposed at predetermined regions of the first active area a<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the DMOS device has a plurality of source cells so as to increase the power drive characteristic. A gate insulating layer <b>72</b> is interposed between the gate electrode <b>74</b> and the first active area a<b>1</b>. Sequentially, a second conductivity type impurity is implanted into the first active area a<b>1</b> by using the photoresist pattern (not shown) to expose the first active area a<b>1</b>, and the gate electrode <b>74</b> as an ion implantation mask. Then, a thermal process is performed on the substrate on which the impurity is implanted so as to form a second conductivity type body region <b>76</b> in the first active area a<b>1</b> exposed at the opening. The body region <b>76</b> is diffused down to the gate electrode <b>74</b> and has an overlapped region with the lower side of the gate electrode <b>74</b>. The body region <b>76</b> may be formed by implanting a p-type impurity such as boron (B), boronfluoric (BF<sub>2</sub>), indium (In), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a first conductivity type impurity is implanted into the surface of the first active area a<b>1</b> and the second active area a<b>2</b> exposed inside the opening formed on the gate pattern <b>74</b>. As a result, the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> is formed on the surface of the first active area a<b>1</b>, and the heavily doped first conductivity type region <b>82</b> is formed on the surface of the second active area a<b>2</b>. The first conductivity type diffused layer may be formed as a loop shape on the peripheral region of the opening adjacent to the gate electrode by using the photoresist pattern (not shown). The first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the heavy doped region <b>82</b> can be formed by implanting an n-type impurity such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb). At this point, it is preferable to dope the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the heavily doped diffused layer <b>82</b> with a higher density than the epitaxial layer <b>56</b>. In addition, the heavily doped diffused layer <b>82</b> is preferably doped with a higher density than the sink area <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A heavily doped second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> is preferably formed on the surface of the body region <b>76</b> to prevent the turning-on of the parasitic bipolar transistor during the operation of the DMOS device so as to connect the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> with a common electrode. For example, in case of forming the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> as a loop shape, a second conductivity type impurity is implanted on the region surrounded by the first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> so as to form the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b>.

The first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b> and the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b> can be formed on the surface of the body region <b>76</b> with various shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first conductivity type diffused layer <b>78</b>, the second conductivity type diffused layer <b>80</b>, and the second conductivity type body region <b>76</b> form the source region of the DMOS transistor.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Even though further drawings are not shown here, by using a typical method of fabricating a semiconductor device, the gate electrode, and the source electrode and the drain electrode which are connected to the source region and the drain region respectively can be formed. At this point, the source electrode can be commonly connected to the first conductivity type diffused layer and the second conductivity type diffused layer. As set forth before, the present invention provides a device isolation structure for a semiconductor device having excellent device isolation characteristics and reduced area size, by providing a dual device isolation structure. In this manner, the present invention addresses the limitations associated with the conventional semiconductor device having a junction device isolation structure, which requires a relatively large amount of area for the device isolation region due to the external diffusion. The present invention further provides a semiconductor device having a deep device isolation structure by solving the difficulties in the conventional device isolation structure in forming a trench isolation structure at a depth of over 15 μm. As a result, the device isolation ability of the semiconductor device operated at high frequency and high voltage can be greatly improved, while reducing the area occupied by the isolation structure.</p>
