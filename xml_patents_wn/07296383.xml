<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/456,439, filed Jun. 6, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/392,320, filed Jun. 27, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,968,656.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a decorative building shutter for mounting on a wall surface. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved plastic batten shutter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Decorative building panels, such as shutters, are widely used in the building industry to add character to a house or other type of building structure. Additionally, decorative building panels are frequently installed on existing structures to change the appearance of the structure. A popular type of building panel that is used is a window shutter. These shutters, which are typically not functional, present a decorative facade that gives the appearance of being a functional shutter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One popular style of shutter is commonly referred to as a batten shutter. The batten shutter includes a plurality of batten slats or boards arranged vertically in a row. At least one, and usually two, cross slats overlay each of the batten slats. The cross slats adjoin the batten slats forming the batten shutter assembly. A simulated plastic batten shutter commonly includes slats having a decorative surface and flanges projecting rearward from the surface creating a hollow slat that gives the appearance of being a complete wooden slat. While the plastic materials reduce the cost of producing the batten shutter, connecting the slats together is a labor intensive and costly operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One such example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,184,300 to Deschamps. Deschamps discloses a batten shutter having plastic batten slats with decorative surface and side flanges. Each batten slat is affixed to a cross slat with pin. Utilizing pins to connect the batten slats to the cross slats adds cost and assembly time due to the increased number of parts required for assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a batten shutter that is simple to produce and yet presents the appearance of being assembled from real wood.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention discloses a decorative shutter assembly having a plurality of batten slats arranged in a row and connected together by at least one cross slat. Each batten slat presents a batten decorative surface having side batten flanges projecting rearward. Each cross slat overlays the batten slats and presents a decorative cross surface with side cross flanges projecting rearward. Each cross slat includes at least one mating member affixed behind the cross-decorative surface with a mating wall affixed to each of the batten decorative surfaces. The slats are affixed to the mating member by sonic welding or heat welding. Each of the slats includes end plugs at each end to present a finished appearance of being a complete wooden board.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventive batten shutter provides a simple design that is easily produced and presents the appearance of being made from wooden boards. The mating member maximizes the amount of extrusion processing that can be utilized enabling a single extruder to be used for both the cross slats and the batten slats by providing a mating surface to the batten slats. Further, hiding the mating surface behind the cross slat provides the ability to form an attachment point from either a sonic weld or a heat weld.</p>

In one embodiment, the assembly <b>10</b> will include one less mating member <b>18</b> than the number of batten slats <b>14</b>. Thus, each mating member <b>18</b> will straddle adjacent batten slats <b>14</b> as is best represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each mating member <b>18</b> is affixed to the cross slat <b>16</b> and to the batten slats <b>14</b> by the plurality of apertures or mating attachment points <b>52</b>. The attachment points <b>52</b> may comprise sonic welds. Alternatively, the attachment points <b>52</b> comprise heat welds. Generally, sonic welds will be utilized when making an attachment point <b>52</b> to a visible decorative surface <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be noted that the decorative shutter assembly may have any number of batten slats <b>14</b>, e.g., four. Each cross slat <b>16</b> includes the mating member <b>18</b> and the first front plane <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The batten slats <b>14</b> include the batten decorative surface <b>20</b>. Each batten slat <b>14</b> also includes two side flanges <b>36</b> and two end flanges <b>40</b>. The two side flanges <b>36</b> and the two end flanges <b>40</b> define an batten interior volume on an opposite side of the batten decorative surface <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the batten slats <b>14</b> are manufactured in predetermined lengths, e.g., 60 inches. In order to assembly a shutter assembly <b>10</b> having an overall length other than 60 inches, one or more batten slats <b>14</b> may be cut such that their combines length equals the desired length. As discussed below, the end flange(s) <b>40</b> of the cross slat(s) <b>16</b> may be used to hide the seam <b>28</b> or joint between the two batten slats <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each mating member <b>18</b> includes a plurality of regularly repeating reinforced structural sections <b>46</b>. The number of sections <b>46</b> correspond directly to the number of batten slats <b>14</b> in the assembled shutter assembly <b>10</b>. For example, the mating member <b>18</b> includes three sections <b>46</b> corresponding to the three slats <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Each mating member <b>18</b> includes the regularly repeating reinforced structural sections <b>46</b> and the ribs <b>50</b> formed with and rising from the planar portion or back wall <b>48</b>. The sections <b>46</b> are formed by mating member side flanges <b>49</b>, mating member end flanges <b>51</b>, plurality of ribs <b>50</b> and the back wall <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The back wall <b>48</b> includes at least one large aperture <b>52</b>. The back wall <b>48</b> also includes at least two smaller apertures <b>53</b> in each section <b>46</b>. The large aperture <b>52</b> is used to assist in separating the first front plane or top cover <b>20</b> and the mating member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To assemble the shutter assembly <b>10</b>, the mating members <b>18</b> are affixed to the batten slats <b>14</b> by a suitable process, such as sonic welding, heat welds, or by using a suitable fastener such as a clip, a screw, or the like. The smaller apertures <b>53</b> may be formed during the fastening process.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The top cover <b>30</b> of the cross slat <b>16</b> includes the cross decorative surface <b>30</b>, two side flanges <b>36</b> and two end flanges <b>40</b>. The two side flanges <b>36</b> and the two end flanges <b>40</b> define a cross batten interior volume.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the cross slats <b>16</b> includes the locking mechanism <b>38</b> which is used to removably lock the top cover <b>20</b> to its corresponding mating member <b>18</b> when the decorative shutter assembly <b>10</b> is assembled The top cover <b>20</b> and the corresponding mating member <b>18</b> may also be assembled in a non-locking position pre-assembly, e.g., during shipping (see below).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The locking mechanism <b>38</b> includes the first notch <b>42</b> and second notch <b>44</b> located on an interior surface of each side flanges <b>36</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the notches <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are located on each side flange <b>36</b>. Each notch <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> is directly across from the corresponding locking mechanism or tab <b>38</b> on the inner surface of the opposing side flange <b>36</b>. Each tab <b>38</b> is offset from the end flange <b>40</b> by a predetermined distance. For example, the tabs <b>38</b> on the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6B</figref> are offset from the end flange <b>40</b> by a distance of “X”. The tabs <b>38</b> in the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6B</figref> are offset from the end flange <b>40</b> by a distance if “Y”. X and Y are not equal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each mating member <b>18</b> includes the second notch <b>44</b> corresponding to each tab <b>38</b>. Each notch <b>44</b> includes a channel portion <b>60</b> and a locking portion <b>62</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). The locking portions <b>62</b> are adjacent the corresponding channel portion <b>60</b>. The locking portions <b>62</b> are offset from a respective mating member end flange <b>40</b> by a distance of X′, Y′. X′and Y′ are not equal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, the top cover <b>30</b> of each cross slat <b>16</b> may be assembled with the mating member <b>18</b> in either a locking position or a slidably removable position. In the illustrated embodiment, the locking position is defined when one of the side flanges <b>36</b> is oriented with a predetermined one of the mating member side flanges <b>49</b>. The slidably removable position is defined when the top cover <b>20</b> is assembled 180 degrees from the locking position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the top cover <b>30</b> and the mating member <b>18</b> are assembled in the slidably removable or non-locking position, each tab <b>38</b> is maintained within a respective channel portion <b>60</b>. Thus, the top cover <b>20</b> is able to slide from on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the top cover <b>32</b> and the mating member <b>18</b>′ are assembled in the locked position, each tab <b>38</b> is aligned with a corresponding locking portion <b>60</b>. When fully assembled each tab <b>38</b> is maintained in position by the corresponding locking portion <b>60</b>, and thus, the top cover <b>20</b> and the mating member <b>18</b> are “locked”. It should be noted that although the top cover <b>20</b> and the mating member <b>18</b> are locked, the top cover <b>20</b> may be removed from the mating member <b>18</b> by flexing the side flanges <b>36</b> such that the tabs <b>38</b> are disengaged from the locking portions <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an alternative embodiment, a cross slat <b>14</b> includes a top cover <b>20</b> and a mating member <b>18</b>′ for use in a shutter assembly having four batten slats or boards.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the shutter assembly <b>10</b> length must be composed of portions of one or more batten slats <b>14</b>, the seam is hidden by the cross slat <b>16</b>. Furthermore, the cross slat end flanges extend past the side flanges <b>36</b> to cover the seam <b>28</b> in the side flanges <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology that has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
