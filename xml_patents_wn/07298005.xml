<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Applications P2005-203318 filed on Jul. 12, 2005 and P2006-17989 filed on Jan. 26, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory and a fabrication method for the same. More specifically, it relates to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory including a word line electrode interconnect layer pattern for a memory cell array and a fabrication method for the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electrically data-erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) is well-known as a nonvolatile semiconductor memory. The EEPROM, in particular, a NAND EEPROM includes a memory cell array comprising memory cells disposed on respective intersections of horizontal word lines and vertical bit lines. Typically, a memory cell is configured by, for example, a MOS transistor having a stacked gate structure of a floating gate and a control gate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A NAND flash memory structure is provided by connecting multiple memory cell transistors in series, thereby creating a NAND string, and disposing select transistors on both sides of the NAND string. In addition, a memory cell array is configured by arranging element isolating regions in parallel with a memory cell element active area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to ensure that a NAND flash memory cell array provides a lithographic margin for regions that are hard to provide periodicity of a word line end pattern, the line width in those regions is extended to be longer than line widths in the other regions, and thereby making the width of the spacing less than the minimum rule. However, recently, since the original minimum line width is narrow, use of such smaller pattern than the minimum line width is impossible. As a result, inter-interconnect short-circuits may easily occur.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A semiconductor device including a fine line and space pattern with narrower inter-line spacing than the line width has been disclosed. The device has wider adjacent inter-line spacing at the line end pattern than at the central pattern, thereby preventing inter-line short-circuits from occurring in the vicinity of line ends due to an optical intensity distribution produced by lithography process (See Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 7-183301).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present invention inheres in a nonvolatile semiconductor memory. The memory includes a first and a second active area configured to extend in the column direction thereof in parallel; an element isolating region configured to electrically separate the first and the second active area; a plurality of word lines configured to extend in the row direction; and a plurality of memory cell transistors configured to be disposed on intersections between the respective main parts of the plurality of word lines and the second active area. Each memory cell transistor comprises a gate insulating film, a floating gate electrode, an inter-gate insulating film, and a control gate electrode; a short-circuit region configured to electrically short circuit the ends of the plurality of word lines; and a trench configured to separate the ends from the main parts of the plurality of word lines.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the present invention inheres in a fabrication method for a nonvolatile semiconductor memory. The method includes providing a first and a second active area configured to extend in parallel in the column direction; electrically separate the first and the second active area by an element isolation region; extending a plurality of word lines in the row direction; and disposing a plurality of memory cell transistors on intersections between respective main parts of the plurality of word lines and an active area. Each memory cell transistor comprises a gate insulating film, a floating gate electrode, an inter-gate insulating film, and a control gate electrode, so as to provide a memory cell array; a short-circuit region configured to electrically short circuit the ends of the plurality of word lines; and a trench configured to separate the ends from the main parts of the plurality of word lines. The fabrication method includes fabricating a stacked layer structure of a nitride film, a metallic salicide film, the control gate electrode, the inter-gate insulating film, and the floating gate electrode, and short circuiting the ends of the plurality of word lines in the short-circuit region; coating a resist across the entire surface of an element region on a semiconductor substrate, and patterning the trench; etching the nitride film, the metallic salicide film, and the control gate electrode using the resist as a mask, and forming an aperture on the trench; and removing the resist.</p>
