<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Applicant hereby claims priority based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/347,803 filed Jan. 10, 2002, entitled “Device for Adjusting Lid Cover for Oxygen Mask Dispensing Container.”</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Oxygen mask dispensing containers are mounted such that the masks can be displayed readily to aircraft passengers in an emergency. Accordingly, the mask containers are generally recessed into the ceiling over the passenger's seat, into the wall along side the passenger, or into the back of the seat in front of the passenger. The containers are typically designed so that the covers can be released remotely in the event of an aircraft decompression. This release may be electrical through solenoids or pneumatic by way of charging the oxygen distribution system from a central location in the aircraft. When released the covers generally fall away from the boxes, allowing the masks to fall free in front of the passengers or to be displayed within easy reach of the passengers. Because the oxygen masks are only displayed in an emergency, aircraft manufacturers and operators want this emergency equipment to be stowed such that it does not call attention to itself until actually required during an emergency. Therefore interior designers want the oxygen mask containers to blend as seamlessly as possible within the ceiling panel or wall panel or seat back where the container is installed. However, in an emergency, the cover has to reliably fall away, exposing the oxygen masks for use. Also, in an aircraft there is almost constant vibration and it is very hard to align doors and covers precisely and to keep them in precise alignment through the vibration of countless landings and takeoffs. Accordingly, there is a need for a device for aligning the cover of an oxygen mask dispensing container.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention meets the above-described need by providing an easy way to make the cover blend almost seamlessly with the ceiling panel, wall, or seat back panel where the oxygen mask container is installed. The present invention provides a self adjusting lid assembly for an oxygen mask dispensing container body. The lid assembly includes a lid having at least one guide disposed thereon. A plate capable of moving relative to the lid is disposed along the at least one guide. The plate is capable of being attached to the container body and is biased toward the lid.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the purposes of this specification, the term “spring” is defined as any elastic body or device that recovers or substantially recovers its original shape when released after being distorted. In the examples shown, a coil spring is disclosed. However, it will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that leaf springs or any other body or device fitting the above definition would also be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an oxygen mask dispensing container <b>10</b> is mounted within an oxygen deployment area (not shown) of an aircraft typically located above the passenger seats in the ceiling of the aircraft. The container <b>10</b> may also be mounted in other locations in the interior of aircraft. The container <b>10</b> is typically rectangular. An openable lid assembly <b>11</b> has an outermost lid cover <b>58</b> designed to mate with the opening presented in the interior lining of the aircraft. It is important that the lid cover <b>58</b> of the container <b>10</b> present a seamless appearance with the interior lining of the aircraft for aesthetic reasons. Also, if the container <b>10</b> does not fit properly, the lid cover <b>58</b> may hang up on the edge of the opening in the interior lining and thereby interfere with the proper functioning of the mask deployment system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lid cover <b>58</b> is generally rectangular with rounded corners. A pair of hinges <b>16</b> extend from a plate <b>19</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that attaches the lid assembly <b>11</b> to the body <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the container <b>10</b> as described herein. A pair of breathing gas ports <b>31</b>, <b>34</b> extend from opposite sides of the container <b>10</b> and are disposed such that they are capable of engaging with the breathing gas delivery system of the aircraft. In use in its stowed condition, the edges of lid cover <b>58</b> mate with the opening in the interior lining of the aircraft and hinges <b>16</b> and ports <b>31</b>, <b>34</b> are not visible from inside the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the lid assembly <b>11</b> comprises the plate <b>19</b> and the lid <b>13</b>. A first portion of the lid <b>13</b> is a lid cover <b>58</b> designed to mate seamlessly with the opening in the interior lining of an aircraft. Another portion of the lid <b>13</b> is a lid body <b>55</b> that mates with the opening in the container <b>10</b>. As described below, the lid body <b>55</b> and the lid cover <b>58</b> may be integrally formed or may be separate members that are attached together.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hinges <b>16</b> are separable type hinges that extend from the plate <b>19</b> and are disposed through a pair of openings <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> in the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b>. During opening when the plate <b>19</b> pivots about the hinges <b>16</b>, the hinges <b>16</b> slide out of the openings and the plate <b>19</b> separates completely from the body <b>28</b>. As described hereafter, a pair of lanyards <b>49</b> restrict the fall of the plate <b>19</b> away from the body <b>28</b>. The body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b> is typically attached inside the opening in the interior lining of the aircraft by means of L-shaped brackets <b>37</b> that are attached to the aircraft adjacent to the opening for container <b>10</b>. The container <b>10</b> has slots <b>40</b> that receive bolts <b>43</b> for attaching the container <b>10</b> to the L-shaped brackets <b>37</b>. The slots <b>40</b> may be elongated to provide for adjustment of the position of the container <b>10</b> inside the opening in the interior lining of the aircraft. The slots <b>40</b> are typically elongated such that the container <b>10</b> can be adjusted relative to how far the container <b>10</b> extends into the opening in the interior lining of the aircraft. As shown, the inner surface <b>14</b> of the interior lining may be provided with a recessed portion or ledge <b>15</b> for receiving the edge of the lid cover <b>58</b> so that the lid cover <b>58</b> and the surface of the interior lining are flush.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The hinges <b>16</b> on the plate <b>19</b> may be provided with an opening <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for receiving a lanyard <b>49</b> such that when the plate <b>19</b> is deployed it is held by the lanyard <b>49</b> and does not free fall where it could strike the passenger. The hinges <b>16</b> are located at the rear of the plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the lid assembly <b>11</b> includes a combination of elements that provide for the lid assembly <b>11</b> to be self adjusting with respect to its spatial orientation with the interior lining of the aircraft. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lid assembly <b>11</b> includes a stationary plate <b>19</b> that is typically formed out of metal that includes the hinges <b>16</b> at the back and includes a mounting arrangement <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for the studs <b>200</b> at the front as described below. The stationary plate <b>19</b> also has four openings <b>50</b> for bolts <b>53</b> that are fixedly attached to the lid body <b>55</b> of the lid <b>13</b>. The lid <b>13</b> has a lid body <b>55</b> and has a lid cover <b>58</b>. The lid body <b>55</b> and lid cover <b>58</b> are illustrated as separate elements attached to form lid <b>13</b>. However, the lid body <b>55</b> and lid cover <b>58</b> may be formed integrally as opposite sides of a unitary lid <b>13</b>. The lid cover <b>58</b> is typically thin and may be flat or slightly curved depending on the shape of the interior lining. The lid cover <b>58</b> may be covered with a textured material to match the color and texture of the interior lining of the aircraft. At the opposite end of the bolts <b>53</b> a washer <b>59</b> and a nut <b>62</b> may be provided. A spring <b>65</b> is disposed between the stationary plate <b>19</b> and the washer <b>59</b>. The washer <b>59</b> provides a stop to prevent the spring <b>65</b> from coming off of the end of the bolt <b>53</b>. If the opening in the lid body <b>55</b> is not threaded, a locking nut <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may also be used between the plate <b>19</b> and the lid body <b>55</b> to secure the bolt <b>53</b> to the lid body <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stationary plate <b>19</b> is the structure of the lid assembly <b>11</b> that attaches directly to the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b> as described in greater detail below. The position of the lid <b>13</b> relative to the plate <b>19</b> is automatically adjustable by means of the springs. Accordingly, the installation of the lid <b>13</b> is greatly simplified, and there are no manual adjustments between the plate <b>19</b> and the lid <b>13</b> required during installation of the container <b>10</b>. The springs <b>65</b> allow for the hinges <b>16</b> on the plate <b>19</b> to be inserted in the openings <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> in the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b> while the orientation between the plate <b>19</b> and the lid <b>13</b> adjusts such that the lid cover <b>58</b> rests on the ledge <b>15</b> provided around the opening in the aircraft interior lining. When the plate <b>19</b> is attached to the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b>, the force of the springs <b>65</b> pulls the lid cover <b>58</b> into proper position on the ledge <b>15</b> surrounding the opening in the interior lining of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to the adjustability resulting from the springs <b>65</b>, there is also some adjustment available due to the clearance between the openings <b>50</b> in the stationary plate <b>19</b> and the four bolts <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the arrangement of the bolts, washers and nuts, to form fixed posts extending from the lid body <b>55</b> may be varied. Other mechanical elements either specially manufactured or combined in other ways may also be used to form fixed posts extending from the lid body <b>55</b> through the stationary plate <b>19</b>. The number and size of the posts may be varied. The bolts <b>53</b> provide fixed posts that comprise a guide for directing the motion of the plate <b>19</b> relative to the lid <b>13</b>. Other mechanical elements may also be used to form guides. The guides may be disposed through the plate <b>19</b> as shown or along the edges of the plate <b>19</b>, as will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. The motion of the plate <b>19</b> relative to the lid <b>13</b> is primarily in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the lid <b>13</b>. However, the spaces around the posts provide for lateral and angular motion as well. Other types of guides may also provide for a range of motion for the plate <b>19</b> relative to the lid <b>13</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the biasing of the lid <b>13</b> relative to the stationary plate <b>19</b> may be done in many different ways as will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>, at the front of the plate <b>19</b> a pair of studs <b>200</b> are provided for engaging with a latch <b>203</b> disposed inside the container <b>10</b>. The latch <b>203</b> may be attached to the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b> by means of an L-shaped bracket <b>206</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a single stud <b>200</b> is shown engaged with a latch <b>203</b>. The studs <b>200</b> releasably attach to the latch <b>203</b> and are typically capable of being automatically released by operation of a solenoid or pneumatically actuated piston or lever that strikes the plate <b>19</b> with enough force to overcome the frictional engagement of the studs <b>200</b> with the corresponding latches <b>203</b>. Such lid release arrangements are known in the art, and are not per se, a part of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art, the plate <b>19</b> may be latched in numerous ways. For example, the plate <b>19</b> can be latched by applying a force to the outer cover <b>58</b>. The outer cover <b>58</b> may be capable of deflecting such that it engages with the frame <b>19</b> to cause the studs <b>200</b> to engage with corresponding latches <b>203</b>. As an alternative, a long narrow tool such as a screw driver or a tool as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be inserted between the floating lid <b>13</b> and the stationary plate <b>19</b> and pressed against the plate <b>19</b> to cause it to latch. In yet another alternative, a small aperture may be provided in the floating lid <b>13</b> to provide access to the plate <b>19</b> for a pin to push the plate <b>19</b> into engagement. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in order to close and latch the container <b>10</b>, a lid tool <b>209</b> may be used to slide between the floating lid <b>13</b> and the stationary plate <b>19</b>, and the plate <b>19</b> is pushed in the area of the plate <b>19</b> near the latches <b>203</b> until the studs <b>200</b> engage with latches <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an alternate embodiment of the invention is shown. Instead of a coil spring <b>65</b> disposed around the bolts <b>53</b>, the biasing member is a pair of coil springs <b>70</b> extending from hooks <b>73</b> on the plate <b>19</b> to hooks <b>76</b> on the lid body <b>55</b>. Another variation could include a single spring disposed all the way across the plate <b>19</b>. If bolts or posts are included to provide guidance between the plate <b>19</b> and the lid body <b>55</b>, the washers and nuts may not be necessary at the end of the bolts because the springs are attached directly to the lid body <b>55</b>. If the spring rate was sufficient, there may not be a risk of pulling the plate <b>19</b> completely off of the posts or bolts.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> an alternate embodiment of the invention is shown. In this embodiment, a coil spring <b>100</b> is disposed on the opposite (compared to the first embodiment) side of the plate <b>19</b> such that the position of the lid body <b>55</b> can be adjusted by tightening or loosening the nuts <b>103</b> on the end of the bolts <b>106</b>. The bolt <b>106</b> is disposed through an opening <b>109</b> in the lid body <b>55</b> and is fixedly attached by a nut <b>112</b>. The coil spring <b>100</b> is disposed between the lid body <b>55</b> and the stationary plate <b>19</b>. A nut <b>103</b> on the opposite side of the plate <b>19</b> provides for the adjustment of the position of the lid body <b>55</b> as described above. A washer <b>120</b> may also be provided between nut <b>103</b> and plate <b>19</b>. In use, the lid <b>13</b> is attached to the body <b>28</b> of the container <b>10</b>, by inserting hinges <b>16</b> into openings <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> in the body <b>28</b>, to test the fit between the lid cover <b>58</b> and the interior surface <b>14</b> of the airplane. If the alignment is not satisfactory, the lid <b>13</b> is removed and the nuts <b>103</b> are tightened or loosened to adjust the position of the lid cover <b>58</b> relative to the plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the invention has been described in connection with certain embodiments, it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular forms set forth, but, on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
