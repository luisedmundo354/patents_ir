<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a backwash strainer for filtering debris particles from a liquid.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Backwash strainers are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,103 to Kraeling, Jr. et al. (the “Kraeling '103 patent”) discloses such a strainer for filtering particulate debris from a liquid. The strainer includes a hollow body which houses a filtering element in the form of a cylindrical screen. A rotatable backwash arm is positioned within the cylindrical screen.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During a filtering operation, liquid with debris flows into the strainer through an inlet. After flowing upwardly into the interior of the cylindrical screen, the debris-laden liquid flows radially outward through openings in the screen. At least some of the debris collects on an inner surface of the screen. The filtered liquid exits the strainer through an outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over time, the screen becomes clogged with the collected debris, thereby necessitating the performance of a backwash operation to clear the screen. During the performance of such a backwashing operation, the backwash arm is rotated to continuously isolate portions of the screen and, through the creation of a pressure differential, causes a reverse flow of liquid so as to force the collected debris into the backwash arm for discharge from the strainer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although backwash strainers such as the one disclosed in the Kraeling '103 patent have been commercially successful, it is always desirable to reduce clogging of the screen, because such clogging has a detrimental affect on the overall efficiency of the strainer. More particularly, as the frequency and duration of clogging increases, the frequency and duration at which the backwash operation must be performed increases, thereby reducing the total volume of liquid filtered by the strainer over time. What is needed therefore is a backwash strainer having means for inhibiting clogging so to maximize strainer efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a mechanism for enhancing performance of a backwash operation by imparting a cyclonic flow to liquid with debris particles to be filtered. More particularly, a backwash strainer is provided with a generally cylindrical filter element that defines an inlet through which liquid to be filtered can flow. A backwash arm is rotatably mounted within the interior chamber of the filter element, and means, such as an impeller ring, is positioned proximal the inlet for imparting cyclonic flow to the liquid flowing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The impeller ring includes a rim abutting an end of the filter element which defines the inlet to the filter element. A hub is provided in the impeller ring to define a central open area that receives a shaft of the backwash arm. A plurality of vanes extend between the rim and the hub and in a direction away from the filter element. The impeller ring includes alignment means, such as a plurality of shoulders, for aligning the filter element with the impeller ring such that they are coaxially aligned.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a backwash strainer <b>10</b> includes the following basic elements: a housing base <b>12</b>, a housing bonnet <b>14</b>, an impeller ring <b>16</b>, a filter element assembly <b>18</b>, and a backwash arm <b>20</b>, all of which are aligned along a central longitudinal axis A<sub>C</sub>. Each of these elements shall be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the base <b>12</b> is secured to the bonnet <b>14</b> to form a two-piece housing that encapsulates the impeller ring <b>16</b>, the filter element assembly <b>18</b>, and the backwash arm <b>20</b>. The base <b>12</b>, which is preferably formed from a corrosion-resistant metal and/or alloy, includes an end wall <b>24</b> having a manual drain <b>22</b>. A cylindrical outer wall <b>26</b> extends from the end wall <b>24</b>, and a cylindrical partition <b>28</b> is concentric with the outer wall <b>26</b>. A generally annular chamber, referenced herein as an outflow chamber <b>30</b>, is formed between the outer wall <b>26</b> and the partition <b>28</b>. An annular flange <b>32</b> extends radially outward from an open end of the base <b>12</b>. The annular flange <b>32</b> has a plurality of holes (not designated), each of which is adapted to receive a bolt <b>45</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for securing the flange <b>32</b> to the bonnet <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The base <b>12</b> further includes a cylindrical drain pipe <b>34</b> that is concentric with the partition <b>28</b> and the outer wall <b>26</b>. A generally annular chamber, referenced herein as an inflow chamber <b>36</b>, is formed between the drain pipe <b>34</b> and the partition <b>28</b>. A passageway <b>38</b> extends through the drain pipe <b>34</b> to a backwash drain <b>40</b> formed in the end wall <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An inlet <b>42</b> and an outlet <b>44</b> are provided on opposite sides of the base <b>12</b>. The inlet <b>42</b> extends from the outer wall <b>26</b> to the inflow chamber <b>36</b> so as to allow liquid to flow into the inflow chamber <b>36</b> from an external source (e.g., from a body of water to be filtered). The outlet <b>44</b> extends from the outflow chamber <b>30</b> to the outer wall <b>26</b> so as to allow filtered liquid to flow from the backwash strainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bonnet <b>14</b> includes an end wall <b>46</b> opposite the end wall <b>24</b> of the base <b>12</b>. The end wall <b>46</b> has a central opening <b>48</b> and a pressure relief vent <b>49</b>. The bonnet <b>14</b> includes a cylindrical side wall <b>50</b> that extends from the end wall <b>46</b> so as to be axially aligned with the outer wall <b>26</b> of the base <b>12</b>. The interior of the bonnet <b>14</b> houses the filter element assembly <b>18</b>, the backwash arm <b>20</b>, and at least a portion of the impeller ring <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An annular flange <b>52</b> extends radially outward from an open end of the bonnet <b>14</b>. The annular flange <b>52</b> has a plurality of holes (not designated) adapted for alignment with the holes formed in the annular flange <b>32</b> of the base <b>12</b>. Bolts <b>45</b> extend through the aligned holes and cooperate with nuts <b>47</b> to attach the flanges <b>32</b> and <b>52</b> in an abutting and liquid tight manner. For the purpose of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one of the bolts <b>45</b> and one of the nuts <b>47</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two of the bolts <b>45</b> and two of the nuts <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The bonnet <b>14</b> further includes a plurality of tabs <b>54</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) extending radially inward from the side wall <b>50</b>. Each one of the tabs <b>54</b> has a threaded bore (not designated) for receiving a fastener <b>55</b>, which, as further discussed below, facilitates the attachment of the impeller ring <b>16</b> to the bonnet <b>14</b>. Although not limiting the scope of the present invention, the exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes three tabs <b>54</b>, each one being angularly displaced from its adjacent tabs <b>54</b> by about one hundred and twenty degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, the impeller ring <b>16</b>, which is formed from a rigid, corrosion-resistant metal and/or alloy, has an outer rim <b>56</b> that abuts the partition <b>28</b> of the base <b>12</b> and an inner hub <b>58</b> that abuts the drain pipe <b>34</b> of the base <b>12</b>. A gasket (not designated) forms a seal between the rim <b>56</b> and the partition <b>28</b>, and another gasket (not designated) forms a seal between the hub <b>58</b> and the drain pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A plurality of spokes <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>extend radially between the rim <b>56</b> and the hub <b>58</b>. Openings <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>are formed between the spokes <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>by a plurality of curved vanes <b>64</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>, each of which depends at an angle from a corresponding one of the spokes <b>60</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>. The vanes <b>64</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>extend through the openings <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>and into the inflow chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The hub <b>58</b> of the impeller ring <b>16</b> defines a central open area <b>66</b> that is aligned with the central longitudinal axis A<sub>C </sub>and the passageway <b>38</b>. An annular lip, referenced herein as a seat <b>68</b>, extends radially inward from the hub <b>58</b> at a side of the impeller ring <b>16</b> proximal the drain pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The impeller ring <b>16</b> also has a plurality of flanges <b>70</b> spaced apart about the rim <b>56</b> and extending radially outward therefrom. Each of the flanges <b>70</b> has a hole <b>70</b>′ sized and dimensioned so as to receive a corresponding fastener <b>55</b> (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The fasteners <b>55</b> are threadedly received in the tabs <b>54</b> to secure the impeller ring <b>16</b> to the bonnet <b>14</b>. Shoulders <b>72</b> are formed where the flanges <b>70</b> merge with the rim <b>56</b> of the impeller ring <b>16</b>. The shoulders <b>72</b> function as an alignment means for properly positioning the filter element assembly <b>18</b> relative to the central longitudinal axis A<sub>C</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A, the filter element assembly <b>18</b> includes an outer filter <b>74</b> and an inner filter <b>76</b>. One end <b>78</b> of the filter element assembly <b>18</b> abuts the rim <b>56</b> of the impeller ring <b>16</b> to define an inlet through which fluid to be filtered may flow. An opposite end <b>80</b> of the filter element assembly <b>18</b> abuts the end wall <b>46</b> of the bonnet <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The outer filter <b>74</b> is preferably a cylindrical wall provided with a plurality of apertures <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). The outer filter <b>74</b> cooperates with the walls <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> of the bonnet <b>14</b> to define an annular chamber, which is referenced herein as an outflow chamber <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The inner filter <b>76</b> is positioned within the outer filter <b>74</b> and between the annular ends <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> of the filter element assembly <b>18</b>. The inner filter <b>76</b> is formed from a woven layer provided with a plurality of apertures <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). The inner filter <b>76</b>, the impeller ring <b>16</b>, and the end wall <b>46</b> cooperate to define a chamber within the filter element assembly <b>18</b>, which is referenced herein as a cyclonic flow chamber <b>90</b>, and which has an inlet defined by end <b>78</b> of the filter element assembly <b>18</b> proximal the impeller ring <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The quantity of inner apertures <b>86</b> is greater than the quantity of outer apertures <b>82</b>. Furthermore, the size (e.g., volume) of each one of the inner apertures <b>86</b> is less than the size (e.g., volume) of each one of the outer apertures <b>82</b>. The larger size of the outer apertures <b>82</b> imparts structural integrity to the outer filter <b>74</b> and the filter assembly <b>18</b> generally. At the same time, the smaller size of the inner apertures <b>86</b> provides enhanced filtering. The inner filter <b>76</b> is removable and relatively inexpensive to replace.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The filter element assembly <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A is one of many types of filters contemplated for use in connection with the present invention. Any suitable filter and/or strainer known in the art can be used. Moreover, it should be understood that the apertures of such filter(s) and/or strainer(s) can comprise cut-outs, pores, and/or any other type of opening adapted to permit the flow of liquid therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the backwash arm <b>20</b> is positioned within the cyclonic flow chamber <b>90</b>. The backwash arm <b>20</b> includes a shaft <b>92</b> that is hollow and that extends into the central open area <b>66</b> of the impeller ring <b>16</b>. A cylindrical gasket <b>94</b> forms a loose seal between the shaft <b>92</b> and the hub <b>58</b> of the impeller ring <b>16</b>. The backwash arm <b>20</b> has a face or shoe <b>96</b> which extends from the shaft <b>92</b> toward the inner filter <b>76</b>. The shoe <b>96</b> is generally hollow, but has a plurality of vanes <b>98</b> extending between the sidewalls (not designated) of the shoe <b>96</b>. The vanes <b>98</b> form a plurality of backwash chambers <b>99</b> with the sidewalls of the shoe <b>96</b>. The backwash chambers <b>99</b> are in liquid communication with a backwash passageway <b>100</b>, which extends through the shaft <b>92</b> to the drain pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The backwash arm <b>20</b> also includes a drive shaft <b>102</b> and a bearing plate <b>104</b> which is positioned adjacent the end wall <b>46</b> of the bonnet <b>14</b>. A washer (not shown) can be provided between the bearing plate <b>104</b> and the end wall <b>46</b>. The backwash arm <b>20</b> extends from the bearing plate <b>104</b> through and out of the central opening <b>48</b> of the end wall <b>46</b> of the bonnet <b>14</b>. A coupling <b>106</b> is mounted on the bonnet <b>14</b> to receive the drive shaft <b>102</b> and maintain the alignment thereof along the central longitudinal axis A<sub>C</sub>. A motor (not shown) or other drive means for rotating the drive shaft <b>102</b> is in mechanical communication therewith. The drive shaft <b>102</b> is rotatable in response to actuation of the drive means so as to impart rotary motion to the backwash arm <b>20</b>. The drive means is provided with user-selectable controls, such as controls for actuating the drive means, controls for selecting the angular velocity of drive shaft <b>102</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the backwash strainer <b>10</b> includes an electro-mechanical system (not shown) for sensing and manipulating the pressure within the various chambers of the base <b>12</b> and the bonnet <b>14</b>. For example, a first pressure sensor (not shown) is positioned within the outlet <b>44</b> to continuously measure a first pressure value P<sub>1</sub>, while a second pressure sensor (not shown) is positioned within the inlet <b>42</b> to continuously measure a second pressure value P<sub>2</sub>. An electronic processor communicates with the first pressure sensor, the second pressure sensor, and a valve (not shown) positioned at the backwash drain <b>40</b>. The valve is operable between an open position in which the passageway <b>38</b> is exposed to atmospheric pressure P<sub>o</sub>, and a closed position, in which the passageway <b>38</b> is unexposed to the atmospheric pressure P<sub>o</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electronic processor is operable to open and close the valve in accordance with any one or more sets of logic. As a first example, the electronic processor is operable to open the valve at predetermined time intervals (e.g., for five minutes every one hour). As a second example, the electronic processor is operable to open the valve in response to manual actuation by an operator of the backwash strainer <b>10</b>. As a third example, the electronic processor continuously calculates a pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1</sub>, opens the valve when the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>exceeds a predetermined value P<sub>C</sub>, and closes the valve when the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>drops below the predetermined value P<sub>C</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>7</b>A, a contemplated use of the backwash strainer <b>10</b> and exemplary operation thereof shall now be described in further detail. During a filtering operation, debris-laden liquid is delivered to the inlet <b>42</b>, as the pressure value P<sub>2 </sub>at the inlet <b>42</b> is continuously measured. The liquid then flows into the inflow chamber <b>36</b>, where the liquid flows in a generally linear direction F<sub>1 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) toward the impeller ring <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Continuing with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 7A</figref>, as the liquid flows through the openings <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>of the impeller ring <b>16</b> into the cyclonic flow chamber <b>90</b>, the impeller ring <b>16</b> functions to impart a cyclonic flow F<sub>2 </sub>to the liquid so as to direct the liquid through the apertures <b>82</b>, <b>86</b> and deposit debris particles <b>108</b> against the inner filter <b>76</b> within the chamber <b>90</b>. The cyclonic flow F<sub>2 </sub>is at least partially helical.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cyclonic flow F<sub>2 </sub>enhances the probability that the debris particles <b>108</b> will approach the apertures <b>86</b> at an angle, thereby reducing the probability that the apertures <b>86</b> will become clogged by the debris particles <b>108</b>. The cyclonic flow F<sub>2 </sub>also reduces anomalies in the even distribution of the debris particles <b>108</b> across the inner filter <b>74</b>. By minimizing clogging and/or facilitating a less anomalous distribution of debris during the filtering operation, the backwash operation can be more efficiently performed, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the backwash strainer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During the filtering operation (as well as the backwash operation), the backwash arm <b>20</b> continuously rotates. Although it is contemplated that the backwash arm <b>20</b> can rotate intermittently, it is preferable that the backwash arm <b>20</b> continuously rotate so as to acquire momentum. Such momentum enables the shoe <b>96</b> to more easily rotate along the inner filter <b>76</b> despite the accumulation of the debris particles <b>108</b> during the filtering operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After flowing through the filter element assembly <b>18</b>, the filtered liquid flows into the outflow chamber <b>84</b> formed in the bonnet <b>14</b> and then into the outflow chamber <b>30</b> formed in the base <b>12</b>. The filtered liquid thereafter flows from the outflow chamber <b>30</b> into the outlet <b>44</b>, where the pressure P<sub>1 </sub>is continuously measured. The filtered liquid finally exits the backwash strainer <b>10</b> from the outlet <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The aforementioned electronic processor identifies when the filter element assembly <b>18</b> has become clogged to such a degree that initiation of the backwash operation is desirable. In this regard, the electronic processor continuously calculates the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>and continuously compares the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>to the predetermined value P<sub>C </sub>to identify when an unacceptably high level of clogging is present. If the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>has exceeded the predetermined value P<sub>C</sub>, the electronic processor initiates a backwash operation by actuating the valve at the backwash drain <b>40</b> into an open position, thereby introducing atmospheric pressure P<sub>o </sub>into the drain pipe <b>34</b> and the backwash arm <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the backwash operation, the pressure in the outflow chamber <b>84</b> is greater than the atmospheric pressure P<sub>o </sub>introduced into the backwash arm <b>20</b>. Thus, as the backwash arm <b>20</b> rotates, a reverse flow of liquid occurs from the outflow chamber <b>84</b> into the shoe <b>96</b> of the backwash arm <b>20</b>, whereby the collected debris particles <b>108</b> are washed off of the filter element assembly <b>18</b> and into the backwash chambers <b>99</b> for discharge from the strainer <b>10</b>. Because the apertures <b>86</b> are smaller than the apertures <b>82</b>, the fluid accelerates as it passes through the filter assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vanes <b>98</b> of the shoe <b>96</b> facilitate a more even, e.g., less anomalous, distribution of the atmospheric pressure P<sub>o </sub>across the portion of the filter element assembly <b>18</b> isolated by the shoe <b>96</b>, thereby facilitating more even backwashing of the debris particles <b>108</b>. The backwash operation continues until the pressure differential ΔP<sub>P2−P1 </sub>has dropped below the predetermined value P<sub>C</sub>, at which time the electronic processor closes the valve at the backwash drain <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be understood that the embodiment of the present invention described herein is merely exemplary and that a person skilled in the art may make many variations and modifications without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. All such variations and modifications, including those discussed above, are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
