<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a thermal transport structure. The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a method of making and/or using the thermal transport structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some electronic devices generate heat during operation that may need to be dissipated. As electronic devices become denser and more highly integrated, the heat flux requirement may increase. Because of performance and reliability considerations, the devices may need to operate at lower temperatures. The operating temperature requirement may reduce the temperature difference between the heat-generating device and the ambient temperature, which may decrease the thermodynamic driving force for heat removal. The increased heat flux and reduced thermodynamic driving force may require a thermal management technique to facilitate heat removal during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thermal management techniques may use some form of heat-dissipating unit (e.g., a heat spreader, heat sink, lid, or heat pipe) to conduct heat away from high temperature areas in an electronic device. A heat-dissipating unit may include a thermally conductive material that is mechanically coupled to a heat-generating unit to aid in heat removal from the heat-generating unit. A dissipating unit may include a metal article in contact with the heat-generating unit, such as a heat radiator fin. Heat from the heat-generating unit may flow through the mechanical interface between the units into the heat-dissipating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an electronic package, a heat-dissipating unit may be mechanically coupled to the heat producing component during operation by positioning a flat surface of the heat-dissipating unit against a flat surface of the heat producing component and holding the heat-dissipating unit in place using some form of adhesive or fastener. A heat-dissipating unit may be attached to the heat-generating component via a thin-layer of thermal interface material (TIM). This material may be a filled polymer system. The effectiveness of heat removal from the device may depend on the in-situ thermal resistance of the TIM material, which may depend on the bulk thermal conductivities of the TIM material. While, the usage of thermal interface material may provide mechanical stability compared to adhesives, thermal resistance may be exacerbated by the bulk of the thermal interface material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method for thermal transport than might not otherwise be available. It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method for thermal transport having relatively improved thermal transport performance. It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method with a relatively higher thermal conductivity in a pre-determined direction than might otherwise be available.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a thermal transport structure. The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a method of making and/or using the thermal transport structure. The invention may include embodiments that relate to a thermal management system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a term thermal transport structure may refer to an engineered structure for use in an electronic assembly. Thermally conductive may include the ability to conduct heat, and may refer to a physical constant for a quantity of heat that may pass through a predetermined volume in a unit of time, for units involving a difference in temperature across the volume. Tack free may refer to a surface that does not possess pressure sensitive adhesive properties at about room temperature. By one measure, a tack free surface will not adhere or stick to a finger placed lightly in contact therewith at about 25 degrees Celsius. Solid refers to a property such that a material does flow perceptibly under moderate stress, or has a definite capacity for resisting one or more forces (e.g., compression or tension) that may otherwise tend to deform it. In one aspect, under ordinary conditions a solid may retain a definite size and shape. The term “free” may be used in combination with a term, and may include insubstantial or trace amounts while still being considered free of the modified term. For example, free of solvent or solvent-free, and like terms and phrases, may include a significant portion, some, or all of the solvent having been removed, for example, during B-staging. B-staging a resin layer, and related terms and phrases, may include one or more of heating for a predetermined amount of time, optionally under vacuum; removing some or all of a solvent; at least partially solidifying the material; and/or advancing the cure or cross-linking of a curable resin from an uncured state to a partially, but not completely, cured state.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as “about”, may not to be limited to the precise value specified.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, a thermal transport structure is provided. The thermal transport structure may include a thermal transport layer having a first surface and a second surface. The thermal transport layer may have a thermally conductive material disposed within. The thermally conductive material may be oriented in a predetermined direction in order to facilitate heat conduction relative to the predetermined direction. The thermal transport structure may include a resin layer secured to the thermal transport layer second surface, and the resin layer may be relatively less thermally conductive than the thermal transport layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the invention, the thermally conductive material may have anisotropic thermal conductivity. That is to say, the thermally conductive material of the thermal transport layer may have a relatively higher value of thermal conductivity in a preferred direction. The plane having relatively higher thermal conductivity values may be employed to transfer heat from one object to another while offering lesser thermal resistance as compared to other planes. For example, the thermally conductive material may be oriented in a predetermined direction in order to facilitate heat conduction between the heat sink and the heat spreader in a thermal management system through the plane having higher thermal conductivity.</p>

In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may include one or both of aluminum nitride or boron nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments of the invention, the thermally conductive material may be coated. Suitable coatings may affect one or more attributes of the thermally conductive material, or of the resulting thermal transport structure. Such attributes may include one or more of thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, bond-line thickness, cohesion, adhesion, transparency, workability, and the like.

The particle size distribution (PSD) may be selected so that the particles are of uniform size and shape, or may be selected as a multi-modal distribution. For multi-modal distributions, the particles may be selected to achieve a pre-determined packing configuration (with the smaller particles filling the gaps defined by the larger particles). In one embodiment, the particles of one of the modes may differ not only in size, but also in shape and/or composition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may include thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG). In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may consist essentially of TPG. The TPG may be oriented in a predetermined direction relative to a desired thermal flow path. The in-plane thermal conductivity of the TPG material may be higher than the thermal conductivity in the through plane direction. By cladding the desired thermal flow path with relatively less thermally conductive material, the desired thermal flow path may be defined further and the thermal energy transport may be controlled further.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The thermally conductive material may be present in the thermal transport layer in an amount in a range of greater than about 1 weight percent, based on the weight of the thermal transport layer. In one embodiment, thermally conductive material may be present in an amount in a range of from about 1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, from about 10 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, from about 15 weight percent to about 25 weight percent, from about 25 weight percent to about 50 weight percent, from about 50 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, from about 75 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, from about 85 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, or greater than about 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the thermal transport layer.

Depending on the availability of the material and the thermal requirements of a system alternatively, the thermal transport layer may be employed in the thermal transport structure in various other forms, such as blocks, bars, cylinders, geometric shapes such as hexagons, and the like. For example, more thermal transport will require relatively larger cross section of the thermal transport layer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments of the invention, the thickness of the thermal transport layer may be in a range of from about 250 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, from about 500 micrometers to about 750 micrometers, from about 750 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, from about 1000 micrometers to about 1500 micrometers, from about 1500 micrometers to about 2000 micrometers, or greater than about 2000 micrometers. In cases where the thermal transport layer is not continuous, the individual portions may have differing thickness. The thickness of these individual portions may differ from each other, and may be in a range of from about 100 micrometers to about 200 micrometers, from about 200 micrometers to about 240 micrometers, from about 240 micrometers to about 260 micrometers, from about 260 micrometers to about 300 micrometers, from about 300 micrometers to about 350 micrometers, from about 350 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, or greater than about 500 micrometers. The thickness of the thermal transport layer may be selected with reference to the system requirements, such as heat generation and operating temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The thickness of the thermal transport layer may be calculated based upon the required thickness of the thermal transport structure, which in turn may depend on factors, such as the dimensions of the devices, and the types of heat-generating and heat-dissipating devices. Further, the thickness of the thermal transport layer may also be based upon the overall thermal resistance requirement of the thermal transport structure. The thermal resistance of the thermal transport structure may depend upon the thermal resistance of the thermal transport layer as well as the resin layer. In some embodiments, the bulk resistance of the thermal transport layer having a thickness of about 1000 micrometers, or less, may be about 1 mm<sup>2</sup>-K/w; of about 500 micrometers, or less, may be about 1 mm<sup>2</sup>-K/w; or of about 1000 micrometers, or less, may be about 5 mm<sup>2</sup>-K/w.</p>

Suitable thermoplastic resins employed in the thermal transport layer may include polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene; polycarbonates; or polyesters; or derivatives and halogenated derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments of the invention, adding one or more fillers may increase the thermal conductivity and/or electrical resistivity of the resin layer, the thermal transport layer, or another layer. The fillers may be additional to the thermally conductive materials disclosed with reference to the thermal transport layer. Filler materials or additives may affect one or more attributes of the resin layer, such as minimum width, viscosity, cure profile, adhesion, tack, electrical properties, chemical resistance (e.g., moisture resistance, solvent resistance), glass transition, thermal conductivity, heat distortion temperature, and the like.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As disclosed hereinabove, in some embodiments the resin layer may be a B-stageable resin. A B-stageable resin refers to a resin composition that may respond to, for example, a B-staging treatment to form one or more of a non-flowable and tack-free layer, a partially polymerized layer, or a solvent free layer. In some embodiments, the material of the resin layer is B-stageable, and in other embodiments, the resin layer has been B-staged. The B-staging may be accomplished, for example, by solvent reduction, partial polymerization, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">B-staging the B-stageable film may be for a sufficient time at a sufficient temperature and a sufficient vacuum to achieve the heat-dissipating component having a B-staged resin film adhered to the heat-dissipating component, where the film may be free of solvent. B-staging of the B-stageable film may be performed at a temperature greater than room temperature. In one embodiment, the B-staging temperature may be in a range of from about 50 degrees Celsius to about 65 degrees Celsius, from about 65 degrees Celsius to about 80 degrees Celsius, from about 80 degrees Celsius to about 220 degrees Celsius, from about 220 degrees Celsius to about 235 degrees Celsius, from about 235 degrees Celsius to about 250 degrees Celsius, or greater than about 250 degrees Celsius.

In one embodiment, the pressure may be a negative pressure of less than about 10 mm Hg (millimeters of Mercury), or about 10 Torr. In one embodiment the pressure may be in a range of from about 10 mm Hg (about 10 Torr) to about 50 mm Hg (about 50 Torr), from about 50 mm Hg (about 50 Torr) to about 75 mm Hg (about 75 Torr), from about 75 mm Hg (about 75 Torr) to about 200 mm Hg (about 200 Torr), from about 200 mm Hg (about 200 Torr) to about 225 mm Hg (about 225 Torr), from about 225 mm Hg (about 225 Torr) to about 250 mm Hg (about 250 Torr), or greater than about 250 mm Hg (about 250 Torr).

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the pre-formed structure having the B-stageable resin layer and the thermal transport layer may be partially cured to a B-stage, that is, a B-staged film or a B-staged layer. The B-staged film may be processed in the same, or a similar manner, as the thermoplastic film disclosed herein. A B-staged resin layer may be one or more of solid, tack-free, or hard so that a heat transfer surface, having a B-staged resin layer adhered thereto, may be, for example, stored, shipped, stacked, or otherwise handled, and later assembled to an electronic device. As noted above, the composite may be cured to at least partially convert the B-stageable resin to a B-staged resin layer. The B-staging of the resin layer may strengthen the composite, may increase cohesion, may increase workability and/or handle-ability, and/or may decrease tack.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment of the invention, the thermal transport layer and the resin layer may be stacked to form a composite. The thermal transport layer may be present in the composite, or stack, in an amount in a range of greater than about 1 weight percent relative to the weight of the resin layer.

In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may be present in an amount less than about 99 weight percent based on the total combined weight of the thermal transport layer and the resin layer. In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may be present in an amount greater than about 50 weight percent based on the total combined weight of the thermal transport layer and the resin layer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The stacking of the thermal transport layer and the resin layer may include one or more of printing, syringe dispensing, or pick-and-place dispensing of the thermal transport layer on the resin layer. For example, squeezing, roll coating, spraying, or brushing may apply the thermal transport layer to the resin layer, or the resin layer to the thermal transport layer. In one embodiment, printing may include flexographic printing, screen-printing, or stencil printing.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">One or both of the thermal transport layer or resin layer may be formed as a film. As a film, the thermal transport structure may be formed by, for example, roll-to-roll processing of the film layers. Suitable films may be formed from, for example, thermoplastic-containing layers or B-staged layers. If the resin layer is a film, disposal or production may include roll coating the thermal transport layer onto the resin layer. Alternatively, if the thermal transport layer is a film, the resin layer may be roll coated over the thermal transport layer. If both, the thermal transport layer and the resin layer are films, the thermal transport structure may be co-extruded, laminated, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The composite may be cut in a plane skew relative to a plane defined by the thermal transport layer to form a cross-sectional slice. The cut may be made perpendicular to a plane defined by the thermal transport layer. In one embodiment, the cut may be at an angle other than 90 degrees. Suitable other angles may be in a range of from about 1 degree to about 30 degrees, from about 30 degrees to about 45 degrees, from about 45 degrees to about 70 degrees, or from about 70 degrees to less than 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The slice may be cut in a direction that is skew relative to a plane defined by the thermal transport layer or layers. Alternatively, the slicing may include making a perpendicular cut to a plane defined by the thermal transport layer or thermal transport layers. The slice may expose a first end of the thermal transport layer on a first surface of the slice and a second end of the thermal transport layer on a second surface of the slice.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The slice may have a thickness of more than a few micrometers. In one embodiment, the thickness of the slice may be in a range of from about 100 micrometers to about 200 micrometers, from about 200 micrometers to about 250 micrometers, from about 250 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, from about 500 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, from about 1000 micrometers to about 1500 micrometers, from about 1500 micrometers to about 2000 micrometers, or more than about 2500 micrometers. The thickness may be selected with reference to one or more factors such as the desired end-use application, the integral strength of the slice, the particle size of spacers (if present), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, the surface of the slice may be subjected to modifying surface treatments. The surface treatments may be used to facilitate adhesion of a surface to an adjacent surface, to increase wetting, to increase surface area, to increase roughness for mechanical adhesion, to increase functionalization of the surface for increased chemical adhesive, or some combination of two or more thereof. In some embodiments, surface modification may include surface treatment to roughen the surface of the thermal transport layers of the slice to couple the slice to other surfaces. For example, mechanical roughening may improve wetting and contact at the interface. Processes such as grinding, bead blast, and the like may also be used as a mechanical roughening process for deliberate modification of a surface. Additional mechanical roughening processes, such as polishing, planarization, or scarification may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Such surface modification procedures may facilitate increased or effective coupling of the thermal transport structure with one or both of the heat-generating unit or the heat-dissipating unit. “Effective coupling” refers to a formation of an interface between the first end surface or the second end surface, and a surface of the heat-generating unit or the heat-dissipating unit to increase the transfer of thermal energy (i.e., heat transfer) therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Surface treatments may remove contaminates, or undesirable residue, such as resin, which may be present on the surface of the thermally conductive material of the thermal transport layers. Such removal may decrease the thermal resistance of the thermal transport structure. A combination of the surface modification techniques may also be employed to obtain enhanced adhesion properties.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Chemical etching methods may be employed as surface treatments of the thermal transport structure. Suitable chemical etch methods may include one or more of surface etching or reactive ion etch. Suitable chemical etchants may include one or more acid, one or more base, or one or more salt solution. The acid may include hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. The base may include potassium chloride, sodium hydroxide, or hydrogen peroxide. The salt solution may include ferric chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one embodiment, surface treatments such as plasma etch or sputtering may be employed to remove any resin material present over the conductive material, or to give a rough and/or to clean the surface of the conductive material, which have reduced amounts of resin, or may be free of resin. Plasma etching or sputtering may treat the surface of the thermally conductive layer. Plasma etching, also known as dry etching, may be applied to clean substrate surfaces. The plasma contains highly excited molecules (reactive ions), which are chemically reactive. There is also a physical bombardment mechanism in that the ions may be accelerated towards the substrate surface with an electric field. Plasma etching may be anisotropic.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">During sputtering treatment of the surface, atoms of inert gas slam the target surface. Due to the collision, there is an exchange of momentum between the atoms of the target and the atoms of the inert gas. In the process, a target atom is ejected from the target and heads to the surface, which is subjected to treatment and sticks onto the surface. In one embodiment, metal sputtering may employ metal targets, such as, but not limited to titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, aluminum, and combinations thereof.</p>
