<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Electronic systems and equipment such as computer systems, network interfaces, storage systems, and telecommunications equipment are commonly enclosed within a cabinet, rack, or housing for support, physical security, and efficient usage of space. Electronic equipment contained within the enclosure generates a significant amount of heat. Thermal damage may occur to the electronic equipment unless the heat is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some computer systems, for example network systems, often have multiple separate computer units or servers positioned and stacked in a cabinet or rack. The servers are electrically interconnected and perform functions such as storage, communications, computations, and the like. The rack includes support columns for securing the individual computer servers, typically using opposing slide assemblies which attach to the columns. Slide assemblies enable a server to be extracted from the rack, typically at the front but possibly at the rear or sides, so that individual servers can be serviced for maintenance, replacement of computer cards, or other operations while the server remains in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical server has a back panel coupled to several input and output cables which include power cables, data cables, communication lines, keyboard lines, and others. Some type of cable management device, for example a cable management arm, may be used to collect the cables at the back of the server and rack for convenience and organization. The cable management arm is typically mounted to the rack and to the server in such a manner that when the computer server is pulled out of the rack on the slide assemblies, the cable management arm unfolds and extends to allow the cables mounted thereto to be maintained in their organized state.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with an embodiment of an electronic and/or electrical equipment assembly, a cable management assembly is configured for usage in an electronic and/or electrical equipment rack assembly. The cable management assembly comprises at least two arm members, at least one flexible coupling configured to attach two of the at least two arm members, and connectors configured to flexibly attach an electronic and/or electrical equipment component to an electronic and/or electrical equipment rack. The at least two arm members, the at least one flexible coupling, and the connectors are constructed from a material that removes heat from interior to the rack and is connected in a configuration that draws the removed heat to a heat sink element.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Cable management arms (CMA) may be used to enable rack-mount servers with rails to be temporarily pulled from electronics racks for servicing. The cable management arms may create airflow resistance, particularly for more compact servers, thereby impacting system cooling. In addition, cable management arms may force placement of power and signal cables in positions within the highest temperature airstreams in the rack or cabinet. Cables have temperature limits for data integrity and current-carrying capabilities that may be violated due to the high temperature air stream.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, a cable management arm may be constructed using techniques, structures, and/or materials that remove heat from the rack cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an illustrative embodiment, a cable management arm may be constructed from tubing which enables coolant to be circulated through the assembly to control exit air temperature from information technology (IT) equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example embodiment, a cable management arm can be constructed from a material with high thermal conductivity, enabling cooling in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cable management arm with integrated heat exchange capability enables moderation of temperature within air exiting servers, control of cable temperature, and reduction or minimization of the heating impact of high-power servers on data center cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a schematic pictorial perspective view diagram illustrates an embodiment of an electronic and/or electrical equipment rack assembly <b>100</b> configured for usage with a cable management assembly <b>102</b> with an integrated heat exchanger <b>104</b>. The illustrative electronic and/or electrical equipment rack assembly <b>100</b> comprises an electronic and/or electrical equipment rack <b>106</b>, a plurality of sliding rails <b>108</b> coupled to the rack <b>106</b> and configured to slideably attach an electronic and/or electrical equipment component <b>110</b> to the rack <b>106</b>, and at least one cable management assembly <b>102</b> coupled to the rack <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The illustrative electronic and/or electrical equipment rack assembly <b>100</b> enables cooling interior to the electronic and/or electrical equipment rack <b>106</b>. Interior to the rack <b>106</b> is cooled by mounting one or more electronic and/or electrical equipment components <b>110</b> in the rack <b>106</b> and mounting signal and or power cabling <b>138</b> of the electronic and/or electrical equipment component or components <b>110</b> on a cable management assembly <b>102</b> associated with the component <b>110</b>. Airflow is drawn through the front <b>150</b> of the rack <b>106</b> across the electronic and/or electrical equipment components <b>110</b> to the rear <b>152</b> of the rack <b>106</b> in a manner such that heat is transferred from the components <b>110</b> to the air. The integrated heat exchanger <b>104</b> conducts heat and/or passes heat by convection through the cable management assembly or assemblies <b>102</b> to a heat sink. The illustrative liquid loop management assembly <b>102</b> is attached to the rear of sliding rails <b>108</b>. The liquid loop cable management assembly <b>102</b> can be coupled to fluid supply lines <b>156</b> that connect to a cooling fluid source or heat sink which removes heat form the circulating coolant for a closed-loop cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The cable management arm <b>102</b> typically attaches as a moving arm to the rear of a server <b>110</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, the cable management assembly <b>102</b> is formed in a serpentine pattern that unfolds as the server <b>110</b> is removed from the rack <b>106</b>. In the illustrative liquid loop cooling application, tubes carrying heated liquid and cooled liquid can be extended outside the servers <b>110</b> and structurally incorporated into the cable management arm <b>102</b>. In some arrangements, the cable management arm <b>102</b> can be part of the tubing assembly through which the coolant circulates. Accordingly, as heated air leaves the server <b>110</b> a supply of cool water or other coolant entering the server cools the exit air leaving the server, enabling a multifaceted cooling effect applied within the servers <b>110</b> and in the air stream external to the servers <b>110</b> within the rack <b>106</b>. The cooling effect is attained as coolant enters the server <b>110</b> and heat is conducted to the fluid through cold plates attached to various components such as processors and the like. Coolant exits the server <b>110</b> at a higher temperature, passes through the tubes in the cable management arm <b>102</b>, removing heat from the air exiting the server <b>110</b> by convection.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other liquid loop cooling arrangements, the cooling tubes may be routed through the cable management arm but only exterior to the servers. The cable management assembly <b>102</b> arrangement with the liquid loop cooling only exterior to the servers, controls exit air temperature from the servers while also enabling management of power and signal cables exiting the servers. Coolant travels through cable management arm <b>102</b>, cooling hot air from the server by heat transfer with the liquid. The cable management assembly <b>102</b> returns heated air from the servers to the room at a temperature lower than the server exit air temperature, ideally at or below the server inlet temperature. The lowered temperature reduces or minimizes the impact of the server's heat generation on the surrounding data center or office environment. Accordingly, the server can be made neutral to the room with respect to heat transfer via removal of heat by the coolant loop.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a schematic pictorial perspective view diagram depicts an embodiment of a cable management assembly <b>102</b> configured with an integrated heat exchanger <b>104</b>. The cable management assembly <b>102</b>, which may be called a cable management arm, comprises two or more arm members <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B, at least one flexible coupling <b>114</b> configured to attach two <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B of the two or more arm members, and connectors <b>116</b>. The connectors <b>116</b> are configured to flexibly attach the cable management assembly <b>102</b> to the rack <b>106</b>. The two or more arm members <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B, and the at least one flexible coupling <b>114</b> are constructed from a material or materials that remove heat from interior to the rack and connected in a configuration that draws the removed heat to a heat sink element <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the illustrative embodiment, the arm members <b>112</b>A and <b>112</b>B comprise one or more liquid loop cooling tubes <b>120</b> configured to circulate a liquid coolant <b>122</b>. A heat exchanger <b>118</b> or other heat sink component coupled to the liquid loop cooling tubes <b>120</b> is configured to cool the circulating liquid coolant <b>122</b> and return the cooled circulating liquid to the liquid loop cooling tubes <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Liquid coolant fluid <b>122</b> circulates through the cable management assembly and cooling air passes over the cable management assembly <b>102</b> by heat transfer to the liquid cooling fluid <b>122</b> with liquid coolant fluid <b>122</b> circulating through a heat exchanger <b>118</b>. The liquid coolant fluid <b>122</b> can be cooled at the heat exchanger <b>118</b> by transfer to another liquid loop such as a chilled water supply and/or refrigeration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some arrangements, a pump <b>126</b> may be included as part of the cable management assembly <b>102</b> and configured to pump the circulating liquid <b>122</b> through the liquid loop cooling tubes <b>120</b> and the heat exchanger <b>118</b>. In various arrangements, the pump <b>126</b> may be positioned in any suitable location. For example, a pump may be contained within a server chassis of an electronic and/or electrical equipment component <b>110</b>. In another case, the pump may be located within or attached to the rack <b>106</b>. In a typical arrangement, one pump drives coolant flow through multiple individual cable management arms.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other arrangements, the cable management assembly <b>102</b> may be implemented with no associated pump. For example, the heat exchanger <b>118</b> may be configured to cool the circulating liquid <b>122</b> by refrigeration or by transfer from a chilled water supply. Pressure for driving the liquid coolant <b>122</b> through the liquid loop cooling tubes <b>120</b> may be supplied via water pressure of chilled water in the building containing the rack <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one approach for supplying cooling to a cable management arm, the CMA can be constructed from a tubular material which permits a liquid coolant to be circulated through the interior of the cable management arm. Hot air passing over the CMA is cooled by heat transfer with the liquid. The hot liquid may be returned to a rack-level heat exchanger where hot liquid from all cable management arms in the rack can be cooled by building chilled water or refrigeration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another configuration, the liquid coolant loop can be arranged to extend into the server so that coolant is pumped into the server to cool components within using cold plates. Liquid heated by transfer from the components can be cooled, at least partially, using an in-server heat sink or may exit the server be driven to a cold plate, refrigeration unit, or building-supplied chilled water, or other cooling element associated with the rack or the building. A pump or pumps for driving the cooling through the liquid loop can be contained and deliver localized pressure within the server or within the rack, or can be coupled to the building-supplied chilled water supply.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an implementation of the cable management assembly <b>102</b> comprises a liquid loop cooling tube <b>120</b> configured in a plurality of rigid segments <b>128</b> coupled by flexible tubing segments <b>130</b>. The tube <b>120</b> comprises walls <b>132</b> formed about a hollow lumen <b>134</b> that enables circulation of the liquid coolant <b>122</b>. The tube <b>120</b> forms a hollow structure that enables fluid flow of a coolant <b>122</b>, supplying thermal conduction. The diagram includes arrows showing the direction of fluid flow. The flexible tubing segments <b>130</b> are shown in a configuration that enables hinge functionality and extension and retraction of the cable management assembly <b>102</b>. The flexible tubing segments <b>130</b> enable the cable management assembly <b>102</b> to extend while maintaining fluid flow. The cable management assembly <b>102</b> further comprises at least one retention element <b>136</b> coupled to the liquid loop cooling tube <b>120</b> in a configuration adapted to retain electronic and/or electrical equipment cabling <b>138</b>. The illustrative example shows retention elements <b>136</b> in the form or hooks in a configuration suitable for holding cables, enabling cable routing in a structure that retains cables in an appropriate position and geometry. The cable management assembly <b>102</b> further comprises fasteners <b>140</b> that attach the assembly <b>102</b> to a sliding rail that holds the electronic and/or electrical equipment component <b>110</b>, such as a server. Inlet tubes <b>1421</b> and outlet tubes <b>1420</b> coupled to the tube <b>120</b> may be connected to liquid cooling loop connections <b>144</b> to data center cooling lines or another suitable cooling source.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another approach for supplying cooling to a cable management arm, the CMA can be constructed from a material with high thermal conductivity. Heat from the server exhaust air can be transferred to the cable management arm by convection and conducted to a central high-conductivity strip or cold plate in a rack column where the heat is removed to building chilled water or external data center ambient air.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some configurations may implement a heat transfer mode with multiple steps of conduction. For example, the thermally-conductive cable management arm may couple to a copper plate or thermosyphon on the rack which is further coupled to a cold plate that extends the length of the rack. At an end of the rack, for example at the rack base, the rack-length cold plate can conduct heat to building-chilled water.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C, schematic pictorial perspective view diagrams show other embodiment of cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C configured with a different type of integrated heat exchanger <b>204</b>. The cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C each comprise two or more arm members <b>212</b>A, <b>212</b>B include a plurality of segments <b>220</b> constructed from a high thermal conductivity material which is configured to transfer heat by convection and/or conduction. One example of a high thermal conductivity material is copper or a copper alloy. Another example is a heat pipe. A further example is a vapor chamber, a low profile or flattened heat pipe with a thin profile and larger planar area that can be constructed into the cable management arm. The illustrative cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C further comprise a high-conductivity strip and/or cold plate <b>224</b> coupled to the segments <b>220</b> and is configured to sink transferred heat from the segments <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Heat is conducted and/or passed through convection through the cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C which are constructed of a material with high thermal conductivity. Cooling air passes over the cable management assembly <b>202</b> by heat transfer to the material with high thermal conductivity. Heat on the cable management assembly <b>202</b> is transferred to the high-conductivity strip and/or cold plate <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one example arrangement, a cable management arm may be constructed from a high thermal conductivity material, such as copper, and bolted to a rack column which also has high thermal conductivity or to a cold plate. The thermally conductive rack column or cold plate can be cooled using building-supplied chilled water or another heat removal source. For example, a thermal bus bar or cold plate may be connected to the rack and function as a suitable heat sink whereby a cable management arm constructed from copper or other high conductivity material, or a heat pipe may connect to the bus bar or cold plate. The thermal bus bar or cold plate may have a relatively large surface area that passes heat along to a location of the rack where heat can be radiated by natural or forced convection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example arrangement, the high-conductivity strip and/or cold plate <b>224</b> may be configured to cool the circulating liquid by refrigeration or by transfer from a chilled water supply. Accordingly, the high-conductivity strip and/or cold plate <b>224</b> is cooled by heat transfer to a chilled water supply and/or refrigeration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrative arrangement, the segments <b>220</b> may be configured in a plurality of rigid segments <b>228</b> coupled by hinge elements <b>230</b> which enable extension and retraction of the cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C. The cable management assembly <b>202</b> further comprises at least one retention element <b>236</b> coupled to the segments <b>220</b> in a configuration which can retain electronic and/or electrical equipment cabling. The hinges <b>230</b> are flexible structures which facilitate movement of the cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C but present a relatively high resistance to conductive heat transfer. The three cable management assemblies <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, and <b>202</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C illustrate three techniques and associated structures for attaining a suitably high conductive heat transfer at hinge connections. Cable management assembly <b>202</b>A depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> has hinges <b>230</b>A in the form of resilient flexible metal sheeting that bends as the cable management arm <b>202</b>A in retracted and extends for extension of the arm <b>202</b>A. Similarly, the arm members <b>212</b>A, <b>212</b>B can be constructed from a resilient or flexible heat pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Cable management arm <b>202</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> includes thermally conductive sheeting <b>232</b> extending between adjacent segments coupled by hinges <b>230</b> that may present a relatively high resistance to thermal conductivity. The sheeting <b>232</b> conducts heat between segments.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Cable management arm <b>202</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> transfers heat from each segment to the rack or building chilled water by attachment of supply and return fluid tubes <b>234</b> to the multiple segments, thereby transferring heat between adjacent segments and to the central heat sink of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In either the liquid cooling loop approach or the thermal conductive material approach, extended surfaces may be added to the cable management arm to enhance heat transfer within practical space limits.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some configurations, the high-conductivity strip and/or cold plate <b>224</b> may be replaced by a thermal conductor of heat pipe coupled to the rack and extending the length of the rack to transfer heat to a cooling source at the rack base. The cooling source may be a coupling to a refrigeration source, a coupling to building-cooled water, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a schematic pictorial perspective view diagram shows another embodiment of a cable management assembly <b>302</b> configured with another different type of integrated heat exchanger <b>304</b>. Multiple fins <b>340</b> may be coupled to arm members <b>312</b>A, <b>312</b>B of the cable management assembly <b>302</b> to increase the surface area of heat exchange. In other embodiments, a sheet metal cable management arm, for example constructed from copper, can have extended surfaces to enhance heat removal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a perspective pictorial diagram illustrates an embodiment of a system <b>400</b> including a rack <b>406</b> configured to hold multiple servers or computers <b>410</b> in an arrangement with cable management arms <b>420</b> which do not include a heat exchange capability. The servers <b>410</b> are attached to rails <b>412</b> coupled to rack columns <b>414</b> that enable the servers <b>410</b> to slide in and out of the rack <b>406</b>. A conventional cable management arm <b>402</b> is typically constructed from sheet metal, solid tubing, or plastic materials. In a typical arrangement, hot air is exhausted from the rear of the servers <b>410</b> over the cable management arms <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In contrast, the assemblies depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> have cable management arms configured to enable thermal conduction of the heat generated by servers and/or other electrical or electronic equipment. The particular examples show a liquid loop cooling arrangement which enable to coolant to flow within tubes and an arrangement using thermal conductive materials such as copper, heat pipes, and the like.</p>
