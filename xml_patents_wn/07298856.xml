<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to microphones and apparatuses based on the use of microphones, and particularly relates to condenser microphones and apparatuses based on the use of such microphones.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Technology has been making progress in terms of reducing the size and weight of electrical equipment, and sound processing apparatuses such as portable recorders and cellular phones are not an exception. Such sound processing apparatuses typically employ condenser microphones, which are comprised of two plates, i.e., a diaphragm and a back plate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Microphones of this kind provide superior performance in terms of sensitivity and noise robustness, and are suitable for size reduction. The diaphragm and the back plate are packed in a case with a spacer (support block) placed therebetween, thereby being provided as a single module, which is then implemented on a circuit board for use in the sound processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such conventional microphones are manufactured by assembling a plurality of different components, thereby resulting in drawbacks as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the limitations of preciseness during an assembly process, there is an inevitable limit to size reduction. The thickness and circuit area of microphone modules tend to be relatively large, compared to other modules of semiconductor devices implemented on small-size electrical equipment such as cellular phones. This hinders an effort toward increasing the circuit density of circuit boards.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the used materials differ from component to component, and thus have different thermal expansion coefficients, distortion may occur due to heat applied during a heat process (more than 200 degrees Celsius) such as a soldering process, which is repeated multiple times during the circuit implementation. Where lead-free solder is used during the circuit implementation process, higher temperature such as in the range from 240° C. to 260° C. need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, if components based on resin materials are employed for the diaphragm and the spacer insulator, for example, these components cannot be treated with other components during a high-temperature implementation process such as the bump/reflow process. This results in inability to pursue efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a need for a microphone that is formed as a silicon-based chip, thereby achieving size reduction, cost reduction, and sufficient reliability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a general object of the present invention to provide a microphone and apparatuses including such a microphone that substantially obviate one or more of the problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent from the description and the accompanying drawings, or may be learned by practice of the invention according to the teachings provided in the description. Objects as well as other features and advantages of the present invention will be realized and attained by a microphone and apparatuses particularly pointed out in the specification in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a chip microphone implemented as a single silicon-based chip according to the invention includes a microphone capsule which includes a vibration portion that vibrates in response to sound pressures a support block which is formed on the diaphragm, excluding at least the vibration portion to provide a vibration space, and a back plate which is formed on the support block and over the vibration space thereby facing the vibration portion of the diaphragm across the vibration space.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The chip microphone as described above can be produced as a small, highly reliable device by use of a micro-machine process technology which utilizes the semiconductor manufacturing technology. When the diaphragm and the back plate are made of silicon-based materials, the chip microphone will exhibit strong heat-resistant characteristics, allowing the use of a process. The microphone can withstand repeated exposures to the heat of reflowing or the like at the time of implementation on a circuit board or implementation as a module. Without the assembly of several parts, the present invention can produce a chip microphone having small area size and a thickness of less than 1 mm, and can implement all circuit components at once on the circuit board by use of an implementation process such as the bump/reflow process. The device for inputting sound information formed in this manner does not limit a temperature range in which the apparatus is used. Even if aluminum, which is typically used, is employed as an electrode material, the chip microphone will exhibit heat-resistant characteristics up to 300 degrees Celsius. The heat-resistant characteristics of this degree can withstand an implementation process using lead-free solder. Preferably, the electrode material is such a material as exhibiting a proper ohmic contact with substrate materials such as silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, a sound processing apparatus includes a microphone of a condenser type, and an oscillation/modulation circuit which includes an LC oscillation circuit that oscillates at oscillation frequency determined by a coil and a condenser, the microphone serving as the condenser, wherein the microphone is a silicon-based chip, including a microphone capsule which includes a vibration portion that vibrates in response to sound pressures, a support block which is formed on the diaphragm, excluding at least the vibration portion to provide a vibration space, and a back plate which is formed on the support block and over the vibration space, thereby facing the vibration portion of the diaphragm across the vibration space.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the sound processing apparatus as described above, the vibration of the diaphragm in the microphone can be detected as changes in the capacitance by applying a small voltage to the LC oscillation circuit, rather than by applying a bias voltage as in conventional microphones. The microphone and the LC oscillation circuit can be formed in the same substrate. With this provision, the present invention can avoid the diaphragm and the back plate being stuck together due to the applied voltage even if the support block is formed to have a thickness as thin as 1 micrometer to 20 micrometers. This further contributes to the size reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, a sound processing apparatus includes an array microphone which includes an array of microphones, and an in-phase summation circuit which is connected to the array microphone to add outputs from the microphones together, wherein the array microphone is implemented as a silicon-based device, and each of the microphones included in the array microphone includes a diaphragm which includes a vibration portion that vibrates in response to sound pressures, a support block which is formed on the diaphragm, excluding at least the vibration portion to provide a vibration space, and a back plate which is formed on the support block and over the vibration space, thereby facing the vibration portion of the diaphragm across the vibration space.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the sound processing apparatus as described above, the outputs of the chip microphones are added together based on the assumption that they are in phase, thereby making it possible to provide a sound input unit that is small and has low-noise characteristics. Production of the sound processing apparatus as a unit makes it possible to achieve steady characteristics of the chip microphones, small product variation, thereby providing a highly-accurate small-size audio input unit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of making a chip microphone includes the steps of providing a diaphragm substrate, providing a back-plate substrate, bonding the diaphragm substrate and the back-plate substrate together with a bonding layer placed therebetween, forming etching masks on exposed surfaces of the diaphragm substrate and the back-plate substrate, performing first etching to turn the diaphragm substrate into a diaphragm and a base around the diaphragm and to turn the back-plate substrate into a back plate having through holes, and performing second etching by using the back plate having through holes as an etching mask to remove a portion of the bonding layer, thereby creating a space across which the diaphragm faces the back plate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the method as described above, the two substrates are bonded together after depositing the bonding layer on the bonding surface of the diaphragm substrate or the bonding surface of the back-plate substrate. Through application of a heat process, for example, the present invention bonds the substrates together with steady bonding over the entire surface, while simultaneously providing an insulating layer having a desired thickness between the two substrates. The bonding layer may contain soot silicon oxide as a main component, thereby making it possible to eliminate defects of the oxide film through sufficient infusion of an oxide substance, to bond the substrates without particular needs for the flatness of bonding surfaces and the rigorous control of cleanliness, and to increase latitude in designing the thickness of each of the substrates and the insulating layer compared to the use of direct bonding or the conventional SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other objects and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustrative drawing showing a chip microphone used in a sound processing apparatus according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a chip microphone <b>10</b> has a diaphragm <b>12</b> formed at the center of a base <b>11</b> and vibrating in response to sound pressures, and has a back plate <b>14</b> that is supported by a support block <b>13</b> around outside the vibrating portion of the diaphragm <b>12</b>. The back plate <b>14</b> thus faces the diaphragm <b>12</b>, thereby providing a vibration space S for the diaphragm <b>12</b>. In this manner, the chip microphone <b>10</b> is configured to function as a condenser microphone. The chip microphone <b>10</b> is manufactured by semiconductor manufacturing technology (i.e., micro-machine processing technology) as will be described later, having a stacked layer structure in which the diaphragm <b>12</b>, the support block <b>13</b>, and the back plate <b>14</b> are stacked one over another in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The chip microphone <b>10</b> has a cap <b>15</b> that covers the back plate <b>14</b>. An electrode <b>16</b> formed on the upper surface of the back plate <b>14</b> is led to an exterior through a wire bonding electrical connection using a wire <b>19</b>, which is connected to an electrode <b>18</b> on the upper surface of a terminal platform <b>17</b> that is formed alongside the back plate <b>14</b>. The cap <b>15</b> is fixedly adhered to the upper surface of the base <b>11</b> and to the upper surface of the terminal platform <b>17</b> with a ceramics-group adhesive <b>20</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The cap <b>15</b> serves to adjust, through its size, the acoustic characteristics of the microphone, and also serves as a shield against an electromagnetic field. An air-passage opening <b>15</b><i>a </i>formed at the center of the cap is used to control the directivity of the microphone. Further, the back plate <b>14</b> is provided with a plurality of through holes <b>14</b><i>a </i>for the purpose of connecting both sides of the back plate <b>14</b> so as not to hinder the vibration of the diaphragm <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The chip microphone <b>10</b> has solder bumps <b>21</b>, which are formed on the upper surfaces of the base <b>11</b> and the terminal platform <b>17</b> at positions outside the cap <b>15</b>. These solder bumps <b>21</b> are provided for the purpose of attaching the chip microphone <b>10</b> to a module board (not shown) to make a module. This module board is then electrically connected to an implementation board for use in a sound processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the following, a process of making the chip microphone <b>10</b> by semiconductor manufacturing technology will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2E</figref> are illustrative drawings showing a process of making a chip microphone <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a silicon substrate, generally used as a semiconductor substrate, is provided as a back-plate substrate <b>114</b>. Beneath the lower surface of the back-plate substrate <b>114</b>, a bonding film <b>113</b> with impurity is formed by a deposition method such as the CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method that deposits an oxide film or by coating with soot silicon oxide containing impurity therein. By the same token, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a silicon substrate is provided as a diaphragm substrate <b>111</b>. At the upper surface of the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b>, an etch-stop layer <b>112</b> with high impurity concentration is formed by a solid phase diffusion method that provides the silicon substrate with the high concentration of impurity through thermal diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The etch-stop layer <b>112</b> and the bonding film <b>113</b> are provided with the same type of impurity so as to have similar physical property. In order to stop impurity from diffusing from the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> to the bonding film <b>113</b>, the bonding film <b>113</b> is designed to have higher impurity concentration than the impurity concentration of the etch-stop layer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The etch-stop layer <b>112</b> will be turned into the diaphragm <b>12</b> as thin as few microns so as to provide high sensitivity for the condenser microphone. To this end, it is preferable to diffuse boron as impurity for the purpose of avoiding the etching of the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> at a subsequent etching stage. It follows that the bonding film <b>113</b> is also provided with boron as impurity, which is diffused by the solid phase diffusion process to a high concentration. In order to achieve the high concentration of impurity through the thermal diffusion, high temperature is required. Use of temperature less than 1200 degrees Celsius will prevent the silicon wafer from suffering heat-caused distortion. In this example, a description has been given with reference to a case in which the solid phase diffusion method is used as a means to form the etch-stop layer <b>112</b>. Needless to say, however, other methods such as an ion implantation method or a coating method may also be used, and the impurity is not limited to boron.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the bonding film <b>113</b> and the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> are bonded together by use of bonding technology such as thermal bonding, anodic bonding, or direct bonding, thereby forming a bonded substrate <b>100</b> comprised of the back-plate substrate <b>114</b> and the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b> bonded together. The upper surface of the back-plate substrate <b>114</b> is ground to adjust the thickness of the whole substrate. The bonded substrate <b>100</b> is then subjected to heat in the oxygen atmosphere, so that oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> serving as etching masks are formed on the upper and lower surfaces of the bonded substrate <b>100</b>. The thickness of the oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> is set to around 4000 angstroms by taking into account the depth of silicon etching of the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b>. The heat process for forming the oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> is preferably performed at lower temperature than when the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> was formed, the purpose being to avoid the diffusion of impurity of the etch-stop layer <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, temperature used for forming the oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> is set to 900 degrees Celsius that is lower than the temperature used for forming the etch-stop layer <b>112</b>. Such temperature is chosen by taking into account a need to secure a proper growth rate of the oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> and also taking into account the fact that the use of lower temperature will results in an increase of interface charge between the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b> and the bonding film <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, photolithography is employed to remove unnecessary portions of the oxide films <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> from the bonded substrate <b>100</b>, thereby turning the oxide film <b>131</b> into a diaphragm etching mask <b>141</b> and turning the oxide film <b>132</b> into a back-plate etching mask <b>142</b> and a terminal-platform etching mask <b>143</b>, followed by etching the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b> and the back-plate substrate <b>114</b> to remove unnecessary portions thereof through the etching masks <b>141</b>-<b>143</b>. In this manner, the diaphragm substrate <b>111</b> is turned into the base <b>11</b>, exposing the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> that forms the diaphragm <b>12</b>, and making the back-plate substrate <b>114</b> into the back plate <b>14</b> and the terminal platform <b>17</b>. Such etching may be performed by use of an alkali etching solution such as TMAH (tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the etching masks <b>141</b> through <b>143</b> are removed by etching, and portions of the bonding film <b>113</b> other than the support block <b>13</b> are also removed by etching. The thin-metal electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are formed by sputtering or the like on the upper surfaces of the back plate <b>14</b> and the terminal platform <b>17</b>, thereby making the chip microphone <b>10</b> having an integrated structure. The electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are shown as thick films for the sake of illustration, but can sufficiently be thin films, so that there is no need to use a deposition mask, except for the back plate <b>14</b> and the terminal platform <b>17</b>. For example, the formation of a thin film <b>151</b> on the upper surface of the etch-stop layer <b>112</b> does not cause any harm. Although a detailed description of an electrode for the diaphragm <b>12</b> is not particularly given here, such an electrode may well be formed by use of sputtering or the like. Here, the use of the deposition mask may be omitted, thereby generating both electrodes simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electrode <b>16</b> on the back plate <b>14</b> and the electrode <b>18</b> on the terminal platform <b>17</b> are connected together through wire bonding, and the cap <b>15</b> is adhered by using the ceramics-group adhesive <b>20</b> or the like. The solder bumps <b>21</b> are then formed on the thin film <b>151</b> over the base <b>11</b> and on the electrode <b>18</b> over the terminal platform <b>17</b>. The chip microphone <b>10</b> formed in this manner can be mounted on a module substrate to make a module structure, which may be implemented on a microphone-circuit substrate for use in audio processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment as described above, the chip microphone <b>10</b> can be made as a single chip by forming a high-precision stacked-layer structure comprised of the diaphragm <b>12</b>, the support block <b>13</b>, and the back plate <b>14</b> based on the semiconductor manufacturing technology. Use of the semiconductor manufacturing technology achieves low cost and easy manufacturing of the chip microphones. The chip microphone <b>10</b> together with other components can then be implemented on a circuit substrate with high circuit density as part of CSP (chip size packaging). Since the diaphragm <b>12</b>, the support block <b>13</b>, and the back plate <b>14</b> are made of silicon-based materials, differences in thermal expansion coefficients are small, resulting in little likelihood of heat-caused distortion. It is therefore less likely to have the diaphragm <b>12</b> damaged. Because of such heat-resistant characteristics, a high-temperature process can be applied at various manufacturing steps. Efficient manufacturing is thus achieved by utilizing high-temperature temperature reflowing or the like at the time of module formation or implementation on the circuit substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, the chip microphone <b>10</b> is provided as a reliable and inexpensive component having small area size and a thickness of less than 1 mm like a LSI chip, rather than being manufactured by assembling a plurality of components including a diaphragm, a support block, and a back plate. Further, efficient manufacturing can be achieved by utilizing the bump/reflow process to implement all at once on the circuit substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention thus contribute to size reduction, cost reduction, and reliability of audio processing apparatus such as circuit boards or cellular phones having the chip microphone <b>10</b> implemented thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the diaphragm <b>12</b>, the support block <b>13</b>, the back plate <b>14</b> are made of the same silicon-based material in this embodiment, the type of material is not limited to be silicon-based. Further, different types of substrate materials may be bonded together as long as the diaphragm <b>12</b> and the support block <b>13</b> are made of materials having similar physical property in terms of thermal expansion coefficients and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In what follows, a description will be given with regard to an audio recording apparatus according a first embodiment of a sound processing apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of the configuration of the audio recording apparatus according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the audio recording apparatus (sound processing apparatus) includes an amplifier <b>221</b> for amplifying audio information such as human voice received by a chip microphone <b>210</b>, and further includes a recording unit <b>225</b> for recording the amplified audio information. The chip microphone <b>210</b> and the amplifier <b>221</b> are integrally formed as an IC chip <b>220</b> by semiconductor manufacturing technology (micro-machine processing technology), thereby achieving size reduction. The IC chip <b>220</b> is directly connected to the recording unit <b>225</b> to attain compact size for the entirety of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are illustrative drawings showing an example of the configuration of the chip microphone <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a diaphragm <b>212</b> is formed at the center of a base <b>211</b> so as to vibrate in response to sound pressures. A back plate <b>214</b> is supported by an adhesive support block (adhesive insulating layer) <b>213</b> around outside the vibrating portion of the diaphragm <b>212</b> so as to provide a vibration space (gap space) S, thereby facing the diaphragm <b>212</b>. With this provision, the chip microphone <b>210</b> is configured to function as a condenser microphone. The chip microphone <b>210</b> has a stacked-layer structure in which the diaphragm <b>212</b>, the adhesive support block <b>213</b>, and the back plate <b>214</b> stacked one after another in this order, so that the chip microphone <b>210</b> together with the amplifier <b>221</b> can be made by semiconductor manufacturing technology. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a plurality of through holes <b>214</b><i>a </i>are formed through the back plate <b>214</b> so as not to prevent the vibration of the diaphragm <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the IC chip <b>220</b>, the diaphragm <b>212</b> vibrates in response to sound input into the chip microphone <b>210</b>, which creates changes in capacitance between the opposing plates, i.e., the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b>. Such changes are picked up by electrode terminals <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> as analog signals, which are then amplified by the amplifier <b>221</b> for outputting.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The chip microphone <b>210</b> has a cap that covers the back plate <b>214</b>, and an air-passage hole is formed at the center of the cap. With this provision, the size of the cap serves to adjust the acoustic characteristics of the microphone. The cap can also serve as a shield for electromagnetic fields, and the air-passage hole at the center of the cap is used to control the directivity of the microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the following, a process of making the chip microphone <b>210</b> by the semiconductor manufacturing technology will be described with reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref>. As for the amplifier <b>221</b>, a conventional semiconductor process can be employed for manufacturing thereof, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, silicon substrates of such a type as generally used as semiconductor substrates are provided as a diaphragm substrate <b>312</b> and a back-plate substrate <b>314</b>. A surface of the diaphragm substrate <b>312</b>, to which the back-plate substrate <b>314</b> is to be bonded (adhered), has an adhesive layer <b>313</b> formed by the CVD method or the like to a thickness of 10 micrometers, for example. This adhesive layer <b>313</b> has soot silicon oxide as a principal component, and contains the high concentration of boron or phosphorus. For size reduction of the microphone, the thickness of the adhesive layer <b>313</b> may be properly 1 to 20 micrometers when considering the ease of manufacturing and a bias potential. The thickness of the adhesive layer <b>313</b> is preferably 2 to 5 micrometers when considering sensitivity and frequency characteristics, and may be determined according to a voltage applied thereto in such a manner as to avoid contact between the diaphragm <b>312</b> and the back plate <b>314</b>. The adhesive layer <b>313</b> may alternatively be formed on a surface of the back-plate substrate <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the diaphragm substrate <b>312</b> and the back-plate substrate <b>314</b> are held together and subjected to heat, so that they are adhered together via the deposited adhesive layer <b>313</b>. The back-plate substrate <b>314</b> is ground to a desired thickness by taking into account its use as the back plate. Oxide layers are then deposited on the lower and upper surfaces of the bonded substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>, followed by a photolithography process being applied thereto to generate etching masks <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, wet etching using an alkali etching solution or dry etching using XeF<sub>2 </sub>gas is applied to the substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> through the etching masks <b>317</b>, thereby forming the back plate <b>314</b> and the base <b>211</b> having the diaphragm <b>312</b>. The back plate <b>314</b> has a mesh structure with the through holes <b>314</b><i>a </i>formed at the portion where the diaphragm <b>312</b> is situated, the purpose being to release air pressure generated inside the vibration space S by the vibration of the diaphragm <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the back plate <b>214</b> is used as an etching mask, and the adhesive support block <b>313</b> is etched by hydrofluoric acid through the mesh structure of the back plate <b>214</b>. Through this etching, the adhesive layer <b>313</b> is removed, except for the portion corresponding to the adhesive support block <b>313</b> near the perimeter of the back plate <b>314</b>, thereby creating the vibration space S. The electrode terminals <b>315</b> and <b>316</b> are then formed by vapor deposition that creates a metal film made of aluminum, for example. The chip microphone <b>210</b> is thus produced as having an integrated structure.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The adhesive layer <b>313</b> has soot silicon oxide as a main component, thereby insuring the sufficient amount of oxide contents that prevent the defects of the oxide layer. Because of this, the diaphragm substrate <b>312</b> and the back-plate substrate <b>314</b> can be quickly adhered together with sufficient bonding contact over the entire surface, without a need for tight control of surface flatness of these substrates. Further, there is no need to rigorously control cleanliness of the bonding surfaces of these substrates when adhering the substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> together. It is therefore possible to freely choose the thickness of the substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>, the distribution of impurity concentration, the thickness of the adhesive layer <b>313</b>, etc., compared with when bonding the substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> directly. Since the adhesive layer <b>313</b> contains high concentration of boron or phosphorus, it is possible to increase fluidity at the time of adhesive contact, thereby improving steady contact at the time of bonding the substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The electrode terminals <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> of the chip microphone <b>210</b> are connected to an input terminal of the amplifier <b>221</b> by wire bonding or the like, and the output of the amplifier <b>221</b> is then connected to the recording unit <b>225</b>. With this provision, the IC chip <b>220</b> functions as an audio input unit for an audio recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiment described above, the chip microphone <b>210</b> is produced by the semiconductor manufacturing technology that does not require any assembling step, such that the adhesive support block <b>213</b> placed between the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> in the multi-layer structure has soot silicon oxide as a main component together with high concentration of boron or phosphorous, and has a thickness ranging from 1 micrometer to 20 micrometers. This makes it possible to readily produce a high-precision chip product at low costs, thereby manufacturing inexpensive small-size. microphones having uniform characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The chip microphone <b>210</b> is integrally formed together with the amplifier <b>221</b> as the IC chip <b>220</b>, thereby insuring high and reliable quality and achieving the effective implementation of small-size and lightweight products.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, since the chip microphone <b>210</b> is made of a silicon-based material, it exhibits strong heat-resistant characteristics. It is possible to avoid a situation in which the use of the chip microphone <b>210</b> is limited to particular areas of use because of limitations posed by operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment described above, the diaphragm <b>212</b>, the adhesive support block <b>213</b>, and the back plate <b>214</b> are made of the same silicon-based material. It should be noted, however, that the material used in the invention does not have to be a silicon-based material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustrative drawing showing a first variation of the chip microphone of the first embodiment. The chip microphone <b>210</b> of the first embodiment includes the flat substrates <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> bonded together with an adhesive, so that a parasitic capacitance created by the opposing electrodes outside the portion where the opposing electrodes function as the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> ends up being comparable to the effective capacitance, thereby serving as one of the coefficients to reduce sensitivity when detecting capacitance changes caused by sound pressures. It is not desirable, however, to reduce the area of the relevant portion since the sensitivity of the microphone is proportional to the area of the relevant portion. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, therefore, a step <b>211</b><i>a </i>is formed as part of the base <b>211</b> by raising the portion of the base <b>211</b> that directly serves as the diaphragm <b>212</b>, and a thick adhesive support block <b>217</b> is provided around the adhesive support block <b>213</b>. This configuration further separates the opposing electrodes from each other, thereby reducing the parasitic capacitance and improving sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustrative drawing showing a second variation of the chip microphone of the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a step <b>214</b><i>b </i>is formed as part of the back plate <b>214</b> in addition to the step <b>211</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>211</b> so as to raise a portion of the back plate <b>214</b> outside the vibrating portion of the diaphragm <b>212</b>. Further, a thick adhesive support block <b>219</b> is provided around the adhesive support block <b>213</b>. This configuration further separates the opposing electrodes from each other, thereby reducing the parasitic capacitance and improving sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram showing an example of the configuration of an audio recording/reproducing apparatus according a second embodiment of the sound processing apparatus of the present invention. In the second embodiment, the same elements as those of the preceding embodiment are referred to by the same numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the audio recording/reproducing apparatus (sound processing apparatus) is configured to receive audio information by the chip microphone <b>210</b> of the IC chip <b>220</b>, to record digital audio information amplified by the amplifier <b>221</b>, and to reproduce the recorded audio information. The IC chip <b>220</b> is implemented on a circuit substrate <b>230</b>, together with an A/D-conversion unit <b>231</b> for converting analog signals into digital signals as the analog signals are output from the amplifier <b>221</b>, a coding unit <b>232</b> for compressing audio information by coding the digital signals after A/D conversion by the A/D-conversion unit <b>231</b>, a recording unit <b>233</b> for recording audio information in a record medium such as a memory stick or a magneto-optical disc such as an MO disk after coding by the coding unit <b>232</b>, a decoding unit <b>234</b> for decoding the compressed audio information recorded by the recording unit <b>233</b>, a D/A-conversion unit <b>235</b> for converting audio information of digital signals decoded by the decoding unit <b>234</b> into analog signals, an amplifier <b>236</b> for amplifying the analog signals converted by the D/A-conversion unit <b>235</b>, and a speaker <b>237</b> for reproducing audio sound based on audio information supplied from the amplifier <b>236</b>. The IC chip <b>220</b> may be implemented on the circuit substrate <b>230</b> as a packaged module having the cap attached thereto as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this manner, the microphone can be implemented on the circuit substrate <b>230</b> rather than being implemented as a separate component, allowing the audio recording/reproducing apparatus to be assembled simply by putting the circuit substrate <b>230</b> in a case. During the implementation of components on the circuit substrate <b>230</b>, a high-temperature process can be applied since the IC chip <b>220</b> is made of a silicon-based material that exhibits strong heat-resistant characteristics. The implementation of circuit components onto the circuit substrate <b>230</b> can thus be performed all at once by use of the bump/reflow process that requires the use of intensive heat. Further, since the IC chip <b>220</b> uses aluminum electrodes for the chip microphone <b>210</b>, a high-temperature implementation process that uses lead-free solder can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this embodiment, further, the implementation of the IC chip <b>220</b> together with the other components <b>231</b> through <b>237</b> on the circuit substrate <b>230</b> can be performed with high component density by use of the CSP (chip size packaging) method or the like. In this case also, the bump/reflow process can be applied all at once so as to achieve effective assembling on the circuit substrate <b>230</b>. This contributes to size reduction, cost reduction, and high reliability of the audio recording/reproducing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, another variation of this embodiment may be configured such that the IC chip <b>220</b> may be connected through signal lines to a circuit substrate <b>230</b><i>a </i>on which the components <b>231</b> through <b>237</b> are implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, further, the IC chip <b>220</b> and the A/D-conversion unit <b>231</b> may be implemented on a circuit substrate <b>230</b><i>b </i>with an aim of avoiding the reduction of the S/N ratio of audio outputs. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, moreover, the IC chip <b>220</b>, the A/D-conversion unit <b>231</b>, and the coding unit <b>232</b> are implemented on a circuit substrate <b>230</b><i>c</i>, thereby making a stage preceding the recording unit <b>233</b> as a single unit so as to simplify the assembling of the apparatus. Any one of these variations may be chosen at the time of design by taking into account an exterior shape, functions, limitations imposed by manufacturing steps, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a chip microphone <b>240</b> is configured to function as a condenser microphone by placing the adhesive support block <b>213</b> between the diaphragm <b>212</b> formed of the base <b>211</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> having the plurality of through holes <b>214</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The chip microphone <b>240</b> is a condenser comprised of the thin, flat diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b>. In order to provide more sensitive detection of changes in the condenser capacitance caused by the vibration of diaphragm <b>212</b> responding to changes in sound pressures, the following measures may be taken: (1) increasing a bias voltage; (2) decreasing a gap between the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b>; (3) increasing the plate areas of the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b>; and (4) using a softer material for the diaphragm <b>212</b> (i.e., reducing the stiffness of the diaphragm <b>212</b>. It should be noted, however, that in the chip microphone <b>240</b>, there is a need to insure that the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> do not touch each other through the electrostatic attracting force. A guidance to make the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> function without touching each other is provided as a stability factor μ in Akio Mizoguchi, “Design of Miniaturizing Directional Condenser Microphone”, Journal of the Acoustical Society of Japan, Vol. 31, No. 10, pp. 593-601 (1975). In general, a design is made by choosing μ that is approximately 7.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0095">According to the equation (1), the measures (1) through (4) mentioned above for improving the sensitivity of the chip microphone <b>240</b> act against the improvement of stability. Since the chip microphone <b>240</b> has an extremely minute gap of few micrometers between the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b>, there is a limit to the sensitivity that can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">The audio pickup apparatus of this embodiment directly connects the chip microphone <b>240</b> to an oscillation/modulation circuit <b>241</b> of an LC oscillation circuit as part or all of the condenser capacitance of the oscillation/modulation circuit <b>241</b>, without placing an intervening amplifier as in the first embodiment described above. With this provision, changes in the condenser capacitance between the opposing plates of the diaphragm <b>212</b> and the back plate <b>214</b> responding to audio information are picked up as changes in the oscillation frequency of the LC circuit. The picked-up changes are then output from the output terminal of the oscillation/modulation circuit <b>241</b> to an exterior thereof</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">The LC oscillation circuit is an oscillator that has an oscillation frequency determined by a coil and a condenser, and detects changes in the condenser capacitance as changes in the oscillation frequency. According to this technology, there is no need to apply a bias voltage to the condenser portion of the chip microphone <b>240</b>, thereby increasing latitude in selecting a measure for improving sensitivity. In this case, the condenser portion of the chip microphone <b>240</b> receives a minute voltage no more than necessary for operating the oscillator of the oscillation/modulation circuit <b>241</b>, which is far lower than the bias voltage applied in the case of an ordinary microphone. It is thus possible to significantly increase the stability factor μ of the equation (1), thereby making it less likely that the diaphragm <b>212</b> comes in contact with the back plate <b>214</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0124">When 16 chip microphones <b>210</b> are to be arranged in a matrix form to implement the array microphone <b>261</b>, the size L needs to fall into the hatched area under the characteristic curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> in order to satisfy the equation (5) where the speed of sound c is set to 340 m/sec. With the upper limit frequency f<sub>h </sub>being 8 kHz, the size L has an upper limit of 4 mm. Under this condition, each chip microphone <b>210</b> is allowed to have a side length of 1 mm at maximum. Since semiconductor manufacturing technology is employed to produce the chip microphone <b>210</b>, the size as described above is well within the attainable range.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0125">The array microphone unit <b>260</b> has an array structure in which the plurality of array microphones <b>261</b> are arranged. The array microphones <b>261</b> are connected to a directivity control circuit <b>263</b> to form a super-directional microphone, which receives the outputs (sound information) of the array microphones <b>261</b> having undergone noise reduction by the in-phase summation, and applies directivity processing that is known in the art. The directivity processing is described in detail, for example, in “Super-Directional Microphone Using Two Dimensional Digital Filter” cited above.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0126">The array microphone unit <b>260</b> has an array structure in which six array microphones <b>261</b>, for example, each having the chip microphones <b>210</b> arranged in a matrix, are arranged in an array formation, and the in-phase summation circuit <b>262</b> is situated alongside and connected to each array microphone <b>261</b>, with the outputs of the in-phase summation circuits <b>262</b> being all gathered by the directivity control circuit <b>263</b>. Such an array microphone unit <b>260</b> is formed on a single substrate <b>264</b> with high precision by a micro-machine process based on the semiconductor manufacturing technology, thereby attaining uniform characteristics of the chip microphones <b>210</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, reference numeral <b>64</b> designates a cover case of the array microphone unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an illustrative drawing showing the way the cellular phone <b>300</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the cellular phone <b>300</b> having the small-size array microphone unit <b>260</b> mounted thereon displays a face of the other person on the liquid-crystal-display unit <b>275</b> that is taken a picture of by the camera <b>271</b> of the cellular phone at the other end of the line. The caller speaks while watching the liquid-crystal-display unit <b>275</b>, and the voice coming out of the caller's mouth at a distance from the array microphone unit <b>260</b> is captured by the super directivity of the array microphone unit <b>260</b>, followed by being transmitted to the cellular phone at the other end of the line. In this manner, the caller can engage in conversation in a comfortable manner that does not require the caller to put on a special microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">The liquid-crystal-display unit <b>275</b> can display any objects instead of the face of the other person, such objects including characters, figures, video images, etc., obtained through broadcast or the Internet. It should be noted that the cellular phone <b>300</b> can be used without the display function, allowing the caller to engage in a conversation with a person having no camera function with his/her cellular phone.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">In this manner, this embodiment has an additional advantage over the previously described embodiments in that a microphone having a superior directivity can be provided by use of the in-phase summation circuits <b>262</b> and the directivity control circuit <b>263</b>. The array microphone unit <b>260</b> may be formed as an integral unit, including the in-phase summation circuits <b>262</b>, the directivity control circuit <b>263</b>, the chip microphones <b>210</b> having stable characteristics, and the amplifiers <b>221</b>, by the semiconductor manufacturing technology that achieves a high-precision small-size product. The array microphone unit <b>260</b> can be subjected to mass-production by use of the semiconductor manufacturing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">This embodiment has been described with reference to a super-directional microphone. It should be noted, however, that the directivity of the microphone can be freely changed from the super-directionality to the omni-directionality by changing processing by the directivity control circuit <b>263</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">Further, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133">The term “sound processing apparatus” in this application is used to refer to an apparatus for processing sound information with respect to various sounds inclusive of human voice (irrespective of whether they are within the audible range or in the inaudible range). Such sound processing apparatus includes an apparatus such as a cellular phone for transmitting and receiving sound information, an apparatus that records sound information in a record medium such as a cassette tape or a memory chip, an apparatus such as a personal computer that performs voice recognition processing, an apparatus such as a loudspeaker and a hearing aid that amplifies sound signals, an apparatus that applies feedback control to acoustical effects or sound field effects generated by itself by use of a microphone or the like, an apparatus that measures acoustical effects or sound field effects generated by itself by use of a microphone or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">Further, the bonding film <b>113</b> or the adhesive layer <b>313</b> may include high concentration of at least one of the IIIB-family elements in the periodic table such as boron and indium, and the VB-family elements in the periodic table such as phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135">The present application is based on Japanese priority applications No. 2001-268520 filed on Sep. 5, 2001 and No. 2001-291824 filed on Sep. 25, 2001, with the Japanese Patent Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
