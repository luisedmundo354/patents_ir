<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to sensing virtual ground flash memory arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Flash memories with progressively reduced costs have been developed by increasing memory density and reducing die size. One way to reduce die size is to use a virtual ground technique. In a virtual ground technique, the contact is removed from the drain of the flash cell.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one architecture for virtual ground memories, an upper portion of the architecture includes global decode and global select transistors and a lower portion contains flash cell blocks and local decode devices, local Y select transistors, and shunt devices. The shunt devices may have their gates connected to selection circuits. The local Y select transistors have their gates connected to a local bitline. The local Y select transistors are connected between global bitlines and local bitlines. The shunt devices are connected between two local bitlines. Current flow through a primary path includes the global select transistor, global bitline resistor, local Y select transistor, a shunt device, a local bitline RC, and a selected flash cell, as well as a local bitline RC, another local Y select transistor, the global bitline resistance, and the global Y select transistor. Current flow through each device in the path may cause voltage drops.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Selected flash cells may be programmed by a fixed select voltage (VDtrim). The fixed select voltage may be applied at the top of a local bitline when the maximum programming current flows through the farthest cell at the farthest block. The bitline voltage may not exceed the disturb voltage which would cause a disturb of an unselected cell. The actual maximum voltage on a selected local bitline is VDmax.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The difference between VDmax and VDtrim is the drain programming window. The maximum voltage that an unselected cell sees on its drain or source in a virtual ground memory is higher than the voltage seen in conventional flash arrays. Moreover, virtual ground arrays also have a higher worst case local bitline resistance for cells far away from the local select transistor. Therefore, some drain programming window of a virtual ground memory may be lost relative to existing technologies. The window loss may be due, for instance, to local bitline resistance or voltage drops due to shunt devices. Thus, a significant negative margin may potentially be developed in virtual ground memory arrays versus conventional technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, virtual ground array architectures may have an improved drain programming window. In some embodiments, the drain programming window may be enlarged by reducing local bitline resistance, voltage drops due to shunt devices, and voltage drops due to other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a flash memory <b>50</b> may include an array <b>32</b> which uses a virtual ground arrangement. A virtual ground arrangement removes the contact from the drain of the memory cells in the array <b>32</b>. The array <b>32</b> may be addressed by a word line decode circuit <b>52</b> and a column select circuit <b>56</b>. The column select circuit <b>56</b> may be coupled to the sense amplifiers <b>58</b> which provide output data.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the array <b>32</b> may include a polysilicon word line (WL) <b>14</b><i>a </i>which is strapped by a metal word line (not shown). High voltage is applied to the word line <b>14</b><i>a </i>to turn on a selected cell <b>30</b> in adjacent input/output group columns. Unselected word lines may be biased at ground or negative voltage to shut off all the connected cells on those word lines. Since there are generally no contacts at either drain or source, the bitlines <b>16</b> may be formed by diffusions. Then, the diffusion bitlines <b>16</b> are strapped by metal bitlines (not shown) to reduce the resistance. In some embodiments, the density of the bitline straps can be 32 rows per strap or 16 rows/strap. One I/O group of columns may contain 16 bitlines or 32 bitlines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the drains and sources of the cells <b>30</b> are symmetrical. Thus, it is arbitrary which one is called the drain and which one is called the source and the higher voltage can be applied to either cell side in some embodiments. However, it may be advantageous to have adjacent I/O groups with sources on opposed sides of the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the “swap” architecture for the array <b>32</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an array select transistor <b>20</b> couples a line having an inherent resistance <b>18</b>. The transistor <b>20</b> enables a connection to a selected global bitline <b>15</b> via the path P<b>1</b>. The path P<b>1</b> includes a global drain select (GY) transistor <b>34</b>, a global source select transistor (GYB) <b>36</b> and the selected cell <b>30</b>. The path P<b>1</b> then extends through the inherent global bitline resistance <b>22</b>. The global bitlines <b>15</b> are indicated above the dotted line and the local bitlines <b>16</b> are indicated below the dotted line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While, normally, a local bitline select transistor (LYS) would be included on each global bitline <b>15</b>, the local bitline select transistors <b>26</b> are moved down onto every other local bitline <b>16</b> in the swap architecture. Then, only one local bitline select transistor <b>26</b> is in the path P<b>1</b>, reducing the voltage drop by the voltage drop of the one eliminated local bitline select transistor from each select path, such as the path P<b>1</b>. Thus, the selected cell <b>30</b> may be accessed along the path P<b>1</b> through the local bitline resistances <b>28</b> and one local bitline transistor <b>26</b> up to the global bitline source select transistor <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is one global bitline <b>15</b> for every other local bitline <b>16</b>. One local bitline <b>16</b> is selected by the even block select line (ESel) and the other adjacent local bitline is selected by a signal on the odd block select line (OSel). The shunt devices <b>24</b> have their gates coupled to ESel or OSel to couple two local bitlines <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the swap architecture, the number of global select transistors <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be (n/2+1)×2, where the number of I/O groups is n. For 16 cells per I/O group, the count of drivers is 18 and for 32 cells per I/O group, the driver count is 34. The number of global bitlines <b>15</b> may be (n+1) per two I/O groups.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The decoding of a shunt device control may be implemented variously. In one embodiment, there is even/odd decoding and in another embodiment there is full decoding. For even/odd decoding there may be a total of three control signals at the local block level: LYS, OSel, and ESel to control the LYS transistors and shunt devices. In the fully decoded structure, the odd and even select lines (OSel, ESel) are eliminated and each bitline is an independent bitline. For the full decoding case, only the shunt device in parallel with the selected flash cell is shut off, providing parallel global bitlines (paths P<b>1</b>AD, P<b>1</b>AS, and P<b>1</b>) and further reducing the global bitline voltage drop. Reducing the global bitline voltage drop may reduce the maximum voltage that unselected cells see. However, such an embodiment would operate substantially as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For a full decode architecture, a source pull down transistor may be provided at the drain side to create global bitline <b>34</b> (GY)/source global bitline <b>35</b> (GYB) transistor pairs. Two pairs of GY/GYB transistors <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be used, without addition for local Y-select (LY) drivers <b>26</b>. If no source pull down transistor is used on the drain path, it is only necessary to add LY control signals and LY gate select drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the number of cells per I/O group is n, the number of LY drivers may be (2n+1)×2. In one embodiment, if the source of the LY select drivers can use the supply voltage signal, then for 16 cells per I/O group, the driver count is 66 and for 32 cells per I/O group, the driver count is 130.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, eliminating one transistor per local bitline select path may reduce the voltage drop by about 150 millivolts. Thus, the architecture depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be called the swap architecture because a shunt device is swapped between the global and the local bitlines.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in accordance with another architecture, which may be called a reduced global bitline architecture, the number of global bitlines <b>15</b> is reduced so that there is only a single global bitline <b>15</b><i>a </i>for the drain and a single global bitline <b>15</b><i>b </i>for the source in one embodiment. A global select transistor <b>34</b> may be provided on the global bitline <b>15</b><i>a </i>and an inherent resistance <b>22</b> is indicated to represent the resistance of the bitline <b>15</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the effect is to move more decoding to the local bitlines <b>16</b>, making the decoding more complicated in the local bitlines <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, the reduced number of global bitlines <b>15</b> allows the global bitlines <b>15</b> to be made wider because there is more available room and because the global bitlines <b>15</b> need not follow the pitch of the local bitlines <b>16</b>. As a result, the resistance of the global bitlines <b>15</b> may be reduced, reducing the voltage drop when accessing a selected cell <b>30</b> through a local bitline <b>16</b> having an inherent resistance <b>28</b>, indicated schematically.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Again, the local select transistors <b>26</b> select the appropriate local bitline <b>16</b> on the selected path P<b>2</b>. The transistors <b>38</b> provide the source connection for the overall path P<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a reduced source connection architecture, every other one of the transistors <b>38</b> in the reduced global bitline architecture, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may be eliminated (as indicated, for example, at <b>39</b>) and replaced with a single transistor <b>38</b>. Thus, for example, on the select path P<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there are no adjacent transistors <b>38</b> on adjacent local bitlines <b>10</b>, as is the case of the path P<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The elimination of transistors <b>38</b> reduces the number of transistors in the path P<b>3</b> compared to the path P<b>2</b>, also reducing the voltage drop.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For a reduced source connection architecture, a source pull down transistor <b>66</b> may be used on the drain side for sensing the I/O cells and the local bitline transistor <b>26</b> results in no change. A control may be provided for the source pull down and the GY select transistor <b>32</b>. Instead of having a single pair of GY/GYB control signals, two pairs of signals may be used. Otherwise, local bitline select transistors <b>26</b> may be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Before programming or sensing, some of the bitlines may need to be discharged first. In a pre-discharge step, the transistors <b>66</b> are turned on to discharge the path P<b>3</b>. Since some local bitlines on the source side are floating during sensing or programming, the sneak path impedance is increased and this leads to reduction of sneak current.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If the number of cells per I/O group is n, the number of local bitline select transistors <b>26</b> may be 3n+4. On the drain side, there are 2×(n+1) drivers and on the source side there are n+2 drivers. Thus, for n=16, the number of drivers is 52 and for n=32, the number of drivers is 100.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the word line <b>14</b><i>a </i>bias may be about 2.8 volts and 70 percent of the cells may have a threshold voltage greater than 2 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, a processor-based system <b>500</b> may be a personal computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, a digital camera, an entertainment system, a media player, or any of a variety of other processor-based systems. It may include a memory <b>530</b>, which may be implemented by the memory <b>50</b>, in some embodiments. It may also include a controller <b>510</b>, which may be, for example, a microprocessor, multiple microprocessors, a digital signal processor, or a microcontroller, to mention a few examples. Coupling the controller <b>510</b> and the memory <b>530</b> may be a bus <b>550</b>. The bus <b>550</b> may also be coupled to other memories, such as a static random access memory (SRAM) <b>560</b>, an input/output device <b>520</b>, and a wireless interface <b>540</b>. The wireless interface <b>540</b> may be any system which enables wireless communications, including cellular wireless communications and networked wireless communications, to mention a few examples. The I/O device <b>520</b> may be any conventional I/O device including, among others, a display, a mouse, a keyboard, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, in some embodiments, wireless communications may be implemented by the system <b>500</b> in which messages stored in the memory <b>530</b> may be communicated over the wireless interface <b>540</b>. As one example, the wireless interface <b>540</b> may be a dipole antenna. Battery power <b>580</b> may be supplied in some embodiments, although the present invention is not limited to wireless applications or to battery powered applications.</p>
