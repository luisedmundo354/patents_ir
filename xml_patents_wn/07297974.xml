<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a radiation image recording medium, which is capable of recording a radiation image when it is exposed to radiation carrying image information, and which comprises a plurality of transparent linear electrodes for reading of an electric charge signal formed in accordance with the recorded radiation image. This invention also relates to an image displaying medium, which is capable of displaying image information in accordance with an alteration in optical characteristics caused to occur by voltage application performed in accordance with the image information, and which comprises a plurality of transparent linear electrodes to be applied with the voltage in accordance with the image information.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various radiation image recording media, which are capable of generating electric charges when being exposed to radiation carrying image information of an object, and which are capable of recording a radiation image of the object through accumulation of the electric charges, have heretofore been proposed and used in practice in medical fields, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As one of the radiation image recording media described above, there has been proposed a radiation image recording medium, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">i) a first electrode layer, which has transmissivity to radiation,</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">ii) a recording photo-conductor layer, which generates electric charges when it is exposed to the radiation,</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">iii) a charge transporting layer, which acts as an insulator with respect to electric charges having a certain polarity, and which acts as a conductor with respect to electric charges having an opposite polarity,</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">iv) a reading photo-conductor layer, which generates electric charges when it is exposed to reading light, and</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">v) a second electrode layer, which is constituted of transparent linear electrodes having transmissivity to the reading light and reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes for blocking the reading light, the transparent linear electrodes and the reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes being arrayed alternately and in parallel,</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">the layers being overlaid in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The proposed radiation image recording medium is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,901.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, and <b>7</b>C are explanatory views showing how a conventional radiation image recording medium operates. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, in cases where a radiation image is to be recorded with the radiation image recording medium having the constitution described above, a negative high voltage is applied to a first electrode layer <b>1</b> of the radiation image recording medium from a high voltage electric power source, which is connected to the first electrode layer <b>1</b>. Also, in this state, radiation carrying image information of an object is irradiated to the first electrode layer <b>1</b>. The radiation, which has been irradiated to the first electrode layer <b>1</b>, passes through the first electrode layer <b>1</b> and impinges upon a recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b>. As a result, pairs of positive and negative charges are generated at an area of the recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b>, which area has been exposed to the radiation. Of the pairs of positive and negative charges having been generated in the recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b>, the positive charges move toward the first electrode layer <b>1</b>, which has been charged negatively. The positive charges, which have thus moved toward the first electrode layer <b>1</b>, combine with the negative charges of the first electrode layer <b>1</b> and disappear. Of the pairs of positive and negative charges having been generated in the recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b>, the negative charges move toward a second electrode layer <b>5</b>, which has been charged positively. A charge transporting layer <b>3</b> acts as the insulator with respect to the negative charges. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the negative charges, which thus move within the recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b> and toward the second electrode layer <b>5</b>, are accumulated at a charge accumulating section <b>6</b>, which is an interface between the recording photo-conductor layer <b>2</b> and the charge transporting layer <b>3</b>. The recording of the radiation image is performed through the accumulation of the negative charges at the charge accumulating section <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, in cases where the radiation image having thus been recorded is to be read out from the radiation image recording medium, the reading light is irradiated to the radiation image recording medium from the side of the second electrode layer <b>5</b>. The reading light, which has been irradiated to the second electrode layer <b>5</b>, passes through a transparent linear electrode <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the second electrode layer <b>5</b> and impinges upon a reading photo-conductor layer <b>4</b>. As a result, pairs of positive and negative charges are generated in the reading photo-conductor layer <b>4</b>. Of the pairs of positive and negative charges having been generated in the reading photo-conductor layer <b>4</b>, the positive charges combine with the negative charges, which have been accumulated at the charge accumulating section <b>6</b>. Also, of the pairs of positive and negative charges having been generated in the reading photo-conductor layer <b>4</b>, the negative charges combine with the positive charges of the transparent linear electrode <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the positive charges, which flow from a reading light non-transmissive electrode <b>5</b><i>b </i>toward the side of the transparent linear electrode <b>5</b><i>a </i>via the ground. An electric current i caused to occur in this manner is detected by a current detecting amplifier <b>8</b>, which is connected to the transparent linear electrode <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The electric current i is converted into a voltage, and an image signal is thus acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">By way of example, a radiation image of a mamma may be recorded by use of the radiation image recording medium described above, the recorded radiation image of the mamma may then be read out from the radiation image recording medium, and an image signal representing the radiation image of the mamma may thereby be acquired. In such cases, it is necessary for a width of each of pixels constituting the radiation image to be set at approximately 50 μm. Therefore, it is necessary for the width of each of the transparent linear electrodes to be set at approximately 10 μm to 20 μm. However, in cases where the thin transparent linear electrode is formed, since the material for the transparent linear electrode is an oxide material, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), which has a high specific resistance, the line resistance of the transparent linear electrode becomes high. Therefore, thermal noise at the current detecting amplifier becomes high, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired image signal becomes low. Also, in cases where the line resistance of the transparent linear electrode is high, a time constant at the time of the acquisition of the image signal becomes long, and the response speed becomes low. As a technique for reducing the line resistance of the transparent linear electrode, there has been proposed a technique, wherein an opaque electrically-conductive member made from, for example, a metal having an electrical conductivity higher than the electrical conductivity of the transparent linear electrode, is located such that the opaque electrically-conductive member is in contact with the transparent linear electrode. The proposed technique for reducing the line resistance of the transparent linear electrode is described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, with the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565, the opaque electrically-conductive member is located on a top surface of an end region of the transparent linear electrode, which end region extends along the longitudinal direction of the transparent linear electrode. Therefore, the reading light, which impinges upon the end region of the transparent linear electrode, is blocked by the opaque electrically-conductive member, and the electric charges are not capable of being generated at an area of the reading photo-conductor layer, which area is located in the vicinity of the end region of the transparent linear electrode. In cases where the radiation image readout is performed by the utilization of the transparent linear electrodes and the reading light non-transmissive electrodes as in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,901, generation of the electric charges at the area in the vicinity of the end region of each of the transparent linear electrodes contributes markedly to an efficiency, with which the image signal is read out. Therefore, in such cases, if the opaque electrically-conductive member is located on the top surface of the end region of the transparent linear electrode as in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565, an image signal having a sufficient level will not be capable of being acquired, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired image signal will not be capable of being kept high.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,901, the radiation image readout is performed by the utilization of the transparent linear electrodes and the reading light non-transmissive electrodes. Besides the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,901, there has also been proposed a radiation image recording medium, wherein the radiation image readout is performed by the utilization of the transparent linear electrodes alone. In the cases of the proposed radiation image recording medium, wherein the radiation image readout is performed by the utilization of the transparent linear electrodes alone, in order for noise at the current detecting amplifier to be reduced, it is necessary that the inter-neighbor capacity between the adjacent transparent linear electrodes be kept as small as possible. Therefore, it is desired that the ratio of the width of each of the transparent linear electrodes to the array pitch of the transparent linear electrodes is capable of being kept as low as possible. However, such that the ratio of the width of each of the transparent linear electrodes to the array pitch of the transparent linear electrodes may be kept as low as possible, and such that the line resistance of each of the transparent linear electrodes may be kept low, if the opaque electrically-conductive member is located on the top surface of the end region of the transparent linear electrode as in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565, the efficiency, with which the image signal is read out, will not be capable of being kept high.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, besides the radiation image recording media described above, an image displaying medium utilizing the transparent linear electrodes has been proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-433467. The proposed image displaying medium comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">i) a displaying layer, whose optical characteristics alter in accordance with an applied electric field,</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">ii) an optical switching layer, which is capable of generating electric charges for the formation of the electric field when being exposed to an address light for displaying, and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">iii) an electrode layer, which is provided with a plurality of transparent linear electrodes arrayed in parallel with one another, the transparent linear electrodes being capable of transmitting the address light for displaying,</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">the displaying layer, the optical switching layer, and the electrode layer being overlaid in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The proposed image displaying medium is operated in the manner described below. Specifically, a voltage in accordance with image information is applied selectively to each of the transparent linear electrodes of the electrode layer. Also, the address light, which extends in a direction normal to the longitudinal direction of each of the transparent linear electrodes, is caused to scan from the side of the electrode layer and along the longitudinal direction of each of the transparent linear electrodes. With the irradiation of the address light, electric charges are caused to occur in the optical switching layer. An electric field is formed in the displaying layer by the electric charges occurring in the optical switching layer. The optical characteristics of the displaying layer alters in accordance with the electric field, and the image information is thereby displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the cases of the proposed image displaying medium, in order for quick image displaying to be enabled, it is necessary that the inter-neighbor capacity between the adjacent transparent linear electrodes be kept as small as possible, and that the time constant be kept as short as possible. Therefore, it is desired that the ratio of the width of each of the transparent linear electrodes to the array pitch of the transparent linear electrodes is capable of being kept as low as possible. However, in cases where the ratio of the width of each of the transparent linear electrodes to the array pitch of the transparent linear electrodes is set to be low, the area of each of the transparent linear electrodes, which area contributes to the generation of the electric charges in the optical switching layer, becomes small. Accordingly, a region, at which the image information is not displayed appropriately, occurs in the range of the area of the displaying layer, which range corresponds to the area between the adjacent transparent linear electrodes. Also, quick image displaying may be enabled with the technique, in which the opaque electrically-conductive member is located on the top surface of the end region of the transparent linear electrode as in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565, such that the line resistance may be kept low and such that the time constant may be kept short. However, if the opaque electrically-conductive member is located on the top surface of the end region of the transparent linear electrode as in the cases of the radiation image recording medium described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-284565, since the electric charges are not capable of being generated at the area of the optical switching layer, which area is located in the vicinity of the end region of the transparent linear electrode, a region, at which the image information is not displayed appropriately, will occur in the range of the area of the displaying layer, which range corresponds to the area between the adjacent transparent linear electrodes.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention will hereinbelow be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of the radiation image recording medium in accordance with the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a sectional view taken on line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> comprises a first electrode layer <b>11</b>, which has transmissivity to radiation carrying image information of an object. The radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> also comprises a recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>, which generates electric charges when it is exposed to the radiation. The radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> further comprises a charge transporting layer <b>13</b>. The charge transporting layer <b>13</b> acts as an insulator with respect to electric charges having a certain polarity, which electric charges have been generated in the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>, and acts as a conductor with respect to electric charges having an opposite polarity, which electric charges have been generated in the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>. The radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> still further comprises a reading photo-conductor layer <b>14</b>, which generates electric charges when it is exposed to reading light. The radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> also comprises a second electrode layer <b>15</b>, which is constituted of a plurality of transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . having transmissivity to the reading light and a plurality of reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . for blocking the reading light. The transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . and the reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . are arrayed alternately and in parallel. The first electrode layer <b>11</b>, the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>, the charge transporting layer <b>13</b>, the reading photo-conductor layer <b>14</b>, and the second electrode layer <b>15</b> are overlaid in this order. A charge accumulating section <b>16</b>, which accumulates the electric charges having been generated in the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>, is formed at an interface between the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b> and the charge transporting layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first electrode layer <b>11</b> may be constituted of a material capable of transmitting the radiation. For example, the first electrode layer <b>11</b> may be constituted of a tin dioxide film (SnO<sub>2</sub>), an indium tin oxide (ITO) film, an Idemitsu Indium X-metal Oxide (IDIXO) film (an amorphous light-transmissive oxide film, supplied by Idemitsu Kosan K. K.), or the like, which has a thickness falling within the range of 50 nm to 200 nm. As the first electrode layer <b>11</b>, an Al film or an Au film having a thickness of 100 nm may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the second electrode layer <b>15</b> is constituted of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . and the reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . The transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . may be constituted of one of various materials, which are capable of transmitting the reading light and have an electrical conductivity. For example, as in the cases of the first electrode layer <b>11</b>, the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . may be constituted of ITO, IDIXO, or the like. Alternatively, the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . may be constituted of a metal material, such as Al or Cr, which has a thickness (e.g., approximately 10 nm) such that the metal material is capable of transmitting the reading light. The reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . may be constituted of one of various materials, which are capable of blocking the reading light and have the electrical conductivity. For example, the reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . may be constituted of a metal material, such as Al or Cr, which has a thickness (e.g., approximately 100 nm) such that the metal material is capable of blocking the reading light. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a distance D between the transparent linear electrode <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the reading light non-transmissive linear electrode <b>15</b><i>b </i>in the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> is equal to 10 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b> may be constituted of one of various materials, which are capable of generating the electric charges when being exposed to the radiation. In this embodiment, the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b> is constituted of a material, which contains a-Se as the principal constituent. The material, which contains a-Se as the principal constituent, have the advantages in that a quantum efficiency is comparatively high with respect to the radiation and in that a dark resistance is high. The thickness of the material, which contains a-Se as the principal constituent and constitutes the recording photo-conductor layer <b>12</b>, may be approximately 500 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The charge transporting layer <b>13</b> may be constituted of one of various materials having the characteristics such that the difference between the mobility of the electric charges, which occur in the first electrode layer <b>11</b> at the time of the recording of the radiation image, and the mobility of the electric charges, which have the polarity opposite to the polarity of the electric charges occurring in the first electrode layer <b>11</b>, is as large as possible (e.g., at least 10<sup>2</sup>, and preferably at least 10<sup>3</sup>). By way of example, in cases where a negative voltage is applied to the first electrode layer <b>11</b> at the time of the recording of the radiation image, the charge transporting layer <b>13</b> should preferably be constituted of a material having the characteristics such that the difference between the mobility of the negative charges and the mobility of the electric charges having the opposite polarity, i.e. the positive charges, is large. Specifically, the charge transporting layer <b>13</b> should preferably be constituted of, for example, an organic compound, such as a poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4, 4′-diamine (TPD), or a disk-shaped liquid crystal; or a semiconductor substance, such as a polymer (polycarbonate, polystyrene, PVK) dispersion of TPD, or a-Se doped with 10 ppm to 200 ppm of Cl.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The reading photo-conductor layer <b>14</b> may be constituted of one of various materials, which exhibit the electrical conductivity when being exposed to the reading light. For example, the reading photo-conductor layer <b>14</b> should preferably be constituted of a photo-conductive material containing, as a principal constituent, at least one substance selected from the group consisting of a-Se, Se—Te, Se—As—Te, metal-free phthalocyanine, metallo-phthalocyanine, magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc), phase II of vanadyl phthalocyanine (VoPc), and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The thickness of the reading photo-conductor layer <b>14</b> should preferably fall within the range of 0.1 μm to 1 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment, an opaque good electrically-conductive member <b>17</b> extends on the top surface of a middle region <b>15</b><i>d </i>of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . of the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b>, which middle region is other than end regions <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . The opaque good electrically-conductive member <b>17</b> may be constituted of one of various materials, which have an electrical conductivity higher than the electrical conductivity of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . By way of example, the opaque good electrically-conductive member <b>17</b> may be constituted of Al, Ag, Cu, or the like. Also, in this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a width L<b>1</b> of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a</i>, . . . of the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> is equal to 15 μm, and the width L<b>1</b> of each of the reading light non-transmissive linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . of the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> is equal to 15 μm.

The width L<b>3</b> of each of the end regions <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, which are free from the opaque good electrically-conductive member <b>17</b>, should preferably be longer than the wavelength of the reading light. For example, in cases where blue light having a wavelength of approximately 0.5 μm is utilized as the reading light, the width L<b>3</b> of each of the end regions <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>should preferably be equal to at least 0.5 μm, and should more preferably fall within the range of approximately 1 μm to approximately 2 μm. Also, the total of the widths L<b>3</b>, L<b>3</b> of the two end regions <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>c </i>should preferably be equal to at least ⅓ of the width L<b>1</b> of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>a, . . . </i></p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in cases where the radiation carrying the image information of the object is irradiated to the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b> having the constitution described above, and the radiation image is thereby recorded on the radiation image recording medium <b>10</b>, negative charges in an amount proportional to the radiation dose are accumulated at the charge accumulating section <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The application of the voltage to each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>, . . . is performed in the manner described above, and the line light source <b>40</b> is actuated to irradiate the address light extending along the array direction of the transparent linear electrodes <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>, . . . , along which direction the transparent linear electrodes <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>, . . . stand side by side with one another. The irradiation of the address light is performed from the side of the second electrode layer <b>34</b> of the image displaying medium <b>30</b>. The address light, which has been irradiated from the side of the second electrode layer <b>34</b> of the image displaying medium <b>30</b>, impinges upon the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c </i>of the optical switching layer <b>33</b>. Also, part of the address light, which has passed through the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c </i>and the positive hole transporting layer <b>33</b><i>b</i>, impinges upon the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When each of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c </i>is exposed to the address light, the electric charges are generated in each of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c</i>. As described above, the end regions <b>34</b><i>b</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>of each of the transparent linear electrodes <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>, . . . are free from the opaque good electrically-conductive member <b>35</b>. Therefore, the electric charges are capable of being generated in each of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c </i>by the address light having passed through the end regions <b>34</b><i>b</i>, <b>34</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the electric charges are capable of being generated in a wide range of the area, which range is taken in the array direction of the transparent linear electrodes <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>, . . .

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Of the electric charges having been generated in the range of the area of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, the positive charges move toward the side of the first electrode layer <b>31</b> having been grounded and accumulate at the interface of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>with respect to the displaying layer <b>32</b>. Of the electric charges having been generated in the range of the area of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, the negative charges accumulate at the interface of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>with respect to the positive hole transporting layer <b>33</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also, of the electric charges having been generated in the range of the area of the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, the positive charges move through the positive hole transporting layer <b>33</b><i>b </i>and toward the side of the first electrode layer <b>31</b> having been grounded. The positive charges, which have thus moved through the positive hole transporting layer <b>33</b><i>b </i>and toward the side of the first electrode layer <b>31</b> having been grounded, combine with the negative charges, which have accumulated at the interface of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>with respect to the positive hole transporting layer <b>33</b><i>b</i>. The positive charges described above thus disappear. Of the electric charges having been generated in the range of the area of the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, the negative charges combine with the positive charges of the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>and disappear.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, as a result of the effects described above, of the electric charges having been generated in the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a</i>, only the positive charges accumulate at the interface of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>with respect to the displaying layer <b>32</b>. The electric field is thus formed between the range of the area of the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, and the corresponding range of the area of the first electrode layer <b>31</b>. In accordance with the thus formed electric field, the orientations of major axes of the liquid crystal molecules, which are contained in the liquid crystal layer <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the displaying layer <b>32</b>, alter. Specifically, in the range of the area of the liquid crystal layer <b>32</b><i>a</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been applied with the positive voltage, since the electric field is formed by the positive charges, which have been accumulated in the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a</i>, and between the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the first electrode layer <b>31</b> in the manner as described above, the orientations of the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules coincide with the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. As a result, when the image displaying medium <b>30</b> is seen from the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the aforesaid range of the area of the liquid crystal layer <b>32</b><i>a </i>is displayed as a black area. Also, in the range of the area of the liquid crystal layer <b>32</b><i>a</i>, which range corresponds to the transparent linear electrode <b>34</b><i>a </i>having been grounded, since the electric charges are not generated in the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>c</i>, and since the electric field is not formed between the first electric charge generating layer <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the first electrode layer <b>31</b>, the orientations of the major axes of the liquid crystal molecules become irregular, and light scattering occurs. As a result, when the image displaying medium <b>30</b> is seen from the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the aforesaid range of the area of the liquid crystal layer <b>32</b><i>a </i>is displayed as a white area.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">After the displaying along the one line has been finished in the manner described above, the line light source <b>40</b> is moved in the direction indicated by the arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.

Further, in the same manner as that described above, the displaying of the white area and the black area along the next one line is performed.
