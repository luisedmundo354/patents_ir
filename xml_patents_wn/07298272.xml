<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “back,” “leading,” “trailing,” etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments can be utilized and structural or logical changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following Detailed Description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates radio frequency identification (RFID) system <b>10</b>. RFID system <b>10</b> includes transceiver <b>12</b> and transponder <b>20</b>. Transceiver <b>12</b> includes transceiver antenna <b>14</b>. Transponder <b>20</b> includes transponder antenna <b>22</b>. Signals generated by transceiver antenna <b>14</b> and by transponder antenna <b>22</b> are transferred through medium interface <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Transceiver <b>12</b> of RFID system <b>10</b> is configured to communicate with transponder <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, transceiver <b>12</b> includes a microprocessor, and in another embodiment, transceiver <b>12</b> is coupled to a host system that includes a microprocessor. In one embodiment, transceiver antenna <b>14</b> is integrated within a single transceiver device. In one embodiment, transceiver <b>12</b> includes a separate transceiver circuit device and a separate transceiver antenna <b>14</b>. Transceiver antenna <b>14</b> emits radio frequency signals that are transmitted through medium <b>16</b> to activate transponder <b>20</b>. After activating transponder <b>20</b>, transceiver <b>12</b> reads and writes data to and from transponder <b>20</b>. Transceiver antenna <b>14</b> and transponder antenna <b>22</b> are the conduits between transceiver <b>12</b> and transponder <b>20</b>, and communicate radio frequency signals through medium interface <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, medium interface <b>16</b> is air, and in other embodiments medium interface <b>16</b> includes air and other materials. Transceiver antenna <b>14</b> and transponder antenna <b>22</b> can be of a variety of shapes and sizes, dependent upon the anticipated distance separating them, the type of medium <b>16</b> that is between antennas <b>14</b> and <b>22</b>, and on other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Transceiver <b>12</b> typically performs a variety of functions in controlling communication with transponder <b>20</b>. In one case, transceiver <b>12</b> emits output signals from transceiver antenna <b>14</b>, thereby establishing an electromagnetic zone for some distance adjacent antenna <b>14</b>. When transponder <b>20</b> passes through the electromagnetic zone established by transceiver antenna <b>14</b>, transponder <b>20</b> detects an activation signal from transceiver <b>12</b>. Transponder <b>20</b> typically has integrated circuits that include data that is encoded in memory. Once transponder <b>20</b> is activated with the activation signal, transceiver <b>12</b> decodes data that is encoded in transponder <b>20</b>. For instance, in one embodiment transceiver <b>12</b> performs signal conditioning, parity error checking and correction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Typically, transceiver <b>12</b> emits radio waves in ranges from a few millimeters up to hundreds of feet or more, depending on its output power and upon the radio frequency used. In one case, transceiver <b>12</b> is integrated in a circuit board card that is then coupled to a host computer, which processes the received data and controls some of the communication with transponder <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of transponder <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, transponder <b>20</b> includes transponder antenna <b>22</b>, analog circuitry <b>24</b>, digital circuitry <b>26</b>, and memory <b>28</b>. In various embodiments, memory <b>28</b> can include read only memory (ROM) <b>30</b>, flash memory <b>32</b>, and/or random access memory (RAM) <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Transponder <b>20</b> comes in a variety of shapes and sizes for use in a variety of applications. For example, in one embodiment transponder <b>20</b> is configured as a small cylindrical-shaped tube having a diameter the size of a typical pencil lead. For example, such a transponder can be inserted beneath the skin of an animal to facilitate tracking the animal. In another embodiment, transponder <b>20</b> is screw-shaped such that it is screwed into trees or wooden items for identification or related purposes. In still other cases, transponder <b>20</b> is credit-card shaped for use in a multitude of access and/or security applications. In another embodiment, transponder <b>20</b> is embedded in hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores for security purposes, and in other embodiments it is in heavy-duty relatively large cases that are used to track inter-modal containers or heavy machinery, as well as a variety of other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, transponder <b>20</b> includes one or more types of memory <b>28</b>. For example, in some embodiments memory <b>28</b> includes ROM <b>30</b> to accommodate security data and operating system instructions that are employed in conjunction with analog circuitry <b>24</b> and digital circuitry <b>26</b> to control the flow of data within transponder <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, memory <b>28</b> includes RAM <b>34</b> to facilitate temporary data storage during a time period when transceiver <b>12</b> is interrogating transponder <b>20</b> for a response. In other embodiments, memory <b>28</b> includes flash memory <b>32</b> to store data in transponder <b>20</b> that is non-volatile in order to ensure that the data is retained when transponder <b>20</b> is in a quiescent or power saving state. In some embodiments, memory <b>28</b> includes other types of non-volatile programmable memory, such as programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), and electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). Any one of memory types ROM <b>30</b>, flash memory <b>32</b> (or other non-volatile programmable memory), or RAM <b>34</b> can be used, or any combination thereof can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, transponder <b>20</b> is an active transponder device. An active transponder is powered by an internal energy source, such as a battery configured within analog circuitry <b>24</b>. Such active transponders are typically “read/write,” which means data stored within memory <b>28</b> of transponder <b>20</b> can be rewritten and/or modified. An active transponder can also be powered from an existing source in another electronic device. For example, where transponder <b>20</b> is an active transponder coupled within a computer system, the power supply within the computer system supplies power to the transponder.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, transponder <b>20</b> is a passive transponder device. Passive transponders operate without a separate internal power source and obtain operating power from transceiver <b>12</b>. Rather than having a battery within analog circuitry <b>24</b>, for example, passive tags instead can use a strongly capacitive circuit and a charge pump within analog circuitry <b>24</b>. The capacitive circuit and charge pump are configured to receive radio frequency energy from transceiver <b>12</b> and store it for use within transponder <b>20</b>, for example, to control digital circuit <b>26</b> and memory <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since active transponders accommodate an internal battery, they are typically larger in size than passive transponders. Memory size within an active transponder varies, but can be fairly significant with some systems operating, for example, with up to a megabyte or more of memory. Active transponders also typically have a longer ready range such that transceiver <b>12</b> and transponder <b>20</b> are typically placed apart at greater distances than in the case of passive transponders. In the same way, passive transponders typically have shorter read ranges, but are typically much smaller and lighter than active transponders and are typically less expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to including a battery for active transponders or capacitive circuit and charge pump for passive transponders, analog circuitry <b>24</b> typically include interface circuits for data transfer between transponder antenna <b>22</b> and digital circuitry <b>26</b>. Digital circuitry <b>26</b> in turn typically includes control logic, security logic, and internal logic or microprocessor capabilities. This control logic controls the flow of data to and from memory <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates transponder <b>40</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Transponder <b>40</b> includes transponder antenna <b>42</b>, analog circuitry <b>44</b>, digital circuitry <b>46</b>, read only memory (ROM) <b>50</b>, flash memory <b>52</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>54</b>, and fuse <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, fuse <b>60</b> is configured to allow continued operation of transponder <b>40</b> when not blown. When fuse <b>60</b> is blown, however, transponder <b>40</b> becomes inoperable such that communication with transponder <b>40</b> with a transceiver is no longer possible.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, fuse <b>60</b> is configured to disable transponder <b>40</b> under certain conditions and allow it to function in other conditions. In operation, transponder <b>40</b> is used in conjunction with a transceiver such that a transceiver first sends radio frequency (RF) signals to transponder <b>40</b>. These RF signals are received via transponder antenna <b>42</b> and sent to analog circuitry <b>44</b>. In one embodiment, analog circuitry <b>44</b> includes a capacitive circuit and a charge pump. In this way, received RF signals charge the capacitive circuit within analog circuitry <b>44</b>. The storage energy is then used to energize digital circuitry <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, digital circuitry <b>46</b> includes control circuitry for activating flash memory <b>52</b>, RAM <b>54</b>, and ROM <b>50</b> as well as fuse <b>60</b>. In this way, upon continued or periodic activation by digital circuitry <b>46</b>, fuse <b>60</b> stays enabled such that transponder <b>40</b> sends RF signals back to the transponder. In one embodiment, the transceiver then subsequently interrogates transponder <b>40</b> in order to read a digitized code stored in memory <b>48</b> of transponder <b>40</b>. When RF signals are no longer continually or periodically received by transponder <b>40</b> from the transceiver, however, fuse <b>60</b> will blow and disable transponder <b>40</b>. In this way, transponder <b>40</b> will no longer be able to send RF signals back to the transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, transponder <b>40</b> will no longer receive RF signals from the transceiver when transponder <b>40</b> is out of a set range of the transceiver. In this way, whenever the transponder <b>40</b> is out of this set range of the transceiver, fuse <b>60</b> will blow, thereby disabling transponder <b>40</b>. In one embodiment fuse <b>60</b> is an electronic fuse.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates RFID system <b>80</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. RFID system <b>80</b> includes computer system <b>81</b> having a transceiver <b>82</b>. Transceiver <b>82</b> has a transceiver antenna <b>84</b>, which can be embedded or external to transceiver <b>82</b>. RFID system <b>80</b> further includes first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, which are coupled to first and second system components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>, respectively. Medium interface <b>86</b> is between transceiver antenna <b>84</b> and first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment of the present invention, RFID system <b>80</b> is used in conjunction with assuring the security of computer system <b>81</b>. In the way, RFID system <b>80</b> detects whether first and second system components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> have been removed from the proximity of computer system <b>81</b> by having transceiver <b>82</b> remotely detect the presence of transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. Because transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are fixed to first and second system components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>, RFID system <b>80</b> determines that first and second system components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> have been removed from the proximity of computer system <b>81</b> when transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are out of range of transceiver <b>82</b>. Thus, RFID system <b>80</b> disables computer system <b>81</b> when transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are out of range of transceiver <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, RFID system <b>80</b> utilizes first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> and transceiver <b>82</b>, which is embedded in an electronic module such as computer system <b>81</b>. Transceiver <b>82</b> is configured to scan the proximity of medium interface <b>86</b> specifically for first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. In one embodiment, transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are configured like transponder <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such that each has a memory and a fuse. A unique identification code is stored in each memory of transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. If transceiver <b>82</b> scans and receives the unique code from each of transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, then computer system <b>81</b> is allowed to function normally. If transceiver <b>82</b> scans and does not receive the unique code from each of transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, however, then the fuse (or several fuse links in some embodiments) is blown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, computer system <b>81</b> further includes an embedded-security device such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). TPM is known to those skilled in the art as a means for authenticating internal and external communications to a computer or computer system by using an encrypted digital signature. TPMs typically provide authentication of components of computing systems that are not transferable from system to system. In other words, the security of a computing system can be compromised if the TPM is moved from one system to another. In one embodiment, each of first and second system components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are TPMs. In this way, corresponding transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are embedded in TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. In one embodiment, TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are physically connected within computer system <b>81</b> and in another embodiment TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are coupled externally to computer system <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, with one embodiment of RFID system <b>80</b>, TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>, along with embedded transponders <b>92</b> and <b>92</b>, can be physically disconnected from computer system <b>81</b> without sacrificing or compromising the security of the system, as long as the modules are not moved out of the range established between transceiver <b>82</b> and its associated transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. Thus, for example, TPMs can be removed from computer system <b>81</b> to allow repair, as long as the TPMs and embedded transponders <b>92</b> and <b>92</b> stay within range of associated transceiver <b>82</b>. RFID system <b>80</b> only blows fuses within transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> embedded in TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> when TPMs <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are powered on and far enough away from away from transceiver <b>82</b>. Transceiver <b>82</b> is essentially “keyed” to transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> in that it sends RF signals to transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> in order to receive back the unique code stored therein. If the code is not received, the fuses are blown and the TPM is disabled. In this way, RFID system <b>80</b> provides security of computer system <b>81</b> with an embedded TPM.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> each contain a one-time programmable number in their respective memories. Transceiver <b>82</b> then sends RF signals to the transponders, and receives the one-time programmable number when transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are in range to verify a match. Thus, the transceiver <b>82</b> will only check for a match if it has been programmed with the value of transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are transponder types that are typically attached to the system in a label, or are physically embedded in the computer system. This provides added security benefit. In this way, if the TPM with embedded transponder is removed and placed in a computer system without the matching transceiver, the TPM will be made permanently inoperable. Since, the TPM is typically tied to a particular computer system of a particular system manufacturer, RFID system <b>80</b> appropriately destroys or disables the TPM that has been removed from the proper system. At the same time, however, RFID system <b>80</b> still allows legitimate repair of a system, where the TPM has to be removed, but not moved out of the proximity of the corresponding transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, RF signals received from transceiver <b>82</b> are received by the associated transponder antenna within first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, and sent to analog circuitry, which in one case includes a capacitive circuit and charge pump. Energy stored in the capacitive circuit is then used to control digital circuitry within each of first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. When first and second transponders <b>92</b> stop receiving RF signals, the digital circuitry is configured to activate or blow the fuse such as the transponders become disabled. In this embodiment, continued RF signal from transceiver <b>82</b> is needed to continue enabling the fuses and the transponders.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, RFID system <b>80</b> includes first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, which are active transponders. In this embodiment, first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are configured such that each has a battery or similar energy storage device within the analog circuitry of each transponder. This provides an RFID system <b>80</b> with more flexible range, meaning that first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are operable even when placed a further distance from transceiver <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, RFID system <b>80</b> includes first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, which are passive transponders. In one such embodiment, first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are configured very similarly to transponder <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this way, a capacitive circuit and charge pump are provided within the analog circuitry of each of first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment of these passive first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, each can also further include a charge building device. In this way, radio frequency signals received from transceiver <b>82</b> by first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> builds up additional charge over a period of time. This additional built-up charge can then be used to power the control circuitry within first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. In this way, RF signals are sent by transceiver <b>82</b> to first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> over a first period of time. Subsequently, that charge is released and used to power control circuitry over a second period of time, which is a shorter period of time than the first. In this way, a relatively large signal is generated within each of first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> due to the quicker dispensing of that stored energy relative to how it was received. In one embodiment, the charge building device within passive first and second transponders <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> is a capacitive ladder, or similar circuitry for building and storing energy over time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an alternative embodiment of RFID system <b>80</b>, a transceiver is embedded within the TPM rather than the transponders. Furthermore, the transceiver is configured with a fuse, rather than the transponder. In this way, in operation of the alternative system the TPM with embedded transceiver can also be physically disconnected from computer system <b>81</b> without sacrificing or compromising the security of the system, as long as the modules are not moved out of the range established between the transceiver embedded in the module and its associated transponder. Thus, for example, the TPM can be removed from the computer system to allow repair, as long as the TPM and embedded transceiver stays within range of associated transponder. The alternative RFID system only blows fuses within the transceiver embedded in the TPM when the TPM is powered on and far enough away from away from transponder. In this way, the alternative RFID system provides security of the computer system with an embedded TPM.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, computer system <b>81</b> is a rack-level server implementation where first and second components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are individual servers. In another embodiment, computer system <b>81</b> is an individual server where first and second components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are integrated within computer system <b>81</b>. In this way, first and second components <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are, for example, blade computers, disks, memory, I/O cards, or related components.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of alternate and/or equivalent implementations can be substituted for the specific embodiments shown and described without departing from the scope of the present invention.
