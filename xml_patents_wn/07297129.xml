<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bed-side information system, particularly to a bed-side information system which is able to display necessary information on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been conventionally impossible to observe information on the human body such as a patient and information on blood processing in real time and simultaneously. To solve this problem, the present inventors have constructed a system which acquires body information and information on blood processing in real time when blood purification is in progress and controls the information appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the above-described apparatus is used, for example, to prevent a blood pressure drop due to a drastic variation in water balance when blood purification is in progress, there is a problem that blood pressure information is not displayed on a screen and it is difficult to grasp their correlation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, there is also a growing demand for predicting the progression of necessary information and adopting appropriate measures in response to the predicted value. To meet this demand, a system capable of also displaying predicted information obtained by predicting a state several hours ahead on a screen is required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been implemented taking into account the above described points and it is an object of the present invention to provide a bed-side information system capable of displaying necessary information on a screen and displaying predicted information obtained by predicting the progression of the necessary information on the same screen.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference now to the attached drawings, Embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view schematically showing an arrangement of a bed-side information system according to Embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bed-side information system according to the present invention is principally constructed of a body information monitor (CMS) <b>11</b> which monitors arterial blood pressures, a Hematocrit monitor (CLM) <b>12</b> which monitors Hematocrit, change blood volume rate and venous blood oxygen saturation and a desktop PC <b>15</b> which displays these information items. The Hematocrit monitor <b>12</b> is connected to a blood circuit of a blood purifying device <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this bed-side information system <b>1</b>, the body information monitor <b>11</b> measures arterial blood pressures (ABP [mmHg]) of a patient <b>14</b>. At this time, the body information monitor <b>11</b> measures systolic arterial blood pressures and diastolic arterial blood pressures and calculates mean arterial blood pressures thereof. Furthermore, the Hematocrit monitor <b>12</b> calculates Hematocrit (Ht [%]), change blood volume rate (ΔBV % [%]) and venous blood oxygen saturation (vSpO<sub>2 </sub>[%]).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The Hematocrit is a volume percentage of red blood cells in blood and ΔBV % can be calculated using a value at the start of blood purification and a value after an arbitrary time has elapsed from the following Expression (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Δ<i>BV</i>%[%]=[(<i>Ht</i><sub>t=0</sub><i>/Ht</i><sub>t=T</sub>)−1]×100  Expression (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where Ht<sub>t=0 </sub>is an Ht value at the start of blood purification and Ht<sub>t=T </sub>is an Ht value after a lapse of (arbitrary) time T.
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Then, the body information monitor <b>11</b> sends information on arterial blood pressures to the desktop PC <b>15</b> and the Hematocrit monitor <b>12</b> sends information on the Hematocrit, change blood volume rate and venous blood oxygen saturation, etc., to the desktop PC <b>15</b>. Then, the desktop PC <b>15</b> displays the arterial blood pressures (ABP), Hematocrit (Ht), change blood volume rate (ΔBV (change rate of ΔBV % for time t)) and plasma refilling rate (PRR [l/hr]) on a screen using these information items. At this time, PRR can be calculated using BV % from the following expression (2):

The information stored in the CMS buffer <b>21</b> and CLM buffer <b>22</b> is output to the analyzing section <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The analyzing section <b>23</b> analyzes the information output from the CMS buffer <b>21</b> and CLM buffer <b>22</b> and controls information to be displayed on the displaying section <b>26</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view showing a managing table in the desktop PC of the bed-side information system according to the present invention. This managing table manages ABP values (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressures) from the body information monitor <b>11</b>, Ht values and ΔBV % values from the Hematocrit monitor <b>12</b>, and PRR values calculated from ΔBV %, body weight (BW) and water removing rate (UFR) input from the operating section <b>24</b> according to the above described Expression (2). The proportion of total weight of blood in the body weight (TBV) necessary to calculate PRR is preset (here 8%). Furthermore, the variation time of ΔBV % (Δt) is calculated by the analyzing section <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The operating section <b>24</b> inputs the body weight (BW) and water removing rate (UFR) and also inputs warning values of various types of information, that is, upper limits and lower limits in a predetermined acceptable range based on the display screen which will be described later. Furthermore, the operating section <b>24</b> selects display items, maximum display time on the vertical axis of trend-graphs and display of prediction (prediction range, prediction time), etc. This managing table also manages information necessary to obtain information to be displayed, that is, information on the body weight (BW), water removing rate (UFR), warning values of various types of information, selection of display items, selection of maximum display time on the horizontal axis of trend-graphs or selection of display of prediction (prediction range, prediction time).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The information controlled by the analyzing section <b>23</b> is output to the displaying section <b>26</b>. The displaying section <b>26</b> displays the information output from the analyzing section <b>23</b>, that is, ABP value (systolic arterial blood pressures and diastolic arterial blood pressures), Ht value, ΔBV % value and PRR value on a screen at a time. An example of this display will be described later. Furthermore, the ABP value (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressures), Ht value and ΔBV % value, vSpO<sub>2 </sub>value, BW, UFR and PRR value are sent from the analyzing section <b>23</b> to the buffer <b>27</b> and stored.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The calculating section <b>25</b> predicts an ABP value (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressures), Ht value and ΔBV % value and PRR value using neural network. Then, the prediction information is output to the analyzing section <b>23</b>. The analyzing section <b>23</b> updates the predicted information items in the managing table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> one by one. Furthermore, the analyzing section <b>23</b> outputs the ABP value (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures), Ht value and ΔBV % value and PRR value including the predicted information to the displaying section <b>26</b>. The displaying section <b>26</b> displays the ABP value (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures), Ht value and ΔBV % value and PRR value including the predicted information on a screen at a time. The managing table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example and the present invention is not limited to this. Therefore, in the present invention, the information managed in the table is only required to include at least the information acquired from the body information monitor <b>11</b> and information acquired from the Hematocrit monitor <b>12</b> and the management items and layout of the table can be modified in various manners.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With regard to the prediction information, the calculating section <b>25</b> calculates a predicted value within a selected prediction range, for example, a 50% prediction range or 80% prediction range. Furthermore, with regard to a prediction time, the calculating section <b>25</b> also calculates a predicted value regarding a selected prediction time. These prediction information items are also stored in the buffer <b>27</b>. The preset prediction range and prediction time are not limited to these values but can be changed as appropriate. Furthermore, the predicted values calculated by the calculating section <b>25</b> are displayed as graphs on the displaying section <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, the calculating section <b>25</b> compares the warning set value input from the operating section <b>24</b> with the current value and if the current value is out of a predetermined acceptable range, the calculating section <b>25</b> outputs a control signal to the warning section <b>28</b>. The warning section <b>28</b> warns based on the control signal. Warning may be performed by displaying a warning sign on a screen or outputting a warning sound.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram for explaining a function of neural network. The neural network is an information processing mechanism created by imitating the structure of a human brain and includes a layered type and interconnecting type. Here, a case where a back propagation learning type which is a typical example of the layered type is used will be explained. If it is possible to predict ABP values (systolic arterial blood pressures, diastolic arterial blood pressures), Ht value, ΔBV % value and PRR value, any neural network other than the back propagation learning type can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The neural network is principally constructed of an input layer <b>31</b>, an intermediate layer <b>32</b>, an output layer <b>33</b> and weight between layers. This weight is controlled by a weight control section <b>34</b> based on the output of the intermediate layer <b>32</b> and/or output layer <b>33</b>. Here, suppose the input layer <b>31</b> has 6 units, the intermediate layer <b>32</b> has 30 units and the output layer <b>33</b> has 1 unit. Furthermore, the input layer <b>31</b> and intermediate layer <b>32</b> each include a unit for inputting a fixed value (bias) as an offset. Thus, the neural network has a plurality of input units and one output unit, calculates a weighted sum of all input values using the weights assigned to the respective units and then applies certain nonlinear conversion and sends the converted values to the output layer. At this time, the weight control section <b>34</b> is given a teacher signal as a correct answer. The weight control section <b>34</b> calculates an error between the output and teacher signal (mean square error) and controls the weights from the error based on a back propagation leaning rule. This controlled weight is assigned to each unit. Processing (learning) is repeatedly performed so as to reduce this mean square error. The processing of the neural network is carried out in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the bed-side information system of the present invention, when, for example, continuous hemofiltration therapy is in progress, six signals are input to the input layer <b>31</b> every 20 seconds and a seventh signal after 20 seconds is predicted and output. More specifically, when a learning coefficient is assumed to be 0.003, if the learning count exceeds approximately 100, the mean square error becomes 0.48 and even if the learning count increases further, the mean square error becomes constant. In this way, six signals are input to the input layer <b>31</b> every 20 seconds and the seventh signal after 20 seconds is predicted and output. The predicted value obtained in this way is output to the analyzing section <b>23</b> and displayed on the displaying section <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, it is possible to predict each information item after approximately 20 seconds and also display the predicted information on a screen. Here, for simplicity of explanation, a case where six signals are input and the seventh signal is predicted and output has been explained, but it is possible to predict up to information after several hours by changing the structure of the neural network (by changing the number of units, learning coefficient, number of intermediate layers). This allows the doctor to take appropriate measures based on the predicted information.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, an example of the display on a screen in the bed-side information system according to Embodiment of the present invention will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> show examples of the display on a screen in the bed-side information system according to Embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">This embodiment will explain a case where the body information is arterial blood pressures (ABP) and blood information is Hematocrit (Ht), change blood volume rate (ΔBV %) and plasma refilling rate (PRR), but the body information and blood information of the present invention are not limited to these information items and can be changed in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">On the left of the screen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are an ABP display item selection button <b>41</b>, ABP current value display area <b>42</b>, systolic ABP warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>43</b>, Ht current value display area <b>44</b>, Ht warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>45</b>, ΔBV % current value display area <b>46</b>, ΔBV % warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>47</b>, PRR current value display area <b>48</b> and PRR warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>49</b>. Furthermore, on the left of the screen are warning buttons <b>50</b> to warn (e.g., issue an alarm sign) in case of being out of a predetermined acceptable range provided for the respective information items and pressing these buttons makes it possible to input an upper/lower limit (warning set value (upper/lower limit) within a predetermined acceptable range.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At the bottom of the screen are a display time selection button <b>51</b> and a maximum display time display area <b>52</b>. At the top of the screen are a water removing rate display area <b>53</b>, a current time display area <b>54</b>, a body weight display area <b>55</b>, an elapsed time display area <b>56</b>, a prediction warning sound button <b>57</b>, a prediction warning display button <b>58</b> and a prediction button <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The screen further displays a trend-graph of systolic ABP, trend-graph of diastolic ABP, trend-graph of Ht, trend-graph of ΔBV % and trend-graph of PRR and shows a warning value display line specific to each information item. This warning value display line can be changed based on the setting of the warning value which will be described later as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On this display screen, pressing the display item selection button <b>41</b> shows a display item area <b>61</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Here, it is possible to select items to be displayed on the screen (body information and blood information to be displayed). Here, when information is selected, the analyzing section <b>23</b> refers to the managing table, extracts the selected information and displays it on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Pressing the trend-graph display time selection button <b>51</b> shows a display time area <b>62</b> on the trend-graph horizontal axis as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Here, if a maximum display time on the horizontal axis of the trend-graph is selected, the scale on the horizontal axis of the trend-graph is changed according to the maximum display time selected. Furthermore, the selected maximum display time is displayed in the maximum display time display area <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Pressing a warning button, for example, the ABP warning button shows an ABP warning value setting area <b>63</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Here, entering a lower limit and upper limit of systolic blood pressures shows an upper limit value and a lower limit value in the systolic ABP warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>43</b>. The same applies to other information (Ht, ΔBV %, PRR) and pressing the warning button and entering the lower limit value and upper limit value causes the Ht warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>45</b>, ΔBV % warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>47</b> and PRR warning set value (upper/lower limit) display area <b>49</b> to display their respective upper limit and lower limit values.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Pressing a current value display area, for example, the ABP current value display area <b>42</b> shows an ABP vertical axis display area <b>64</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here, entering a maximum value and width sets the display scale of an ABP trend-graph and displays the ABP trend-graph on that scale. The same applies to other information items (Ht, ΔBV %, PRR) and pressing the current value display areas <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and entering a maximum value and width causes the Ht current value display area <b>44</b>, ΔBV % current value display area <b>46</b> and PRR current value display area <b>48</b> to display their respective maximum values and widths. Selecting an automatic setting on the display of the ABP vertical axis automatically shows a preset maximum value and width or a maximum value and width of measured values for a certain period of time that can be displayed in the current value display area.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Pressing the prediction button <b>59</b> shows a prediction display area <b>65</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Here, selecting a prediction range and prediction time shows prediction information corresponding to only the prediction range and prediction time. For example, a 50% prediction range <b>67</b> is displayed outside and an 80% prediction range <b>66</b> is displayed inside in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. It is preferable to show the 50% prediction range <b>67</b> and 80% prediction range <b>66</b> color-coded to be easily readable. Here, up to prediction information several hours later is displayed on the screen using neural network having a structure which makes it possible to obtain prediction information several hours later.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, pressing the prediction warning display button <b>58</b> shows a prediction warning point for each information item. When this prediction warning point is reached, a warning is displayed. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, pressing the prediction warning sound button <b>57</b> outputs a warning sound when the prediction warning point is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Such a display shows all information items obtained (body information and blood information) on a screen and allows the doctor to recognize necessary information at a glance. Furthermore, since prediction information can also be displayed on a screen, it is possible to recognize the trend of necessary information and the doctor can take appropriate measures beforehand based on the trend.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">This embodiment has explained the case where information on arterial blood pressures is used as body information, but it is also possible to use noninvasive blood pressures (NIBP) or cardiac rate as the body information. Furthermore, it is also possible to acquire and display peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output as the body information as factors determining a blood pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A blood pressure is considered to be affected by elasticity of blood vessels, pulsation, cardiac contractile force, circulating blood volume, thickness of blood vessels and blood viscosity. Among these factors, elasticity of blood vessels, thickness of blood vessels and blood viscosity are related to the above-described peripheral vascular resistance, while pulsation, cardiac contractile force and circulating blood volume are related to the above described cardiac output Among these factors, elasticity of blood vessels, pulsation, cardiac contractile force and thickness of blood vessels are affected by autonomic nerve, while circulating blood volume and blood viscosity are affected by water balance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Therefore, directly measuring or calculating these parameters makes it possible to obtain accurate blood information. Thus, predicting these parameters using neural network makes it possible to obtain accurate blood pressure information even up to several hours later and allows the doctor to take more appropriate measures.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, it is also possible to collect waveform information of an electrocardiogram as autonomic nerve information in a computer, analyze pulsation variation (variation in intervals between R-waves in a electrocardiogram; R-wave refers to the highest part in an electrocardiogram waveform of one pulse) using, for example, a maximum entropy method, calculate and display the following indices as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(1) Index indicating activity (LF/HF power (ratio of LF power to HF power))</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(2) Indices indicating activity of parasympathetic nerve (HF power (power (msec×msec) of high frequency component of 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), HF/Total power (ratio of HF power to total power), entropy (disorder of beat intervals, amount of data to be analyzed is less than 4 sec, including autonomic nerve activity other than activity of parasympathetic nerve))
<br/>
(3) Indices indicating activity of sympathetic nerve+parasympathetic nerve (LF power (power (msec×msec) of low frequency component of 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, amount of data to be analyzed requires 30 sec, values are displayed every 2 sec), LF/total power (ratio of LF power to total power))
<br/>
(4) Other indices concerning autonomic nerve (total power (power of all frequency components), VLF power (power (msec×msec) of frequency component of 0.003 to 0.04 Hz, amount of data to be analyzed requires 300 sec, values are displayed every 4 sec), ULF-1 power (power (msec×msec) of frequency component of 1/10,000 to 1/2,000 Hz, amount of data to be analyzed requires 1000 sec, values are displayed every 16 sec), ULF-2 power (power (msec×msec) of frequency component of 1/2,000 to 0.003 Hz, amount of data to be analyzed requires 1800 sec, values are displayed every 8 sec), gradient of power spectrum (gradient of power spectrum in a frequency band of 1/10,000 to 1/100 Hz, amount of data to be analyzed is 10000 sec, values are displayed every approximately 30 sec, one of indices expressing comfort)
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this embodiment, information which seems to be the cause for affecting the body, for example, information on chemicals administered to the body or information known from the amount of water content and excretions of a patient can also be additionally used for prediction using neural network. This makes it possible to accurately obtain a predicted value and allows the doctor to take appropriate measures.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment and can also be implemented modified in various ways. For example, the numerical values and display items in the above-described embodiment are only examples and the present invention is not limited to them and can be implemented modified in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, the present invention comprises body information acquiring means for acquiring body information of a patient, blood purifying means for purifying blood of the patient, the blood purifying means having a blood circuit for circulating the blood, blood information acquiring means for acquiring blood information obtained from the blood, the blood information acquiring means connecting to the blood circuit, and display means for displaying the body information and the blood information, the display means connecting to the body information acquiring means and the blood information acquiring means, wherein the display means displays the body information and the blood information on a screen, and can thereby display necessary information on the same screen and display predicted information obtained by predicting the progression of necessary information on the same screen.</p>
