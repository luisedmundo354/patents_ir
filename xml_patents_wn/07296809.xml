<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to vehicle suspensions and, in particular, to a system used for alignment of a vehicle suspension and axle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Disclosure of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional vehicle suspension system, a suspension control arm has a first end rigidly connected to an axle of the vehicle and a second end pivotally connected to a bracket descending from the vehicle frame. The second end of the control arm may terminate in a bushing. The bracket generally includes first and second spaced walls that receive the bushing therebetween. A fastener extends through the first wall of the bracket, through the bushing, and through the second wall of the bracket. The fastener may also extend through one or more washers disposed on either side of the bushing between the first and second walls of the bracket. A nut is used to secure the fastener in place relative to the bracket and the control arm pivots about the fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional suspension systems must be aligned in a fore-aft direction to adjust the fore-aft position of the axle relative to the vehicle frame and thereby align the wheels that are supported on the axle. Improper alignment may lead to premature tire wear among other problems. In most conventional suspension systems, alignment is achieved by moving the control arm relative to the bracket descending from the frame. Each of the spaced walls of the bracket generally includes an elongated slot having a major axis that is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The fastener upon which the control arm pivots is moved within these slots to cause corresponding movement in the suspension control arm and axle. In some conventional suspension systems, a weld collar is disposed about the fastener and the position of the collar is adjusted to move the fastener. The collar is then welded to the frame bracket once proper alignment is achieved. These conventional systems are disadvantageous because realignment of the suspension and axle requires removal of the existing welds and the installation of new welds—a process that requires a relatively large amount of time. In other conventional suspension systems, an eccentric cam is disposed about the fastener and the cam is guided by one or more guides on the frame bracket. Rotation of the cam causes displacement of the fastener within the slots of the frame bracket and thereby adjusts the alignment of the suspension and axle. Although these latter systems enable the suspension to be realigned in a relatively short period of time, the systems require additional components and machining of existing suspension components thereby increasing the cost, weight, and complexity of the suspension. These alignment systems may also have a relatively low load capacity that discourages their use with trailers and other high load vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventors herein have recognized a need for a vehicle suspension that will minimize or eliminate one or more of the above-mentioned deficiencies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a vehicle suspension and, in particular, a system used for alignment of a vehicle suspension and axle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A suspension for a vehicle in accordance with the present invention includes a suspension control arm connected to an axle of the vehicle and having one end pivotally connected to a bracket extending from a frame of the vehicle. The bracket includes first and second plates spaced from one another and defining aligned, elongated openings. The first plate further defines an arcuate aperture proximate said elongated opening. The inventive suspension further includes a cam rotatable relative to the first plate of the bracket. The cam defines an aperture and a nose aligned with the elongated opening in the first plate. The nose may be configured for insertion and movement within the elongated opening of the first plate. The cam may further define a pin configured for insertion and movement within the arcuate aperture of the first plate of the bracket. A fastener extends through the aperture in the cam, the elongated openings in the first and second plates of the bracket, and the end of the suspension control arm. Rotation of the cam may cause a corresponding movement of the pin along the arcuate aperture of the first plate of the bracket and of the fastener along the elongated openings in the first and second plates of the bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A suspension in accordance with the present invention has several advantages as compared to conventional suspension systems. First, the inventive system does not require the installation or removal of welds during the alignment process and, therefore, requires less time for realignment of the suspension as compared to many conventional systems. Second, the inventive alignment mechanism has an increased load capacity and may be used with trailers and other high load vehicles. Third, the inventive system is lightweight and uses simple, low-cost methods to manufacture components of the inventive system. As a result, the inventive system weighs less than most conventional systems and is less costly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features and objects of this invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings illustrating features of this invention by way of example.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to identify identical components in the various views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of a vehicle <b>10</b>. Vehicle <b>10</b> may include a frame <b>12</b>, one or more axles <b>14</b>, wheels <b>16</b>, and a suspension <b>18</b> in accordance with the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, vehicle <b>10</b> comprises a semi-trailer. It should be understood, however, that the present invention may find application in a wide variety of vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Frame <b>12</b> provides structural support to the body of vehicle <b>10</b>. Frame <b>12</b> is conventional in the art and may be made from conventional metals and metal alloys such as steel. Frame <b>12</b> may include a pair of longitudinal rails (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and cross-members as is conventional in the art. Frame <b>12</b> may also include a plurality of mounting brackets, such as bracket <b>20</b>, for mounting various components of vehicle <b>10</b> including suspension <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, bracket <b>20</b> will be described in greater detail.

Cam <b>54</b> may be generally pear-shaped. However, it should be understood by those in the art that cam <b>54</b> may comprise a variety of shapes, such as a rectangular shape, without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Cam <b>54</b> may be made from conventional metals and metal alloys such as steel. The components of the inventive rotary cam alignment system, including cam <b>54</b>, are manufactured using simple low cost methods. In accordance with the low cost manufacturing methods of system components, cam <b>54</b> may be stamped or laser cut depending on the required quantity of components desired. Cam <b>54</b> defines a nose <b>72</b> and a follower pin <b>74</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Nose <b>72</b> cooperates with slot <b>30</b> to cause movement of a fastener <b>76</b> (to be described in detail further below) in a fore and aft direction enabling alignment of the suspension <b>18</b>. Nose <b>72</b> is generally circular in shape and is recessed with slot <b>30</b> upon assembly.

Once the proper predetermined position has been established for the fastener <b>76</b> in slots <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, fastener <b>76</b> may then be secured in place using washers <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> and nut <b>92</b> in a conventional manner. Proper alignment of suspension <b>18</b> may minimize tire wear. Rotation of cam <b>54</b> causes a corresponding movement of follower pin <b>74</b> in arcuate-shaped aperture <b>44</b> and nose <b>72</b> in slot <b>30</b>. This action moves fastener <b>76</b> in a fore-aft direction within the elongated openings <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> in the bracket side walls <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a method for aligning a vehicle suspension <b>18</b> and axle <b>14</b> in accordance with the present invention will be described. The method includes the step of providing a suspension control arm <b>46</b> connected to the axle <b>14</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b> and having an end pivotally connected to a bracket <b>20</b> extending from a frame <b>12</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b>. The bracket <b>20</b> includes plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> spaced from one another and defining aligned elongated openings <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. Plate <b>26</b> further defines an arcuate aperture <b>44</b> proximate elongated opening <b>30</b>. The method further includes the step of providing a cam <b>54</b> configured for rotation relative to bracket <b>20</b> with cam <b>54</b> defining an aperture <b>78</b> and a nose <b>72</b> aligned with elongated opening <b>30</b> in plate <b>26</b> of bracket <b>20</b>. Nose <b>72</b> is configured for insertion and movement within elongated opening <b>30</b> of plate <b>26</b>. Cam <b>54</b> further defines a pin <b>74</b> configured for insertion and movement within arcuate aperture <b>44</b> of plate <b>26</b> of bracket <b>20</b>. The method further includes the step of providing a fastener <b>76</b> extending through aperture <b>78</b> and nose <b>72</b> of cam <b>54</b>, the elongated openings <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> in plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the bracket <b>20</b>, and the end of suspension control arm <b>46</b>. The method may further include the step of providing a disc <b>56</b> with a nose <b>82</b> aligned with the elongated opening <b>28</b> in plate <b>24</b> of the bracket <b>20</b>, the nose <b>82</b> configured to receive the fastener <b>76</b>.
