<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a chip adapter seat, and in particular to a chip adapter seat for positioning and connecting a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A desktop or laptop computer is constituted by a hardware and software. The hardware usually comprises a motherboard, CPU, memory, hard disk driver, display card, sound card, power supply and the like. The hard driver stores a system software and data. The memory is used to be a buffer for reading data so as to accelerate the processing speed of the hardware system. On the motherboard, various kinds of chips, connectors and electronic elements having different sizes and specifications are arranged and soldered. The chip is used for storing or performing the computation. After a long-term operation, the occurrence of damage is inevitable. Further, when the computer is to be upgraded and thus needed to change part of chips, it is necessary to detach the chip from the motherboard. Therefore, it is an important issue to provide an adapter seat capable of easily detaching the chip from the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in a combined structure of a conventional chip and a circuit board, a plurality of pins <b>11</b><i>a </i>project outwardly from two corresponding end faces of the chip <b>10</b><i>a</i>. At the corresponding positions on the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a</i>, a plurality of connecting pieces are provided and each connecting piece is used for abutting and connecting to each pin <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the chip <b>10</b><i>a</i>. In assembling, the connecting pieces on the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a </i>are coated with soldering agent such as solder paste. The chip <b>10</b><i>a </i>is positioned to a position in which the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a </i>is to be located. Each pin <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the chip <b>10</b><i>a </i>corresponds to each connecting piece of the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Then, a soldering operation is performed to combine the chip <b>10</b><i>a </i>with the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the combined structure of the chip and the circuit board, there are still some problems existing in actual practice. Since the chip <b>10</b><i>a </i>is operated for a long time, the chip may be inevitably burned down and damaged due to the overload current or unsteady current. In the repairing procedure, each soldering point should be welded one by one, and then the residue of soldering agent is removed. After this, another new chip <b>10</b><i>a </i>is made to connect with the circuit board <b>20</b><i>a</i>. In this way, not only various kinds of special tools are necessary, but also the time for repairing is increased. Further, if the computer is to be upgraded and needed to change part of chips, it is also necessary to perform the above-mentioned complicated procedure. Therefore, the practicability and economic efficiency thereof are greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above the drawbacks, the inventor proposes the present invention to overcome the above problems based on his expert experiences and deliberate researches.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is to provide a chip adapter seat capable of rapidly changing another chip without complicated detaching process when the chip is damaged. With this arrangement, the repairing procedure becomes simple and convenient. Further, it can be used to connect to various kinds of chips having different sizes, thereby to increase the versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a chip adapter seat for positioning and connecting to a chip, which comprises an insulating seat body, a plurality of terminals and a pressing element. The insulating seat body has an accommodating space for arranging the chip. On the corresponding sides of the accommodating space, a plurality of terminal-receiving grooves is provided to correspond to the chip pins. Each terminal-receiving groove is provided with a terminal therein. On end of the each terminal is electrically connected to the chip pin, and the other end thereof projects from the outside of the periphery of the insulating seat body. The pressing element is connected above the accommodating space of the insulating seat body for pressing the chip in the accommodating space of the insulating seat body.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an assembled view showing the state in which the present invention is connected to a circuit board. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an assembled cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an assembled cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> taken from another direction. The chip adapter seat of the present invention can be provided at a predetermined position on the circuit board <b>6</b>. The positions at which the circuit board <b>6</b> is to be soldered are coated previously with soldering agent such as soldering paste. Then, the chip adapter seat is positioned on the circuit board <b>6</b> with the soldering segment <b>22</b> of each terminal <b>20</b> abutting against the connecting piece of the circuit board <b>6</b> and soldered thereto. Subsequently, a chip <b>5</b> is positioned into the accommodating space <b>11</b> of the insulating seat body <b>10</b>. A plurality of pins <b>51</b> extends outwardly from two corresponding sides of the chip <b>5</b>. Each pin <b>51</b> abuts against the contacting segment <b>21</b> of each corresponding terminal <b>20</b>. Then, the pressing element <b>30</b> covers on the chip <b>5</b> by using the projecting shaft <b>31</b> as a center of rotation. The locking groove <b>32</b> of the pressing element <b>30</b> locks onto the locking hook <b>15</b> of the insulating seat body <b>10</b>. At the same time, the middle part of the pressing element <b>30</b> just presses on the chip <b>5</b> to bring each pin <b>51</b> of the chip <b>5</b> into close contact with the contacting segment <b>21</b> of each terminal <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is an assembled cross-sectional view showing the state in which another embodiment of the present invention is connected to a circuit board. In the present invention, since the top face of the contacting segment <b>21</b> of each terminal <b>20</b> in a free state is located higher than the bottom surface of the accommodating space <b>11</b> of the insulating seat body <b>10</b>, the chip adapter seat can not only be used for connecting to the above chip <b>5</b>, but also to another chip <b>5</b>′ having a slightly smaller thickness than that of the chip <b>5</b>. When the pressing element <b>30</b> is locked to the insulating seat body <b>10</b>, the inner side face thereof abuts against the upper surface of the chip <b>5</b>′. Although the bottom surface of the accommodating space <b>11</b> of the insulating seat body <b>10</b> does not contact with the bottom surface of the chip <b>5</b>′, the electrical connection between the pin <b>51</b> of the chip <b>5</b>′ and the contacting segment <b>22</b> of each terminal <b>20</b> can be still achieved. Therefore, the chip adapter seat of the present invention can be used for connecting to the chips <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>′ having different thickness, thereby to increase the versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is an assembled view showing another embodiment of the present invention. The pressing element <b>30</b> can be made of metallic materials. The inner surface thereof is adhered to a heat-conducting piece <b>40</b>. The heat-conducting piece <b>40</b> can be heat-conducting glue, graphite patch or any other materials having good heat conductivity. With the above arrangement, not only the heat generated by the operation of the chip can be conducted out, but also the close abutment between the pressing element <b>30</b> and the chip <b>5</b> can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it is an assembled cross-sectional view showing the state in which a further embodiment of the present invention is connected to a circuit board. The terminal <b>20</b> comprises a contacting segment <b>21</b> and a soldering segment <b>22</b> bending downwardly from one side of the contacting segment <b>21</b>. The contacting segment <b>21</b> is electrically connected to the pin <b>51</b> of the chip <b>5</b>′. The soldering segment <b>22</b> is fixedly soldered on the circuit board <b>6</b>. In this way, the total height of the chip adapter seat can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the above, the chip adapter seat of the present invent indeed involves the industrial applicability, novelty and inventive steps. Further, since the construction of the present invention has not been published or put to public use prior to applying for patent, the present invention conforms to the requirements for a utility model patent.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the present invention has been described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details thereof.
