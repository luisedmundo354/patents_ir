<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for optical receiver circuit protection includes a bias source, a bias monitor, and a comparator. The bias source is to provide a bias voltage to an optical receiver. The bias monitor is coupled to measure a current through the optical receiver, where the current changes responsive to received optical energy. A comparator is coupled to the bias monitor, where the comparator has a first state if the current is less than a threshold current level and where the comparator has a second state if the current is greater than the threshold current level. The bias source is coupled to be enabled responsive to the comparator switching to the first state and disabled responsive to the comparator switching to the second state.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to optical receiver circuits, and in particular but not exclusively, relates to protection of optical receivers during high levels of received optical power.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The ever-increasing requirements of today's optical-network systems require a sensitive device to accurately receive data and measure optical power. As the requirements for high data rates grow, more and more systems will transition to high-speed and high-sensitivity optical receivers. The designers of these optical-network systems have many types of optical receivers from which to choose. One such choice for a fast and highly sensitive optical receiver is an Avalanche Photo Diode (“APD”).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">APDs differ from other photodiodes in that APDs can provide gain, meaning that the ratio of incoming photons to outgoing electrons is greater than 1:1. This ratio, or avalanche multiplication factor, is controlled by a reverse bias voltage applied across the APD. APDs provide significant advantages over other types of optical receivers. Of particular note is that APDs exhibit low noise, broad spectral and frequency responses, and have high gain ranges provided by their internal photo-electronic signal gains.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The difficulty with using APDs is their high cost and their vulnerability to damage due to high-levels of received optical power. For example, APDs are often used in laser-based optical-fiber systems, such as wave division multiplexed (“WDM”) networks. The Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (“EDFA”) is a device in the WDM network that boosts the signal in the optical fiber. However, the EDFA amplifies all channels in a WDM signal simultaneously, so as wavelength channels are added or dropped a high optical power spike can occur on one of the newly added or remaining channels. This high optical power spike causes a rapid increase in total current that flows through a biased APD and thereby may cause permanent damage to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To maintain reliability of the optical network, the optical receiver should be able to continue to operate, without damage, after exposure to periods of high optical power. To operate continuously, rapid and effective safety mechanisms should be in place to detect such high optical power conditions and correspondingly protect the optical receiver.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once current I<sub>TOTAL </sub>has dropped below threshold current level <b>302</b>, due to removal of the bias voltage, process <b>600</b> proceeds to a process block <b>618</b> where reset timer <b>126</b> generates a time delay <b>304</b>. Upon expiration of time delay <b>304</b>, process <b>600</b> returns to process block <b>602</b>, where reset timer <b>126</b> re-enables bias source <b>102</b>, causing the bias voltage to be re-applied to optical receiver <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The shutdown mode now having been completed, AGC <b>502</b> switches to a closed-loop mode, initially setting the optical attenuation of VOA <b>506</b> to a relatively high level. By way of example, the illustrated embodiment, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, shows the VOA control voltage set to about 5V at the end of time delay <b>304</b>. In this embodiment, the 5V control voltage corresponds to a VOA attenuation of about 30 dB. In process block <b>607</b>, AGC <b>502</b> adjusts the optical attenuation of VOA <b>506</b>, such that current I<sub>TOTAL </sub>trends towards operating current level <b>706</b>. AGC <b>502</b> tracks small-signal changes in input voltage V<sub>I </sub>caused by small signal changes in the received optical power, such that current I<sub>TOTAL </sub>is maintained about the operating current level <b>706</b>.</p>
