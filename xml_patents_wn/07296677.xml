<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a hinged stacked array of trays for holding media discs and, more particularly, to a container containing such a hinged stacked array of trays.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Trays are often used as storage means for media discs, such as compact discs (CDs), digital versatile discs (DVDs) and similarly shaped disc-like information storage media. As used herein, the term “media disc” refers to a compact disc (CD), digital versatile disc (DVD), or other disc-shaped media item that is used to store analog or digital information. A useful configuration for packaging multiple media discs is a stacked array of trays. In a stacked array, the hinge edges of the trays are aligned with each other in the stack and a flexible hinge member is affixed to the hinge edges to hinge the trays to each other. Frequently, the stack of trays is mounted onto an interior panel of a jacket with the underside of the bottom tray affixed to the panel, while the jacket is folded around the stack of trays to close the package. When the trays are pivoted from the single stack configuration about the flexible hinge member to form a second stack, as the second stack becomes taller than the first stack, so long as the attachment of the bottom tray to the panel remains intact, stresses are created on the flexible hinge member which cause it to separate from the hinge edges of the trays. At the same time, stresses are placed upon the means, such as adhesives, attaching the underside of the bottom tray to the panel, causing the jacket to pull away from the bottom tray. Whether the resulting damage is to the flexible hinge member or to the cover, both of which are undesirable, the integrity of the overall package is destroyed with possible damage to the media discs stored within the stacked trays.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Packages which include a hinged stack of disc-holding trays are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 03/050812, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. It would be advantageous to design a package which is not susceptible to the type of damage discussed hereinabove, will prevent damage to and pilferage of the media discs, and into/from which the media discs can readily be inserted and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there exists a need for an economical, simple and effective package for storing a hinged, stacked array of trays for holding media discs which will not be damaged by pivoting of the trays from a single stack to form a second stack.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a package including a stack of hinged trays for holding media discs mounted within a protective container, which is economical, simple and easy to use, and which will not be damaged by pivoting of the trays about the flexible hinge member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a package including a protective container for the stack of hinged trays for holding media discs into which media discs may be easily inserted and from which media discs may be easily removed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide such a package wherein the bottom tray in the stack of hinged trays for holding media discs is pivotally mounted within the protective container to permit the bottom tray in the stack to pivot upwardly on its spine side after a majority of the trays in the stack are pivoted about the flexible hinge to form a second stack of trays.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a package including means on the base panel of the protective container for engaging means on the non-spine side of the bottom tray for pivotally mounting the bottom tray within the protective container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing and other objects are achieved in accordance with the present invention by providing a package for holding media discs, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a stack of disc-holding trays including at least a top tray and a bottom tray, each tray in the stack having means for receiving and holding a media disc thereon, each tray in the stack having a hinge edge and an opposite edge, the hinge edges of the trays being aligned with each other, and a flexible hinge member affixed to the hinge edges, the flexible hinge member hinging the trays to each other at the hinge edges;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">an enclosure comprising a base, a spine and a cover for receiving said stack of disc-holding trays within said base with said hinge edges adjacent said spine and said opposite edges remote from said spine, said enclosure having an open position in which media discs can be inserted onto and removed from the disc-holding trays and said trays can pivot about said flexible hinge member to form a second stack of trays and a closed position in which said cover is pivoted about said spine to enclose the stack of disc-holding trays within said base;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">the bottom tray in said stack of disc-holding trays being mounted in said base for pivotal movement about said opposite edge;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">whereby, with the enclosure in its open position, as trays are pivoted about said flexible hinge member from said stack onto a second stack, the hinge edge of said bottom tray pivots away from said base when said second stack contains at least one more tray than the original stack.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a package including first means on said bottom tray and second means on said base, said first and second means interengaging for mounting said bottom tray for pivotal movement in said base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">In still another aspect of the invention, there is provided a package wherein said first means is a slot formed in and extending along said opposite edge of said bottom tray, a portion of said tray remaining below said slot, and said second means comprises means mounted on said floor panel and extending upwardly therefrom, said upwardly extending means having an upwardly opening pivot bore therein, said bore extending in a direction substantially parallel to said opposite edge of said bottom tray and being dimensioned to receive and pivotably retain the portion of said tray remaining below said slot.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">In yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a package in which the slot is formed along the intersection of the planar surface of the bottom tray and a flange depending from the opposite edge of the planar surface of the bottom tray and in which the upwardly extending means comprises a pair of generally parallel posts upstanding from said base panel, said posts being spaced apart at their upper and lower portions a distance at least equal to the width of said depending flange and being spaced apart intermediate their upper and lower portions a distance less than the thickness of said depending flange, whereby the depending flange portion below said slot is inserted into the space between said slots and pressed downwardly until said depending flange portion is forced past the intermediate narrower space between the posts into the space between their lower portions.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a side perspective view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front perspective view, of a media package <b>10</b> according to the present invention. The media package <b>10</b> includes a plurality of disc-holding trays <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> arranged in a stack. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the trays are hinged to each other by a flexible hinge member <b>24</b> that is affixed to one side of the stack of trays. In accordance with the present invention, the hinged stack of trays is pivotally mounted in the interior of a protective container <b>50</b>, such as the well-known clamshell enclosure, to form the package of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The hinge member <b>24</b> is fabricated from a suitable material, such as a styrene-based film or tape, polyethylene, polypropylene, or the like. The hinge member <b>24</b> may be fabricated, for example, from a strip of commercially available poly tape. The hinge member <b>24</b> must be flexible enough to allow the stack of trays to be opened and closed freely, as by pivoting the upper tray, and each succeeding tray, in order, about the flexible hinge to form a second stack of trays next to the original stack of trays, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 AND 7</figref>. In addition, the hinge member must be strong enough to prevent premature failure of the hinge member or separation of the hinge member from trays in the stack. The hinge member may be affixed to the trays using an adhesive, or using a mechanical technique, including techniques using ultrasound or heat.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a perspective view of a tray <b>30</b> that is suitable for use in a media package according to the present invention. The tray <b>30</b> is a rectangular, relatively thin plate-like member, which is formed with a circular central recess <b>32</b> that is shaped to closely receive a media disc and is defined by a circular side wall <b>34</b> extending downwardly from surrounding planar surface <b>36</b> to base <b>38</b>. A peripheral flange <b>39</b> depends from planar surface <b>36</b> abut the entire periphery of tray <b>30</b>. A rosette <b>40</b> for gripping a media disc and holding it within recess <b>32</b> is molded on raised seat <b>42</b> which, itself, is molded on base <b>38</b>. Rosette <b>40</b> may be any conventional rosette well known in the art for engaging the central opening of a media disc placed thereon. Raised seat <b>42</b> provides a circular surface on which the annular area of the media disc which is immediately adjacent the central disc aperture can be supported above the base <b>38</b>. This area of the media disc typically contains no recorded information and, therefore, contact between the media disc in this area and the raised seat will not damage the media disc. The media disc may also be peripherally supported at its outer edges by optional peripheral shelf <b>44</b> formed in circular side wall <b>34</b>. The outer edges of a media disc also, typically, contain no recorded information and supporting media discs at their outer edges provide further assurance that contact of the recorded areas of the media disc with the base will be avoided. Planar surface <b>36</b> of tray <b>30</b> includes diametrically opposed finger wells <b>46</b> which communicate with the base <b>38</b> of recess <b>32</b> to facilitate a user removing a media disc from the recess <b>32</b>. Recess <b>32</b>, rosette <b>40</b> and finger wells <b>46</b> are well known in the media disc packaging art and need not be described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The tray <b>30</b> includes an edge <b>48</b>, referred to herein as a “hinge edge” that is used to hinge the tray <b>30</b> to other trays. The hinge edge <b>48</b> is positioned such that when a plurality of trays are stacked on top of each other, the hinge edges are aligned to receive a hinge member, such as the hinge member <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Opposite to the hinge edge <b>48</b> is the non-spine edge <b>49</b>. At the corners defined between the non-spine edge <b>49</b> and the top edge <b>45</b> and bottom edge <b>47</b> of the tray, arcuate cutouts <b>61</b> are formed to assist in pivoting the trays when they are stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The style, shape, and dimensions of the tray <b>30</b>, including the number and location of finger wells therein and the design of the rosette <b>40</b>, may be varied and are not limited in any way by this disclosure. The tray <b>30</b> may suitably be fabricated from a plastic material that has been injection molded. Suitable materials for the tray include polystyrene and polypropylene. If desired, the tray <b>30</b> can be fabricated from a clear material, such as crystalline polystyrene. The use of a clear material is often desired from an aesthetic point of view. Further, the use of a transparent material for the trays allows a user to see promotional and informational materials which may be affixed to the underside of a tray and to quickly determine which of the trays are empty and which are full.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>, it can be seen that the protective container <b>50</b> consists of a base <b>51</b> having a base panel <b>52</b>, a spine <b>53</b> having a spine panel <b>54</b> and a cover <b>55</b> having a cover panel <b>56</b>, in which the base panel <b>52</b> and cover panel <b>56</b> are separated from the spine panel <b>54</b> by fold lines or creases <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, respectively. Preferably, these fold lines or creases are formed during fabrication as living hinges. The protective container <b>50</b> may suitably be fabricated from a plastic material that has been injection molded. Suitable materials for the tray include polystyrene and polypropylene. If desired, the protective container <b>50</b>, like tray <b>30</b>, can be fabricated from a clear material, such as crystalline polystyrene. Two opposite lateral sides <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and one connecting transverse side <b>66</b> have connected wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>upstanding from base panel <b>52</b> to enclose base panel <b>52</b> on three sides (not including the spine side). The height of the wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>is at least sufficient to enclose the stack of trays which is stored on base panel <b>52</b> and the tray stack within the base is oriented in such a manner that the hinge edges <b>48</b> of the trays are disposed in close alignment with living hinge <b>58</b> and the opposite edges of the trays (non-spine edges) are adjacent the transverse side wall portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>(non-spine side) of the base panel <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">Two opposite lateral sides <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and one connecting transverse side <b>76</b> of cover panel <b>56</b> have upstanding, connected wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>to enclose cover panel <b>56</b> on three sides (not including the spine side). The height of the wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>is desirably less than the height of the corresponding wall portions on the base panel <b>52</b> since the cover panel <b>56</b> and its wall portions merely serve as a lid for the base panel <b>52</b> and its wall portions. In a preferred form of the invention, the upper end portions of wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>are cut away on their outside to define a peripheral outside shoulder <b>78</b> about these wall portions. The remaining upper end portions <b>72</b><i>b</i>, <b>74</b><i>b</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>of wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>are positioned a greater distance inside the marginal edge of the cover panel <b>56</b> than are the wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>51</b> such that, when the cover <b>55</b> is pivoted about living hinge <b>60</b> and then the spine <b>53</b> and the cover <b>55</b> are pivoted about living hinge <b>58</b> to enclose the stack of trays on base panel <b>52</b>, the upper end portions <b>72</b><i>b</i>, <b>74</b><i>b</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>of wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>nest within the wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>51</b>. Two opposite lateral sides <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> of spine panel <b>53</b> have upstanding wall portions <b>77</b><i>a </i>and <b>79</b><i>a </i>which are positioned a greater distance inside the marginal edge of the spine panel <b>54</b> than are the wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>51</b> and the wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b> of the cover <b>55</b>. In this configuration, when the cover <b>55</b> is pivoted about living hinge <b>60</b> and then the spine <b>53</b> and the cover <b>55</b> are pivoted about living hinge <b>58</b> to enclose the stack of trays on base panel <b>52</b>, the spine wall portions <b>77</b><i>a</i>, <b>79</b><i>a </i>are disposed interiorly of wall portions <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>74</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>55</b> and wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the base <b>51</b>. With the stack of trays pivotally secured in base <b>51</b>, and with the protective container <b>50</b> in the open configuration, notwithstanding that the tray stack is enclosed on three sides by wall portions <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>a</i>, it is a simple matter to pivot the trays from the stack to a second stack using arcuate cutouts <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">With the walls of the cover <b>55</b> nested within the walls of the base <b>51</b>, the protective container <b>50</b> and package <b>10</b> are in the closed configuration. In this configuration, the outside of the upper end portions <b>72</b><i>b</i>, <b>74</b><i>b</i>, <b>76</b><i>b </i>of the wall portions of cover <b>55</b> are immediately adjacent the inside of the wall portions of base <b>51</b>. In this way, transversely extending rod-like protrusions <b>80</b> on the outside of the cover transverse upper wall portion <b>76</b><i>b </i>engage correspondingly located upwardly opening, transversely extending bores <b>82</b> on the inside of the base transverse wall portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>to permit the cover and base to snap fit together for forming a media disc package <b>10</b> which can be maintained in the closed position. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, communicating with each of bores <b>82</b> is an upwardly opening insertion slot <b>83</b>, preferably in the form of a truncated cone, which has a width at its upper edge at least as wide as the diameter of the rod-like protrusion <b>80</b> and which tapers towards the bore <b>82</b> so that as cover <b>55</b> is closed, rod-like protrusion <b>80</b> is inserted into the top edge of slot <b>83</b> and then forced downwardly past the narrow portion of the slot into the bore <b>82</b>. To facilitate opening of the closed package <b>10</b>, corresponding wall recesses <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> are formed in the outside wall of transverse wall portions <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>of the base and cover, respectively, i.e., in the wall portions remote from the spine <b>53</b>. These recesses allow the user to have gripping edges <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>a </i>to assist in pulling the base and cover apart when their respective protrusions/bores <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are engaged with the protective container <b>50</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The stack of trays is pivotally secured in the base <b>51</b> of protective container <b>50</b> by pivotally attaching the bottom tray <b>22</b> to the base panel <b>52</b>. Specifically, means <b>100</b> on the non-spine side of bottom tray <b>22</b> is pivotally engaged with means <b>110</b> of the base panel <b>52</b>. This is accomplished by providing first pivot means at one or more positions on base panel <b>52</b> spaced along non-spine wall portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>and, at a corresponding location or locations along the non-spine side <b>49</b> of bottom tray <b>22</b>, providing second pivot means for engaging the first pivot means for pivotally attaching the bottom tray <b>22</b> to the base panel <b>52</b>. In this manner, as each succeeding tray, in order, is pivoted from the original stack about the flexible hinge to form a second stack of trays next to the original stack of trays, the height of the second stack grows. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the height of each tray is about the same as an equal number of trays have been pivoted from the first stack onto the second stack as have been left in the first stack. At this point, the bottom tray <b>22</b> has not yet started to pivot. However, as the next tray is pivoted, and with each succeeding tray which is pivoted, from the original stack to the second stack, the height of the second stack grows while the height of the first stack diminishes. Just as soon as the second stack contains one more tray than the first stack, bottom tray <b>22</b> begins to pivot such that its spine side rises while its non-spine side remains pivotally attached to the base panel <b>52</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> all but one of the trays has been pivoted from the original stack to the second stack. It is abundantly clear from this illustration how much the spine side of bottom tray <b>22</b> has risen to avoid placing stress on the flexible fabric holding the hinge edges of the trays in alignment. Moreover, inasmuch as this configuration obviates the need to affix, as with an adhesive, the entire underside of the bottom tray <b>22</b> to the base panel <b>52</b>, the problem of stress on the bottom tray-base panel face-to-face interface causing them to separate is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, means <b>100</b> on the non-spine side <b>49</b> of bottom tray <b>22</b> comprises a transversely extending, relatively short (about ¼ to 1 inch in length) slot <b>102</b>, which may be formed at spaced locations along the non-spine side <b>49</b> of bottom tray <b>22</b>. Desirably, the slot <b>102</b> is formed at the intersection of the planar surface <b>36</b> and the depending flange <b>39</b> along the non-spine side <b>49</b> of the bottom tray <b>22</b>. In this manner, a portion <b>39</b><i>a </i>of the depending flange <b>39</b> remains beneath the slot <b>102</b>. Means <b>110</b>, according to one aspect of the invention, comprises first and second posts <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, extending upwardly from base panel <b>52</b>, which are positioned inwardly adjacent and along non-spine side wall portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>at locations corresponding to the locations of slots <b>102</b>. First post <b>112</b> rises from base panel <b>52</b> and is generally “P”-shaped, with the head of the “P” facing toward the non-spine side wall portion <b>66</b><i>a</i>. Second post <b>114</b> also rises from base panel <b>52</b> and is positioned adjacent first post <b>112</b>, between first post <b>112</b> and wall portion <b>66</b><i>a</i>. The head of the “P” and the upper end of the second post <b>114</b> are tapered toward each other for defining between them an upwardly opening truncated cone defining an insertion slot <b>116</b> which has a width at its upper edge at least as wide as the thickness of the depending flange <b>38</b> of tray <b>22</b>. The truncated cone tapers downwardly toward a space <b>118</b> between first and second posts <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and bordered on the bottom by base panel <b>52</b> and on the top by the underside of the “P”, which is desirably perpendicular to the leg of post <b>112</b>. When the stack of trays is inserted into the base <b>51</b>, it is oriented in such a manner that the depending flange portion <b>39</b><i>a </i>beneath the slot <b>102</b> are inserted into the insertion slot <b>116</b> of means <b>110</b> with sufficient downward force that flange wall portion <b>39</b><i>a </i>moves past the narrow portion of the insertion slot <b>116</b> into the space <b>118</b> with the head of the “P” of post <b>112</b> projecting into the slot <b>102</b>. In this manner bottom tray <b>22</b> is snap fit onto and pivotally mounted in base <b>51</b> and post <b>114</b> serves to restrict movement of the trays toward non-spine wall portion <b>66</b><i>a</i>. In order to be certain that tray <b>22</b> is able to pivot easily, the dimensions of the slots <b>102</b>, the posts <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and the distance between the posts <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> should be selected appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">It will be appreciated that the embodiment described for pivotally mounting the tray stack within base <b>51</b> represents only the preferred manner of so doing. Other configurations for pivotally mounting the tray stack within base <b>51</b> may also be utilized and are within the scope of the present invention. For example, other means for snap-fitting may be used. Means for attaching other than snap-fitting can also be utilized. In addition, the bottom tray may be mounted to the inside of the non-spine wall portion <b>66</b><i>a </i>instead of to the base panel <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">There is ample opportunity for the placement of promotional and informational materials on and in the package <b>10</b>. For example, a promotional or informational sheet may be adhered to the underside of one or more of the trays. Another promotional or informational sheet may be attached along the outside of the cover panel <b>56</b>, spine panel <b>54</b> and base panel <b>52</b> and adhered thereto, for example, by adhesive along its entire length or at spaced locations. In addition, S-shaped latches <b>88</b> are positioned spaced along and attached along the transverse edge <b>76</b> of the inside of the cover panel <b>56</b> with the latches opening and extending toward the spine <b>53</b>. Promotional or informational brochures or sheets may be removably inserted under the latches <b>88</b> on the inside of the cover panel <b>56</b></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">While the present invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design other than as defined in the appended claims.</p>
