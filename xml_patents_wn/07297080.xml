No. 10/654,172, entitled âGame Racquet With Separate Head And Handle Portions For Reducing Vibration,â filed on Sep. 3, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,840,874 which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/277,672 filed on Oct. 22, 2002 by Severa et al., now U.S. Pat.

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to game racquets, and, more particularly, to a game racquet with separate head and handle portions, which are separated by, and joined with, shock and/or absorbing material.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Game racquets such as tennis racquets, racquetball racquets, and squash racquets include a head portion and a handle portion. The head portion supports a string bed, and the player holds the racquet by the handle portion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the head portion strikes a ball, shock and vibration are transmitted from the head portion through the handle portion to the player's arm. Such shock and vibration can cause discomfort and can lead to physical problems such as tendinitis or tennis elbow.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Shock is caused by the impact of a ball on the strings. Shock on a typical tennis racquet might last about 3 milliseconds after ball impact.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Vibration is caused by shock and lasts longer. Vibration might last about 1000 milliseconds in a typical tennis racquet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many prior attempts have been made to reduce the transmission of shock and vibration to the player's arm. However, any direct connection between the head portion and the handle portion can provide an area through which shock and vibration can be transmitted. A conventional one-piece racquet acts as a conduit of vibration from the head to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,198 describes a racquet in which a tubular damping pad is positioned within the grip of the racquet.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention provides a game racquet with separate head and handle portions. The handle portion includes arms which extend along portions of the head, and the head and handle portions are separated by, and joined with, shock and/or vibration absorbing material such as urethane or rubber which reduces the transmission of shock and vibration from the head portion to the handle portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The head and handle portions are advantageously joined to the shock and/or vibration absorbing material by adhesive or an adhesive agent. If desired, an additional mechanical connection between the head and handle portions can be provided, for example, by strings which extend through string holes in both the head and the handle portions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The shock and/or vibration absorbing material is advantageously urethane, natural rubber, butyl rubber, or synthetic rubber and has a Shore A hardness within the range of 0 to 90, more preferably within the range of 20 to 70, and most preferably within the range of 30 to 60. Other relatively soft polymeric materials could also be used.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a tennis racquet <b>25</b> includes a head portion <b>26</b> and a handle portion <b>27</b>. The handle is aligned with a longitudinal centerline CL of the racquet. Although the invention will be explained with reference to a tennis racquet, it will be understood that the invention can be used with other game racquets such as racquetball racquets and squash racquets.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The head and handle portions can be formed from any conventional material for game racquets. For example, either or both of the head and handle portions could be made from thermoplastic or thermoset materials or a combination of thermoplastic and thermoset materials. The preferred material is a graphite and resin composite. The head and handle portions can be formed from the same or different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A thermoplastic is a material which will soften, flow, or distort appreciably when subjected to sufficient heat and pressure. Thermoplastic resins dampen vibrations and shock exceptionally well. Thermoplastic resins also are highly abrasion resistant and highly impact resistant. A thermoset material is a material which, after being initially cured, will not soften, flow, or distort appreciably when subjected to sufficient heat and pressure. Thermoset resins are significantly stiffer and lighter than thermoplastic resins. Thermoset resins are also generally more workable and easier to manufacture. For example, a thermoset resin typically requires an oven, furnace or mold temperature of approximately 300-350 F. to produce, while a thermoplastic resin typically requires an oven, furnace or mold temperature of approximately 550-650 F.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one particularly preferred embodiment, the hoop portion of the racquet is formed of a fiber reinforced thermoset resin material, and the handle is formed of a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin material. The fibers are a high tensile strength material, such as, graphite. Alternatively, the fibers can be formed of other materials, such as, for example, fiberglass, carbon, ceramic, aramid, KevlarÂ®, high molecular weight polyethylene in strand form, other conventional fiber materials or combinations thereof. The fibers are preferably elongate fibers arranged in a laminated stack configuration. Alternatively, the fibers can be fiber segments mixed into the thermoset or thermoplastic resin, or eliminated entirely. The thermoplastic material of the handle portion is preferably nylon. However, other thermoplastic materials can also be used in the handle portion, such as, for example, urethane, ABS, polyvinylchloride or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this particularly preferred embodiment, the thermoset material provides the hoop portion with exceptional stiffness at a very low weight. The reduced weight increases the design flexibility of the racquet enabling weight, which would otherwise be incorporated into the hoop portion, to be: redistributed to one or more alternate locations about the racquet; eliminated altogether; or addressed through a combination thereof. The exceptional dampening characteristics of the thermoplastic material of the handle portion serve to reduce the amount of shock and/or vibration felt by the user gripping the handle portion. The thermoplastic material of the handle portion also can be used to increase the flexibility of the handle portion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative particularly preferred embodiment, the opposite configuration can be used. The hoop portion can be formed of a thermoplastic fiber-reinforced material and the handle portion can be formed of a thermost fiber-reinforce material. In this particularly preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic material of the hoop portion significantly increases the impact and abrasion resistance of the hoop portion thereby increasing the durability and life of the racquet. The increased impact and abrasion resistance is desired because it is not uncommon for the hoop portion of sports racquets to contact the ground during play. This embodiment is particularly advantageous in racquetball, where the racquetball racquet typically and routinely contacts the ground and walls during play. The dampening characteristics of the thermoplastic material serve to reduce amount of shock and vibration that is transferred to the handle portion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The head portion includes a hoop <b>28</b> and a generally V-shaped throat portion <b>29</b>. The hoop includes a top portion <b>30</b>, side portions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, and a bottom or yoke portion <b>33</b>. The throat includes a pair of arms <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>, which converge downwardly and inwardly from the sides of the hoop.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A string bed <b>36</b> is supported by the hoop <b>28</b> in the conventional manner. The string bed includes longitudinally extending main strings <b>37</b> and cross strings <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The handle portion <b>27</b> includes a grip portion <b>40</b> which is wrapped with grip material and a throat portion which is formed from a pair of arms <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> which diverge outwardly and upwardly from the grip portion. Each arm includes an upper end <b>43</b>, which is adjacent the juncture between the yoke <b>33</b> and the sides <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> of the hoop.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As will be explained in detail with respect to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, material which absorbs shock and/or vibration is positioned between the head and handle portions and isolates the head and handle portions. Each of the head and handle portions is attached to the shock and/or vibration absorbing material, advantageously by adhesive or an adhesive agent, and the head and handle are thereby connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a racquet <b>44</b> which is similar to the racquet <b>25</b>. The racquet <b>44</b> includes a head portion <b>45</b> and a handle portion <b>46</b>, which extends along the centerline CL of the racquet. A bumper strip <b>47</b> can protect the top of the head portion if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the head portion includes a hoop <b>48</b> and a V-shaped throat portion <b>49</b>. The throat portion includes a pair of arms <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, which extend downwardly from shoulders or undercuts <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> in the hoop <b>48</b> toward the longitudinal centerline CL. The lower ends of the arms are joined by a connecting portion <b>54</b>, and a tapered projection <b>55</b> extends downwardly from the connector <b>54</b>. Shoulders <b>56</b> extend laterally between the projecting <b>55</b> and the front and rear faces of the head portion.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the handle portion <b>46</b> includes a grip portion <b>62</b> and a throat portion, which is formed from a pair of diverging arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. Each arm includes an inside surface <b>65</b> and an angled upper end <b>66</b> which mates with one of the shoulders <b>52</b> or <b>53</b>. A socket <b>67</b> extends into the top of the grip portion between the arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate a panel or sheet <b>68</b> of material for absorbing shock and/or vibration which is positioned between the outer surfaces <b>57</b> of the throat portion and the inside surfaces <b>65</b> of the handle portion. The particular panel illustrated includes a flat end portion <b>69</b>, which is provided with cutouts or recesses <b>70</b> and a pair of elongated parallel strips <b>71</b>, which are joined by a crosspiece <b>72</b>. The strips are separated by recesses <b>73</b> and <b>74</b>. The recesses <b>70</b>, <b>73</b>, and <b>74</b> are intended primarily to reduce the weight of the panel <b>68</b>. However, the panel could be any shape and could be solid, i.e., without any openings or recesses. Alternatively, the shock and/or vibration absorbing material could be formed from a plurality of separate pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The panel <b>68</b> can be formed from any material, which provides shock absorbing and/or vibration dampening properties. Such materials include rubber, synthetic or butyl rubber, Kraton rubber, and urethane. One specific embodiment was made from soft chlorobutyl rubber, which included filler and oils sufficient to provide a Shore A hardness of <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The panel <b>68</b> preferably has a Shore A hardness within the range of 0 to 90, more preferably within the range of 20 to 70, and most preferably within the range of 30 to 60. Shore A hardness is measured in accordance with ASTM D-2240-00.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref> illustrate a cup <b>80</b> of shock absorbing material, which is positioned between the projection <b>55</b> of the head portion and the socket <b>67</b> of the handle portion. The cup includes a sidewall <b>81</b>, which has the same dimensions as the socket <b>67</b> and a socket <b>82</b>, which has the same dimensions as the projection <b>55</b>. Flanges <b>83</b> extend upwardly from two sides of the sidewall <b>81</b>, and flanges <b>84</b> extend laterally from the other sides of the sidewall <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The cup <b>80</b> is attached to both the projection <b>55</b> and the socket <b>67</b>, preferably by adhesive or an adhesive agent, which will not separate during normal use of the racquet. The preferred adhesive bonding agent is Loctite 496, which is a Cyanoasrylate Ester adhesive. The flanges <b>83</b> extend upwardly between the arms <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> of the head portion and the arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> of the handle portion. The flanges <b>84</b> extend between the top of the socket <b>67</b> in the handle portion and the shoulders <b>56</b> of the head portion. Similarly, a panel <b>68</b> is attached to the outer surface <b>57</b> of each of the throat arms <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> and to the inside surface <b>65</b> of each of the handle arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. The strips are also preferably bonded by an adhesive, for example, Loctite 496.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The panels <b>68</b> and the cup <b>80</b> separate or isolate the head portion from the handle portion so that there is no direct contact between those parts. However, since each part is securely bonded to the panels <b>68</b> and the cup <b>80</b>, the parts are connected together by the panels and cup and will not separate during normal use of the racquet. The panels <b>68</b> and cup <b>80</b> significantly reduce the transmission of shock and vibration from the head portion to the handle portion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If desired the projection <b>55</b> and socket <b>67</b> could be omitted. In that event the cap <b>80</b> can be replaced by a suitably shaped piece which prevents direct contact between the head and the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A mechanical connection between the head portion and the handle portion can be provided by the racquet strings. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the head portion is provided with at least one string hole <b>85</b> which extends through the undercuts <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> of the throat arms <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>. A corresponding string hole <b>87</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) extends through the upper end of each of the handle arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. The holes <b>85</b> and <b>87</b> are aligned when the head and handle portions are connected by the panels <b>66</b> and cup <b>80</b>. When the racquet is strung, one of the main strings <b>37</b> extends through the holes <b>85</b> and <b>89</b> on each side of the racquet and further secure the head and handle portions together. The strings extend through the middle recesses <b>70</b> in the panels <b>68</b>. Alternatively, the panels <b>68</b> could be shaped so that the strings do not pass through the panels.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The mechanical connection, which is provided by the strings, is located near the upper ends of the handle arms <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. The lower ends of the handle arms are therefore free to move slightly relative to the lower ends of the throat arms <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> as the panels <b>68</b> and cup <b>80</b> are compressed by forces which are exerted on the racquet. Such relative movement assists in absorbing shock.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is not necessary to have the racquet strings extend through the head and the handle. The head and handle could be connected solely by the adhesive bond to the vibration and/or shock absorbing material.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a racquet <b>90</b> which includes a head portion <b>91</b> and a handle portion <b>92</b> which extends along the centerline CL. The head portion <b>91</b> includes a hoop <b>93</b> which has a top portion <b>94</b>, side portions <b>95</b> and <b>96</b>, and a bottom or yoke portion <b>97</b>. A pair of short throat portions <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> extend downwardly from the yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The side portion <b>95</b> includes a first outer edge <b>101</b> and a second recessed convex outer surface <b>102</b> which extends downwardly from about an undercut <b>103</b> at 4:00 o'clock to the end of the throat portion <b>98</b>. Similarly, the side portion <b>96</b> includes a first outer edge <b>104</b> and a recessed convex outer surface <b>105</b> which extends downwardly from an undercut <b>106</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the recessed portions of the sides <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> taper inwardly at <b>107</b> so that the top and bottom edges <b>108</b> are offset toward the midplane MP from the top and bottom edges <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> of the remainder of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The handle portion <b>92</b> includes a grip portion <b>114</b> and a throat formed by a pair of diverging arms <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>, which extend away from the centerline CL. The arm <b>115</b> includes a lower portion <b>117</b>, which has a concave inside surface <b>119</b> which mates with the convex outer surface <b>102</b> of the head.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A panel <b>124</b> of shock and/or vibration absorbing material is inserted between each of the arms <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> and the head and secured by a chemical or an adhesive bond. Each panel <b>124</b> is preferably similar to the panel <b>68</b> and is secured by Loctite <b>496</b> to both the head and handle portions. The panels isolate the head and handle portions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A plurality of string holes <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) are provided in the recessed side portions <b>102</b> and <b>105</b>, and a plurality of string holes <b>127</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) are provided in the upper portions <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> of the arms of the handle portion. Strings, which extend through the string holes <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>, provide an additional mechanical attachment between the head and the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If desired, the arms <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> of the handle portion can extend upwardly for a greater distance along the sides of the head portion. Also, the short throat portions <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> of the head can be omitted if desired. The head portion can be entirely hoop-shaped, and the arms of the handle portion can follow the contour of the hoop for any portion of the head which is desired. The handle portion can also extend along the centerline of the racquet up to the head portion so that the racquet does not have an open throat between the head and the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-24</figref> illustrate an alternative preferred embodiment of a game racquet <b>200</b> extending along a longitudinal centerline CL. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the racquet <b>200</b> includes head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> separated by first and second panels <b>223</b> and <b>224</b>. The head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> are generally similar to the head and handle portions <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The head portion <b>291</b> includes a hoop <b>293</b> having a top portion <b>294</b>, first and second side portions <b>295</b> and <b>296</b>, and a bottom or yoke portion <b>297</b>. The hoop <b>293</b> supports a string bed <b>270</b> formed by a plurality of interwoven main and cross string segments. The string bed <b>270</b> generally defines a plane. The first and second side portions <b>295</b> and <b>296</b> include first and second outer edges <b>201</b> and <b>204</b>, which transition through first and second undercuts <b>203</b> and <b>206</b> to define first and second recessed outer surfaces <b>202</b> and <b>205</b>, respectively. A plurality of string holes <b>285</b> are formed through the hoop <b>293</b>. Spaced-apart first and second throat projections <b>298</b> and <b>299</b> downwardly extend from the bottom portion <b>297</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The handle portion <b>292</b> includes a grip portion <b>214</b> and a throat formed by first and second diverging arms <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> upwardly and outwardly extending from the grip portion <b>214</b>.

In other alternative preferred embodiments, the upper and lower portions of each arm can include any number of string holes or be formed without string holes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first and second panels <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> comprise vibration and/or shock absorbing material, such as the material of panel <b>68</b>. Each of the panels <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> are configured to conform to the coupled surfaces of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>, and to separate the head portion <b>291</b> from the handle portion <b>292</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>, the coupling of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> with the first panel <b>223</b> is shown in greater detail. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> focus on the engagement of the first panel <b>223</b> with the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> of the racquet <b>200</b>, the description of this engagement is also directly applicable to the second panel <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The first recessed outer surface <b>202</b> of the first side portion <b>295</b> of the head portion <b>291</b> is generally planar and includes a centrally positioned, and longitudinally and inwardly extending channel <b>230</b>. In alternative preferred embodiments, the first and second recessed outer surfaces <b>202</b> and <b>205</b> can be concave, convex, or otherwise curved, or irregularly shaped. The channel <b>230</b> preferably extends almost the entire length of the recessed outer surface <b>202</b>. The channel <b>230</b> is formed into the first recessed outer surface <b>202</b> of the first side portion <b>295</b> and is defined by a bottom wall <b>232</b> and first and second side walls <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> outwardly extending from the bottom wall <b>232</b>. The channel <b>230</b> is configured to correspond with and engage the first panel <b>223</b> and the first arm <b>215</b> of the handle portion <b>292</b>. In alternative preferred embodiments, the channel can extend over only a portion of the recessed outer surface, can include two or more channels, or can include other shapes when viewed along a transverse plane, such as, for example, U-shape, V-shaped, and other curved or angled shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The upper portion <b>218</b> of the first arm <b>215</b> includes a generally planar first inside surface <b>219</b>. Alternatively, the first inside surface <b>219</b> can be formed in other shapes that generally conform to the configuration of the first recessed outer surface <b>202</b> of the head portion <b>292</b>, such as, for example, concave, convex, or otherwise curved, or irregularly shaped. The upper portion <b>218</b> of the first arm <b>215</b> further includes a centrally positioned, and longitudinally and outwardly extending rib <b>238</b>. The rib <b>238</b> is shaped to generally correspond to the shape of the channel <b>230</b> and includes a top surface <b>240</b> and opposing first and second side surfaces <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>. In alternative preferred embodiments, the rib <b>238</b> can be formed in a different shape, such as, for example, semi-cylindrical, polyhedral, and arcuate. The rib can also be formed as two or more outwardly extending projections.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The first panel <b>223</b> is an elongate, lightweight, resilient layer of shock and/or vibration absorbing material having a centrally positioned, longitudinally extending slot <b>246</b>, and including a pair of inwardly projecting, longitudinally ridges <b>248</b> positioned on opposite sides of the slot <b>246</b>. The slot <b>246</b> is sized to receive the rib <b>238</b>. The slot <b>246</b> enables racquet string (not shown) to extend through the first panel <b>223</b> as it extends through the racquet string holes <b>285</b>. The first panel <b>223</b> is shaped to extend over and space apart first recessed outer surface <b>202</b> of the head portion <b>291</b> and the first inside surface <b>219</b> of the upper portion <b>218</b> of the first arm <b>215</b>. The first panel <b>223</b> enables these corresponding surfaces <b>202</b> and <b>219</b> of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> to be positioned in close proximity to each other while preventing direct contact between the surfaces <b>202</b> and <b>219</b>. The depth of the channel <b>230</b> and the placement of the first panel <b>223</b> also space apart the top surface <b>240</b> of the rib <b>238</b> from the bottom wall <b>232</b> defining the channel <b>230</b>, thereby preventing direct contact between the two surfaces. The ridges <b>248</b> extend between, and space apart, the first and second side walls <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> defining the channel <b>230</b> of the head portion <b>291</b> and the first and second side surfaces <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> of the rib <b>238</b> of the arm <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">By providing a layer of shock and/or vibration absorbing material between the corresponding surfaces of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>, the first panel <b>223</b> reduces the amount and severity of the shock and/or vibration generated at the head portion during play, which extends from the head portion <b>291</b> to the handle portion <b>292</b>. Further, the alignment of the first and second side surfaces <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> of the rib <b>238</b> with the first and second side walls <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> of the channel <b>230</b> improves the racquet's <b>200</b> capacity to withstand the direct, shear and torsional stresses exerted on to the racquet <b>200</b> during play. The alignment and spaced-apart engagement of the rib <b>238</b> with the channel <b>240</b> further secure the proper alignment of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>291</b>, strengthen the coupling of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>, and provide additional surface area for bearing and absorbing the stresses and impact loads resulting from a ball contacting the racquet during play.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternative preferred embodiment, the channel(s) can be formed into one or more of the first and second arms, and the rib(s) can be formed on head portion of the racquet. In another alternative preferred embodiment, one arm of the handle portion can include a channel and the other arm a rib, and one side of the head portion can include a channel and the other side a rib.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, in an alternative preferred embodiment, the corresponding first and second outer recessed surfaces <b>202</b> and <b>205</b> of the head portion <b>291</b>, and the first inside surface <b>219</b> of the first arm and the second inside surface of the second arm <b>216</b>, respectively, include at least one set of corresponding projections and recesses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the coupling of the first outer recessed surface <b>202</b> with the first inside surface <b>219</b>, which is substantially similar, and a mirror image of, the opposite side of the racquet <b>200</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the first outer recessed surface <b>202</b> includes a generally jagged or serrated surface, preferably having at least two head projections <b>250</b> and at least two head recesses <b>252</b>. Similarly, the first inside surface <b>219</b> of the first arm <b>215</b> includes at least two handle projections <b>254</b> and at least two handle recesses <b>256</b> configured to correspond with the head projections and recesses <b>250</b> and <b>252</b> of the head portion <b>291</b> of the racquet <b>200</b>. Alternatively, other numbers of corresponding projections and recesses can be used. A first panel <b>323</b> is configured to conform to, and space apart, the first outer recessed surface <b>202</b> of the head portion <b>291</b>, and the first inside surfaces <b>219</b> of the handle portion <b>292</b>. The first panel <b>323</b> is generally similar to the first panel <b>223</b>. The first panel <b>323</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>258</b> for receiving the racquet string extending through the string holes <b>285</b> of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>. Alternatively, the first panel <b>323</b> can be configured with one or more slots or openings for receiving the racquet string.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The engagement of the corresponding at least one projection and at least one recess of first outer recessed surface <b>202</b> and the first inside surface <b>219</b> inhibits the movement or displacement of the head portion <b>291</b> in a direction toward the handle portion <b>292</b>, which can occur in some racquets. For example, if a racquet includes elongated main string segments extending through the bottom portion, or yoke, of the head portion to engage the handle portion, the string tension applied to the main string segments can act to draw the head portion further into the handle portion between the first and second arms. The projections and recesses, or generally jagged or serrated corresponding surfaces, of the head and handle portion form one or more stops which inhibit and resist the forces causing such movement of the head portion closer to the handle portion. The projections and recesses further secure the coupling of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> of the racquet.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, another alternative preferred embodiment of the coupling of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b> of the racquet <b>200</b> is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> includes only the first side of the racquet <b>200</b>, however, the second side of the racquet is substantially a mirror image of the first side of the racquet. The upper portion <b>218</b> of the first arm <b>215</b> of the handle portion <b>291</b> further includes a catch <b>260</b> configured to generally correspond to the first throat projection <b>298</b> of the head portion <b>291</b>. The catch <b>260</b> is a rounded upwardly and inwardly extending projection configured to generally conform to the outer surface of the head portion <b>291</b> at the first throat projection <b>298</b>. Alternatively, the catch <b>260</b> can be formed in other shapes generally corresponding to the first throat projection.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A first panel <b>423</b>, substantially similar to the first panel <b>223</b>, extends over and between the corresponding portions of the catch <b>260</b> and the first throat projection <b>298</b> to engage, and space apart, the catch <b>260</b> and the first throat projection <b>298</b>. The first panel <b>423</b> includes a slot <b>446</b> for receiving the racquet string extending through the string holes <b>285</b> of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>. The first panel <b>423</b>, like the first panel <b>223</b>, spaces apart, and prevents direct contact between, the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>. Similar to the jagged or serrated surfaces of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the catch <b>260</b> is configured to engage the first throat projection <b>298</b> and inhibit and resist the movement or displacement of the head portion <b>291</b> of the racquet <b>200</b> in the direction of the handle portion <b>292</b>. The catch <b>260</b> further strengthens and secures the coupling of the head and handle portions <b>291</b> and <b>292</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While in the foregoing specification a detailed description of specific embodiments of the invention has been set forth for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that many of the details hereingiven can be varied considerably by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
