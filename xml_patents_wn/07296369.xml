<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to generally to work vehicles. More particularly, it relates to couplings for work vehicles. Even more particularly it relates to pivot joints for excavators and loaders.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Work vehicles such as wheel loaders, backhoes, loader-backhoes, excavators, skid steers, graders, trenchers, tractors, combines, balers, cotton pickers, telehandlers, forklifts, and other material handling or ground engaging vehicles often include members that are coupled together to pivot with respect to one another at pivot joints. These members are most commonly moved by actuators, for example, hydraulic actuators such as hydraulic cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a common arrangement, such as the backhoe attachment of a loader-backhoe, or the excavating attachment to an excavator, two elongate rigid members such as boom swing towers, booms, dippers or buckets are coupled together with a pivot pin at a pivot joint. A hydraulic cylinder extends between and is coupled to the two members. The cylinder pivots the two members with respect to one another about the pivot pin by extending and retracting.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the pin in a pivot joint has a structure for retaining the pin in place. In one arrangement snap rings are fastened to both ends of the pivot pin. The snap ring on one end prevents the pin from moving in one direction and the snap ring on the other end prevents the pin from moving in the other direction. In another arrangement, a shoulder or head is provided on one end of the pin, replacing one snap ring. The dual snap ring and ring-and-shoulder arrangements are acceptable for pivot joints that are not blind—i.e. when an operator can get access to both ends of the pivot pin.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Blind pivot joints, however, require different structures since one has no access to both ends of the pivot pin in its blind hole. In these situations, pivot pins have been provided with a retainer that is welded to and extends away from the pin. This retainer is fixed to the member in which the pin is inserted, typically with a bolt. This fixes the pin in the member by a connection at just one end, preventing pin movement either into or out of the joint. It also holds the pin stationary with respect to the member to which the retainer is fastened, and thus forces the pin to pivot with respect to one of the two members. Disadvantageously, this welded arrangement holds the pin rigidly with respect to the member, and does not let it float within the pivot pin hole.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative arrangement for blind pivot joints includes a pin with a circumferential groove at one end and a retainer that fits into this groove. An advantage to this arrangement is the pin's ability to (1) wobble, float or self-align slightly within the pivot pin hole and (2) to rotate freely about its longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, however, this free rotation has been identified as a problem in some situations where the pin binds or corrodes in the pivot pin hole that supports it. In these situations it is beneficial to prevent the pin from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The free rotation could be prevented by welding the pin and retainer together in the prior art manner. This arrangement would, however, prevent the pin from self-aligning with respect to the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed, therefore, is an improved pivot pin assembly for blind holes that permits the pin to float, wobble or self-align slightly in the hole (like the arrangement with the circumferential groove), yet also retains the pin in a blind hole (like the welded arrangement).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of this invention to provide such a pivot pin assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention, a backhoe pivot joint is provided, including a first backhoe member having first cylindrical opening; a second backhoe member having a second cylindrical opening, wherein said first and second longitudinal openings are disposed in a coaxial relation; a circular metal cylinder disposed in said first and second openings, said cylinder having a first end and a second end, said first end having a circumferential groove having at least one blocked groove portion; and a retaining plate removably fixed to said first member and having a first edge disposed in said circumferential groove.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The circumferential groove may have first and second blocked portions. The first and second blocked portions may be disposed about 180 degrees apart. The first and second blocked portions may subdivide the circumferential groove into a first arcuate portion and a second arcuate portion, each of the first and second arcuate portions having substantially equal length. The first end may have first and second recesses adjacent to the first and second blocked portions. The groove may have a finish that indicates the groove was formed by turning the cylinder on a machine tool. The first and second blocked portions may have a finish that indicates the first and second blocked portions were formed by pressing or stamping the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a second embodiment of the invention, a pivot pin assembly for a pivot joint of a work vehicle is provided, including a circular metal cylinder, the cylinder having a first end and a second end, the first end having a circumferential groove with at least one blocked groove portion; and a retaining plate removably fixed to the first member and having a first edge disposed in the circumferential groove.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The circumferential groove may have first and second blocked portions. The first and second blocked portions may be disposed about 180 degrees apart. The first and second blocked portions may subdivide the circumferential groove into a first arcuate portion and a second arcuate portion, each of the first and second arcuate portions having substantially equal length. The first end may have first and second recesses adjacent to the first and second blocked portions. The groove may have a finish that indicates the groove was formed by turning the cylinder on a machine tool. The first and second blocked portions may have a finish that indicates the first and second blocked portions were formed by pressing or stamping the groove. The first and second arcuate portions may have an angular extent of 140-175 degrees.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Backhoe attachment <b>104</b> also includes dipper <b>136</b> that is pivotally coupled to the upper end of boom <b>128</b>. Dipper <b>136</b> is coupled to boom <b>128</b> by two pivot pin assemblies <b>138</b> and <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>9</b> illustrate details of the construction of all of pivot pin assemblies <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>144</b>, and <b>148</b> which are identically constructed</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each pin assembly <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>144</b>, and <b>148</b> shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>9</b> includes a pin <b>152</b> and a pin retaining plate (or pin retainer) <b>154</b>. Pin <b>152</b> is cylindrical in form having a major diameter <b>156</b> that extends substantially the entire length of the pin. A circumferential groove <b>158</b> is disposed at one end of pin <b>152</b>. Groove <b>158</b> is configured to receive retainer <b>154</b>. Groove <b>158</b> preferably extends around the entire circumference of pin <b>152</b>, preferably having a width of between 0.1 and 0.3 inches. It has a depth measured from the major diameter of pin <b>152</b> of between 0.2 and 0.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Groove <b>158</b> is disposed at one end of pin <b>152</b> and is spaced between 0.1 and 0.3 inches from the end of the pin. This spacing produces a flange <b>160</b> that extends around the entire circumference of pin <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The pin is manufactured by turning an elongate metal member such as a steel rod on a machine tool (for example a lathe or screw machine) reducing its diameter with a turning tool until it has the desired outer diameter of the pin. The rod is further turned on a lathe or screw machine to create the groove. A turning tool reduces the diameter of the pin thereby creating the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">These turning processes cold-work the surface of the pin and the groove walls, leaving striations, indentations or scores <b>153</b> on the surface of the pin and groove that typically extend circumferentially around the outer diameter of the pin, and on the walls and bottom of the groove. These marks <b>153</b> indicate that the pin was turned to create its outer diameter and also that the groove was formed by turning. They indicate the process by which the surface of the pin and the surface of the groove were formed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the basic pin body and groove have been made, the pin is placed in a press and two opposing sections <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of flange <b>160</b> are bent in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>166</b> of pin <b>152</b> such that the opposing sections <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> of the flange <b>160</b> are recessed below the end surface of the pin, and block two opposing portions <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> of groove <b>158</b>. By recessing sections <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> of flange <b>160</b> into blocked portions <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> of groove <b>158</b>, the circumferential groove <b>158</b> is subdivided into two semicircular arcuate groove portions that are sized to receive the retaining plate. The blocked portions <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> of groove <b>158</b> are disposed 180 degrees apart. The semicircular arcuate groove portions each have a length of between 140 and 175 degrees. They are preferably of equal length.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This process of recessing the flange into the groove leaves characteristic striations, indentations and scores <b>153</b> on the surface of the two opposing sections <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> of flange <b>160</b> indicating that they are formed by being pressed or stamped in a direction generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pin until the recessed portions of the flange are plastically deformed into the groove <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Retainer <b>154</b> is in the form of a planar sheet of metal, preferably steel, that has an aperture <b>172</b> passing therethrough and one edge <b>174</b> that is configured to be inserted into either one of the semicircular arcuate portions of groove <b>158</b> that are formed when portions <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> of groove <b>158</b> are blocked. Retainer <b>154</b> has a thickness along edge <b>174</b> that is slightly smaller than the width of groove <b>158</b>. In this manner, retainer <b>154</b> can be easily inserted into groove <b>158</b> with no special tools. Retainer <b>154</b> is inserted into groove <b>158</b> in a direction generally perpendicular to longitudinal axis <b>166</b> of pin <b>152</b>. It preferably is inserted to the bottom of groove <b>158</b> such that it engages the groove to a depth of 0.3 to 0.5 inches along an arc of 90 to 140 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ends <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> of edge <b>174</b> are preferably just adjacent to the crushed portions <b>168</b>, <b>170</b> of groove <b>158</b>. With retainer <b>154</b> in this position, pin <b>152</b> can rotate only a few degrees, preferably at least 5 degrees, but preferably no more than 90 degrees, more preferably no more than 45 degrees, even more preferably no more than 25 degrees, and most preferably no more than 10 degrees with respect to retainer <b>154</b>. Groove <b>158</b> and retainer <b>154</b> are sized to provide a slight spacing between retainer <b>154</b> and pin <b>152</b> both in a direction parallel to longitudinal axis <b>166</b> and a direction perpendicular to axis <b>166</b>. This spacing permits pin <b>152</b> to “float” slightly with respect to retainer <b>154</b>, yet preventing pin <b>152</b> from leaving the members in which it is inserted. This allows for slight mechanical misalignments, roughness or irregularities in surfaces or other manufacturing tolerances that might otherwise prevent the use of a pin.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Pin <b>152</b> includes lubricating passageways formed integral with the pin that permit an operator of the vehicle to lubricate the pivot joints. These lubricating passageways include a first grease passage <b>180</b> that extends longitudinally through the center of pin <b>152</b> from the end of the pin at which groove <b>158</b> is located to a point <b>182</b> that is generally located midway between the two ends of pin <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second passageway <b>184</b> extends from one side of cylindrical sidewall <b>186</b> of pin <b>152</b> to the other side of cylindrical sidewall <b>186</b> of pin <b>152</b>. Passageway <b>184</b> intersects longitudinal axis <b>166</b> of pin <b>152</b> and passage <b>180</b>. In this manner, a lubricant such as grease can be injected into the end of passage <b>180</b>, can be forced down the length of passage <b>180</b> and can be forced outward through passage <b>184</b> until it exits pin <b>152</b> coating opposing sides of sidewall <b>186</b>. The opposing ends of passageway <b>184</b> are configured to be located within the joint itself, preferably abutting the second member of the pivot joint (i.e. the member to which retaining plate <b>154</b> is not attached). Pin <b>152</b> is forced by retainer <b>154</b> to rotate with respect to the second member, and therefore the movement of the second member with respect to passageway <b>184</b> serves to distribute the lubricant that exits passageway <b>184</b>. Any grease exiting the opposing ends of passageway <b>184</b> is thereby forced between the pin and the apertures of the vehicles in which it's received to lubricate the pin. This reduces wear and extends the life of the pin <b>152</b> and the components in which it is inserted. A grease fitting <b>188</b> is preferably inserted into the open end <b>190</b> of passage <b>180</b> to ensure that no water enters the lubricating passages and that no grease can escape except through the ends of passageway <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The insertion of the pivot pin assemblies illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>9</b> into any of the locations indicated in the figures is relatively simple. First, the two pivoting members that are to be pivotally joined or coupled together are positioned with respect to each other such that mating holes on each component are coaxial. Once in this position, the operator inserts pin <b>152</b> into the aligned apertures until groove <b>158</b> is only slightly above the surface of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At this point, the operator inserts edge <b>174</b> of retainer <b>154</b> into one of the semicircular groove portions formed by crushing opposing portions of circular groove <b>158</b>. With retainer <b>154</b> in this position, the operator then slides a pin further into the aligned apertures of the structures that it is pinning together until retainer <b>154</b> abuts the surface of one of the structures. Using pivot pin assembly <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) as an example, the operator positions retainer <b>154</b> to abut surface <b>190</b> of swing tower <b>122</b>. The operator aligns aperture <b>172</b> with threaded hole <b>194</b>, inserts threaded fastener <b>192</b> through aperture <b>172</b> of retainer <b>154</b> and into threaded hole <b>194</b> of swing tower <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The operator rotates fastener <b>192</b> until the head of fastener <b>192</b> compresses retainer <b>154</b> against surface <b>190</b> and fixes retainer <b>154</b> in position against the top surface of the swing tower <b>122</b>. Aperture <b>172</b> and threaded hole <b>194</b> are located such that when fastener <b>192</b> is threadedly engaged with hole <b>194</b> retainer <b>154</b> extends into groove <b>158</b> of pin <b>152</b> such that pin <b>152</b> can neither be inserted deeper into the holes in which it is received nor withdrawn from those holes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The various holes and apertures are positioned such that pin <b>152</b> is not fixed rigidly with respect to swing tower <b>122</b> or to elongate member <b>114</b>, when fastener <b>192</b> fixes retainer <b>154</b> against surface <b>190</b>. Instead, the components are configured to provide pin <b>152</b> a slight amount of axial play (typically on the order of 0.050-0.100 inches) and also to provide pin <b>152</b> a small degree of rotational play about its longitudinal axis <b>166</b> (e.g. the 90, 45, 25, or most preferably 10 degrees of pin-to-retainer play mentioned above).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By permitting a slight degree of play with respect to retainer <b>154</b> and with respect to the structure retainer <b>154</b> is fastened to, pin <b>152</b> of pin assembly <b>124</b> can float lightly with respect to both structures and preferably seize against neither one of them. This floatation combined with the internal lubricating passageways <b>180</b>, <b>184</b>, substantially reduces the wear of the pin and the joint that it defines.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of the present invention. For example, the pins may be made of any of a variety of metals, such as steel, iron, aluminum, titanium, copper, brass, bronze, and nickel, or alloys or mixtures containing one or more of these metals, or other elements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As another example, the particular arrangement and lengths of the couplings and elongated arms and members shown herein can be changed into their configurations. As another example more or fewer elongated members may be added to the backhoe or excavator linkage to make it longer or shorter without departing from this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As another example, one or more members may be removed from the illustrated work vehicle members and still fall within the scope of the claims. The individual members may be reconfigured, such as by changing their length, their orientation, their construction, the size of the holes coupling the members, and the length of the holes that defined the pivot joints, while still falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
