<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Applications No. P2004-256022, filed on Sep. 2, 2004; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, more specifically to a semiconductor device and an assembling method for a ball grid array package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With move to higher levels of integration and improved functions of electric devices in recent years, semiconductor chips in semiconductor devices are shrinking in geometrical size, growing the degree of on-chip integration, and improving their performance. With respect to mounting technology of the semiconductor chips, a surface-mount package (SMP), such as a ball grid array (BGA), and a chip scale or chip size package (CSP) has been developed in addition to a lead-insertion package.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The surface-mount package has outer connection balls serving as electrodes arranged in an array on a bottom surface of a base substrate. A semiconductor chip provided on an upper surface of the base substrate is electrically connected to the outer connection balls. For example, a product having a semiconductor chip provided on a polyimide substrate with high heat resistance, an encapsulating resin encapsulating the semiconductor chip, and a plurality of solder balls provided on a bottom side of the polyimide substrate is widely known. In addition, a miniaturization technology of wiring boards, such as tapes and printed wiring boards, which have fine wiring patterns, has been developed to mount a miniaturized semiconductor chip thereon. A technology for a build-up wiring board having multi-lever interconnects has also been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, in the field of a micro-ball grid array packages, a semiconductor chip mounted on a base substrate has become extremely smaller than the base substrate. A few lines of outer connection electrodes are arranged outside of the chip mounting area. The base substrate may warp due to heat stress that occurs during the formation of the outer connection electrodes on the bottom side of the board, and it is difficult to connect solder balls to the outer connection electrodes. To maintain planarity of the base substrate, encapsulating resin, which encapsulates the semiconductor chip, is provided on the base substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the present invention inheres in a semiconductor device encompassing a substrate having a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface, the substrate having an opening penetrating from the first surface to the second surface; a first adhesive layer provided on the first surface; a second adhesive layer provided under the second surface; a third adhesive layer provided around the opening and adhered on the first adhesive layer; a semiconductor chip arranging a plurality of chip bonding pads in a central portion of the semiconductor chip, a perimeter of the semiconductor chip surrounding the central portion is adhered on the third adhesive layer so as to expose the chip bonding pads through the opening; a plurality of substrate bonding pads adhered under the second adhesive layer; a plurality of bonding wires connecting the chip bonding pads to the substrate bonding pads; and an encapsulating resin provided around the bonding wires and the semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention inheres in a method of assembling a semiconductor device encompassing providing a first adhesive layer on a first surface of a substrate, the substrate being defined by the first surface and a second surface opposing the first surface and having an opening penetrating from the first surface to the second surface; providing a second adhesive layer under the second surface providing a third adhesive layer around the opening on the first adhesive layer; adhering a semiconductor chip on the third adhesive layer so that a plurality of chip bonding pads provided in a central portion at a top surface of the semiconductor chip is exposed to the opening; providing a plurality of the substrate bonding pads on the second adhesive layer; connecting the chip bonding pads to the substrate bonding pads by bonding wires; and encapsulating the bonding wires and the semiconductor chip with a encapsulating resin.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Here, the “first surface” refers to one of a surface having a substantially planarized area. The “second surface” refers to a surface opposing to the first surface. In other words, the first and second surfaces can be defined as a “top surface” and a “bottom surface”.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the encapsulating resin <b>19</b><i>a </i>is provided around the chip bonding pads <b>10</b><i>c</i>, . . . and the bonding wires <b>14</b><i>c</i>, . . . <b>14</b><i>i</i>, . . . by use of a potting device or the like.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the mounting method of the semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the asperity layer is first formed on the first surface of the substrate <b>1</b> by the plasma treatment and the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> is formed on the layer. Therefore, the adhesion strength between the substrate <b>1</b> and the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> will be increased. Further, the metal film <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed on the surface in contact to the third adhesive layers <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the first adhesive layer <b>3</b>. Since the anchor member <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which has an asperity is formed on the surface of the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> by peeling off the metal film <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a wet property of the surface of the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> will be increased. Further, the adhesion strength between the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> and the second encapsulating resin <b>19</b><i>b </i>will be increased and the reliability will also be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the third adhesive layers <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>are formed to have a shape corresponding to the outline of the semiconductor device <b>9</b>.

Further, since the second encapsulating resin <b>19</b><i>b </i>is provided around the semiconductor chip <b>9</b>, the planarity of the substrate <b>1</b> can be ensured and reliability will be improved when the semiconductor chip <b>9</b> is significantly smaller than the entire size of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Evaluation of the Adhesive Strength)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A peel test is given to evaluate the adhesion strength of the semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 21</figref>. Concretely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, a glass epoxy substrate <b>31</b>, which is a base substrate for using the peel test, is prepared. An adhesive <b>32</b> for adhering a semiconductor chip is adhered onto the glass epoxy substrate <b>31</b>. The adhesive <b>32</b> is made from the same material as the third adhesive layers <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, such as epoxy resin or the silicon resin, or the like. A surface for measuring adhesion strength (a measurement surface) of a measurement substrate <b>33</b> is adhered to the adhesive <b>32</b>. A copper film <b>34</b> having a folding member <b>34</b><i>a </i>is placed to another surface (a no measurement surface) of the measurement substrate <b>33</b>. The folding member <b>34</b><i>a </i>is folded perpendicular to the measurement substrate <b>33</b>. The adhesion strength is evaluated by pulling at the folding member <b>34</b><i>a </i>perpendicularly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Peeling characteristics (failure modes) of the peel test are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Peeling at an interface between the copper film <b>34</b> and the measurement substrate <b>33</b> is called “A mode”. Peeling at the measurement substrate <b>33</b> is called “B mode”. Peeling at an interface between the measurement substrate <b>33</b> and the adhesive <b>32</b> is called “C mode”.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The resin tape made from polyimide resin as described in the above embodiments is used for the measurement substrate <b>33</b>. In a “first embodiment (with adhesive)” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, an adhesive for copper films, which is made from the same material and has the same film thickness as the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is used for the adhesive <b>32</b>. The measurement surface of the measurement substrate <b>33</b> is adhered to the adhesive <b>32</b>, and the peel test as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is given. In a “second embodiment (with anchor)”, an asperity layer, which is made from the same material and has the same film thickness as the anchor member <b>3</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, is formed on the measurement surface of the measurement substrate <b>33</b>, and the peel test as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is given. In a “comparative example (without adhesive)”, the first adhesive layer <b>3</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 21</figref> is not provided and the measurement substrate <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, “without treatment” refers to a result of a substrate with no pretreatment. “Pretreatment” refers to a result of a substrate exposed to the Ar plasma in a pretreatment process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the “comparative example” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, since the substrate does not have the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> in the measurement surface of the measurement substrate <b>33</b>, a result of the peel force shows insufficient adhesion strength of about 0.7 to about 0.6 N/cm. And the failure mode of the comparative example shows “C mode”. Peeling at the interface between the adhesive <b>32</b> for adhering a semiconductor chip and the measurement substrate <b>33</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, in the “first embodiment”, since the substrate is pretreated so as to have an asperity on the first surface and the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> is provided on the asperity, a result of the peel force is higher than the comparative example of about 7.9 to about 13.4 N/cm. In the “second embodiment”, since the anchor member <b>3</b> is formed on a surface of the first adhesive layer <b>3</b>, a result of the peel force shows over 16 N/cm (incapable measurement). In the semiconductor device in the second embodiment, strong adhesion strength is obtained regardless of the presence of the pretreatment. The failure mode of the comparative example shows “A mode”. In the second embodiment, peeling at the interface between the adhesive <b>32</b> for adhering a semiconductor chip and the measurement substrate <b>33</b> does not occur and adhesion strength is significantly increased in comparison with the comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described in the above results, it can be understood that the first adhesive layer <b>3</b> on the first surface of the substrate and the anchor member <b>3</b> can increase the adhesion strength between the encapsulating resin <b>19</b> and the third adhesive layers <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the semiconductor device, which has a semiconductor chip significantly smaller than the entire size of the substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
