For calibration, a transmitter is positioned at multiple locations in an area of interest and multiple receivers receive and record signal characteristics from the transmitter to generate a calibration data set. The unknown position of a transmitter may be determined by receiving signals from the transmitter by multiple receivers. A locator data set is generated based on the comparison between two received signal characteristics determined for each receiver. The locator data set is compared with the calibration data set to determine the unknown position. In one embodiment, the signal comparisons are the differences between electric and magnetic field phase. Further embodiments utilize signal amplitude differences. A reciprocal method utilizing a single receiver and multiple transmitter locations is disclosed. A further method is disclosed for determining position by utilizing signals available from existing installed wiring such as power wiring.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the measurement of position or location by means of electromagnetic signaling and more particularly to position measurement utilizing near field signals in conjunction with a calibration process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Radio frequency (RF) techniques have been proposed to solve many ranging and position measuring problems in industry. For example, significant cost reduction is possible if inventories could be automatically tracked in a warehouse. Hospitals need to know the location of resources such as wheel chairs, gurneys, and diagnostic equipment for speedy retrieval when needed and for cost efficient operations. Hotels and resorts need to know the location of resources such as projectors, lawn mowers, golf carts, etc. Position information could inform a security system keeping track of inventories in a retail establishment and guarding against theft. Position information is critical to the national 911 system to enable first responders to know instantly the location of a call to 911 from a person in distress.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accurate, affordable position information however has been elusive. A principal source of difficulty arises from the fact that typical environments are not ideal. Outdoors, typical environments contain objects such as trees, hills, buildings, cars and such that disrupt ideal planar uniform behavior. Similarly inside, objects such as walls, studs, pipes, desks, filing cabinets, and lights tend to attenuate or block signals as well as generate multi-path reflections. In both cases, real world environments have complicated behaviors that defy exact reliable predictions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A variety of prior art seeks to overcome complicated propagation environments by mapping a signal characteristic corresponding to particular locations of interest. These techniques are sometimes collectively referred to as “RF fingerprinting.” The motivation behind these techniques is the hope that a sufficiently accurate map can be made to uniquely identify a particular transmit position in the same way a human fingerprint serves to uniquely identify a particular person.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One RF fingerprinting approach is to deploy a network of sensors throughout an area in which one desires to track personnel or assets. Received signal strengths at each sensor may be compared to calibration, reference or experimental data to determine which previously measured location yields the best fit to a currently received signal. Christ (U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,913) uses this technique to localize personnel and Gray et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,674,403) use this technique to track wireless devices. However, positioning based on relative signal strength is notoriously inaccurate. Network signal strength measurements may serve to localize a transmitter to a particular zone, but usually require at least one sensor per zone. This often makes it uneconomical to achieve high precision positioning. Also, the propagation environment may change significantly based on the presence of people, goods, or other transient objects that may not have been present or may have been in different positions at the time a calibration was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An alternate RF fingerprinting technique attempts to use multi-path signals arriving at an antenna array to localize a transmitter. Multipath signals arriving at the antenna array are compared to a database of calibrated multipath signal signatures and corresponding locations. The location whose calibrated signal signature best matches the measured signature is selected as the most likely transmitter location. Hilsenrath (U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,304) suggested this technique in conjunction with a system to localize cellular phone transmissions. More sophisticated techniques for signature matching were taught by Wax et al (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,064,339; 6,104,344; 6,108,557; 6,112,095). These techniques may be used to make more economical assignments of cellular subscribers to base stations as taught by Grubeck et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,154,657), or applied to CDMA systems as taught by Wax et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,680). Furthermore, Wang et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,426) teach using time of arrival signals and simulated ray tracing. All of these techniques rely on the hope that the multi-path environment will be sufficiently stable and static to be repeatable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Chen et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,701) teach a system in which the geographical location of a mobile terminal is identified by comparing characteristics such as pilot strength and chip offset from the mobile terminal with the same attributes for a variety of sub-cells and determining which sub-cell most closely matches the observed set of RF characteristics. Werb et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,456,239) teach user selectable configuration packages in conjunction with a system for determining location of a tag using stored data. Moriya et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,074) teach using accelerometers and Kalman filtering to supplement electromagnetic position measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Finally, there is a body of prior art involving signals conveyed on a transmission line such as a telegraphy line or a power line. Edison (U.S. Pat. No. 162,633) taught an apparatus for duplex telegraphy in which direction of current yields one signal channel and increase or decrease of current yields another.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there is a need for a low cost method for range determination that may be used in complex RF propagation environments such as in and around buildings or over rough terrain and yet provide accurate, reliable results.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Briefly, the present invention is a system and method for determining position by utilizing electromagnetic signaling in conjunction with a calibration process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For calibration, a mobile transmitter generates one or more beacon signals at a plurality of transmitter locations, the beacon signal for each respective transmitter location is received at a plurality of receiver locations, and a comparison unit determines and records a comparison between two or more signal characteristics for each receiver location, for each respective transmitter location. A database including calibration data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For position determination, a transmitter located at the position to be determined transmits one or more beacon signals. A plurality of receivers receive one or more beacon signals. A comparison between at least two signal characteristics is determined for each receiver location. A locator data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics. A control processor compares the locator data set with the calibration data set to determine position.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the comparison between two or more signal characteristics is the difference between E field phase and H field phase. In an alternate embodiment, the comparison is the difference between E field magnitude and H field magnitude. It is a feature of the invention that the E field and H field signal characteristic differences are particularly useful in the near field.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Comparing data sets may include matching using a vector difference magnitude criteria. Interpolation or extrapolation may be employed to refine the match. One embodiment employs a Laplace algorithm for extrapolation to unmeasured data points.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, calibration is achieved wherein one or more receivers receive multiple beacon signals at multiple receiver locations from a plurality of transmitters. A calibration data set is generated comprising receiver measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet another embodiment, position is determined wherein a receiver at a position to be determined receives multiple beacon signals from one or more transmitters at one or more respective transmitter locations. A locator data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics. The locator data set is compared with the calibration data set to determine the position of the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further method is disclosed for determining position by utilizing signals available from existing installed wiring such as power wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments are also disclosed for a personal locator wherein an antenna is embedded in a lanyard such as are often used for holding identification badges or cards. This personal locator architecture is well suited for a low frequency personal location system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further features and benefits of the present invention will be apparent from the following specification and claims when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention. Like elements are labeled using like reference numerals in the various figures.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">There are a variety of ways in which range information may be obtained from near-fields. For instance, one could compare a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a first field to a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a first field. One could compare a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a first field to a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a second field. One could compare a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a first field to a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a first field. One could compare a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a first field to a longitudinal or radial ({circumflex over (r)}) component of a second field. One could compare a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a first field to a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a first field. One could compare a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a first field to a transverse component ({circumflex over (θ)} or {circumflex over (φ)}) of a second field. These comparisons may include comparisons of phase, comparisons of amplitude, or comparisons of other signal properties.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">These relations assume a measurement in the plane of the loop (θ=90°). Similar relations may be derived for other orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a graphic representation of electric and magnetic field phase relationships as a function of range for an ideal electrically small loop in free space. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a graphic plot <b>100</b> includes a magnetic or H-Field phase curve <b>102</b>, an electric or E-Field phase curve <b>104</b> and a phase difference or Δφ curve <b>106</b> representing the difference between curves <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. Curves <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are plotted against a first axis <b>108</b> representing phase (preferably in degrees) as a function of range represented on a second axis <b>110</b> in wavelength (preferably in a kilogram-meter-second unit, such as meters) of an electromagnetic signal under consideration. Thus, the relations of Equations [6]-[8] are illustrated in graphical representation <b>100</b>. H-field phase curve <b>102</b>, described by Equation [7], begins 90° out of phase with respect to E-field phase <b>104</b>, described by Equation [6]. As range is increased from about 0.05λ to about 0.50λ, H-field phase curve <b>102</b> initially decreases, then increases. Similarly, as range is increased from about 0.05λ to about 0.50λ, E-field phase curve <b>104</b> increases, gradually at first, and at an increasing rate as range increases. The difference between E-field phase curve <b>104</b> and H-field phase curve <b>102</b> is represented by Δφ curve <b>106</b>. Δφ curve <b>106</b> begins at approximately 90° (i.e., at phase quadrature) in the near-field within a range of about 0.05λ and goes to 0° (i.e., phase synchronicity) as the far-field is approached, past a range of about 0.50λ. Δφ curve <b>106</b> is described mathematically in Equation [8]. Transition of Δφ curve <b>106</b> from phase quadrature to phase synchronicity between about 0.05λ to about 0.50λ is substantially continuous and predictable and is used to advantage by the present invention. With more precise measurement, this phase transition can be beneficially used at ranges inside 0.05λ and outside 0.50λ.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Equation [8] expresses phase difference Δφ as a function of range (r). Equation [8] is a transcendental relation that may not be inverted to yield an expression for range as a function of phase difference. Nevertheless, a variety of mathematical methods may be used to determine a range given a phase difference. Equation [8] may be advantageously employed by other mathematical techniques such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, solving numerically, generating a look-up table, and solving graphically.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the far-field, at distances greater than one wavelength, both the electric and magnetic fields are phase synchronous. The phase of each field varies in lock step with the other field at a fixed rate of 360° per wavelength in the far-field limit. This is the usual relationship expected by those skilled in the RF arts. As a rule, the near-field phase anomalies exploited by the preferred embodiment of present invention are rarely discussed, if at all, in the prior art. One exception to this rule is the work of one of the inventors. [<i>Electromagnetic Energy Around Hertzian Dipoles, </i>by H. Schantz; IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, April 2001; pp. 50-62.]</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a table relating range of operation and frequency for a near-field ranging system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a table <b>200</b> relates frequency with selected ranges expressed in terms of wavelength of a signal under consideration. An important feature of the present invention is that a phase difference Δφ between electric and magnetic fields may be exploited to determine a range from a locator receiver to a beacon transmitter, or other source of electromagnetic waves. This near-field ranging method allows a distance to a beacon to be accurately determined between about 0.05λ and 0.50λ from the beacon, where λ is the wavelength of electromagnetic signal transmitted by a beacon. Optimum performance is obtained from a range of about 0.08λ to a range of about 0.30λ from the beacon. With more precise measurement, this phase transition can be used for ranges inside 0.05λ and outside 0.50λ. A corresponding characteristic range of operation as a function of frequency is presented in table <b>200</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Lower frequencies permit operation at longer ranges; higher frequencies are preferred for shorter ranges. The particular frequencies listed in table <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are presented for purposes of illustration and not for purposes of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Determination of a range from a phase difference Δφ between an electric and a magnetic field may be more complicated than the free space result of Equation [8] indicates. In practice, one may wish to calibrate a ranging system using a more complicated analytical or computational model (for example, a model including the effect of propagation over a real ground instead of free space), or using experimental data from an environment within which one wishes to carry out ranging operations.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention allows ranging to at least 3000 feet in the 160-190 kHz band, to at least 900 feet in the AM radio band, and to shorter ranges at higher frequencies. A wide variety of other operational ranges are available by using other frequencies. Greater range can be achieved with lower frequency. Accuracy within inches is achievable even at the longest ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the interest of presenting a simple illustrative example of the present invention, that is by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, this description addresses a mobile beacon and a stationary locator, but one skilled in the art may easily recognize that a beacon may be fixed and the locator mobile, or both beacon and locator may be mobile. To avoid unnecessary prolixity in the discussion that follows, sometimes only a single locator and a single beacon are discussed. This should not be interpreted so as to preclude a plurality of beacons and locators used as part of a more complicated positioning, locating, or tracking system.</p>

Alternatively, the representative signal may be, for example, a digital signal conveying data pertaining to the magnetic or H-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>. First (H-field) receiver <b>525</b> may include filtering, amplification, analog to digital conversion, and tuning means of the kind that are generally understood by practitioners of the RF arts.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Second (E-field) antenna <b>532</b> responsive to an electric or E-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b> allows second (E-field) receiver <b>527</b> to detect a second signal proportional to an electric or E-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>. Antennas responsive to an electric or E-field component of an electromagnetic wave include, by way of example and not by way of limitation, whip, dipole, or monopole antennas. Second (E-field) receiver <b>527</b> detects an input signal from second (E-field) antenna <b>532</b> and yields a second signal proportional to the electric or E-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>. The representative signal may, for example, be an analog signal whose voltage is directly proportional to amplitude of the electric or E-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If electromagnetic signal <b>515</b> is a single frequency sine wave, it is desirable for a first (H-field) receiver <b>525</b> and a second (E-field) receiver <b>527</b> to employ a very narrow bandwidth filter so as to minimize the noise and maximize the signal to noise ratio. However, it is also important for filters used in a first (H-field) receiver <b>525</b> and a second (E-field) receiver <b>527</b> to have a constant passband group delay so that relative phase characteristics of a first representative signal and a second representative signal are stable and predictable. The inventors have advantageously employed Bessel filters as a starting point for optimization.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">First (H-field) antenna <b>531</b> and second (E-field) antenna <b>532</b> are preferably oriented to be maximally responsive to polarization of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>. In alternate embodiments, locator <b>520</b> may employ additional (H-field) antennas, additional (E-field) antennas, additional H-field receivers, and additional E-field receivers in order to detect multiple polarizations or so as to detect electromagnetic signals from additional incident directions. Because electromagnetic signal <b>515</b> has near-field characteristics, polarizations may advantageously include a longitudinal polarization with a component parallel to a direction of travel of an incident electromagnetic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Signal comparator <b>580</b> (preferably embodied in a phase detector) takes the first representative signal proportional to the magnetic or H-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b> and the second representative signal proportional to the electric or E-field component of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b> and determines a phase difference between the first and second representative signals. Phase detector <b>580</b> may be thought of (for purposes of illustration and not limitation) as a mixer that receives the first and second representative signals and produces a quasi-static signal proportional to a quasi-static phase difference between the first and second representative signals. In an alternate embodiment, phase detector <b>580</b> may be implemented with an AND gate having as inputs the first and second representative signals and whose output is provided to an integrator. The output of the integrator is a quasi-static signal proportional to a quasi-static phase difference between the first representative signal and the second representative signal. The term “quasi-static” in this context means varying on a time scale substantially similar to a variation in phase, not necessarily a time scale or period substantially similar to that of electromagnetic signal <b>515</b>. In other embodiments, phase detector <b>580</b> may receive or capture a time domain signal and detect zero crossings or other characteristics of wave shape in order to determine an effective phase difference between the first representative signal and the second representative second signal. Suitable phase detectors are readily available—such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, an Analog Devices part no. AD 8302. Another embodiment of phase detector <b>580</b> may take digital information from first (H-field) receiver <b>525</b> and second (E-field) receiver <b>527</b> and calculate a phase difference between the first digital information and the second digital information.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Range detector <b>590</b> may be embodied in any means capable of converting a measured phase difference to a range r. In a particular simple example, range detector <b>590</b> may be an analog voltmeter having a scale calibrated to read a range r as a function of an applied voltage from phase detector <b>580</b>. A more sophisticated embodiment of range detector <b>590</b> may, for example, advantageously employ an analog to digital converter and a micro-controller or micro-processor to calculate a range r from an applied voltage received from phase detector <b>580</b>. Range detector <b>590</b> may include visual, audio, or other outputs to indicate range r to a user, or may convey a measured range r to a remote location for further analysis as part of a comprehensive tracking, positioning, or locating system.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Locator <b>520</b> may be generally regarded as comprising a means for detecting and receiving a first signal, a means for detecting and receiving a second signal, a means for determining a difference between a first and a second representative signal related to the first and second signals and a means for determining a range given a difference between the first and second representative signals.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Beacon <b>510</b> may be generally regarded as comprising a means for transmitting an electromagnetic signal.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram of details of a preferred embodiment of a system for near-field ranging by comparison of electric and magnetic field phase. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a ranging system <b>600</b> includes a beacon <b>610</b> and a locator <b>620</b> separated from beacon <b>610</b> by a range r. Beacon <b>610</b> includes a transmitter <b>612</b> which may be mobile or fixed, and a transmit antenna <b>636</b>. Transmitter <b>612</b> may include means to change properties of a transmitted electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> including, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, changing frequency, phase, polarization, or amplitude of an electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> according to a predetermined pattern, in response to an input or stimulus, such as, for example, a control signal received from a data bus <b>695</b>. In alternate embodiments, transmitter <b>612</b> may modulate a transmitted electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> so as to convey information. Such information may include information that identifies beacon <b>610</b> or other information or telemetry of value to a user. For example, binary phase shift keying may be implemented on a transmitted electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> without impairing ranging performance of the present invention. In still another embodiment, transmitter <b>612</b> may turn on or off according to a predetermined pattern, in response to a control signal from a data bus <b>695</b>, or in response to some other input or stimulus. Such input or stimulus may include (but is not necessarily limited to) a signal from an accelerometer, a timer, a motion detector, other transducers or other sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It may be advantageous in some applications for transmitter <b>612</b> to operate at a higher instantaneous power and a lower duty cycle. For instance, transmitter <b>612</b> might operate at approximately ten times an allowed average power level but only transmit 10% of a characteristic period, thus maintaining a substantially similar average transmit power level. Such intermittent operation would enable a higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) signal. Periodic operation of beacon <b>610</b> is also advantageous for operation in the presence of interference. When beacon <b>610</b> is silent (i.e., not transmitting), locator <b>620</b> can characterize a particular coherent noise source such as an interfering signal and can compensate for the presence of this coherent noise once beacon <b>610</b> begins transmitting again.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In applications where security is particularly important, beacon <b>610</b> may employ techniques to make electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> more difficult to detect by an eavesdropper. These techniques may include a frequency hopping scheme, periodic operation, varying transmit power to use the minimum power needed to make an accurate measurement, or other means to render signal <b>615</b> less detectable by an eavesdropper. Transmit power control may be further advantageous to allow frequency reuse in smaller cell sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A first step in determining range r between beacon <b>610</b> and locator <b>620</b> is for a beacon <b>610</b> to transmit an electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>. In a preferred embodiment, electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> is vertically polarized, but horizontal polarization or alternate polarizations are usable as well. To avoid unnecessary complication the electromagnetic coupling between beacon <b>610</b> and locator <b>620</b> is described in terms of an electromagnetic wave comprising electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>. Because range r between beacon <b>610</b> and locator <b>620</b> is typically less than a wavelength of electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>, electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> is not typically a radiation electromagnetic wave decoupled from beacon <b>610</b> such as would be found in the far-field at a range r significantly greater than one wavelength of electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>. It should be understood that an electromagnetic wave comprising electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> is typically a reactive or coupled electromagnetic wave, rather than a radiation or decoupled electromagnetic wave.</p>

Thus a single locator <b>620</b> may track a large number of different beacons <b>610</b>. A variety of other schemes for tracking multiple beacons <b>610</b> are possible, including, for example, time division multiple access. If a beacon <b>610</b> modulates a transmitted electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> with identifying information, one can distinguish among a plurality of beacons <b>610</b> operating at the same frequency. Similarly, a large number of different locators <b>620</b> may measure ranges r to a common beacon <b>610</b>.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In ranging system <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), first phase detector <b>681</b> receives the first IF representative signal from first signal output port <b>6210</b> and receives the third IF representative signal from third signal output port <b>6212</b> and determines phase difference between the first and third IF representative signals. Second phase detector <b>682</b> receives the second IF representative signal from second signal output port <b>6211</b> and receives the third IF representative signal from third signal output port <b>6212</b> and determines phase difference between the second and third IF representative signals. In a preferred embodiment, locator <b>620</b> has two H-field channels (first (H-field) channel <b>625</b> and second (H-field) channel <b>626</b>) and a third (E-field) channel <b>627</b>. In a preferred embodiment using a vertically polarized electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>, third electric antenna <b>632</b> is a vertical whip antenna with an omni-directional pattern in a first plane perpendicular to the axis of the whip. In a preferred embodiment magnetic antennas <b>630</b>, <b>631</b> are loop antennas with an omni-directional pattern in a second plane substantially perpendicular to a first plane (associated with the whip antenna of third electric antenna <b>632</b>). It is advantageous to have two magnetic antennas <b>630</b>, <b>631</b> to achieve sensitivity to a magnetic component of an electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> incident in any direction. With only one magnetic antenna <b>630</b> or <b>631</b> locator <b>620</b> will tend be insensitive to a beacon <b>610</b> positioned in a direction that lies in a null of the single magnetic antenna <b>630</b> or <b>631</b>. By having two magnetic antennas <b>630</b>, <b>631</b> locator <b>620</b> can determine range r to a beacon <b>610</b> in any direction. An additional advantage of having two magnetic antennas <b>630</b>, <b>631</b> is that locator <b>620</b> may use prior art techniques to obtain angle of arrival information in addition to range information.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">For optimal performance of phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> it is advantageous for amplitudes of first, second and third IF representative signals to be maintained within a desired amplitude limit. Automatic gain controls <b>6480</b>, <b>6481</b>, <b>6482</b> act to maintain a desired amplitude limit for the first, second and third IF representative signals. Phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> may employ log amps to maintain constant signal levels, such as are used in an Analog Devices part no. AD 8302 (phase detector IC). Alternatively, channels <b>625</b>, <b>626</b>, <b>627</b> may include a limiter (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to limit output signal levels. Range detector <b>690</b> translates measured phase differences received from phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> to range r. In a preferred embodiment, range detector <b>690</b> includes an analog to digital converter <b>691</b> and a microprocessor (or a micro-controller) <b>692</b> that cooperate to calculate range r based upon signals received from one or both of phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b>. In a preferred embodiment, range detector <b>690</b> also monitors RSSI levels from RSSI ports <b>6220</b>, <b>6221</b>, <b>6222</b> so that range detector <b>690</b> can select either of phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> (or both) to use in determining range r. Range detector <b>690</b> may also compare RSSI levels from RSSI ports <b>6220</b>, <b>6221</b>, <b>6222</b> to determine angle of arrival of electromagnetic signal <b>615</b>. Typically first phase detector <b>681</b> will be preferred if beacon <b>610</b> lies in the pattern of first magnetic field antenna <b>630</b> and second phase detector <b>682</b> will be preferred if beacon <b>610</b> lies in the pattern of second magnetic field antenna <b>631</b>. Ideally range detector <b>690</b> will selectively employ signals received from phase detectors <b>682</b>, <b>682</b> to optimize range measurement. Such optimization might also involve, for example, locator <b>620</b> combining signals received from magnetic field antennas <b>630</b>, <b>631</b> to create an effective antenna pattern that nulls out an interfering signal, or maximizes a desired signal. RSSI levels from RSSI ports <b>6220</b>, <b>6221</b>, <b>6222</b> may also be used by range detector <b>690</b> to supplement or complement information from phase detectors <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> in determining range r.</p>

Such a plurality of locators <b>620</b> and beacons <b>610</b> may operate cooperatively to establish a comprehensive tracking, positioning, or locating system. With a wireless data bus <b>695</b>, beacon <b>610</b> is no longer strictly a transmit-only device. Because only a transmitted electromagnetic signal <b>615</b> is necessary for ranging operations, with a wireless data link precise timing required for a traditional transponder ranging system is eliminated. Timing information can be conveyed via the wireless data link.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Locator <b>620</b> may be regarded as comprising a means for detecting or receiving a first (H-field) signal, a means for detecting or receiving a second (H-field) signal, a means for detecting or receiving a third (E-field) signal, a means for determining a first phase difference between a first and a third signal, a means for determining a second phase difference between a second and a third signal, and a means for determining a range r given a first and a second phase difference. It may also be advantageous to include in locator <b>620</b> a means for tuning a locator <b>620</b> whereby range data may be obtained for any of a plurality of beacons <b>610</b>, each generating an electromagnetic signal at a different frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Still further advantages may accrue by adding to locator <b>620</b> a means for conveying data among a plurality of locators <b>620</b> and a plurality of beacons. Such a means (e.g., a data bus or a wireless link <b>695</b>) could be advantageously employed in a comprehensive tracking, positioning, or locating system.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It should be kept in mind that functions and components of locator <b>620</b> need not be implemented in a single unit.

Antennas may, for example, be connected via RF cables if a stand-off were desired for safety reasons, economic reasons, operational reasons, ease-of-use or for any other reasons. Similarly, locator <b>620</b> may implement signal detection and reception in one location and phase detection in another. Locator <b>620</b> may also implement phase detection in one location and relay data to a range detector <b>690</b> at a remote location for determination of range r.</p>

In many applications the onmi-directional coverage of a single loop or loopstick antenna is preferred to a more directional pattern of a traditional horizontally polarized whip or dipole antenna. Locator <b>1120</b> includes an electric antenna <b>1132</b> and a magnetic antenna <b>1131</b>. Electric antenna <b>1132</b> is typically a horizontally oriented whip or dipole antenna. Magnetic antenna <b>1131</b> is typically a loop or loopstick antenna oriented to be responsive to horizontally polarized electromagnetic signals <b>1115</b>. Locator <b>1120</b> typically must be oriented to optimize a signal from electric antenna <b>1132</b>. Additionally, the direction of arrival of electromagnetic signal <b>1115</b> can be determined by orienting a null of electric antenna <b>1132</b> with the direction of arrival of electromagnetic signal <b>1115</b> and observing an associated decrease in an RSSI level. If the responses of magnetic antenna <b>1131</b> and electric antenna <b>1132</b> are summed, the direction of arrival of electromagnetic signal <b>1115</b> can be determined by orienting a null of an effective summed pattern with a direction of arrival of electromagnetic signal <b>1115</b> and observing an associated decrease in amplitude of the summed responses.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A choice of polarization may be influenced by specifics of a particular propagation environment, by the presence of potentially interfering signals of a particular polarization, or by the requirements of a particular application. Vertical polarization is typically preferred for propagation in an environment where undesired coupling tends to be horizontal, such as near ground. Horizontal polarization is typically preferred for propagation in an environment where undesired coupling is vertical such as through vertically oriented steel members. Circular polarization is typically preferred for systems where orientation independence is important. Some such coupling may actually be desirable if this coupling tends to guide waves in a desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Important antenna parameters for designing ranging systems according to the present invention include antenna patterns, matching, form factors, performance and cost. Another important critical parameter is capturing and differentiating between an electric and a magnetic component of an incident electromagnetic signal. A wide variety of suitable antenna options are known to those skilled in the RF arts.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Exemplary Receiver</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The inventors have implemented a ranging system as taught by the present invention. This system operated at 10.7 MHz and exhibited ranging accuracies within inches from about 5 ft to about 35 ft. Since the wavelength (λ) at 10.7 MHz is 92 ft, this corresponds to about 0.054λ to 0.38λ. According to the teachings of the present invention, significantly longer ranges are possible by utilizing significantly lower frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating details of an exemplary receiver in a system for electromagnetic ranging. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a ranging system <b>1200</b> includes a beacon <b>1210</b> and a locator <b>1220</b>. Beacon <b>1210</b> transmits an electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> that is received by locator <b>1220</b>. Locator <b>1220</b> includes an electric antenna <b>1232</b> that is sensitive to the electric component of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b>. Electric antenna <b>1232</b> detects a first (electric or E-field) signal proportional to the electric component of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> and conveys the first signal to an antenna port <b>1270</b> of a first receiver <b>1225</b> included in locator <b>1220</b>. Locator <b>1220</b> also includes a magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> that is sensitive to the magnetic component of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b>. Magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> detects a second (magnetic or H-field) signal proportional to the magnetic component of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> and conveys the second signal to a second receiver <b>1227</b> included in locater <b>1220</b>. Second receiver <b>1227</b> is constructed in substantial similarity to receiver <b>1225</b>; details of construction of receiver <b>1227</b> are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in order to simplify the description of ranging system <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Exact spacing between electric antenna <b>1232</b> and magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> is not critical, providing that spacing is large enough to avoid undesired mutual coupling and spacing is small relative to the wavelength λ of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b>. The inventors have arranged electric antenna <b>1232</b> and magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> separated by a distance on the order of 1%-3% of a wavelength (0.03λ-0.01λ). In alternate embodiments, electric antenna <b>1232</b> and magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> may be arranged in a single integral unit with a first terminal yielding an E-field response and a second terminal yielding an H-field response. Although spacing between antennas is preferentially small relative to the wavelength λ of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b>, a larger spacing between electric antenna <b>1232</b> and magnetic antenna <b>1231</b> may be tolerated if phase detector <b>1280</b> or range detector <b>1290</b> in locator <b>1220</b> are compensated for the effect of the larger spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Locator <b>1220</b> also includes a pre-select filter <b>1242</b> that receives the first (electric) signal from antenna port <b>1270</b>. Pre-select filter <b>1242</b> passes the first (electric) signal in a desired band, but rejects signals with undesirable frequencies. Typically pre-select filter <b>1242</b> will pass a band of frequencies within which beacon <b>1210</b> might transmit an electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> for a relevant application. Selection of a band will depend upon a variety of factors including, but not necessarily limited to, regulatory constraints, propagation behavior of an electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b>, and a desired range r of operation. The present invention offers optimal performance for a desired range r of operation approximately constrained by 0.08λ to 0.30λ, where λ is the wavelength of the electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> transmitted by beacon <b>1210</b>. A typical operating range is generally within 0.05λ to 0.50λ. Higher performance implementations of the present invention may operate at ranges r less than 0.05λ and greater than 0.50λ.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A front-end-amplifier <b>1265</b> increases the amplitude of the first (electric) signal. If atmospheric and other noise are sufficiently low, it is advantageous for an amplifier to have a noise figure sufficiently low to avoid introducing undesired noise, a dynamic range large enough to accommodate the potential variation in amplitude of the first (electric) signal, and a gain sufficient to yield a suitably large amplitude first (electric) signal so that a weak signal will properly drive phase detector <b>1281</b>. The inventors have advantageously used a Mini-Circuits ZFL-500 amplifier as a front-end-amplifier <b>1265</b>, but a wide variety of other amplifiers are suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A mixer <b>1252</b> mixes the first (electric) signal with a local oscillator (LO) signal generated by a local oscillator <b>1250</b> thus yielding a first intermediate frequency (IF) signal. Local oscillator <b>1250</b> may be a traditional sine wave oscillator. Local oscillator <b>1250</b> may also be a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), or other waveform template generator. For instance, the inventors have used an Analog Devices DDS (AD 9835) as local oscillator <b>1250</b> and a Mini-Circuits SBL-3 mixer as mixer <b>1252</b>. A wide variety of alternate implementations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">An IF amplifier <b>1262</b> increases the amplitude of the first IF signal. The inventors have found that a pair of current feedback operational amplifiers providing about +50 dB of gain were a suitable embodiment of IF amplifier <b>1262</b>, but a wide variety of alternatives are available to practitioners of the RF arts.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">An IF filter <b>1244</b> accepts only the desired first IF signal and rejects other undesired signals. A crystal filter may be advantageously used as IF filter <b>1244</b>. Such a crystal filter is characterized by an extremely narrow pass band, and preferably has a constant group delay within the pass band. A narrow pass band acts so as to allow the desired first IF signal to be conveyed to phase detector <b>1281</b> while rejecting adjacent undesired signals and noise.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Local oscillator <b>1250</b> may also be advantageously used as a tuner to select among a plurality of electromagnetic signals transmitted by a plurality of beacons <b>1210</b>. A particular beacon <b>1210</b> emitting a particular electromagnetic signal may be distinguished from other beacons emitting other electromagnetic signals, where other signals have slightly different frequencies. Thus a single locator <b>1220</b> may track a large number of different beacons <b>1210</b>. A variety of other schemes for tracking multiple beacons are possible, including for example, time division multiple access, code division multiple access, frequency hopping, or other schemes for achieving a desired channelization. Similarly, a large number of different locators <b>1220</b> may measure ranges to a particular beacon <b>1210</b>. Local oscillator <b>1250</b> may be considered as a component of an individual receiver <b>1225</b> or <b>1227</b> or as a common frequency standard for a plurality of receivers <b>1225</b>, <b>1227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Phase detector <b>1281</b> accepts the first IF signal from first receiver <b>1225</b> and a second IF signal from second receiver <b>1227</b> and generates an output voltage proportional to a phase difference between the first IF signal and the second IF signal. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, one exemplary embodiment of phase detector <b>1280</b> is an Analog Devices AD 8302. This particular phase detector also yields an output proportional to a magnitude difference that may help identify and correct for propagation anomalies and provide a more accurate determination of range in some circumstances. Range detector <b>1290</b> is included in locator <b>1220</b> and accepts an input from a phase detector <b>1281</b> for determining range r between beacon <b>1210</b> and locator <b>1220</b>. The inventors used a Measurement Computing Corporation PC-Card-DAS 16/16 A/D PCMCIA Card and a notebook computer to embody range detector <b>1290</b>, but there are a great many ways one skilled in the RF arts could implement range detector <b>1290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The present invention offers good performance for a desired range of operation approximately within ranges r between 0.05λ and 0.50λ away, and more optimal performance was achieved within a range r between 0.08λ and 0.30λ where λ is the wavelength of electromagnetic signal <b>1215</b> transmitted by beacon <b>1210</b>. Higher performance implementations of the present invention may operate at ranges r less than 0.05λ and greater than 0.50λ.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a near-field ranging system configured according to a fixed beacon-mobile locator architecture. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a fixed beacon-mobile locator ranging system <b>1300</b> includes a first beacon <b>1310</b> in a first known, fixed position transmitting a first electromagnetic signal <b>1315</b>.

A third beacon <b>1314</b> in a third known, fixed position transmits a third electromagnetic signal <b>1319</b>. Locator <b>1320</b> receives third electromagnetic signal <b>1319</b> and determines a third range r<sub>3</sub>. A fourth beacon <b>1316</b> in a fourth known, fixed position transmits a fourth electromagnetic signal <b>1321</b>.

Electromagnetic signals <b>1315</b>, <b>1317</b>, <b>1319</b>, <b>1321</b> may be substantially similar electromagnetic signals with substantially similar frequencies, or may be a variety of electromagnetic signals with different frequencies. Electromagnetic signals <b>1315</b>, <b>1317</b>, <b>1319</b>, <b>1321</b> may be transmitted substantially contemporaneously or at different times. For example, beacon <b>1310</b> may simultaneously transmit a low frequency signal suitable for a long range and a high frequency signal suitable for a short range. Using ranges r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, r<sub>3</sub>, r<sub>4</sub>, locator <b>1320</b> can determine its position. For purposes of explanation and not for limitation, four beacons <b>1310</b>, <b>1312</b>, <b>1314</b>, <b>1316</b> have been illustrated. One beacon is sufficient to yield useful range information for some applications. Two beacons can yield a position in two dimensions subject to an ambiguity, three beacons can yield an unambiguous position in two dimensions or an ambiguous position in three dimensions, and four beacons yield an unambiguous position in three dimensions. With additional beacons providing ranges, one can obtain a more accurate position for locator <b>1320</b> using multilateration techniques known to those skilled in the RF arts.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Locator <b>1320</b> can also convey range and other useful information via an optional data bus <b>1395</b> to a central controller <b>1399</b> for analysis. Central controller <b>1399</b> can then relay position or other information via data bus <b>1395</b> back to locator <b>1320</b>. A centrally coupled (i.e., coupled to all components of ranging system <b>1300</b>) controller <b>1399</b> or locator <b>1320</b> can coordinate frequency of operation or other operational parameters of locator <b>1320</b> and beacons <b>1310</b>, <b>1312</b>, <b>1314</b>, <b>1316</b>. Such coordination may include operating at appropriate frequencies to avoid interference or to obtain optimal range information. Coordination may also include scheduling time or duty cycle of operation. Coordination may further include control of transmit power for coexistence, signal security, or other reasons.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Ranging system <b>1400</b> is particularly well configured for tracking large numbers of assets including, for example, tracking people or assets from a central location. A variety of applications are possible. For purposes of illustration and not for limitation, a few applications are listed below.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">For example, a plurality of fixed locators (e.g., locators <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) may be deployed in and around a particular area of interest within which one wishes to track a plurality of beacons (e.g., beacon <b>1410</b>) attached to assets of interest. Ranging system <b>1400</b> is well suited for tracking cars, rental equipment, parts, components, tools or other assets in a manufacturing facility, a retail lot, warehouse, hold, vehicle, cargo container, storage area, hospital, or other facility in which one desires to track assets. A respective mobile beacon <b>1410</b> may be placed in each car, piece of rental equipment, part, component, tool, or other asset whose location is desired to be known. If a respective mobile beacon <b>1410</b> is removed from an area in and around which an infrastructure of fixed locators have been placed, then a mobile locator (e.g., mobile locator <b>1428</b>) may be used to help locate the wandering mobile beacon <b>1410</b>. This functionality is of particular utility if a wandering mobile beacon <b>1410</b> is attached to stolen property. A locator such as locator <b>1420</b> may be associated with a traffic signal, toll booth, or other traffic related infrastructure and may monitor a respective mobile beacon <b>1410</b> in an approaching emergency vehicle, bus, or car thus allowing precision control of a traffic signal, or other monitoring of the situation. It is useful to note here that electromagnetic signals associated with ranging system <b>1400</b> may be modulated to include information, such as identifying information relating to an asset to which a mobile beacon is attached. In such manner, various assets bearing respective mobile beacons <b>1410</b> may be individually identified or authenticated within ranging system <b>1400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, a plurality of fixed locators (e.g., locators <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) may be deployed in and around a particular area of interest within which one wishes to track a plurality of beacons (e.g., beacon <b>1410</b>) attached or associated with people. Thus, ranging system <b>1400</b> is well suited for tracking emergency responders such as firefighting, police, SWAT team members, and medical personnel at an incident scene. Ranging system <b>1400</b> can be used to track employees in a hazardous environment like miners in a mine, workers at a facility where hazardous materials are present, or corrections officers or prisoners in a prison.

Similar applications include tracking hikers, climbers, skydivers, hunters, fishermen, outdoorsmen, and others who engage in potentially dangerous activities and might require rescue or assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Patrons may be tracked at an amusement park, museum, festival, sporting event, convention, meeting, or other assembly drawing crowds. Sports competitors such as football players, soccer players, baseball players, swimmers, runners, and participants in other sports may have their positions monitored to assist in officiating, coverage, or analysis of a sporting event. Sporting equipment or animals might be tracked, including, by way of example and not by way of limitation, footballs, baseballs, soccer balls, rugby balls, race cars, yachts, thoroughbreds, or greyhounds.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Key personnel may be located in a business or other facility. Children and others requiring supervision may be monitored around a home, neighborhood, school, campus, or other facility. Ranging system <b>1400</b> is also applicable to a personal emergency response system (PERS), allowing rescuers to quickly locate an individual in need of assistance, such as a patient who has wandered away from a nursing home. Prisoners may be tracked as part of a home release or other low security supervision program. Persons subject to restraining orders or other restrictions on their movements may be monitored to prevent their violating terms of their restrictions. A mobile locator (e.g., mobile locator <b>1428</b>) can be used to help find a person who has left an area in and around which an infrastructure of fixed locators (e.g., fixed locators <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) have been placed.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Ranging system <b>1400</b> may also be used to track a pet as part of a pet containment system, or to allow an owner to monitor a pet's location.

In some applications however, it may be advantageous to have additional beacon-locators so that each member of a larger group may track or be tracked. A variety of applications are appropriate for ranging system <b>1500</b>. For purposes of illustration and not for limitation, a few applications are listed below. Reciprocal beacon-locator system <b>1500</b> is useful in conjunction with two-way radios whose users desire to know how far away a communicating party is situated. One may also advantageously incorporate a beacon-locator <b>1520</b>, <b>1522</b> in devices that allow a plurality of people to find each other, such as parents and children at an amusement park, hunters, fishermen, or other outdoorsmen, or other devices in which combined tracking and communication within and among members of a group is desired. Such a combined tracking and communicating arrangement may be useful not only for people, but also for vehicles, particularly aircraft and ships which may need to maintain particular spacing or stations within a moving group. If a means for direction finding is also used in a particular application, then both range and bearing information may be obtained. Reciprocal beacon-locator system <b>1500</b> is also useful for allowing members of a team to monitor each other's positions when visibility is impaired by smoke or other intervening walls or objects. Further, reciprocal beacon-locator system <b>1500</b> may be employed beneficially as part of a communication security system that uses range or position information to validate or authenticate the identity of a communicating party.</p>

A variety of alternate configurations and combinations of architectures are also possible. For example, fixed locators <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) may be embodied in a beacon-locator configuration, such as beacon-locator <b>1520</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In another example, passive tag <b>1629</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) may be used with a network of locators (e.g., fixed locators <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). In addition, nothing in this disclosure should be interpreted as precluding a ranging, positioning or locating system from using additional information to refine an estimate of position. Such other information may include, by way of example and not by way of limitation, a history of past positions or changes of position, or information from other sensors or sources. In particular, the present invention is well suited as a supplement to a GPS type tracking system. The present invention can extend the functionality of a GPS type tracking and positioning system into areas where GPS signals cannot penetrate or are unavailable. Also, the present invention may be used to achieve levels of performance not attainable using GPS alone. Nothing in this disclosure should be interpreted as precluding use of the present invention in conjunction with any other prior art techniques for tracking, positioning, or locating.

It should be understood that the present invention may also be implemented using multiple frequencies, time domain impulse waveforms, stepped or swept sets of appropriate frequencies, or other signals more complicated than an individual narrowband CW signal. For example, a phase difference of a CW signal may be related to a time delay, or more generally, a Hilbert transform of an arbitrary time domain signal. Any waveform (whether a CW waveform, short pulse, impulse, or time domain waveform, chirped waveform, or other waveform) will evolve from a near-field shape to a far-field shape in a manner that facilitates distance measurement and positioning according to the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Near Field Ranging with Calibration</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Near Field Propagation</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Near field electromagnetic ranging uses comparisons between two or more near field signal characteristics that vary in a predictable way with respect to distance or position. As explained in applicant's earlier co-pending work on near field electromagnetic ranging, one particularly useful comparison is between electric and magnetic field phase. This phase delta between electric and magnetic phase varies in a non-linear but predictable fashion within the near field. About a small electric antenna (small relative to ¼ wavelength), for instance, the phase delta varies with range, but does not vary with respect to angle, such as azimuth angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the uniform variation of near field comparisons in an open field environment. In a typical open near field propagation environment <b>1900</b>, the magnitudes of near field comparisons form uniform circular contours <b>1902</b>-<b>1908</b> around a transmitter <b>1910</b> (Antennas are shown co-located with the transmitters and receivers), i.e. the near field comparison magnitude shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> varies with range from the transmitter, but is the same value for any angle, such as azimuth angle, about the center transmitter. Receivers within a near field range of transmitter <b>1910</b> such as receivers <b>1912</b>-<b>1916</b> detect near field signals, effect a comparison between two or more near field signal properties, and locate transmitter <b>1910</b>. Such near field properties may include but are not limited to electric field intensity, and magnetic field intensity. Comparisons may include but are not limited to relative phase angles and amplitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a schematic diagram depicting the distortions of near field comparisons in a cluttered and complicated propagation environment. In a typical cluttered near field propagation environment <b>2000</b>, the magnitudes of near field comparisons no longer form uniform circular contours <b>1902</b>-<b>1908</b> around a transmitter <b>1910</b>. Consider a typical propagation environment such as office environment <b>2010</b>. Office environment <b>2010</b> comprises offices <b>2012</b>-<b>2018</b> and a hallway <b>2020</b>. In the presence of office environment <b>2010</b>, the magnitudes of near field comparisons form distorted contours <b>2002</b>-<b>2008</b>. Although distorted contours <b>2002</b>-<b>2008</b> vary slowly enough to enable ready correlation between a magnitude of a near field comparison and a position, distorted contours <b>2002</b>-<b>2008</b> no longer vary uniformly with respect to angle. Thus, if a near field electromagnetic ranging system were to operate in a typical cluttered near field propagation environment <b>2000</b>, a system and method for calibration of a near field electromagnetic ranging system offers the potential for improved accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> depicts office environment <b>2010</b> as an example of a typical cluttered propagation environment. Similar behavior occurs in home and residential environments, business, retail, and industrial environments, and in the complicated propagation environment between and around stacked shipping containers just to name a few. Office environment <b>2010</b> is an illustrative example. Nothing herein should be interpreted so as to limit application of the present invention to any particular environment.</p>

<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a schematic diagram showing how a near field electromagnetic ranging system may be calibrated by moving a reference transmitter to a sampling of points within a cluttered and complicated propagation environment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a calibration system <b>2100</b> operates in a typical cluttered environment <b>2000</b>. Typical cluttered environment <b>2000</b> comprises an exemplary office environment <b>2010</b> which comprises a first office <b>2012</b>, a second office <b>2014</b>, a third office <b>2016</b>, a fourth office <b>2018</b>, and a hallway <b>2020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">A reference transmitter <b>1910</b> is moved to various points P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>5 </sub>within the office environment <b>2010</b>. Although five points are shown in exemplary calibration system <b>2100</b>, in practice as many points as are necessary may be employed to achieve a desired level of precision. At each point, receivers <b>1912</b>-<b>1916</b> (also referred to as RX<sub>1</sub>-RX<sub>3</sub>) detect the near field beacon signals, effect a comparison between two or more near field signal properties, collect reference data regarding a magnitude of a near field comparison, and convey data to a control processor such as central controller <b>2102</b>. One skilled in the data processing and computational arts will realize that a wide variety of data structures and processing methods are possible within the bounds of the present invention. One embodiment preferred in many applications is for a central controller <b>2102</b> to store a calibration set of measurements, which may also be called reference data, in a matrix <b>2104</b>. The matrix <b>2104</b> stores reference data corresponding to measurements made by each receiver (RX<sub>j</sub>) as the reference transmitter <b>1910</b> is moved to each point P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>5 </sub>(P<sub>i</sub>). The matrix of reference data may also be referred to as a database. The database may be recorded on media or transmitted by network to make the data available at a later time or to additional users.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the comparison may be performed by direct comparison of signals or by measurement of signals and comparison of measured values. The comparison may be done in the receiver or may be done in a separate processing unit. Likewise the comparison may be performed at the time of reception or at a later time. Thus, a comparison unit refers to any device or system that performs the comparison, either by analog or digital signal processing or by software processing.</p>

Calibration method <b>2200</b> continues with a decision whether to proceed to the next receiver as indicated in block <b>2216</b>.

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Although exemplary calibration method <b>2200</b> shows a particular process chosen for ease of explanation, alternate equivalent processes may accomplish the same desired end result.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In a second exemplary embodiment, the central controller <b>2102</b> stores transmitter position data in an exemplary transmitter position data vector <b>2406</b>. Exemplary transmitter position data vector <b>2406</b> contains data from each receiver <b>1912</b>-<b>1016</b> pertinent to the location of the transmitter <b>1910</b>. The central controller <b>2102</b> employs transmitter position data vector <b>2406</b> and reference data <b>2410</b> to predict a position for transmitter <b>1910</b> in a position calculation <b>2404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">For instance, suppose method <b>2300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> for calibrated near field electromagnetic ranging yields an exemplary transmitter position data vector <b>2406</b> identical to exemplary transmitter position data vector <b>2314</b> defined above. Further suppose that a calibration process such as calibration process <b>2200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> results in exemplary reference data identical to exemplary reference data <b>2406</b> defined above.

<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Using exemplary reference data <b>2406</b> defined above, exemplary position calculation <b>2404</b> requires generation of exemplary reference data <b>2410</b>. In this particular illustrative example, assume that a central controller <b>2102</b> predicts a measurement result for each of the points in coordinate system <b>2401</b> based on the reference results obtained at points P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>5</sub>. One exemplary illustrative calculation is to assume that a measurement results at a particular point is an average of measurement results at adjacent points. Thus:

At edges of coordinate system <b>2401</b> a data point is assumed to be the average of the three adjacent data points.

So central controller <b>2102</b> concludes that a data vector <b>2410</b> through point P with coordinates (i, j)=(0, 2) has minimal error and is the position of transmitter <b>1910</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Exemplary position calculation <b>2404</b> may yield adequate results with sufficient measurement points, particularly if those points adequately bound an area of interest, like those points in coordinate system <b>2401</b>. Also, exemplary position calculation <b>2404</b> is memory intensive yet relatively simple in calculation. Thus exemplary position calculation <b>2404</b> is well suited for a central controller <b>2104</b> with extensive memory and an ability to quickly compare data vectors. Alternate algorithms may be preferable for a central controller <b>2104</b> with differing capabilities.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">For purpose of illustration and not limitation the present disclosure speaks to tracking a mobile transmitter (beacon) using a network of receivers (locators): a fixed locator-mobile beacon architecture. Alternatively, the system may comprise a fixed beacon-mobile locator architecture, a fixed/mobile locator-mobile beacon architecture, or a reciprocal beacon-locator architecture, i.e. multiple beacons with a single locator.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">One skilled in the art will recognize the value in combining the present invention with other techniques to further refine the position result. For example, Bayesian, maximum likelihood, Kalman, and related techniques may be used to combine multiple range results based on known patterns of noise or uncertainty. Such techniques may also be used in combination with the present invention to better determine object position and motion states. The data that may be combined with near field position information may include such data as signal strength, accelerometer data, or inertial navigation states. Certainly, multiple position measurements may be used to determine the velocity and acceleration of an object.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Plug-In Receiver</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a schematic diagram presenting a plug-in receiver for use with a calibrated near field electromagnetic ranging system. A plug-in receiver <b>2500</b> uses existing electrical wiring in a typical building or other environment as an antenna or sensor to detect near field signal characteristics. Near field signals in a cluttered environment couple to electrical wiring with properties that are dependent upon where a near field transmitter is located. Thus, by comparing signal characteristics of voltage and current signals, it is possible to effect a position measurement. One preferred embodiment compares the phase of a voltage signal to the phase of a current signal. Alternatively, the comparison may be between the amplitude of the voltage signal and the amplitude of the current signal, or between the magnitude of the voltage signal and the magnitude of the current signal. Alternatively, the phase comparison and the amplitude comparison may be made in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Plug in receiver <b>2500</b> includes an electrical plug <b>2504</b> to couple and receive signals from existing electrical wiring in a propagation environment. The plug-in receiver may utilize any existing wiring including power wiring, telephone wiring, cable TV wiring, or other wiring. A filter <b>2506</b> selects only the RF near field signals of interest for positioning purposes. In one embodiment, the filter is a high pass filter. In an alternate embodiment, the filter may be a band pass filter. In still other embodiments, the filter <b>2506</b> may include a power supply that converts power from electrical plug <b>2504</b> into a form useful for supplying power to the plug-in receiver <b>2500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Signals selected by the filter <b>2506</b> are conveyed to a first receiver such as voltage detector <b>2508</b> and a second receiver such as current detector <b>2510</b>. The voltage detector <b>2508</b> and the current detector <b>2510</b> include such filtering, amplification, mixing, and other receiving functions as are necessary to receive signals. Also, the voltage detector <b>2508</b> and the current detector <b>2510</b> may include a common local oscillator to effect a frequency conversion of signals. Signals from the voltage detector <b>2508</b> and the current detector <b>2510</b> are conveyed to a signal comparator <b>2512</b> that measures the difference between the voltage signal and the current signal. In a preferred embodiment, this comparison is a phase comparison between the voltage signal and the current signal. The signal comparator <b>2512</b> conveys the result of the comparison measurement to a microprocessor. The comparison measurement result may subsequently be transmitted to a central controller as part of an overall system for calibrated near field electromagnetic ranging. Transmission to the central controller may be implemented by a wired medium or a wireless medium. In particular, transmission to the central controller may involve signals coupled through the electrical plug <b>2504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In one embodiment, plug-in receiver <b>2500</b> measures RF power factor, which is related to the cosine of the phase difference between the RF voltage and RF current. Alternative systems may be employed that measure RF power factor or relative phase between the RF voltage and RF current.</p>
