<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to coupling assemblies, and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for coupling gas turbine engine components together.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">At least some known mechanical coupling assemblies used to couple gas turbine components together include a threaded fastener and a threaded connector. More specifically, within at least some known applications, the threaded fastener is inserted through an opening formed in a flange prior to a connector being threadably coupled to it for securing a component to the flange. At least some known flange openings are counter-bored to enable a portion of the threaded fastener to remain recessed with respect to an external surface of the flange after the fastener is coupled to the flange.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the connector is threadably tightened to the fastener, clamping loading is induced to the flange. However, when counter-bored openings are used, at least a portion of the clamp loading induced to the flange is carried by the thinner portions of the flange that define the counter-bore. Over time, the uneven load pattern stresses induced within the flange may cause the edges of the fastener opening within the flange to roll inward and away from the threaded connector, in a condition known as “bolthole rolling.” Bolthole rolling may cause additional stresses to be induced to the flange which over time may cause a premature failure of the flange.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a method for assembling a gas turbine engine assembly including at least a first member and a second member is provided. The method comprises inserting at least one threaded fastener through a fastener opening formed in a flange extending from the first member, and providing at least one shank nut including a flanged mating end, an opposite non-mating end, and a body extending therebetween, wherein the body includes an internal surface, an external surface, and a centerline extending between the first and second ends, and wherein the flanged mating end includes a substantially planar exterior surface that is aligned perpendicularly to the centerline and an annular groove that extends from the exterior surface at least partially towards the non-mating end. The method also comprises securing the assembly together such that the flanged mating end is positioned flush against the flange and such that the threaded fastener extends at least partially into a bore extending through the shank nut and defined by the shank nut internal surface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a shank nut for mating with a threaded mating component is provided. The nut includes a flanged mating end, an opposite non-mating end, and a body extending therebetween. The flanged mating end includes an exterior surface that is substantially planar. The body includes an internal surface, an external surface, and a centerline extending between the first and second ends. The internal surface defines a bore extending between the first and second ends. The bore is sized to receive at least a portion of the mating component therein. The mating end exterior surface is perpendicular to the body centerline and includes a groove extending at least partially circumferentially around the body bore. The groove extends axially from the mating end exterior surface at least partially towards the nut non-mating end.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further aspect, a coupling assembly for a gas turbine engine is provided. The coupling assembly includes a flange including at least one fastener opening extending therethrough, and a shank nut for mating with the threaded fastener. The at least one fastener opening is sized to receive at least a portion of a threaded fastener therethrough. The shank nut includes a flanged mating end, an opposite non-mating end, and a body extending therebetween. The flanged mating end includes a substantially planar exterior surface. The body includes an internal surface and an external surface. The body also includes a centerline extending between the first and second ends.

The bore is substantially concentrically aligned with respect to the body and is sized to receive at least a portion of the threaded fastener therein. The mating end exterior surface is perpendicular to the body centerline and includes an annular groove extending generally axially from the mating end exterior surface and at least partially towards the shank nut non-mating end. The flange is coupled against the shank nut mating end.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a cross sectional view of a portion of an exemplary embodiment of a coupling assembly <b>10</b> including a threaded connector or shank nut <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of threaded connector <b>12</b> that is used with coupling assembly <b>10</b>. Specifically, coupling assembly <b>10</b> includes at least one flange <b>20</b>, shank nut <b>12</b>, and a threaded fastener (not shown). In one embodiment, the threaded fastener is a threaded bolt that is threadably coupled to shank nut <b>12</b>, as described in more detail below. Coupling assembly <b>10</b> is used to securely couple components together, such as gas turbine engine components. In the exemplary embodiment, coupling assembly <b>10</b> is used to couple adjacent mating portions of a rotor shaft <b>14</b> together. In one embodiment, rotor shaft <b>14</b> is a multi-piece rotor shaft that is used with a CF6-80 gas turbine engine commercially available from General Electric Aircraft Engines, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the exemplary embodiment, each shaft portion <b>14</b> includes a coupling flange <b>20</b> that extends radially outward from an external surface <b>21</b> of shaft <b>14</b> to enable adjacent portions of shaft <b>14</b> to be coupled together. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although only one shaft portion <b>14</b> is illustrated, each shaft portion <b>14</b> includes a coupling flange or other known coupling means, that enables shaft portions <b>14</b> to be coupled together. Flange <b>20</b> includes a mating surface <b>22</b>, an opposite coupling surface <b>24</b>, and at least one fastener opening <b>26</b> extending therebetween. In the exemplary embodiment, fastener opening <b>26</b> is extends through a counter-bored portion <b>28</b> of flange <b>20</b>, such that a sidewall <b>30</b> defining counter-bored portion <b>28</b> and opening <b>26</b> is obliquely oriented with respect to surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Accordingly, a thickness T of flange <b>20</b> measured between coupling surface <b>24</b> and a sidewall <b>30</b> is variable across counter-bored portion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Shank nut <b>12</b> includes a flanged mating end <b>40</b>, an opposite non-mating end <b>42</b>, and a generally cylindrical body <b>44</b> extending therebetween. In the exemplary embodiment, body <b>44</b> has a substantially circular cross-sectional profile. In alternative embodiments, body <b>44</b> has other cross-sectional shapes. Body <b>44</b> has an external surface <b>50</b>, an internal surface <b>52</b>, and a centerline <b>53</b> that extends between ends <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Internal surface <b>52</b> defines a bore <b>54</b> that extends between body ends <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, bore <b>54</b> is concentrically aligned with respect to body <b>44</b> and has a diameter D<sub>B </sub>that is substantially constant through bore <b>54</b>. Internal surface <b>52</b> is threaded and includes a plurality of threads <b>60</b> that extend between body ends <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Diameter D<sub>B </sub>is sized to receive at least a portion of the threaded fastener therein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the exemplary embodiment, shank nut external surface <b>50</b> is tapered from flanged mating end <b>40</b> at least partially towards non-mating end <b>42</b>, such that a wall thickness T<sub>W </sub>of body <b>40</b> measured between body surfaces <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> is at least partially variably between body ends <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, external surface <b>50</b> is tapered from a hook <b>70</b> extending from body <b>40</b> at least partially towards non-mating end <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the exemplary embodiment, hook <b>70</b> extends radially outward from body <b>44</b> such that an outer end <b>71</b> of hook <b>70</b> is positioned a distance D<sub>1 </sub>forward of an end surface <b>72</b> of mating end <b>40</b>. Distance D<sub>1 </sub>enables hook <b>70</b> to extend radially outward of an outer edge <b>74</b> of flange <b>20</b> such that hook <b>70</b> provides an anti-rotation feature to shank nut <b>12</b>, as described in more detail below. In the exemplary embodiment, hook <b>70</b> includes a scallop <b>76</b> which enables shank nut <b>12</b> to be easily visually distinguishable from other threaded connectors. In alternative embodiments, shank nut <b>12</b> does not include hook <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A chamfer <b>80</b> is formed along mating end <b>40</b> at the edge <b>82</b> formed between body external surface <b>50</b> and end surface <b>72</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, chamfer <b>80</b> is positioned diametrically opposite hook <b>70</b> and is formed substantially parallel to the width W<sub>H </sub>of hook <b>70</b> rather than following the circular arc of edge <b>82</b>. Because of installation space limitations, in the exemplary embodiment, chamfer <b>80</b> enables shank nut <b>12</b> to be formed with a larger flange radius R<sub>F </sub>at mating end <b>40</b>. In alternative embodiments, shank nut <b>12</b> does not include chamfer <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the exemplary embodiment, shank nut <b>12</b> also includes a shank barrel <b>90</b> extending outward from mating end <b>40</b>. Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, shank barrel <b>90</b> is substantially cylindrical and extends a distance D<sub>2 </sub>from end surface <b>72</b> to a outer edge <b>92</b>. Distance D<sub>2 </sub>enables shank barrel <b>90</b> to be swaged or outwardly flared such that shank nut <b>12</b> is retained in an axial direction against flange <b>20</b> during assembly by shank barrel <b>90</b>, as is described in more detail below. Shank barrel <b>90</b> has a diameter D<sub>4 </sub>defined by an outer surface <b>96</b> of shank barrel <b>90</b> that is smaller than an inner diameter D<sub>5 </sub>of flange fastener opening <b>26</b> adjacent flange coupling surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A groove <b>100</b> is defined within mating end <b>40</b> and extends a distance D<sub>6 </sub>axially inward from end surface <b>72</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, groove <b>100</b> is annular and extends circumferentially around shank barrel <b>90</b> and bore <b>54</b>. In an alternative embodiment, groove <b>100</b> extends only partially circumferentially around barrel <b>90</b>. In another alternative embodiment, mating end <b>40</b> includes a plurality of grooves defined therein. As is described in more detail below, groove <b>100</b> facilitates redistributing clamping loading radially outward from shank nut centerline <b>54</b> when shank nut <b>12</b> is securely coupled in position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">During assembly of rotor shaft <b>14</b>, initially shank nut <b>12</b> is positioned adjacent flange <b>20</b>. Specifically, initially shank nut <b>12</b> is positioned such that shank nut mating end <b>40</b> is against flange coupling surface <b>24</b>. Accordingly, shank barrel <b>90</b> extends at least partially through flange fastener opening <b>26</b>. Shank barrel <b>90</b> is then swaged or flared using a known flaring tool such that shank barrel <b>90</b> is forced outwardly against flange fastener opening sidewall <b>30</b>. Accordingly, once swaged, shank barrel <b>90</b> facilitates retaining shank nut <b>12</b> in an axial direction in position relative to, and against, flange <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A component to be coupled to rotor shaft <b>14</b> is then positioned adjacent shaft <b>14</b> such that a flange extending from that component is against the mating surface <b>22</b> of flange <b>20</b>. A threaded fastener is then inserted through the first component flange and through flange <b>20</b>. More specifically, as the fastener is extended through flange <b>20</b>, the fastener is rotated to be threadably coupled to shank nut <b>12</b>. Because hook <b>70</b> extends radially outward from an outer edge <b>74</b> of flange <b>20</b>, hook <b>70</b> facilitates preventing nut <b>20</b> from rotating as the threaded fastener is torqued within nut <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Continued rotation of the fastener enables shank nut <b>12</b> to induce a clamping force to flange <b>20</b> such that the components of rotor shaft <b>14</b> are securely coupled together. More specifically, shank nut groove <b>100</b> facilitates redistributing clamping loading radially outward from shank nut centerline <b>54</b> such that the reaction loading is not induced through counter-bored portion <b>28</b>, but rather is instead induced through a portion <b>100</b> of flange <b>20</b> that has a thickness T<sub>1 </sub>that is thicker than that any thickness T measured within counter-bored portion <b>28</b>. Moreover, the additional material thickness T<sub>1 </sub>of flange portion <b>100</b> facilitates structurally enhancing the stiffness of flange <b>20</b> such that bolt rolling within flange fastener opening <b>26</b> is facilitated to be reduced as a result of groove <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the tapering of shank nut external surface <b>50</b> facilitates enabling the clamp load to more easily pass between the nut threads <b>60</b> and mating surface <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">After the threaded fastener has been securely coupled within shank nut <b>12</b>, shank nut non-mating end <b>42</b> is crimped against the threaded fastener. Crimping end <b>42</b> facilitates preventing shank nut <b>12</b> from unthreading from the threaded fastener, such that end <b>42</b> provides a self-locking feature to nut <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above-described coupling system is a cost-effective and reliable means for coupling components together. The shank nut includes an annular groove which displaces the mating surface of the nut radially outward, such that clamp loading is redistributed radially outward from the nut bore. Accordingly, the clamp loading is carried by a thicker portion of the mating flange such that stresses induced to the flange, and/or bolt rolling of the fastener opening within the flange, are facilitated to be reduced. As a result, the shank nut facilitates securely coupling components together in a cost-effective and reliable manner</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Exemplary embodiments of coupling assemblies are described above in detail. The assemblies are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein, but rather, components of each assembly may be utilized independently and separately from other components described herein. For example, each shank nut component can also be used in combination with other coupling assemblies.</p>
