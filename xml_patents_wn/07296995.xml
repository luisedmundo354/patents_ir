<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter of the invention is a circulating air oven according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Circulating air ovens for drying and/or fusing, in short, for treating, material webs, especially textile material webs, guided through the oven comprise a housing, in which transport means for guiding a material web through the housing are arranged. Nozzle chambers, which are arranged one next to the other and parallel to the transport direction, are attached above and below the transport means. Nozzles are attached to opposing side surfaces of these nozzle chambers facing the transport means. With the nozzles, air is blown onto the material web. The nozzle chambers are arranged in a closed discharge chamber, from which the air emerging from the nozzles is suctioned and—heated and compressed—fed back to a pressure chamber, in order to be blown again through the nozzles onto the material web.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The circulating air dryer known from EP-A1 148 113, which is built in the way described above, has the disadvantage that the air blown onto the material web is fed to the material web in a well controlled manner, but flows away from there in an uncontrollable manner, because there are not consistent relationships in terms of the surface quality, density, and thickness of the material web, and also the distance between the pressure housings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, from DE-A1 3130297, a device for heat treatment of a continuous web is known, in which a channel with high pressure and a channel with low pressure are allocated to each nozzle chamber. Flaps on the channels permit air to be blown with the nozzles onto the continuous web on both sides or to be suctioned from there or to be suctioned from one side and to be blown onto the other side. In addition, the nozzle chambers lie side to side, so that the blown air is suctioned through an adjacent housing or through an opposing chamber. A disadvantage for this device is that an alternating flow of air through the continuous web from bottom to top and from top to bottom is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this respect, the invention seeks to provide a solution. Therefore, the objective of the present invention is to create a circulating air oven, which permits a controlled flow of process air to and from the material web according to essentially freely selectable criteria.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This objective is met by a circulating air oven according to the features of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In circulating air ovens according to the invention, the nozzle spaces and the nozzle chambers can be connected either to a suction chamber or to a pressure chamber, in order to guide air emerging from one nozzle through the material web in a selective way and to suction the air through the suctioning nozzles. In this way, an optimum flow of the process air through the material web can be achieved. This leads to a uniform treatment of the material web across its entire material cross section. It is especially advantageous, that the air can be distributed transverse to the material web, if the nozzle chambers alternate in a mirror-inverted arrangement. The circulating air oven according to the invention also permits the amount of air supplied to each nozzle chamber along the length of the material through the circulating air oven to be set and changed in terms of quantity. Consequently, e.g., at the beginning, it can be heated with less hot air and the amount of hot air can be increased successively or vice versa. Because it is now possible to pass the air actively through the material web, the latter acts as a filter, so that the suctioned air is much less contaminated than in conventional ovens, where the air passes over the surface of the material web and is then suctioned. For impermeable material webs, through alternating suctioning and blowing nozzles, a uniform surface treatment can be achieved. The possibility of suctioning process air with the nozzles further permits a return flow chamber to be eliminated. Now only the nozzle chambers must be insulated. This leads to a significantly better and more direct access to the treatment area in the oven. For the use of elastic bands as flaps, the settings and adjustments of the amount of air can be adapted very quickly to conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When nozzle chambers with rectangular instead of wedge-shaped cross sections are used, the air guidance can be simplified to a great extent and, for example, in the transport direction of the material web, on one side, air can be guided with high pressure and, on the other side, air can be guided with low pressure. Therefore, the circulating air oven can be built in modules, in that the nozzles arranged side by side and guiding, namely, the air, are built independent of the length of the nozzle chambers arranged in-between.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The construction of a circulating air oven <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and known from EP-A1 148 113 comprises an insulated housing <b>3</b>, whose interior is divided into a pressure chamber <b>5</b>, a return flow chamber <b>7</b>, and a heating chamber <b>8</b>. The heating chamber <b>8</b>, in which a heating element <b>9</b>, e.g., an electric or a combustion oven, is inserted, lies between the return flow chamber <b>7</b> and the pressure chamber <b>5</b>. The heating chamber <b>8</b> is connected to the return flow chamber <b>7</b> via a filter element <b>11</b>. Furthermore, a blower <b>15</b>, e.g., an axial-flow blower, is installed in the wall <b>13</b> between the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and the heating chamber <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The return flow chamber <b>7</b> comprises at least one transport means <b>17</b>, preferably a conveyor belt <b>21</b> guided so that it rotates about several deflection rollers <b>19</b>. The conveyor belt <b>21</b> is manufactured from an air-permeable material, such as gauze, canvas, or grating made from metal or plastic, and is driven by a motor M. In another configuration of the circulating air oven <b>1</b>, a second transport means <b>17</b>′ can also be arranged above the first, so that two runs <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>′ extend parallel to each other and a material web <b>27</b> is guided in-between. The distance between these two runs <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>′ is preferably adjustable to the thickness of the material web <b>25</b> guided in-between. The material web <b>25</b> is guided through the circulating air oven <b>1</b> by the two transport means <b>17</b> in the direction of the arrow T. Below and above the one or two transport means <b>17</b>, there is a plurality of nozzle chambers <b>27</b> lying one next to the other in series. The nozzle chambers <b>27</b> extend perpendicular to the transport direction T of the material web <b>27</b> over its entire width, i.e., they extend over the width of the conveyor belt <b>21</b>. Nozzles <b>29</b> for the passage of air are fixed on the bottom sides of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>, i.e., on the side surfaces facing the material web <b>25</b>. The nozzle chambers <b>27</b> have a cross section that becomes narrower from the air inlet side <b>31</b> outwards. On the air inlet side <b>31</b>, a pressure flap <b>35</b> is coupled, with which the opening cross section <b>37</b> to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> can be closed completely or partially (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This known arrangement enables hot air from the air inlet side <b>31</b> out to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> to be guided into the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> and from there onto the material web <b>25</b>. The air impacting the material web <b>25</b> escapes in an uncontrolled manner to the side of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> and can be led through the intermediate spaces between the adjacent nozzle chambers <b>27</b> into the return flow space <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The circulating air oven <b>1</b> according to the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 8</figref>, comprises, in addition to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and the return flow chamber <b>7</b>, a suction chamber <b>39</b>. This can extend next to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and/or can be penetrated by the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>. The suction chamber <b>39</b> is connected directly to the heating chamber <b>8</b>. A passage opening <b>41</b> between the suction chamber <b>39</b> and the heating chamber <b>8</b> is spanned by a filter element. A second passage <b>43</b> between the suction chamber <b>39</b> and the return flow chamber <b>7</b> is preferably formed adjacent to the passage opening <b>41</b> from the suction chamber <b>39</b> into the heating chamber <b>8</b>. The passage <b>43</b> can be completely or partially closed by a slide <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Suction flaps <b>49</b>, which enable air to be suctioned with the nozzles <b>29</b>, are arranged on the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> in the space <b>47</b> connecting the suction chamber <b>39</b>. The air guidance in the circulating air oven according to the invention from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is no different from known circulating air ovens when the suction-side closing means, such as suction flaps <b>49</b>, are closed and the slide <b>45</b> is open to the suction side of the blower <b>15</b>. Then the air flows, namely from the nozzles <b>29</b> of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> onto the material web <b>25</b> and from there in an uncontrolled way between the adjacent nozzle chambers <b>27</b> into the return flow chamber <b>7</b> and further through the filter <b>11</b> into the heating chamber <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Now, according to the invention, there is also the ability to guide and control the air actively through the material web <b>25</b>, in that on one side the slide <b>45</b> is closed and thus the suction chamber <b>39</b> is connected only to the heating chamber <b>8</b>, which lies on the suction side of the blower <b>15</b>. Therefore a vacuum is established in the suction chamber <b>39</b>. This vacuum extends through open suction flaps <b>49</b> into those suction chambers <b>27</b>, in which the suction flaps <b>49</b> are open. For example, all of the bottom nozzle chambers <b>27</b> can be connected to the suction chamber <b>39</b> by opening the suction flaps <b>49</b> and the connections to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> can be closed by closing the pressure-side closing means, such as pressure flaps <b>35</b>. Now the hot air flows from the top nozzle chambers <b>27</b> from the nozzles <b>29</b> through the material web <b>25</b> and is suctioned by the nozzles <b>29</b> due to the low pressure in the bottom nozzle chambers <b>27</b> or vice versa. Consequently, the hot air contacts not only the top side of the material web <b>25</b>, but it is also suctioned through the material web <b>25</b> and guided into contact with all parts of the material web <b>25</b> and, as a secondary effect, the air is filtered, i.e., fibers and lint possibly separated from the surface remain in the material web <b>25</b>, so that only a small number of fibers or amount of lint can reach the filter <b>11</b> through the suction chamber <b>39</b>. So that no air can flow to the side and leave the flow direction directed perpendicular to the material web <b>25</b>, nozzle beds <b>30</b> are formed between the nozzles <b>29</b>. These beds form surfaces lying between the nozzles <b>29</b> parallel to the material web <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With the circulating air oven <b>1</b> according to the invention, not only can an air flow from top to bottom or from bottom to top be realized, but the suction flaps <b>49</b> can be opened and the pressure flaps <b>35</b> can be closed or vice versa alternately on the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> connected in parallel and forming a heating nozzle column, so that the flow can be realized from bottom to top or from top to bottom in an alternating or section-wise pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The advance of the material web <b>25</b> through the transport means <b>17</b> creates a continuous change of the air flow direction in the material web <b>25</b>. Thus, an extremely uniform flow of hot air through the material web <b>25</b> can be realized across the entire thickness of the material web <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows schematically another advantageous configuration of the invention. The nozzle chambers <b>27</b> are connected through a conduit <b>51</b> to a multiple-path valve <b>53</b> or a multiple-path cap, with which a connection to a pressure conduit P or to a suction conduit S can be established selectively. The pressure conduit P is connected to a blower V, which is connected on the suction side to the suction conduit S. In the connecting conduit <b>57</b>, which connects the suction conduit S to the pressure conduit P, a filter F, a suction blower S, and/or a heating system H or a cooling system C can be inserted. In the schematic view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, only two opposing nozzle chambers <b>27</b> are shown as representatives for a plurality of nozzle chambers <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this configuration of the invention, the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> are covered by shutters <b>59</b> attached on the end, so that the processing chamber <b>61</b> between the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>, through which the material web <b>25</b> is guided, is closed. Also, the intermediate space between the individual, paired, opposing nozzle chambers <b>27</b> can be closed by corresponding shutters or the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> can be arranged in a line one next to the other without mutual spacing. An insulation layer <b>63</b> prevents heat exchange with the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this configuration of the invention, the air flow across or through the material web can be set from pressure chamber to pressure chamber <b>27</b>. The air emerging from the pressure chambers <b>27</b> at a high pressure is suctioned through the slots on pressure chambers <b>27</b> connected to the suction side. An uncontrolled air flow emerging between the pressure chambers is therefore eliminated. In contrast with the arrangement described in the introduction, this arrangement enables optimal access to the material web <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, from the schematic view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it can be seen that this arrangement enables both the supply of hot air and also of cold or, if need be, moist air. Furthermore, the returned, suctioned air can be cleaned in a filter F. To increase the vacuum, especially when a filter F is connected in front, the pressure blower V can be supported by a suction blower S. The switching of the multiple-path valve <b>53</b> can be realized manually or by using electromagnetically controllable valves by means of the machine controller. According to the configuration of the valves <b>53</b>, the incoming/suctioned amount of air can also be controlled for each individual pressure chamber <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another preferred configuration of the invention, the air outlet cross sections of the nozzles <b>29</b> can be set. This enables, for example, at the beginning of the heat treatment of the material web <b>25</b>, a small amount of hot air to be supplied and this amount to be increased successively, whether it is now up to the end of the pass length or only over a certain area and then to reduce the amount again by decreasing the cross sections. A suitable control of the air quantity can also be achieved by an arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the configuration of the invention according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, an especially advantageous configuration of a closing means cap is shown. This comprises a flexible sheet-metal or plastic belt, in short, band <b>71</b>, which is guided displaceably in guides <b>73</b> arranged on the side on the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>. The band <b>71</b> can be moved from a closed position, in which the passage for air between the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> and the pressure (<b>5</b>) and the suction chambers (<b>7</b>) is closed, into an open position or an intermediate position, which opens the passage completely or to a desired extent. The movement of the band <b>71</b> is realized preferably by hand. For this purpose, a tab <b>75</b> is formed on one end of the band. The band <b>71</b> is held in the guides <b>73</b> in a self-locking way and therefore can be brought into any desired position and held there without additional technical means. An electromechanical movement is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another advantageous configuration of the invention according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>, the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> are cubic, i.e., they also have a rectangular shape in the vertical section. The supply of air (pressure-side opening <b>85</b>) is realized from the left side outwards to a pressure chamber <b>5</b> arranged along the circulating air oven <b>1</b>. The suctioning of air is realized on the right side through an opening <b>87</b> into a suction chamber <b>39</b>, which also extends over the length of the circulating air oven <b>1</b>. The suction chamber <b>39</b> and the pressure chamber <b>5</b> are connected to each other via a blower as in the preceding examples. This configuration of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> creates a very balanced air distribution transverse to the material web and independent of the direction of main air flow in the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The embodiment of the circulating air oven <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref> shows the passage space <b>77</b> for the material web <b>25</b> next to the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> arranged one above the other. In the interior of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>, horizontal pivot shafts A, which are preferably supported in at least one of the side walls <b>27</b>′ and <b>27</b>″, can be seen. A diversion flap <b>79</b>, which divides the interior of the nozzle chamber <b>27</b> essentially diagonally into two wedge-shaped halves, sits on each pivot shaft A. The two edges <b>81</b> of the diversion flap <b>79</b> running parallel to the shaft A contact the bottom and top side walls <b>27</b>′, <b>27</b>″ preferably at a distance to the end walls of the nozzle chambers. In other words, the diversion flap <b>79</b> runs not exactly diagonally through the nozzle chambers <b>27</b>, in order to enable the flap <b>79</b> to be pivoted from one diagonal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, bottom) to the other diagonal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, bottom) without contacting the end walls. The pivoting can be realized with a handle <b>83</b> attached to the suction-side or pressure-side end of the diversion flap <b>79</b>. A closing flap <b>89</b>, which is guided by a guiding element <b>91</b>, is preferably coupled to the pressure-side end of the diversion flap <b>79</b>. When the diversion flap <b>79</b> pivots from the “pressure position” according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> into the suction position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, bottom nozzle chamber <b>27</b>), the closing flap <b>89</b> is guided in front of the opening <b>85</b> in the nozzle chamber <b>27</b> and closes the latter in the “suction position.” Obviously, other configurations of handles or pivot levers are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the top nozzle chamber <b>17</b> is connected to the pressure chamber <b>5</b>. The diversion flap <b>79</b> contacts the nozzle chamber <b>17</b> with its one edge <b>81</b> at the top left and with the other edge at the bottom right. The diversion flap <b>79</b> permits the entry of air from the pressure chamber <b>5</b> through the opening <b>85</b> connecting to the pressure chamber <b>5</b> into the nozzle chamber <b>27</b> and from there through the nozzles <b>29</b> to the material web <b>25</b>. The suction chamber <b>39</b> is connected to the top half of the nozzle chamber <b>27</b>, but due to the diversion flap <b>79</b> there is no connection to the nozzles <b>29</b>. By pivoting the diversion flap <b>79</b> into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, bottom, the suction chamber <b>39</b> is now connected to the nozzles <b>29</b>. Simultaneously, the connection between the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and the nozzles <b>29</b> is broken. Consequently, air can be blown into the material web <b>25</b> from above in the arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in the top nozzle chamber from the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and can be suctioned into the suction chamber <b>39</b> downwards at the bottom nozzle chambers <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> can be connected individually either to the suction chamber <b>39</b> or to the pressure chamber <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Both the pressure chamber <b>5</b> and also the suction chamber <b>39</b> is connected to a plurality of nozzle chambers <b>27</b>. According to the material web width to be processed, nozzle chambers <b>27</b> with a corresponding length L are inserted. Consequently, for nozzle chambers <b>27</b> of different lengths, identically shaped pressure chambers <b>5</b> or suction chambers <b>39</b> can be inserted, which consequently enable a modular production of the circulating air oven <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The circulating air oven <b>1</b> or the various freely selectable possibilities for supplying or discharging air gives the user means to adapt the profile of the heat treatment exactly to the material to be dried or to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The circulating air oven <b>1</b> according to the invention has proven to be especially advantageous when the material web <b>25</b> is compressed within the housing <b>3</b> during the heat treatment by the nozzle chambers <b>27</b> or pressure plates (not shown) arranged thereon. Through alternating supply of hot air from above and suctioning of the supplied air at the bottom or supply of hot air from below and suctioning of the hot air at the top, air can also pass uniformly through materials with a high density and thus the materials can be heat treated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the pressure chambers <b>27</b> arranged one next to the other are switched alternately for air passage from top to bottom or from bottom to top, then, assuming suitable nozzles <b>29</b>, the material web <b>25</b> transported in the transport direction T can be set in vibration. An additional vibration or oscillation device for opening up the material web <b>25</b> can therefore be eliminated.</p>
