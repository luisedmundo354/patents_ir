<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a mass spectrometer and a method of mass spectrometry.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mass spectrometers are known which are suitable for performing so called MS/MS experiments wherein in a first step parent ions are mass analysed. In a second step parent ions having a particular mass to charge ratio are selected by a mass filter and are then fragmented in a gas collision cell. The resulting fragment ions are then mass analysed. The mass spectrum of an analyte ion and the mass spectrum of the fragment products of the analyte ion reveal useful information about the structure of the analyte ion and this information may then be used to identify the ion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to perform MS/MS experiments on triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. Triple quadrupole mass spectrometers comprise a first quadrupole mass filter Q<b>1</b>, followed by a quadrupole ion guide arranged in a gas collision cell Q<b>2</b>. Downstream of the gas collision cell Q<b>2</b> is provided a second quadrupole mass analyser Q<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A parent ion mass spectrum may be obtained by setting Q<b>1</b> to operate in a wide band pass mode (i.e. RF only mode) so that the first quadrupole Q<b>1</b> operates in non-filtering ion guide mode. The ions then pass through the gas collision cell Q<b>2</b> but either collision gas is not provided in the collision cell or the energy of the ions passing through the collision cell is arranged to be sufficiently low so that ions are not substantially fragmented within the collision cell. The parent ions are then mass analysed by the second quadrupole mass analyser Q<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A fragment ion or MS/MS mass spectrum may be obtained by setting the first quadrupole Q<b>1</b> to operate as a mass filter so that only parent ions having a specific mass to charge ratio are onwardly transmitted by the mass filter. Parent ions transmitted by the mass filter Q<b>1</b> then enter the collision cell Q<b>2</b> and are arranged to have an energy such that they fragment upon colliding with gas molecules in the collision cell. The resultant fragment ions are then mass analysed by the second quadrupole mass analyser Q<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hybrid mass spectrometers wherein the second quadrupole mass analyser Q<b>3</b> is replaced with a Time of Flight mass analyser are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a feature of both the known triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and hybrid quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometers that two mass filters/analysers are required in order to perform MS/MS experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is desired to provide an improved mass spectrometer for performing MS/MS experiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a mass spectrometer comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">an ion source;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a mass filter/analyser arranged downstream of the ion source;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">an upstream ion detector arranged upstream of the mass filter/mass analyser; and</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a downstream ion trap arranged downstream of the mass filter/analyser.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a particularly preferred feature MS/MS experiments may be performed using a mass spectrometer which comprises only a single mass filter/analyser. This represents a considerable simplification and cost saving over conventional arrangements such as triple quadrupole mass spectrometers and quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometers wherein two mass filters/analysers are required. The present invention therefore constitutes an important advance in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to use only one mass filter/analyser rather than two mass filters/analysers as is conventional, ions are preferably stored in an ion trap downstream of a mass filter/analyser and are then sent back upstream through the mass filter/analyser. The ions, which may comprise parent ions, fragment ions or second (or further) generation fragment ions may be mass filtered or mass analysed as they pass upstream through the mass filter/analyser. Alternatively/additionally, once the ions have been passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser and stored in an upstream ion trap, the ions may then be passed back downstream through the mass filter/analyser to be mass filtered/analysed for a second, third or further time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A number of distinct embodiments of the present invention are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a first embodiment in a first mode of operation the mass filter is operated in a wide band pass mode so as to transmit substantially all ions and the downstream ion trap is arranged to accumulate parent ions. The ion source remains ON during this mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a second mode of operation the downstream ion trap releases the parent ions and at least some of the parent ions are passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser which is arranged to mass analyse the parent ions. The ions are then detected by the upstream ion detector. In this mode of operation the ion source is switched OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a third mode of operation the mass filter/analyser is arranged to mass filter parent ions emitted from the ion source so that only parent ions having a specific mass to charge ratio are onwardly transmitted and ions having other mass to charge ratios are substantially attenuated by the mass filter. Ions onwardly transmitted by the mass filter are then arranged to be substantially fragmented. The resulting fragment ions are arranged to be accumulated in the downstream ion trap. The ion source in this mode of operation remains ON and the ions are preferably fragmented within the downstream ion trap.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a fourth mode of operation the downstream ion trap releases the fragment ions and at least some of the fragment ions are passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser which is arranged to mass analyse the fragment ions. The fragment ions are then detected by the upstream ion detector. In this mode of operation the ion source is switched OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an alternative Single (or Selected) Reaction Monitoring (“SRM”) embodiment the mass spectrometer may initially be operated in the second mode of operation described above so that selected parent ions are fragmented and the resultant fragment ions are stored in the downstream ion trap. Then, the downstream ion trap is arranged to release the fragment ions and at least some of the fragment ions are passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser which is arranged to mass filter the fragment ions so that fragment ions having a specific mass to charge ratio are onwardly transmitted and fragment ions having other mass to charge ratios are attenuated by the mass filter. The fragment ions transmitted by the mass filter are detected by the upstream ion detector. When the fragment ions are released from the downstream ion trap the ion source is switched OFF. A Multiple Reaction Monitoring (“MRM”) embodiment is also contemplated wherein either the transmission window of the mass filter when filtering parent ions and/or when filtering fragment ions is changed so that a different reaction is monitored for.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A second embodiment of the present invention is contemplated and further comprises a downstream ion detector arranged downstream of the downstream ion trap.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a first mode of operation of the second embodiment, the mass filter/analyser is arranged to mass analyse ions emitted from the ion source and the parent ions are detected by the downstream ion detector. The ion source is ON and the downstream ion trap is preferably arranged to be operated in a non-trapping ion guide mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a second mode of operation the mass filter/analyser is arranged to mass filter parent ions emitted from the ion source so that parent ions having a specific mass to charge ratio are onwardly transmitted and ions having other mass to charge ratios are attenuated by the mass filter. The ions onwardly transmitted by the mass filter are arranged to be substantially fragmented and fragment ions are arranged to be accumulated in the downstream ion trap. The ion source remains ON and ions are preferably fragmented within the downstream ion trap.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a third mode of operation the downstream ion trap releases the fragment ions and at least some of the fragment ions are passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser which is arranged to mass analyse the fragment ions. The fragment ions are then detected by the upstream ion detector. In this mode the ion source is switched OFF and the downstream ion trap is preferably operated in a non-trapping ion guide mode. Single Reaction Monitoring and Multiple Reaction Monitoring embodiments are also contemplated wherein the mass filter/analyser mass filters the fragment ions rather than mass analysing them i.e. the mass filter/analyser is set to transmit ions having a specific mass to charge ratio rather than being scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a third embodiment of the present invention there is provided a mass spectrometer comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">an ion source;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">a mass filter/analyser;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">an upstream ion trap arranged upstream of the mass filter/analyser;</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">a downstream ion trap arranged downstream of the mass filter/analyser; and</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">a downstream ion detector arranged downstream of the downstream ion trap;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">wherein the mass filter/analyser is arranged to mass filter ions emitted from the ion source so that ions having a specific mass to charge ratio are onwardly transmitted and ions having other mass to charge ratios are attenuated by the mass filter and wherein ions onwardly transmitted by the mass filter are arranged to be substantially fragmented and wherein the fragment ions are arranged to be accumulated in the downstream ion trap, wherein the downstream ion trap then releases the fragment ions and at least some of the fragment ions are passed back upstream through the mass filter/analyser which is operated in a wide band pass mode so as to transmit substantially all the fragment ions wherein the fragment ions are arranged to be accumulated in the upstream ion trap, wherein the upstream ion trap then releases the fragment ions and at least some of the fragment ions are passed through the mass filter/analyser which is arranged to mass analyse or mass filter the fragment ions and wherein the fragment ions are transmitted by the downstream ion trap without the ions being substantially fragmented and are then detected by the downstream ion detector.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Single Reaction Monitoring and Multiple Reaction Monitoring embodiments are contemplated wherein the mass filter/analyser mass filters the fragment ions rather than mass analysing them i.e. the mass filter/analyser is set to transmit ions having a specific mass to charge ratio rather than being scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A fourth embodiment is contemplated which is similar to the second embodiment except that an upstream ion trap is arranged upstream of the mass filter/analyser.</p>

As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> this embodiment can advantageously perform a MS/MS experiment using apparatus comprising only a single mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> whereas conventional triple quadrupole mass spectrometers comprise two mass filters/analysers.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> according to the first embodiment four different modes of operation are cycled through in order to complete a MS/MS experiment. In the first mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is ON, the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> is set to transmit all ions irrespective of their mass to charge ratio (e.g. wide band pass mode or RF ion guide mode) and parent ions are trapped in the downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. In the subsequent MS mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is switched OFF, parent ions are released from the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> and pass upstream back through the mass analyser <b>2</b> which is scanned so that the parent ions are mass analysed and detected by the upstream ion detector <b>4</b>. In the subsequent mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is switched back ON, the mass filter <b>2</b> is arranged to operate in a narrow bandpass mode so that only parent ions falling within a specific narrow range of mass to charge ratios are transmitted by the mass filter <b>2</b>. These parent ions are then arranged to have an energy and the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> is arranged to be maintained at a pressure such that when the parent ions enter the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> they are caused to fragment into fragment ions which are also trapped, accumulated or otherwise stored in downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. In the final mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is again switched OFF and the fragment ions are released from the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> and are arranged to pass back upstream through the mass analyser <b>2</b> which is arranged to be scanned so as to mass analyse the fragment ions which are then detected by upstream ion detector <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> Single Reaction Monitoring and Multiple Reaction Monitoring embodiments are contemplated wherein the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> mass filters the fragment ions rather than mass analysing them i.e. the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> is set to transmit ions having a specific mass to charge ratio rather than being scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">It will be apparent from the above that in the second and fourth modes shown respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is turned OFF to allow the mass analyser <b>2</b> to analyse the previously accumulated ions. This prevents parent ions from the source which have not passed through the mass analyser <b>2</b> from appearing in the resulting mass spectra but has the disadvantage of lowering the overall duty cycle of the MS/MS experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to a preferred embodiment the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> may comprise a quadrupole rod set mass filter. In a scanning experiment such as described above approximately equal times may be spent in each of the four different modes. Accordingly, the ion source <b>1</b> would be OFF for about 50% of the time hence 50% of the ions generated would be used.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show a variation of the first embodiment for performing a Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) experiment. In a SRM experiment a known targeted compound is monitored. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> for the majority of the time (e.g. 90% of the time) the ion source <b>1</b> can be left ON. The mass filter <b>2</b> is set to transmit only parent ions having a specific mass to charge ratio which corresponds with the targeted compound. Those parent ions transmitted by the mass filter <b>2</b> are then fragmented in the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> and are stored in the downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. Accordingly, a majority of the time in any given experimental run can be spent accumulating fragment ions in the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> (i.e. the first mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The ion source <b>1</b> is then switched OFF for a relatively short period of time whilst the fragment ions are caused to exit the downstream ion trap <b>3</b>, pass back upstream through the mass filter <b>2</b> to the upstream ion detector <b>4</b>. Advantageously, concentrating the desired ion signal in a relatively short portion of an experimental cycle enhances the signal to noise ratio compared with conventional arrangements wherein an ion detector is active for substantially the whole of an experimental run. It is contemplated that an amplifier may be phase locked to the waveform of the experimental cycle. Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) experiments can also be performed by cycling through different mass to charge ratios and transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except that a downstream ion detector <b>5</b> is also provided downstream of the downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> the addition of a downstream ion detector <b>5</b> reduces the number of steps required for certain analyses. MS/MS experiments can be performed requiring one less step than in the first embodiment i.e. three steps as opposed to four. Furthermore, as is apparent from comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-C</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-D</figref>, the ion source <b>1</b> is OFF for only one out of the three modes of operation. The ion usage according to the second embodiment is therefore improved to 66% compared with 50% according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> according to the second embodiment three different modes of operation are cycled through in order to complete a MS/MS experiment.

The downstream ion trap <b>3</b> is arranged to operate as an ion guide. In the second mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> the ion source is again ON, the mass filter <b>2</b> is arranged to operated in a narrow bandpass mode so that only parent ions falling within a specific narrow range of mass to charge ratios are transmitted by the mass filter <b>2</b>. These parent ions are then arranged to have an energy and the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> is arranged to be maintained at a pressure such that when the parent ions enter the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> they are caused to fragment into fragment ions which are also trapped, accumulated or otherwise stored in downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. In the third mode of operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is switched OFF and the fragment ions are released from the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> and are arranged to pass back upstream through the mass analyser <b>2</b> which is arranged to be scanned so as to mass analyse the fragment ions which are then detected by upstream ion detector <b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates a third embodiment of the present invention. The third embodiment is similar to the second embodiment except that an upstream ion detector <b>4</b> is not necessarily required and an upstream ion trap <b>6</b> is provided upstream of the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b>. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> the addition of an upstream ion trap <b>6</b> without an upstream ion detector <b>4</b> allows MS<sup>n </sup>experiments to be performed wherein parent ions are selected, fragmented and then specific fragment ions may be selected and fragmented to form second generation fragment ions. This is possible because ions may be passed back and forth through the mass filter <b>2</b> as many times as desired. With no upstream ion detector <b>4</b> the ions preferably pass through the mass filter <b>2</b> an odd number of times for a particular experimental cycle. A typical experimental cycle for a MS/MS experiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The downstream ion detector <b>5</b> may be replaced by an orthogonal acceleration Time of Flight mass analyser which can reduce the number of steps required for any particular analysis in addition to improving the duty cycle.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates a fourth embodiment of the present invention.

The combination of an upstream ion trap <b>6</b> and an upstream ion detector <b>4</b> enables the number of cycles required for an experiment to be reduced.

In the third mode the ion source <b>1</b> remains ON and ions generated by the ion source <b>1</b> are preferably trapped in the upstream ion trap <b>6</b>. Meanwhile, fragment ions are caused to exit the downstream ion trap <b>3</b> and pass back upstream through the mass analyser <b>2</b> to the upstream ion detector <b>4</b>. The mass analyser <b>2</b> is arranged to be scanned so as to mass analyse the fragment ions which are then detected by the upstream ion detector <b>4</b>. According to the next mode ions from the upstream ion trap <b>6</b> are released and these ions together with other parent ions generated by the ion source <b>1</b> are transmitted by the upstream ion trap <b>6</b> which is set to operate as an ion guide. The mass filter <b>2</b> is arranged to transmit ions falling within a specific narrow range of mass to charge ratios.

According to the next mode shown and described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> the ion source <b>1</b> is switched OFF and fragment ions are released from the downstream ion trap <b>3</b>. The fragment ions are arranged to be passed back upstream through the mass filter <b>2</b> which is arranged to operate in a narrow bandpass mode so that only parent ions falling within a specific narrow range of mass to charge ratios are transmitted by the mass filter <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The modes described above illustrate how a MS<sup>3 </sup>experiment may be performed. The first and second modes are similar to the first and second modes of the MS/MS experiment according to the second embodiment.

The additional second upstream ion trap <b>7</b> allows all the ions generated by the ion source <b>1</b> to be used i.e. the ion source <b>1</b> does not need to be and preferably is not switched OFF whilst performing a MS<sup>3 </sup>experiment.

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">According to a preferred embodiment the various modes according to the fifth embodiment may correspond with those according to the fourth embodiment except that preferably instead of switching the ion source <b>1</b> OFF in the fifth and sixth modes of the fourth embodiment (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6D and 6E</figref>), the ion source <b>1</b> is preferably left ON and ions generated by the ion source <b>1</b> are trapped in the further upstream ion trap <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the above described embodiments the upstream and/or downstream ion detector <b>4</b>,<b>5</b> preferably comprise a detector per se.

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">It will be appreciated that the ion traps <b>3</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>7</b> are not necessarily ion tunnel ion traps/ion guides comprising a plurality of electrodes having apertures through which ions are transmitted and wherein substantially all the electrodes forming the ion tunnel ion trap/ion guide have substantially the same size apertures. Other forms of ion traps such as 2D linear quadrupole ion traps or Paul 3D quadrupole ion traps may also be used according to less preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Similarly, although the mass filter/analyser <b>2</b> is preferably a quadrupole rod set mass filter/analyser, the mass filter/analyser could according to less preferred embodiment comprise an axial Time of Flight mass filter/analyser, a magnetic sector mass analyser, a Paul or 3D quadrupole type ion trap, a 2D linear quadrupole ion trap, a Wien filter or another type of mass filter/analyser.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Reference is made in the present application to the mass filter/analyser being operated in different modes. When the mass filter/analyser is the to be operated as a mass filter then unless otherwise stated it is intended that the mass filter transmits ions having a narrow (e.g. 1 amu) range of mass to charge ratios. Ions having other mass to charge ratios are substantially attenuated by the mass filter. When the mass filter is described as operating in a wide band pass mode then this is intended to mean that the mass filter does not substantially mass filter ions i.e. ions are transmitted by the mass filter irrespective of their mass to charge ratio. Finally, when the mass filter/analyser is described as operating as a mass analyser, this is intended to mean that a narrow (e.g. 1 amu) mass to charge-ratio transmission window of the mass filter/analyser is rapidly scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In all the embodiments described above an axial DC voltage gradient or other means for urging ions through the mass spectrometer may or may not be provided. For example, according to less preferred embodiments when an ion trap is arranged to eject ions no axial DC voltage gradient may be provided along the length of the ion trap so that ions drift out of the ion trap but are not substantially accelerated out of the ion trap. Similarly, it will be appreciated that axial DC voltage gradients applied to one or more of the ion traps may be varied along the length of the ion trap and may vary in a time dependent manner.</p>
