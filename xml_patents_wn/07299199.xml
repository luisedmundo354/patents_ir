<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In general, the present invention relates to an information-processing system, an information-processing apparatus and an information-processing method. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information-processing system, an information-processing apparatus and an information-processing method that allow, for example, a content purchased by the user to be kept in a server.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, portable information terminal devices, such as a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and a digital portable telephone, have been utilized. Due to their small weight, it is convenient to connect the portable information terminals to the Internet for obtaining audio or video data content through a purchase arrangement or free download.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, memory embedded in the portable information terminal device does not have sufficient storage capacity. Thus, when new content is purchased with limited available memory, that is, a state in which a number of contents has been already stored in the memory, the user must erase a content already stored in the memory or, as an alternative, the user must erase a content already stored in the memory after copying the content to another memory, typically a memory card if the user does not want to lose the content.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As described above, as the number of contents to be used increases, the user must prepare a memory card for extra capacity, or, in the case of only one memory card available, contents stored in the memory card must be further copied to a large-capacity hard disk of a personal computer. As a result, operations to be carried out by the user become complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, when the user wants to use a content, which was once copied to the hard disk of a personal computer, in the portable information terminal device, the content must be copied back from the hard disk to the portable information terminal device by way of the memory card or it is necessary to connect the portable information terminal device to the personal computer and copy the content from the personal computer to the portable information terminal. In this case, the operations to be carried out by the user also become complicated as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses the problems described above to provide an information-processing system that allows the user to purchase a content and preserve the purchased content in a server so that it is not necessary for the user to worry about the storage capacity of a portable information terminal device's memory for storing contents.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An embodiment of the present invention is explained by referring to the diagrams as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical configuration of a content-providing system to which the present invention is applied. In the content-providing system, PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N and a server <b>3</b> are connected to the Internet <b>2</b>. In the following description, the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N are each referred to as a PDA <b>1</b>, which is a generic reference numeral for the PDAs, if it is not necessary to distinguish the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The user operates any of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N to transmit a request for purchase of a content to the server <b>3</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>. At that time, the ID of the user is also transmitted to the server <b>3</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is to be noted that the server <b>3</b> has received information on the user and issued the user ID to the user to indicate acceptance of the user in advance. The information includes the user's address, name and phone number. The user ID issued by the server is stored typically in a flash ROM <b>23</b> employed in the PDA <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Subsequently, a particular one of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N, which was operated by the user, receives the content transmitted by the server <b>3</b> on the basis of the purchase request, and stores the content in a memory card <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Then, the user operates the particular one of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N to transmit a request to the server <b>3</b>, asking the server <b>3</b> that the purchased content be preserved, and to acquire a preservation ID issued by the server <b>3</b> in response to the request, storing the preservation ID in the memory card <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The user may also operate any of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N to read out a preservation ID from the memory card <b>10</b> and transmit the preservation ID to the server <b>3</b> as a request for a transmission of a content associated with the preservation ID.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The server <b>3</b> is connected to a content database <b>4</b> and a preservation-ID database <b>5</b>. The content database <b>4</b> is used for storing data of contents and additional information associated with the contents. On the other hand, the preservation-ID database <b>5</b> is used for storing preservation IDs, which are issued to users when the users request the server <b>3</b> that purchased contents be preserved. It is to be noted that the content database <b>4</b> and the preservation-ID database <b>5</b> can be integrated into a single database if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the server <b>3</b> receives a request for purchase of a content, which is a request transmitted by any of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N through the Internet <b>2</b>, the server <b>3</b> reads out the content from the content database <b>4</b> and transmits the content to the PDA <b>1</b> making the request. In addition, when the server <b>3</b> receives a request for preservation of a purchased content, which is a request transmitted by any of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N through the Internet <b>2</b>, the server <b>3</b> issues a preservation ID based on the content ID of the purchased content transmitted to the user earlier and based on the user ID of the user making the request for preservation of the purchased content, and transmits the preservation ID to one of the PDAs <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>1</b>-N, which has made the request for preservation of the purchased content. The server <b>3</b> then stores the issued preservation ID in the preservation-ID database <b>5</b> by associating the preservation ID with the content ID.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is to be noted that, while only one server <b>3</b> is connected to the Internet <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in actuality, a plurality of servers <b>3</b> can be connected to the Internet <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a typical configuration of the external view of a PDA <b>1</b> in the content-providing system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The PDA <b>1</b> is enclosed in a case having such a size that the PDA <b>1</b> can be held in one hand and operated by one hand. On the upper portion of the PDA <b>1</b>, there are provided a memory-card slot <b>14</b>, into which a memory card <b>10</b> is to be inserted, and an infrared-ray communication unit <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The infrared-ray communication unit <b>30</b> is a component for exchanging information with other apparatus by carrying out infrared-ray communications. On the upper portion of the PDA <b>1</b>, it is also possible to provide a radio LAN unit (not shown) for carrying out Bluetooth (trademark) radio communications</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The memory card <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is typically a flash memory card developed by the applicant for a patent of the present invention. The flash memory card <b>10</b> developed by the applicant for a patent of the present invention is called a memory stick (trademark). This memory stick accommodates a flash-memory device in a small and thin plastic case having a height of 50 mm, a width of 21.5 mm and a thickness of 2.8 mm. The flash-memory device is a kind of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), which is a non-volatile memory allowing data stored therein to be electrically overwritten and erased. The plastic case has 10 pins through which various kinds of data are written into and read out from the flash-memory device. Examples of the data are picture, sound and musical data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the memory stick adopts an original serial protocol capable of sustaining compatibility with an apparatus employing the memory stick even if the specifications of the flash memory embedded in the memory stick are changed due to, for example, enhancement of the storage capacity. The memory stick realizes high-speed performance including a maximum write speed of 1.5 MB/S and a maximum read speed of 2.45 MB/S. In addition, the memory stick is provided with an inadvertent-erasure prevention switch for preventing data stored therein from being mistakenly erased so as to preserve high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Refer back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. On the bottom surface of the PDA <b>1</b>, there are provided a modem not shown in the figure and a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port <b>16</b> or an RS-232C port also not shown in the figure. The modem connects the PDA <b>1</b> to a public line network. The USB port <b>16</b> or the RS-232C port is used for exchanging various kinds of data with an external apparatus. In addition, the PDA <b>1</b> has a display unit <b>11</b>, a keyboard <b>12</b>, a jog dial <b>13</b> and a headphone terminal <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The display unit <b>11</b> is a thin display device such as a liquid-crystal display device for displaying pictures such as an icon and a thumbnail or a text. On the lower side of the display unit <b>11</b>, a touch pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>is provided. The user presses the display unit <b>11</b> or the touch pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>by using a finger or a pen in order to enter predetermined data or an operation command to a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>21</b>, which is employed in the PDA <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The keyboard <b>12</b> includes keys <b>12</b><i>a </i>to <b>12</b><i>f</i>. The user operates the keys <b>12</b><i>a </i>to <b>12</b><i>f </i>in order to enter predetermined data or an operation command to the CPU <b>21</b>. When the user operates the keyboard <b>12</b>, the CPU <b>21</b> activates software for displaying a schedule, a list of addresses or a memo, or scrolls the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, with a comic-picture screen, which will be described later, appearing on the display unit <b>11</b>, when the key <b>12</b><i>a </i>or <b>12</b><i>b </i>is operated, the screen is scrolled in the left direction of the screen, when the key <b>12</b><i>e </i>or <b>12</b><i>f </i>is operated, the screen is scrolled in the left direction of the screen, when the key <b>12</b><i>c </i>is operated, the screen is scrolled in the upward direction of the screen and when the key <b>12</b><i>d </i>is operated, the screen is scrolled in the downward direction of the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The user rotates or presses the jog dial <b>13</b> against the body of the PDA <b>1</b> in order to select one of items such as an icon, a thumbnail and a text, which are appearing on the display unit <b>11</b>. If the user rotates the jog dial <b>13</b> with a plurality of icons appearing on the display unit <b>11</b>, for example, a desired icon can be selected among the displayed icons. If the user further presses the jog dial <b>13</b> against the body of the PDA <b>1</b>, the selection of the selected icon is confirmed. If the selected icon corresponds to an application program, the application program is activated when the selection of the selected icon is confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the PDA <b>1</b> can be designed so that an operation to rotate the jog dial <b>13</b> while pressing the jog dial <b>13</b> is interpreted as an instruction different from the ordinary rotating operation. Nevertheless, relations between operations of the jog dial <b>13</b> and instructions corresponding to the operations are not limited to what is described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The headphone terminal <b>15</b> outputs sounds received from a sound generation unit <b>32</b> employed in the PDA <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to a headphone shown in none of the figures.</p>

A preservation ID is issued on the basis of a content ID and a user ID. That is to say, a preservation ID is an identifier having a value unique to a user and a content.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the typical preservation-ID database shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a content ID of 0001 is recorded, being associated with a preservation ID of 0001asfggg. By the same token, a content ID of 0002 is recorded, being associated with a preservation ID of 0002ddsdcc. In the same way, a content ID of 0003 is recorded, being associated with a preservation ID of 00034 kg0fi. Similarly, a content ID of 0001 is recorded, being associated with a preservation ID of 0001zzjk02.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The preservation IDs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are each created by appending a user ID to a content ID. For example, a user ID of asfggg is appended to a content ID of 0001 and a user ID of ddsdcc is appended to a content ID of 0002. It is to be noted, however, that the creation of the preservation IDs is no more than a typical way of creating preservation IDs in order to make the description easy to understand.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an explanatory functional block diagram showing functions of the server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A content distribution program <b>101</b> is a program for reading out a content from the content database <b>4</b> and transmitting the content to a PDA <b>1</b> in response to a request for purchase of the content, which is a request made by the PDA <b>1</b>. The content distribution program <b>101</b> is also a program for reading out a content ID associated with a preservation ID specified in a request for a transmission of a content from the preservation-ID database <b>5</b> and for further reading out the content identified by the content ID from the content database <b>4</b> and, finally, transmitting the content to a PDA <b>1</b> in response to the request made by the PDA <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b> is a program for issuing a preservation ID based on a user ID and based on a content ID in response to a request for a preservation of a content identified by the content ID, which is a request received from a PDA <b>1</b> associated with the user ID. The preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b> is also a program for storing an issued preservation ID in the preservation-ID database <b>5</b>, associating the preservation ID with the content ID.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An authentication program <b>103</b> is a program, which is used for authenticating the user on the basis of a user ID owned by a PDA <b>1</b> when a request for purchase of a content is received from the PDA <b>1</b>. The authentication program <b>103</b> is also a program, which is used for carrying out an authentication process to verify the validity of a preservation ID specified in a request for a preservation of a content when the request is received from a PDA <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">An input/output management program <b>104</b> is a program for supplying a signal received from a PDA <b>1</b> through the communication unit <b>86</b> to the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b> or the authentication program <b>103</b> and for managing processes to transmit predetermined data based on results of processing carried out by the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b> and the authentication program <b>103</b> to a PDA <b>1</b> by way of the communication unit <b>86</b> and the Internet <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">By referring to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the following description explains pieces of processing ranging from an operation carried out by a PDA <b>1</b> to purchase a content to an operation to preserve the content in the server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">First of all, when the user of a PDA <b>1</b> wants to purchase a content, the user activates the content purchase program <b>61</b> by operating the keyboard <b>12</b>, the jog dial <b>13</b> or the touch pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the display unit <b>11</b>. In this way, the CPU <b>21</b> of the PDA <b>1</b> executes the content purchase program <b>61</b> stored in flash ROM <b>23</b> or the EDO DRAM <b>24</b>. While the content purchase program <b>61</b> is being executed, the user enters information on the content to be purchased. Examples of the information on the content to be purchased are the name of the content and the content ID of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At a step S<b>1</b>, by execution of the content purchase program <b>61</b>, the PDA <b>1</b> receives information on a desired content. Entered by the user, examples of the information on the content to be purchased are the name of the content and the content ID of the content as described above. Under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>, the communication unit <b>34</b> transmits a signal making a request for purchase of the content to the server <b>3</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b>. At that time, a user ID stored in the flash ROM <b>23</b> is also transmitted to the server <b>3</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">At a step S<b>1</b>, in the server <b>3</b>, the communication unit <b>86</b> receives the request for purchase of the content from the PDA <b>1</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>, and passes on the request to the CPU <b>81</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. The CPU <b>81</b> then executes the content distribution program <b>101</b> to handle the request for purchase of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The authentication program <b>103</b> is then executed to authenticate the user on the basis of a user ID included in the request for purchase of the content. A result of the authentication is then supplied to the content distribution program <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At the next step S<b>12</b>, by execution of the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not the authentication of the user was successful on the basis of the authentication result received from the authentication program <b>103</b>. If the authentication of the user was unsuccessful due to, for example, the fact that the user has been determined to be an unregistered user, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>13</b> at which the communication unit <b>86</b> transmits a message indicating the unsuccessful authentication of the user to the PDA <b>1</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. The processing is then ended.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>12</b> indicates a successful authentication of the user, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>14</b> at which, by execution of the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> reads out a content indicated by a content name or a content ID from the content database <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the communication unit <b>86</b> then transmits the content to the PDA <b>1</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. The content name or the content ID is information included in the request for purchase of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">At a step S<b>2</b>, by execution of the content purchase program <b>61</b>, the PDA <b>1</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not a message received from the server <b>3</b> indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the user. If the result of the judgment shows that the message received from the server <b>3</b> indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the user, the processing is ended without executing subsequent steps. Then, if necessary, the user registers itself in the server <b>3</b> before again starting the process of the step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>2</b> shows that no message was received from the server <b>3</b> to indicate an unsuccessful authentication of the user, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>3</b> at which the communication unit <b>34</b> receives the content from the server <b>3</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>, and passes on the content to the content purchase program <b>61</b> under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>. If necessary, the content is stored in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash ROM <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">If the user of the PDA <b>1</b> wants to preserve the content purchased this time in the server <b>3</b>, the user enters a command to preserve the content by carrying out a predetermined operation on the keyboard <b>12</b>, the jog dial <b>13</b> or the touch pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the display unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, at the next step S<b>4</b>, by execution of the content purchase program <b>61</b>, the PDA <b>1</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not the content purchased this time needs to be preserved in the server <b>3</b>, that is, whether or not the user has entered a request for a preservation of the purchased content. If the result of the judgment shows that the content purchased this time does not need to be preserved in the server <b>3</b>, the processing is ended without executing subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>4</b> shows that the content purchased this time needs to be preserved in the server <b>3</b>, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>5</b> at which, by execution of the content purchase program <b>61</b>, the user's request for a preservation of the purchased content is accepted, and the communication unit <b>34</b> transmits the request to the server <b>3</b> through the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">It is to be noted that the request for a preservation of the purchased content is actually a request for an issuance of a preservation ID and, is not by all means a request for a transmission of the purchased content from the PDA <b>1</b> to the server <b>3</b> to preserve the content in the server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At a step S<b>15</b>, by execution of the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the server <b>3</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not the server <b>3</b> has received the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA <b>1</b>. If the result of the judgment indicates that the server <b>3</b> did not receive the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA <b>1</b>, the processing is ended without executing subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>15</b> indicates that the server <b>3</b> has received the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA <b>1</b>, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>16</b> at which the communication unit <b>86</b> receives the request for a preservation of the purchased content from the PDA <b>1</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>, and passes on the request to the content distribution program <b>101</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. Then, the preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">By execution of the preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b>, a preservation ID is generated on the basis of the user ID authenticated in the processing carried out at the steps S<b>11</b> and S<b>12</b> and on the basis of the content ID of the content transmitted to the PDA <b>1</b> in the processing carried out at the step S<b>14</b>. Then, the communication unit <b>86</b> transmits (delivers) the preservation ID to the PDA <b>1</b> through the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Typically, a preservation ID is a hash value obtained by extracting data with a proper length from a result of applying a hash function to a user ID and a content ID. A hash value used as a preservation ID is a value obtained as a result of applying a hash function to data, which is a user ID and a content ID in this case. A hash function is a one-directional function of mapping data generally having a variable length onto a value having a fixed length. A hash function has a property that makes collisions among hash values difficult to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">At a step S<b>17</b>, by execution of the preservation-ID issuance program <b>102</b>, the preservation ID issued in the processing carried out at the step S<b>16</b> is stored in the preservation-ID database <b>5</b>, being associated with the content ID as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">At a step S<b>6</b>, the communication unit <b>34</b> employed in the PDA <b>1</b> receives the preservation ID from the server <b>3</b> through the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>. By execution of the content purchase program <b>61</b>, the preservation ID is then stored in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash memory <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the user of the PDA <b>1</b> is allowed to preserve a purchased content in the server <b>3</b> so that it is not necessary to store a purchased content in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash memory <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Thus, by merely storing a preservation ID issued by the server <b>3</b> in response to a request for a preservation of a purchased content in the server <b>3</b>, the PDA <b>1</b> is capable of downloading the purchased content from the server <b>3</b> if necessary at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described above, when a content is purchased, processing is carried out to form a judgment as to whether or not the purchased content needs to be preserved in the server <b>3</b>. It is to be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited to this scheme. For example, a request for a preservation of a purchased content can be made when such a preservation becomes necessary at a later time after the purchase of the content. That is to say, a purchased content can be preserved in the server <b>3</b> at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">By referring to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the following description explains a process carried out by the PDA <b>1</b> to download a purchased content preserved in the server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">First of all, when the user of the PDA <b>1</b> wants to download a purchased content preserved in the server <b>3</b> under management executed by the server <b>3</b> at a request made earlier by the user to preserve the content in the server <b>3</b>, the user activates the content exchange program <b>62</b> by operating the keyboard <b>12</b>, the jog dial <b>13</b> or the touch pad <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the display unit <b>11</b>. In this way, the CPU <b>21</b> employed in the PDA <b>1</b> executes the content exchange program <b>62</b> stored in the EDO DRAM <b>24</b> or the flash ROM <b>23</b>. By execution of the content exchange program <b>62</b>, the user selects a preservation ID among those stored in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash ROM <b>23</b> and carries out an operation to make a request for a transmission of a purchased content identified by the preservation ID from the server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At a step S<b>31</b>, by execution of the content exchange program <b>62</b>, from the user, the PDA <b>1</b> receives a request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID from the server <b>3</b>. The communication unit <b>34</b> transmits a signal representing the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID to the server <b>3</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">At a step S<b>41</b>, in the server <b>3</b>, the communication unit <b>86</b> receives the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID from the PDA <b>1</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>, and passes on the request to the CPU <b>81</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. The CPU <b>81</b> then executes the content distribution program <b>101</b> to handle the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID. As part of the execution of the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the authentication program <b>103</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The authentication program <b>103</b> is then executed to determine whether or not the preservation ID included in the request for a transmission of a purchased content associated with the preservation ID is valid. A result of the authentication is then supplied to the content distribution program <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">At the next step S<b>42</b>, by execution of the content distribution program <b>101</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not the authentication of the preservation ID was successful on the basis of the authentication result received from the authentication program <b>103</b>. If the authentication of the preservation ID was unsuccessful due to, for example, the fact that the preservation ID has been falsified, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>43</b> at which the communication unit <b>86</b> transmits a message indicating the unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID to the PDA <b>1</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>. The processing is then ended without executing subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>42</b> indicates a successful authentication of the preservation ID, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>44</b> at which, by execution of the content distribution program <b>1001</b>, the CPU <b>81</b> reads out a content ID associated with the preservation ID from the preservation-ID database <b>5</b> and, then, reads out a content, which is identified by the content ID read out from the preservation-ID database <b>5</b>, from the content database <b>4</b>. Subsequently, the communication unit <b>86</b> transmits the content to the PDA <b>1</b> by way of the Internet <b>2</b> under control of the input/output management program <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">At a step S<b>32</b>, by execution of the content exchange program <b>62</b>, the PDA <b>1</b> forms a judgment as to whether or not a message received from the server <b>3</b> indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID. If the result of the judgment shows that the message received from the server <b>3</b> indicates an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID, the processing is ended without executing subsequent steps.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">If the result of the judgment formed at the step S<b>32</b> shows that no message was received from the server <b>3</b> to indicate an unsuccessful authentication of the preservation ID, on the other hand, the flow of the processing goes on to a step S<b>33</b> at which the communication unit <b>34</b> receives the content from the server <b>3</b> through the Internet <b>2</b>, and passes on the content to the content exchange program <b>62</b> under control of the data communication program <b>64</b>. If necessary, the content is stored in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash ROM <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As described above, the user of the PDA <b>1</b> is capable of downloading a purchased content associated with a preservation ID issued by the server <b>3</b> when necessary. Thus, it is not necessary to store a purchased content in the memory card <b>10</b> or the flash ROM <b>23</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Thus, the user can purchase a content without worrying about the storage capacity of the memory employed in the PDA <b>1</b> owned by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In addition, by using a PDA <b>1</b>, a content can be purchased and preservation of the purchased content can be requested as described above. However, the present invention is not limited to the use of a PDA <b>1</b>. For example, a wide range of other information-processing apparatus connectable to a digital portable telephone, a portable personal computer and the server <b>3</b> through the network such as the Internet <b>2</b> can also be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The series of processes described above can be carried out by using hardware or by execution of software. If the series of processes is carried out by execution of software, programs composing the software are installed in a computer from program storage media. The computer can be a computer including embedded special-purpose hardware or a computer capable of carrying out a variety of functions by execution of a variety of programs installed therein. An example of the latter computer is a general-purpose personal computer.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The program storage media for storing programs to be installed into a storage medium employed in a computer is so-called package media. Examples of the package media are the magnetic disk <b>51</b> or <b>91</b> including a flexible disk, the optical disk <b>52</b> or <b>92</b> including a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) and a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), the magneto-optical disk <b>53</b> or <b>93</b> or an MD (Mini-Disc, trademark) and the memory card <b>10</b> or the semiconductor memory <b>94</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <b>5</b>. The installed programs are then loaded from the storage medium into a memory such as a RAM employed in the computer in a state of being executable by the computer. The storage medium for installing programs is embedded in the hard disk drive <b>87</b>. Instead of installing programs into the hard disk drive <b>87</b> as described above, the programs can be stored in advance in the flash ROM <b>23</b>. The hard disk drive <b>87</b> and the flash ROM <b>23</b> are each a storage medium that can be used for storing programs temporarily or permanently. As an alternative, the programs can be installed into the storage medium employed in the computer not from the package media but, if necessary, from a remote source by way of communication media and an interface employed in the computer. The communication media includes a wire communication medium such as the Internet <b>2</b> and a radio communication medium such as the digital satellite broadcasting. The Internet <b>2</b> includes a public line network and a local area network. On the other hand, the interface employed in the computer is the communication unit <b>34</b> or <b>86</b>, which is typically implemented by a router or a modem.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">It is to be noted that in this specification, steps prescribing a program stored in a recording medium can of course be pieces of processing, which are carried out in a prescribed order along the time series, but do not have to be executed sequentially. That is to say, the steps can be pieces of processing, which are carried out concurrently or individually.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In addition, the word ‘system’ used in this specification means the whole system including a plurality of apparatuses.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In accordance with the present invention, the user can preserve a purchased content in a server. Thus, the user can purchase a content without worrying about the storage capacity of a memory employed in an apparatus used by the user. In addition, the server is capable of managing contents purchased by users with ease.</p>
