<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to rack devices and more particularly pertains to a new rack device for supporting material above a pick-up truck bed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of rack devices is known in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,152 describes a device that includes adjustable poles that are mountable on and extendable across a pick-up bed. The poles are telescoping to ensure that they properly fit across the bed. Another type of rack device is U.S. Pat. No. 4,659,131 having a plurality of vertically orientated posts that are removably extendable into the sides of a pick-up bed so that the posts are vertically supported. The top ends of the posts are secured to horizontal members onto which items may be positioned. Yet another such device is U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,583 which includes posts that are pivotally coupled to supports that are positioned on an upper edge of side walls of a pick-up bed so that the posts may be selectively positioned in a horizontal position or a vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the need remains for a device that includes a method for releasably securing collapsible posts to a pick-up bed so that the posts may be easily erected into a vertical position or taken down and stored within the pick-up bed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention meets the needs presented above by generally including a first support and a second support. Each of the first and second supports includes a first leg, a second leg and an elongated arm extending between and is attached to the first and second legs. The first and second legs each extend away from an associated one of the arms in generally the same direction. Each of the first and second legs has an upper end and bottom end. The arms are positioned adjacent to respective ones of the upper ends. Each of a plurality of securing assemblies is adapted for being releasably securing one of the bottom ends of the legs to one of a pair of inwardly extending lips attached to the side walls of a pick-up bed. The securing assemblies attach the legs to the lips so that the legs extend upwardly from the bed and the arms traverse the bed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> thereof, a new rack device embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref>, the truck rack apparatus <b>10</b> generally comprises a support assembly for selectively mounting material <b>5</b> above a pick-up bed <b>6</b>. The bed <b>6</b> is bounded by a pair of side walls <b>7</b> each having an upper edge. Each of a pair of inwardly extending lips <b>8</b> is attached to one of the upper edges of the side walls <b>7</b> such that the lips <b>8</b> extend toward each other from the oppositely positioned side walls. Downwardly extending flanges <b>9</b> are typically attached to the lips <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The apparatus <b>10</b> includes a first support <b>12</b> and a second support <b>13</b>. Each of the first <b>12</b> and second <b>13</b> supports includes a first leg <b>14</b>, a second leg <b>15</b> and an elongated arm <b>16</b> extending between and attached to the first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> legs. The first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> legs each extend away from an associated one of the arms <b>16</b> in generally the same direction. Each of the first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> legs has an upper end <b>17</b> and bottom end <b>18</b>. The arms <b>16</b> are positioned adjacent to respective ones of the upper ends <b>17</b>. Each of the arms <b>16</b> has break <b>19</b> therein such that a first portion <b>20</b> and a second portion <b>21</b> of each of the arms <b>16</b> is defined.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plurality of couplers <b>22</b> is attached to the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions for selectively coupling the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions together. The couplers <b>22</b> preferably include braces <b>23</b> attached to each of the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions adjacent to the break <b>19</b> and positioned so that the braces <b>23</b> are positioned on opposite sides of the arm <b>16</b> when the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions are joined. The braces <b>23</b> each have a bottom edge having a slot <b>24</b> therein. Posts <b>25</b> are positioned opposite of the braces <b>23</b> so that the posts <b>25</b> extend into the slots <b>24</b> when the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions are positioned together so that gravity retains the posts <b>25</b> within the slots <b>24</b>. Alignable holes <b>27</b> may be utilized for receiving a locking pin for locking the braces in place. A hinge <b>28</b> may be used to hingedly couple the first <b>20</b> and second <b>21</b> portions together so that they may be folded up in the stored position. The hinge <b>28</b> is formed from an interlocking rod <b>36</b> and cylinder <b>37</b> combination. Locking flaps <b>38</b>, attached to the ends of the first <b>20</b> and second portion opposite of a corresponding one of the braces <b>23</b>, may be selectively biased outwardly against the braces <b>23</b> to add stability to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The arm <b>16</b> of the first support <b>12</b> has a pair of bends <b>29</b> therein. Each of the bends <b>29</b> forms substantially perpendicular angles such that the arm <b>16</b> of the first support <b>12</b> is generally U-shapes and lies in a plane orientated perpendicular to a plane of the first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> arms of the first support <b>12</b>. The legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> each have a length generally between 2 feet and 3½ feet. The arms <b>16</b> have a length such that the bottom ends <b>18</b> of the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are spaced a distance generally equal to a width of the bed <b>6</b>. It is also preferred that the each of the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> have a pair of bends <b>30</b> therein so that the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> extend slightly inward toward the arms <b>16</b>. This positions the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> substantially over the bed <b>6</b> when the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are mounted on a truck <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of a plurality of tabs <b>31</b> is attached to one of the upper ends <b>17</b> of the first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> legs such that each of the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> has at least one tab <b>31</b> attached thereto. Each of the tabs <b>31</b> extends away from the upper ends <b>17</b> so that the tabs <b>31</b> extend upwardly when the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are vertically orientated. The tabs <b>31</b> each have an aperture <b>32</b> extending therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of a plurality of securing assemblies <b>40</b> is adapted for being releasably securing one of the bottom ends <b>18</b> of the legs to one of the inwardly extending lips <b>8</b> such that the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> extend upwardly from the bed <b>6</b> and the arms <b>16</b> traverse the bed <b>6</b>. Each of the securing assemblies <b>40</b> includes a bracket attachment that is adapted for being selectively attached to the lip <b>8</b>. The bracket attachment includes a support plate <b>41</b> and a biasing plate <b>42</b> spaced from each other and hingedly coupled together with an attachment means. The support plate <b>41</b> is selectively positioned on an upper surface of the lip <b>8</b> and the biasing plate <b>42</b> is positioned on a lower surface of the lip such that the biasing plate <b>42</b> biases the support plate <b>41</b> against the upper surface of the lip <b>7</b> by pulling the support plate <b>41</b> against the lip <b>8</b>. The attachment means includes a post <b>43</b> and a connector plate <b>46</b>. The post <b>43</b> has a first end <b>44</b> and a second end <b>45</b>.

The saddle <b>50</b> includes a pair of vertical walls <b>51</b> and a bottom wall <b>52</b> attached together in a U-shaped configuration. The vertical walls <b>51</b> are orientated generally parallel to the upper portion <b>48</b> of the connector plate <b>46</b>. The saddle <b>50</b> is positioned between the post <b>43</b> and the connector plate <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A protruding member <b>60</b> is attached to and extends upwardly from the support plate <b>41</b>. The protruding member <b>60</b> is removably extendable into wells <b>61</b> extending upwardly into the bottom ends <b>18</b> of the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A plurality of connecting members <b>70</b> is adapted for releasably connecting each of the first <b>14</b> and second <b>15</b> legs to one of the side walls <b>7</b> in a stored position. The connecting members <b>70</b> are preferably attached to the side walls and include U-shaped brackets that the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> can be positioned in. Clips <b>71</b> may be attached to the legs for engaging the brackets to further secure the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in place. The connecting members <b>70</b> may include upwardly extending members for preventing the clips from sliding off of the connecting members <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In use, the securing assemblies <b>40</b> are attached to lips <b>8</b> and positioned opposite with respect to each other. The protruding members <b>60</b> are extended into the legs <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> so that the arms <b>16</b> extend over the bed <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is preferred that that arm <b>16</b> of the first support <b>12</b> is positioned over a cab of the truck <b>4</b> to provide support extending forward from the bed <b>6</b>. Elongated items are positioned on the arms <b>16</b> and secured thereto with tethers such as bungee cords or ropes. The tabs <b>31</b> provide convenient tie-down areas.</p>
