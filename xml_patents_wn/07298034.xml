<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to an application entitled “Multi-Chip Semiconductor Connector and Method” having inventors Carney et al and to an application entitled “Multi-Chip Semiconductor Connector Assembly Method” having inventors Carney et al, both of which are filed concurrently herewith and both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates, in general, to electronics, and more particularly, to methods of forming semiconductor devices and packaging therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, the semiconductor industry utilized a variety of package configurations to increase the packing density of semiconductor die in a system. The increased demand for electronic devices increased the demand for smaller, lighter, and yet more functional semiconductor devices and resulted in a demand for semiconductor packages that had increased semiconductor packaging densities with smaller outlines and mounting footprints. In some embodiments, semiconductor die were vertically stack on top of one another with an interposing layer of adhesive to attached to the semiconductor die in order to attach the die together. The die were then attached to a glass-epoxy type printed circuit board substrate or other similar substrate. The semiconductor die were then wire bonded to the substrate to form electrical interconnections between the substrate and the semiconductor die. One example of such a package configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,650,019 issued to Thomas B. Glenn et al on Nov. 18, 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It often took considerable horizontal space to wire bond to both of the semiconductor die which increased the footprint. Further, wire bonding to the semiconductor die consumed additional vertical space which increased the height. Another problem with such a configuration was thermal dissipation. The attachment medium used to attach the two die together often had low thermal conductivity, which reduced the thermal conductivity of the configuration and minimized the power dissipation capability of the configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to have a means of attaching multiple die together, that provides high thermal conductivity, that does not require wire bonding, and that has a small footprint.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional portion of an embodiment of a multi-chip semiconductor connector assembly <b>35</b> that utilizes connector <b>20</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as one connector of a plurality of multi-chip semiconductor connectors to attach a first semiconductor die <b>36</b> to a second semiconductor die <b>37</b>. This description has references to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Assembly <b>35</b> also includes a second multi-chip semiconductor connector <b>38</b> that is an alternate embodiment of connector <b>20</b> that was explained in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Connector <b>38</b> includes a first conductive strip <b>39</b> that has support portion <b>23</b>, connection portion <b>22</b>, and a first attachment area <b>41</b>. A second conductive strip <b>40</b> of connector <b>38</b> has support portion <b>30</b>, connection portion <b>28</b>, and a second attachment area <b>42</b>. Connector <b>38</b> and strips <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> are identified in a general way by arrows. Methods for forming connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> are disclosed in a related patent application entitled “Multi-Chip Semiconductor Connector and Method” having inventors Carney et al which previously was incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Semiconductor die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> typically have a top side or front side <b>48</b> that has a plurality of connection points and a bottom or backside <b>49</b> that typically has a single connection point. Such backside and front side connection points and electrodes and methods of forming them are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may be power transistors that have a source and gate connection point on front side <b>48</b> and a drain connection point on backside <b>49</b>. One or both of die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may also be a diode, an IGBT, an analog or a digital logic semiconductor device, or any other type of semiconductor device. The different connection points on each of die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may have different sized attachment pads or connection points, thus, the attachment area of connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> may have different sizes or surface areas in order to mate to the corresponding connection points on die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. For example, a source pad or source connection point may have a larger surface area than a gate pad or gate connection point in order to support a larger current flow, and a drain pad or drain connection point may have an even larger area than the source connection point. Consequently, attachment areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> of connector <b>38</b> are formed to have a larger surface area than attachment areas <b>21</b> and <b>29</b> in order to mate to the respective connection points of die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to form electrical connection to the connection points of die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, strips <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>40</b> typically are formed from a conductive material that is suitable for being attached to the connection pads of die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, such as solder or conductive epoxy, and that provides a low resistance electrical conduction path. Additionally, connection portions <b>23</b>, and <b>30</b> assist in supporting the weight of assembly <b>35</b>, thus, the material utilized to form connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> must also provide rigidity and support. Insulator <b>26</b> provides electrical insulation between strips <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> and between strips <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> and also provides sufficient rigidity to support at least the weight of die <b>37</b>. It will be appreciated that strips <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>40</b> may all have different widths and thickness. Although each of strips <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are illustrated to have connection portions extending from only one side, it will be appreciated that any of strips <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> may have connection portions extending from all four sides of support portions <b>22</b> and <b>28</b>, or extending from only one side, or extending from any combination of sides. Attachment areas <b>21</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>41</b>, and <b>42</b> typically are formed as raised areas on a portion of the surface of support portions <b>22</b> and <b>28</b>. Areas <b>21</b> and <b>41</b>, and areas <b>29</b> and <b>42</b> typically extend a first distance <b>53</b> from a surface of respective portions <b>22</b> and <b>28</b>, for example extending from surface <b>24</b> of portion <b>22</b>. As will be seen further hereinafter, first distance <b>53</b> typically is selected to be at least as large as the bond-line thickness of the attachment material that is utilized to attach areas <b>21</b> and <b>41</b> to die <b>37</b> and areas <b>29</b> and <b>42</b> to die <b>36</b>. Additionally, first distance <b>53</b> should be sufficient to ensure that the attachment material utilized to attach connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> to die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> sufficiently wets to areas <b>21</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>41</b>, and <b>42</b>. The surface area of each of attachment areas <b>21</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>41</b>, and <b>42</b> generally are formed to be less than the surface area of the exposed part of the corresponding connection point of dies <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. As is well known in the art, a portion of the connection points on die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may be covered by a passivation layer, thus, the exposed surface area of the connection point may be less than the total surface area of the connection point. In most embodiments, support portions <b>23</b> and <b>30</b> are formed in a different plane from the plane of connection portions <b>22</b> and <b>28</b> so that portions <b>23</b> and <b>30</b> may function as leads that provide external connections to die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. A distal end <b>33</b> of strips <b>31</b> and <b>39</b> and a distal end <b>34</b> of strips <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> generally are used to attach assembly <b>35</b> to an intermediate substrate such as a printed circuit board or a ceramic substrate or onto a semiconductor leadframe, or may be used as an assembly that is encapsulated to form a semiconductor package. Connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> are mechanically attached to and electrically connected to die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> so that die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> generally are in different planes. As can be seen, at least the surface of front side <b>48</b> of die <b>37</b> is in a different plane from the surface of backside <b>49</b> of die <b>36</b>. Typically, the two planes do not intersect. In most embodiments, the two planes are approximately parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional portion of an embodiment of a semiconductor device <b>50</b> that utilizes assembly <b>35</b> within a semiconductor package <b>54</b> having a package body <b>51</b>. Package <b>54</b> is illustrated in a general way by an arrow. Backside <b>49</b> of die <b>36</b> typically is attached to a conductor in order to form electrical contact to backside <b>49</b>. The conductor usually is a die attach area or flag <b>44</b> of a semiconductor package leadframe. Additionally, a conductor <b>43</b> may be attached backside <b>49</b> of die <b>37</b> to provide electrical connection thereto. Conductor <b>43</b> typically is similar to one of strips <b>32</b> or <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Distal ends <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, flag <b>44</b>, and the distal end of conductor <b>43</b> generally are at least substantially coplanar with a bottom surface of body <b>51</b>. In some embodiments, ends <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> may extend past the bottom surface of body <b>51</b>. The mechanical attachment of connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> to die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> facilitates reducing the height or thickness of package <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example embodiment of assembly <b>35</b> and package <b>54</b>, die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are power transistors.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rigidly of strips <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>40</b> mechanically support die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> and eliminates the need for an insulating material attached to die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> and between die <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> to provide the mechanical support. The large surface area of strips <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>39</b>, and <b>40</b> provides low resistance and high thermal conductivity thereby increasing the thermal capacity of package <b>54</b> and reducing the lead resistance.</p>

Connector <b>46</b> is utilized to form a mechanical attachment to and a common electrical connection between two semiconductor die such as die <b>36</b> and die <b>37</b>, instead of electrically isolated connections that were formed by connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b>. Connector <b>46</b> includes a first attachment area <b>47</b> on a top surface of portion <b>28</b> and second attachment area <b>29</b> on bottom surface <b>25</b> of portion <b>22</b>. The surface area of attachment area <b>47</b> is larger than the surface area of attachment area <b>29</b> in order to provide a low resistance connection between semiconductor die connection points that have different sizes. Alternately, areas <b>47</b> and <b>29</b> may have the same size in order to provide electrical connection between two connection points of the same size, for example two source connection points.</p>

Device <b>185</b> includes a plurality of multi-chip semiconductor connectors including multi-chip semiconductor connectors <b>186</b> and <b>200</b> that are alternate embodiments of connectors <b>20</b> and <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Connectors <b>186</b> and <b>200</b> mechanically attach together a plurality of semiconductor die that are not all in the same plane. Connectors <b>186</b> and <b>200</b> are electrically connected to and mechanically attached to the plurality of semiconductor die. The plurality of semiconductor die include semiconductor die <b>119</b> and <b>120</b>. Connector <b>186</b> includes a first conductive strip <b>187</b> and a second conductive strip <b>193</b> that are alternate embodiments of respective strips <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).

Similarly, connector <b>200</b> includes a first conductive strip <b>201</b> and a second conductive strip <b>206</b> that are alternate embodiments of strips <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Strip <b>206</b> includes a connection portion <b>209</b>, a support portion <b>208</b>, and an attachment area <b>207</b> that are alternate embodiments of resection portion <b>30</b>, portion <b>28</b>, and area <b>29</b>. Strip <b>201</b> includes a connection portion <b>204</b>, a support portion <b>203</b>, and an attachment area <b>202</b> that are alternate embodiments of respective portion <b>23</b>, portion <b>22</b>, and area <b>21</b>. Connectors <b>186</b> and <b>200</b>, and strips <b>187</b>, <b>193</b>, <b>201</b>, and <b>206</b> are identified in a generally way by arrows.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As can be seen, the connection portions and the support portions of the conductive strips of connectors <b>186</b> and <b>200</b> may have various shapes in order to route the electrical connections from the connection points of the respective semiconductor die to other points such as to leads of a leadframe, to conductors of a substrate such as a ceramic substrate or a printed circuit board or a flex tape, or to other conductors external to the semiconductor die and external to the multi-chip semiconductor connectors.

The turns of conductive portion <b>203</b> may be made at angles other than right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In view of all of the above, it is evident that a novel device and method is disclosed. Included, among other features, is forming a multi-chip semiconductor assembly by electrically connecting and mechanically attaching a multi-chip semiconductor connector to a plurality of semiconductor die. The rigidity of the multi-chip semiconductor connector provides support for the die and eliminates the need for an intermediate adhesive support layer thereby improving the thermal dissipation of the assembly and packages that use the assembly. Using the connectors to provide electrical connection between the semiconductor die and a semiconductor package reduces the package height and footprint. Additionally, more than two semiconductor die can be attached together to increase the packing density of the packages and any system that uses the packages.</p>
