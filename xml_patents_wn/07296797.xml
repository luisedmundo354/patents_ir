<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to card games. More particularly, the present invention relates to a card game in which game pieces are incrementally advanced around a game board to a palace destination according to numbers displayed on playing cards, preferably customized player cards having the same images as those displayed on Iraqi Most Wanted playing cards, dealt to each of multiple players.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Card games are popular among persons of all ages because they require participants to use strategy and skill in an attempt to out-maneuver their opponents and win the game. A standard card deck includes 52 playing cards divided into four suits (spades, diamonds, hearts and clubs) each having multiple card types numbered from two to ten, in addition to a king card, a queen card, a jack card and an ace card. Recently, the Pentagon released a 52-card deck of playing cards known as the Iraqi Most Wanted playing cards. These playing cards feature fifty-two of those who were the most wanted Iraqi officials in Saddam Hussein's regime at the time the Operation Iraqi Freedom war started in 2003. The Iraqi Most Wanted playing cards were designed to aid U.S. military personnel in identifying and capturing these officials.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is generally directed to a method of playing a card game. The method includes providing a game board having multiple base areas, a destination and an advancement path having a plurality of advancement spaces between the base camps and the destination. A set of the playing cards is dealt from the deck to each of multiple players. At least one game piece is provided on each of the base camps for each of the players. Each of the players draws one of the playing cards from his or her dealt set of said playing cards and advances the game pieces from his or her base camps on the advancement path for a number of the advancement spaces corresponding to a numerical value displayed on the drawn playing card.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to the drawings, an illustrative game board which is suitable for implementation of the card game of the present invention is generally indicated by reference numeral <b>1</b>. The game board <b>1</b> includes multiple base areas <b>2</b> which are placed in various locations on the game board <b>1</b>. For example, the base areas <b>2</b> may be located in general proximity to the corners <b>1</b><i>a </i>and edges <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the game board <b>1</b>. Preferably, there are six base areas <b>2</b> provided on the game board <b>1</b>. These may include, for example, a base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a</i>; a base camp Bravo <b>2</b><i>b</i>; a base camp Charlie <b>2</b><i>c</i>; a base camp Delta <b>2</b><i>d</i>; a base camp Echo <b>2</b><i>e</i>; and a base camp Foxtrot <b>2</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An advancement path <b>3</b> extends among and between the base areas <b>2</b>. The advancement path <b>3</b> includes a start space <b>8</b> for each of the base areas <b>2</b>. Preferably, the advancement path <b>3</b> includes a start space <b>8</b><i>a </i>for the base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a start space <b>8</b><i>b </i>for the base camp Bravo <b>2</b><i>b</i>, a start space <b>8</b><i>c </i>for the base camp Charlie <b>2</b><i>c</i>, a start space <b>8</b><i>d </i>for the base camp Delta <b>2</b><i>d</i>, a start space <b>8</b><i>e </i>for the base camp Echo, and a start space <b>8</b><i>f </i>for the base camp Foxtrot <b>2</b><i>f</i>. Multiple, adjacent advancement spaces <b>4</b> extend between the start spaces <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The advancement path <b>3</b> further includes a checkpoint space <b>5</b> for each of the base areas <b>2</b>. Each checkpoint space <b>5</b> may be designated by a star, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Preferably, the checkpoint spaces <b>5</b> for the respective base areas <b>2</b> are separated from the start spaces <b>8</b> of the respective base areas <b>2</b> by the same number of advancement spaces <b>4</b>. For example, the checkpoint space <b>5</b><i>a </i>for the base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a </i>is separated from the start space <b>8</b><i>a </i>for the base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a </i>by six adjacent advancement spaces <b>4</b>. The same applies to the number of advancement spaces <b>4</b> between the checkpoint spaces <b>5</b> and the respective start spaces <b>8</b> for the remaining base areas <b>2</b>. A destination <b>6</b>, which may be designated “Shawkenaw” ((shock-and-awe) palace, or the like, is provided in substantially the center of the game board <b>1</b> and is surrounded by the advancement path <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In implementation of the card game, as will be hereinafter further described, multiple game pieces <b>7</b> are initially placed on each base area <b>2</b> and then incrementally and sequentially advanced around the advancement path <b>2</b> to the destination <b>6</b>. The game pieces <b>7</b> may include a selected number, typically six, game pieces <b>7</b><i>a </i>for the base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a</i>; multiple game pieces <b>7</b><i>b </i>for the base camp Bravo; multiple game pieces <b>7</b><i>c </i>for the base camp Charlie <b>2</b><i>c</i>; multiple game pieces <b>7</b><i>d </i>for the base camp Delta <b>2</b><i>d</i>; multiple game pieces <b>7</b><i>e </i>for the base camp Echo <b>2</b><i>e</i>; and multiple game pieces <b>7</b><i>f </i>for the base camp Foxtrot <b>2</b><i>f</i>. Preferably, the game pieces <b>7</b> for each base area <b>2</b> have a color which differs from that of the game pieces <b>7</b> for the other base areas <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, each of multiple playing cards <b>10</b> is used in implementation of the card game. The playing cards <b>10</b> may be a standard 52-card deck of playing cards with additional wild cards added. Preferably, however, the playing cards <b>10</b> are a 52-card deck of customized player cards having the same images as those displayed on Iraqi Most Wanted playing cards with eight additional wild cards with images for a total of a customized sixty playing card deck. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the customized playing cards <b>10</b> generally includes a front face <b>16</b> on which is provided a suit and number identification section <b>11</b>, typically at opposite corners of the playing card <b>10</b>, which identifies the suit and number of the playing card <b>10</b>. An image section <b>12</b> is provided in the approximate center of the front face <b>16</b> and includes a photograph or caricature pertaining to the theme of the game. For example, the most wanted officials in Saddam Hussein's regime can be used. Accordingly, the officials who were the fifty-two most wanted Iraqi officials in Saddam Hussein's regime at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom are displayed on fifty-two customized playing cards <b>10</b>, respectively. A number of moves section <b>15</b> may be provided on the front face <b>16</b> of each playing card <b>10</b>. A number which corresponds to the number of advancement spaces <b>4</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b> that the playing card <b>10</b> entitles a player to take is provided on the number of moves section <b>15</b>. That number may or may not correspond to the number displayed in the suit and number identification section <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One example of a player card <b>10</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and includes at least one section <b>20</b><i>a </i>which entitles a player to either move one advancement space <b>4</b> forward on the advancement path <b>3</b> or move another one of his or her game pieces <b>7</b> from the base area <b>2</b> to the start space <b>8</b> of his or her base area <b>2</b>. The player card <b>10</b><i>a </i>may further include one or a pair of suit identification sections <b>22</b>. A caricature or other image <b>12</b><i>a </i>is provided in the image section <b>12</b> of the player card <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A second example of a player card <b>10</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. One or a pair of suit identification sections <b>22</b> is provided on the player card <b>10</b><i>b</i>. A caricature or other image <b>12</b><i>b </i>is provided on the image section <b>12</b> of the player card <b>10</b><i>b</i>. One or a pair of number of moves sections <b>20</b><i>b </i>is further provided on the player card <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, according to the card game of the present invention, the deck of playing cards <b>10</b> preferably further includes multiple wild cards <b>18</b>, a general format of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Preferably, the card game uses eight wild cards <b>18</b> for a total of sixty customized playing cards. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each wild card <b>18</b> may include an image section <b>19</b> on which is displayed an image or caricature of a humorous or other figure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One example of a wild card <b>18</b><i>a </i>suitable for the card game is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The wild card <b>18</b><i>a </i>includes a caricature <b>19</b><i>a</i>, as well as one or a pair of number of moves sections <b>20</b>. For example, one or a pair of number of moves sections <b>20</b> may be provided adjacent to the upper, lower or both upper and lower edges of the wild card <b>18</b><i>a</i>. The number of moves section <b>20</b> indicates the number of advancement spaces <b>4</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b> that the wild card <b>18</b><i>a </i>entitles a player to take when he or she plays the wild card <b>18</b><i>a </i>during the card game. A caricature or other image <b>19</b><i>a </i>is provided in the image section <b>19</b> of the wild card <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A second example of a wild card <b>18</b><i>b </i>which is suitable for the card game is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and includes one or a pair of color stripes <b>21</b> typically provided along one or both edges of the wild card <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The color stripe or stripes <b>21</b> on each wild card <b>18</b><i>b </i>corresponds in color to the color of one of the game pieces <b>7</b>. A caricature or other image <b>19</b><i>b </i>is provided in the image section <b>19</b> of the wild card <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In typical implementation of the card game, six players sit around the game board <b>1</b>, with three players on each side. Each of the players chooses a base area <b>2</b>. Multiple game pieces <b>7</b> are initially placed on each base area <b>2</b> on the game board <b>1</b>, as indicated in step S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Typically, six of the game pieces <b>7</b> are placed on each base area <b>2</b>, although fewer of the game pieces <b>7</b> can be placed on each base area <b>2</b> depending on time constraints, for example. As indicated in step S<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each player then places one game piece <b>7</b> on the start space <b>8</b> of his or her base area <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A “supply sergeant” or dealer is selected from among the multiple players. The dealer may be selected by, for example, the drawing of playing cards <b>10</b> from the card deck, in which case the player who draws the highest card becomes the dealer. As indicated in step S<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the dealer deals a set of multiple, typically five, playing cards <b>10</b> in the face-down position to each of the multiple players. In the case of five players, the dealer typically deals a set of six playing cards <b>10</b> to each player.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As indicated in step S<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one of the players selects a card from his or her set of dealt cards. In typical play, the player to the left of the dealer is the player who first selects a card from his or her set of dealt cards. The player then lays his or her card in full view of the other players and advances his or her game piece <b>7</b> the number of advancement spaces <b>4</b> which corresponds to the numerical value of the selected playing card <b>10</b> and the number indicated in the number of moves section <b>15</b>, as indicated in step S<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, in the event that the player's base area <b>2</b> is base camp Alpha <b>2</b><i>a </i>and that player draws a playing card <b>10</b>, the number of moves section <b>15</b> of which entitles the player to move his or her game piece <b>7</b><i>a </i>seven advancement spaces <b>4</b> forward, then the player advances his or her game piece <b>7</b><i>a </i>from the start space <b>8</b><i>a </i>to the seventh advancement space <b>4</b> in the direction of the arrow, as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In typical play, each king playing card <b>10</b> selected from the set of dealt playing cards <b>10</b> entitles a player to move another one of his or her game pieces <b>7</b> from his or her base area <b>2</b> to his or her start space <b>8</b>; each queen playing card <b>10</b> entitles the player to advance his or her game piece <b>7</b> twelve advancement spaces <b>4</b> forward on the advancement path <b>3</b>; and each ace playing card <b>10</b> entitles the player to advance his or her game piece <b>7</b> either one advancement space <b>4</b> forward or another of his or her game pieces <b>7</b> from the base area <b>2</b> to the start space <b>8</b>. Each jack playing card <b>10</b> entitles the player to trade places of his or her game piece <b>7</b> with any other player's game piece <b>7</b> at any location on the advancement path <b>3</b>. Each wild card <b>18</b> entitles the player to move his or her game piece <b>7</b> three advancement spaces <b>4</b> backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each player takes turns drawing a playing card <b>10</b> from the set of playing cards <b>10</b> dealt to them and advances his or her game piece <b>7</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b> in the manner which was heretofore described with respect to steps S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As a player advances his or her game piece <b>7</b> to or beyond the last checkpoint space <b>5</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b> from his or her base area <b>2</b>, that player must use a playing card <b>10</b> having a value of seven or less to advance his or her game piece <b>7</b> to the destination <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the player then places his or her game piece <b>7</b> on the destination <b>6</b>, as indicated in step S<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A player must have a King, Ace, or a wild card <b>18</b> with a color stripe Y having the same color as the player's playing piece <b>7</b> to transfer another of his or her game pieces <b>7</b> from the base area <b>2</b> to the start space <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the event that a second player's game piece <b>7</b> lands on a first player's game piece <b>7</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b>, the second player can “capture” the game piece <b>7</b> of the first player as a “spy” by replacing the first player's game piece <b>7</b> with the second player's game piece <b>7</b> on the advancement space <b>4</b>. In the event that a player's game piece <b>7</b> lands on a checkpoint space <b>5</b>, the player may, on his or her next turn, play any playing card <b>10</b> having a value of ace through <b>5</b> to move the game piece <b>7</b> to another checkpoint space <b>5</b>. The player can skip the game piece <b>7</b> of any other player to reach the next checkpoint space <b>5</b> on the advancement path <b>3</b>. Alternatively, at his or her discretion, the player can play a wild card <b>18</b> to move the game piece <b>7</b> backwards three checkpoint spaces <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the event that one of the players is dealt a wild card <b>18</b><i>b </i>the color stripe <b>21</b> of which is the same as that of the player's game pieces <b>7</b>, the player may be given three options: move another of the player's game pieces <b>7</b> from his or her base area <b>2</b> to his or her start space <b>8</b>; send one game piece <b>7</b> of each of the other player's game pieces which have arrived at the destination <b>6</b>, from the destination <b>6</b> back to those players' base areas <b>2</b>; or move his or her game piece <b>7</b> back three advancement spaces <b>4</b>. Any player can play a wild card <b>18</b> which entitles him or her to advance his or her game piece <b>7</b> the number of advancement spaces <b>4</b> which is indicated on the number of moves section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After all players have used all five of their playing cards <b>10</b>, the players may pass the playing cards <b>10</b> to a discard pile (not illustrated). At that point, the dealer can either deal an additional round (typically five additional playing cards <b>10</b> to each player). The dealer may deal multiple rounds until all of the playing cards <b>10</b> have been dealt to the players. The dealer then passes the deck to the next player typically on his or her left, for example. Alternatively, after having dealt one or more rounds of the playing cards <b>10</b>, the dealer can pass all playing cards <b>10</b> in the card deck to the player on his or her left, for example, in which case that player will become the “supply sergeant” or dealer. The first player to advance all of his or her game pieces <b>7</b> from his or her base area <b>2</b> to the destination <b>6</b> wins the game.</p>
