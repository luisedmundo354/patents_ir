<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C §119(a) on Patent Application No. 2005-163297 filed in Japan on Jun. 2, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electric power steering apparatus using a brushless DC motor for steering assistance. More specifically, the present invention relates to the electric power steering apparatus which comprises an angle detector (angle sensor) for outputting a sine wave signal and a cosine wave signal which correspond to a rotor position of a brushless DC motor and a torque detector for detecting a steering torque applied to a steering member, and drives the brushless DC motor, based upon the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal which were outputted from the angle detector and the steering torque detected by the torque detector, to assist steering. Further, the present invention relates to a method for detecting abnormality of an angle detector for use in such electric power steering apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electric power steering apparatus, which drives an electric motor for assisting steering so as to alleviate the load of a driver, typically comprises: an input shaft connected to a steering member (steering wheel); an output shaft connected to steering control wheels through a pinion, rack and the like; and a connecting shaft for connecting the input shaft and the output shaft. A steering torque value to be applied to the input shaft is detected by a torque sensor based upon an angle of distortion generated in the connecting shaft, and the electric motor for steering assistance, which is coupled with the output shaft, is driven and controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, a brushless DC motor has been in use in such an electric power steering apparatus as described above. In the brushless DC motor of the electric power steering apparatus, a current flowing through a stator is PWM (pulse width modulation) controlled such that a rotary magnetic field generates according to a rotating position of a rotor. For detecting the rotor position, an angle sensor (angle detector) such as a resolver or an MR sensor for outputting a sine wave signal and a cosine wave signal is used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Incidentally, when the angle sensor (angle detector) used for detecting the rotor position is broken down and thereby an accurate data of the rotating position cannot be obtained, it is not possible to allow an appropriate current according to the rotor position to flow through the brushless DC motor. In such case, therefore, a steering wheel (steering member) might vibrate or be locked in the electric power steering apparatus using the brushless DC motor. In such circumstances, the following inventions have been proposed with the aim of detecting abnormality in the brushless DC motor, more specifically, in the angle sensor (angle detector).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-81961 discloses an invention in which an analog signal of a magnetic detection element is converted to a digital signal, and according to a difference value between the digital signal and a resolver signal, abnormality in an angle sensor is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-278826 (1998) discloses an invention in which a steering angle given from an angle sensor at a predetermined cycle is stored, a derivation value of the steering angle is calculated, an absolute value of a difference from a previous derivation value is obtained, and the obtained absolute value is compared with a threshold, to detect abnormality.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-258757 (1998) discloses an invention in which a difference between two optional outputs among outputs of three respective steering angle sensors is obtained and it is determined that an abnormal sensor is included in a combination of the two sensors whose output difference is a value apart from zero.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-197238 (1998) discloses an invention in which a predetermined number of samplings of a steering angle having been detected by a steering angle sensor are performed within a predetermined period of time to calculate an average and a derivation, and when the average or the derivation falls out of a predetermined range, the sensor is determined as abnormal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, there has been a problem in that abnormality in a detector cannot be detected at an early stage in the case of the above-mentioned prior arts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention was made in view of the foregoing circumstances. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an electric power steering apparatus, when a brushless DC motor as an electric motor for steering assistance is used, capable of detecting abnormality in a detector (angle detector) for detecting a rotor position of the brushless DC motor at an early stage, and to provide a method for detecting abnormality of an angle detector.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A first aspect of the electric power steering apparatus according to the present invention is an electric power steering apparatus which comprises: an angle detector for outputting a sine wave signal and a cosine wave signal corresponding to a rotor position of a brushless DC motor for assisting steering; a torque detector for detecting a steering torque applied to a steering member; and an abnormality detecting unit for detecting occurrence of abnormality in the angle detector; and which drives the brushless DC motor to assist steering based upon the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal outputted from the angle detector and the steering torque detected by the torque detector, and is characterized in that the abnormality detecting unit includes: sine wave signal squaring means for squaring the sine wave signal detected by the angle detector; cosine wave signal squaring means for squaring the cosine wave signal detected by the angle detector; adding means for adding the sine wave signal squared by the sine wave signal squaring means to the cosine wave signal squared by the cosine wave signal squaring means; judging means for judging whether or not the addition result by the adding means falls within a predetermined range; and abnormality detecting means for detecting occurrence of abnormality in the angle detector when the judging means judges that the addition result does not fall within the predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, a first aspect of a method according to the present invention is a method for detecting abnormality of an angle detector of an electric power steering apparatus, and the electric power steering apparatus comprises: an angle detector for outputting a sine wave signal and a cosine wave signal corresponding to a rotor position of a brushless DC motor for assisting steering; a torque detector for detecting a steering torque applied to a steering member; and an abnormality detecting unit for detecting occurrence of abnormality in the angle detector; and drives the brushless DC motor to assist steering based upon the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal outputted from the angle detector and the steering torque detected by the torque detector, and is characterized by comprising the steps of making the abnormality detecting unit square the sine wave signal outputted by the angle detector; making the abnormality detecting unit square the cosine wave signal outputted by the angle detector; making the abnormality detecting unit add the squared sine wave signal to the squared cosine wave signal; making the abnormality detecting unit judge whether or not the addition result falls within a predetermined range; and making the abnormality detecting unit determine that abnormality occurs in the angle detector when the addition result does not fall within the predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A second aspect of the electric power steering apparatus according to the present invention is based on the first aspect of the same, and is characterized in that the upper limit of the predetermined range is determined based upon respective error ranges of the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, a second aspect of the method according to the present invention is based on the first aspect of the same, and is characterized in that the upper limit of the predetermined range is determined based upon respective error ranges of the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A third aspect of the electric power steering apparatus according to the present invention is base on the first or second aspect, and is characterized by further comprising: sine wave offset correcting means for correcting an offset of the sine wave signal detected by the angle detector with respect to a neutral point; cosine wave offset correcting means for correcting an offset of the cosine wave signal detected by the angle detector with respect to a neutral point; sine wave amplitude correcting means for correcting an amplitude value of the sine wave signal detected by the angle detector; and cosine wave amplitude correcting means for correcting an amplitude value of the cosine wave signal detected by the angle detector; wherein a lower limit of the predetermined range is determined based upon the minimum value out of addition results obtained by the adding means within a range where the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal are correctable by both of the offset correcting means and both of the amplitude correcting means.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, a third aspect of the method according to the present invention is based on the first or second aspect of the same, and is characterized in that the power steering apparatus further comprising a rotor position detecting unit for detecting a rotor position of the brushless DC motor based on the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal outputted by the angle detector, and the method further comprising the steps of making the rotor position detecting unit correct an offset of the sine wave signal outputted by the angle detector with respect to a neutral point; making the rotor position detecting unit correct an offset of the cosine wave signal outputted by the angle detector with respect to a neutral point; making the rotor position detecting unit correct an amplitude value of the sine wave signal; and making the rotor position detecting unit correct an amplitude value of the cosine wave signal; wherein a lower limit of the predetermined range is determined based upon the minimum value out of addition results obtained by the adding step within a range where the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal are correctable by both of the offset correcting step and both of the amplitude correcting step.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the electric power steering apparatus and the method for detecting abnormality of the angle detector thereof according to the present invention as thus described, a sine wave signal and a cosine wave signal outputted from an angle detector according to the rotor position of the brushless DC motor are squared respectively. The squared sine wave signal is added to the squared cosine wave signal, and when the addition result does not fall within a predetermined range, occurrence of abnormality in the angle detector is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, the electric power steering apparatus is realized which is capable of detecting, at an early stage, abnormality in the detector (angle detector) of the rotor position of the brushless DC motor for steering assistance in the case of occurrence of the abnormality.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are flowcharts showing procedures in which the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> calculates an amplifier correction value and an offset correction value of each of the sine wave signal and the cosine wave signal outputted from the resolver <b>25</b> (angle detector) in the electric power steering apparatus according to the present invention as described above. For example, in turning-on of an ignition key, at every passage of predetermined time during driving of the vehicle, or the like, each correction value is calculated by the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> after initialization (zero-clearance) of parameters. It should be noted that the following procedure is realized specifically as a procedure for the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> performed by execution of a computer program by the microcomputer <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Basically, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> always reads a sine wave signal sin θre outputted from the resolver <b>25</b> (S<b>2</b>). The rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> perform a process for detecting the maximal value of the sine wave signal sin θre by, for example, detecting a value indicating turning of the sine wave signal sin θre from an increase to a decrease (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the maximal value of the sine wave signal sin θre is detected (YES in S<b>6</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> stores the detected maximal value (S<b>8</b>), and increments a parameter T<b>1</b> by one (S<b>10</b>). It is to be noted that the parameter T<b>1</b> is initially cleared to zero as described above. Further, the value of the parameter T<b>1</b> represents the number of detections of the maximal value of the sine wave signal sin θre.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> perform a process for detecting the minimal value of the sine wave signal sin θre by detecting, for example, a value indicating turning of the sine wave signal sin θre from the decrease to the increase (S<b>12</b>). When the minimal value of the sine wave signal sin θre is detected (YES in S<b>14</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> stores the detected minimal value (S<b>16</b>), and increments a parameter T<b>2</b> by one (S<b>18</b>). It is to be noted that a parameter T<b>2</b> is also initially cleared to zero as described above. Further, the value of the parameter T<b>2</b> represents the number of detection of the minimal value of the sine wave signal sin θre.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, when the maximum value of the sine wave signal sin θre is not detected (NO in S<b>6</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> directly shifts the procedure to a process for detecting the minimal value of the sine wave signal sin θre in Step S<b>12</b>. Further, when the minimal value is not detected (NO in S<b>14</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> returns the procedure as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> increments the parameter T<b>2</b> by one (S<b>18</b>), and thereafter judges whether or not the parameters T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are both not less than n (n is a positive integer number) (S<b>20</b>). When the result of this judgment is negative, (NO in S<b>20</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> returns the procedure as it is. Therefore, since the judgment result in Step S<b>20</b> is “NO” when the minimal value of the sine wave signal sin θre is detected while the maximal value of the same is not detected, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> returns the procedure as it is also in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When both of the parameters T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are judged to be not less than n (YES in S<b>20</b>), the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> divides the maximal value and the minimal value stored in Steps S<b>8</b> and S<b>16</b> by the parameters T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>, respectively, to calculates average values (S<b>22</b>). Thereafter, the parameters T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are initialized (cleared to zero) (S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, using the averaged maximal value and the averaged minimal value calculated in Step S<b>22</b>, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> performs a calculation of “Offset correction value=0−(Averaged maximal value+Averaged minimal value)/2” (S<b>26</b>), and stores the “offset correction value” as the calculation result (S<b>28</b>). It is to be noted that offset correction as described above is carried out with respect to a neutral point. Subsequently, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> performs a calculation of “Amplitude correction value=2/(Averaged maximal value−Averaged minimal value)” (S<b>30</b>), and stores the “amplitude correction value” as the calculation result (S<b>32</b>). Thereafter, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> returns the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After storing the offset correction value in Step S<b>28</b> and storing the amplitude correction value in Step S<b>32</b>, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> corrects the read sine wave signal sin θre by means of the stored offset correction value and amplitude correction value until those stored values are updated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> performs offset correction by adding the offset correction value to the read sine wave signal sin θre, and performs amplitude correction by multiplying the sine wave signal sin θre subjected to the offset correction by the amplitude correction value.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is to be noted that, although the foregoing description is given to the procedure regarding the sine wave signal sin θre performed by the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b>, a similar procedure is performed by the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> as for a cosine wave signal cos θre. Namely, the rotor position detecting unit <b>62</b> simultaneously performs operations for correcting both of the sine wave signal sin θre and the cosine wave signal cos θre.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing the procedure performed by the microcomputer <b>21</b> of the ECU <b>5</b>, a description is given to a detecting operation in a case where abnormality (breakdown) has occurred in the resolver <b>25</b> (angle detector) as the angle detector of the electric power steering apparatus according to the present invention. It should be noted that the following procedure is realized specifically as a procedure for the abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> performed by execution of a computer program by the microcomputer <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> basically always reads a sine wave signal sin θre and a cosine wave signal cos θre outputted from the resolver <b>25</b> (S<b>40</b>), and always performs a calculation of “sin<sup>2</sup>θre+cos<sup>2</sup>θre” (S<b>42</b>). The abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> then judges whether or not the calculation result of “sin<sup>2</sup>θre+cos<sup>2</sup>θre” falls within a predetermined range of m to M (S<b>44</b>). When the judgment result in Step S<b>44</b> falls within the range of m to M (YES in S<b>44</b>), the abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> returns the procedure as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">On the other hand, when the judgment result in Step S<b>44</b> does not fall within the predetermined range of m to M (NO in S<b>44</b>), the abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> determines that abnormality has occurred in the angle detector (resolver <b>25</b>), and outputs an angle detector abnormality signal which indicates occurrence of abnormality in the resolver (angle detector) <b>25</b> (S<b>46</b>). Thereafter, the abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> returns the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the abnormality detecting unit <b>63</b> outputs the angle detector abnormality signal, the ECU <b>5</b>, for example, inhibits drive control of the motor <b>6</b> by the motor drive circuit <b>52</b>, to bring the motor <b>6</b> into the state of being freely rotatable in concert with rotation of the steering wheel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Here, a normal range of the foregoing predetermined range of m to M is determined shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> with an error and a tolerance taken into consideration with respect to the theoretic value, based upon a size of a vector whose components are (sin θre, cos θre) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although sin θre and cos θre should, in theory, fall within the range of −1 to +1, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the upper limit value M of the predetermined range of m to M is determined based on an out-of-range failed threshold ±√{square root over (M)} as the maximum value of the error range of the resolver <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the lower limit value m of the predetermined range of m to M is determined as the minimum value among values which can be taken by “sin<sup>2</sup>θre+cos<sup>2</sup>θre” in the range correctable by the foregoing respective amplitude correction and offset correction of sin θre and cos θre as the output of the resolver <b>25</b>. For example, when the minimum amplitude value is correctable, the minimum value m is determined assuming the case of offsetting by a value corresponding to the maximum value within the offset correctable range. It should be noted that sin θre and cos θre here are values before the amplitude correction and the offset correction are made.</p>
