<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a coupling system, including a coupling device and an engagement device for mating attachment of a seating device to a securing or lifting device to allow the seating device to be secured and/or lifted relative to transportation and/or architectural movement needs. More particularly, the present invention relates to a coupling device fixedly secured to, or integrally embodied in, the frame of a wheelchair or other seating device to allow the wheelchair or seating device, while occupied, to be secured in position and/or lifted or lowered in elevation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been a consistent challenge for wheelchair users, mobility device users, and those that assist them, to secure their wheelchairs and/or mobility devices in a stable position in a moving vehicle, while the user is seated therein. Current known systems utilize a strap or latch system that secures the wheel, axle, and/or frame of the wheelchair within a vehicle through the use of strap and tie down methods. While these systems and methods are universal in their ability to accommodate a wide range of differing wheelchair designs, they are typically cumbersome and time consuming for users and their assistance personnel. Moreover, these systems typically cannot be performed alone by a person confined to or otherwise seated within a wheelchair or mobility device and therefore require the assistance of another person. This is because a person seated in the wheelchair or mobility device typically cannot reach the strap and tie down systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems that clamp the wheels of a wheelchair for securing thereof have been developed. These systems are designed to engage the wheels automatically or upon activation. However, restraint of a wheelchair by the wheels does not provide a satisfactorily rigid connection of the wheelchair seat or seating device to a transportation vehicle, particularly in the event of rough terrain or an accident. Further, these wheel clamp systems also take up considerable space within the transportation vehicle. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a universal system for coupling and effectuating elevation changes of a seating device and/or wheelchair that includes a simple rigid connection for securing the wheelchair and/or seating device in a stationary position. In the case of a public transportation bus, for instance, it is known that present developments for wheelchair clamping devices addressing the deficiencies of tie down systems take up a significant amount of space, thereby decreasing the effective area, where the predominant use is not related to those of disability or limited mobility. It would be desirable to provide a system that also overcomes this disadvantage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, it is also a known challenge for wheelchair users, mobility device users, and those that assist them, to lift their wheelchair and/or other mobility device from the ground up into a vehicle or other mode of transportation, or to negotiate level changes within an architectural structure, such as a building. As is known, a large amount of effort and/or mechanical assistance is required to assist or lift a person from ground level to a driving or riding position in a vehicle. This is true for a person that has some physical impairment that limits their ability to climb into a vehicle, such as for example, a person with a walker or a cane. This is equally true for those that are not physically able to climb into a vehicle, including those that require a wheelchair. Moreover, significant effort and/or mechanical assistance is also required to lift or lower a person of physical disability from one elevation to another within any architectural building.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most current systems that provide assistance in elevating a person in a wheelchair or seating device to a driving or riding position, such as is required for entry into a vehicle, require that the wheelchair or seating device be positioned on a platform or similar structure, which is then lifted with the person seated thereon, to raise them to the level of the vehicle. These platform type systems typically require a large amount of space and are therefore costly and disadvantageous. Further, after the wheelchair or seating device has been lifted, the wheelchair or seating device must further be moved into position and then secured within the vehicle. This typically requires that the wheelchair or seating device be latched in position through tying down of the wheel or the axle, as discussed above. Only after the wheelchair or seating device has been secured, can the vehicle be operated safely for the occupant of the wheelchair or seating device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Several current lifting systems are available that can transfer a person from a position on ground into a vehicle. These lifting systems include a lifting seat that is an integral part of the lifting system. These systems thus require the physical transfer of the person from their wheelchair or seating device into the lifting chair. On ce the person is located in the lifting seat, the seat is lifted and rotated by the lifting system to a secure position within the transportation mode. These systems also require the step of storing the now unused wheelchair or seating device in the vehicle by an aiding attendant before vehicle operation, such that they can be used again by the person when unloaded from the lifting seat. This is thus not a system that can readily be used independently by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would therefore be advantageous to provide a coupling system that would place a lifting system in communication with a wheelchair and enable both the lifting and securing steps of the wheelchair to easily allow persons that require the use of a wheelchair to enter and exit the vehicle as compared to current systems. In the case of an able, or limited mobility person, it would also be advantageous to provide a coupling system for use with a seating element instead of a wheelchair that secures and lifts the seating element. At present, there are no known systems that can accommodate different seating configurations and thus allow for adaptation to a person's changing mobility capabilities or to the abilities of another user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There presently exists no universal rapidly deployable rigid system for use in securing and/or effectuating elevation changes of seating devices or wheelchairs. It would therefore be desirable to provide a universal wheelchair coupling device that can be utilized with different attachment devices and lifting structures employed by different vehicles and/or architectural applications. Current universal lift platform devices for rapidly deploying and lifting wheelchairs and/or other seating devices require significant space and are not efficient for use in vehicles, boats, bus, and architectural settings where the predominant use is not related to those of disability or limited mobility. It would thus be desirable to provide a coupling device that allows for universal attachment to more compact systems capable of use with a wider variety of vehicles and also requiring less devoted space.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that allows a wheelchair and/or other mobility seating device to be readily lifted by a mechanical apparatus into a vehicle and retained in a secure position within the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide a universal coupling system that allows a wheelchair and/or other seating device to be secured and lifted by a mechanical apparatus such that it remains secured during the lifting operation with respect to a variety of different modes of transportation, including automobiles, buses, boats, stairs, personal mobility vehicles, and other similar devices and structures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a universal coupling system that is intended to communicate with a lift mechanism such that its configuration takes up significantly less space than prior lift mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a still another object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that includes a securing feature that allows a wheelchair to be lifted from ground into a vehicle and secured within the vehicle without the need to secure the wheel of the wheelchair or the frame secondarily.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that can be utilized with various seating modules, devices and personal platforms, including wheelchairs and power wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a related object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that allows for relatively efficient attachment of a wheelchair or other seating device to a lift mechanism as compared to prior attachment mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that readily facilitates unattachment of the mating engagement device incorporated in the coupling system as the wheelchair or seating device is in the final stage of lowering such that the seating device or wheelchair can readily move away from the system or vehicle when lowered to exit height. In the case of unattachment of a seating module, the removal of the seat module is effected easily for removal thereof and ready accommodation of another seating module, device, or personal platform, including wheelchairs and power wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupling system having an electrical signal coupling component that allows the wheelchair user's controls to mate to the lift mechanism and the vehicle controls for subsequent control of the lift mechanism and the vehicle with the user's wheelchair controls.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with that above and the other objects of the present invention, a universal coupling system is provided. The universal coupling system includes a coupling device that is intended to be secured to or formed integrally with the frame of a chair device, such as a comfort chair unit or a wheelchair. The coupling device includes at least one attachment structure formed thereon for mating with a corresponding engagement device formed on an associated lift mechanism or a location securing device utilizing the coupling system's universal attachment standards. In the case of utilization with a lifting mechanism, the coupling device is intended to mate the structure on the chair device with the corresponding engagement device on the lift mechanism and locationally secure the chair device in space for lifting. Thereafter, the chair device is raised to an elevated position while the chair device is occupied. The coupling system is configured such that complete stability of the chair device relative to the lift mechanism is maintained during the lifting operation. The coupling device preferably includes one or more aligning devices to facilitate tolerance of the coupling process or chair device misalignment during the coupling process. It will be understood that the effective elements of the coupling device, the engagement device, and the aligning devices may be located either on the engagement device or the coupling device.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a preferred coupling device <b>10</b>, which is part of a coupling system <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention. The coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably secured to the chair frame of a wheelchair <b>12</b>. More preferably, the coupling device <b>10</b> is secured to the seat back <b>14</b> of the chair frame. It will be understood that the coupling device <b>10</b> may alternatively be secured to the seat bottom <b>18</b> of the chair frame. The coupling device <b>10</b> may be attached on a combination of the seat back <b>14</b> and the seat bottom <b>18</b> or a variety of other locations on the wheelchair <b>12</b> or combination thereof. However, the coupling device <b>10</b> is attached to the wheelchair <b>12</b> independently of the wheels. In other words, the coupling device <b>10</b> is secured to the wheelchair <b>12</b>, such that it effects a rigid connection and does not interfere with any normal function of the wheelchair <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably attached to the chair frame by welding. However, the coupling device <b>10</b> may alternatively be attached to the wheelchair <b>12</b> by any known attachment or securing mechanism. While the coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably secured to the wheelchair <b>12</b>, it may alternatively be integrally formed with the wheelchair <b>12</b>, such as in the seat back structure <b>14</b> or the seat bottom structure <b>18</b> or a combination thereof. Moreover, while the coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably shown and described for use with a wheelchair <b>12</b>, it is intended, and will be understood that the coupling device <b>10</b> may be secured to, or integral with and utilized by a power wheelchair, a mobility device or other seating structure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably comprised of an upper plate <b>20</b>, which is secured to the seat back <b>14</b>, and a lower plate <b>22</b>, which is also preferably secured to the seat back <b>14</b>. The upper plate <b>20</b> and the lower plate <b>22</b> are preferably comprised of a metal material, however, it will be understood that the plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may instead be formed of a plastic material, such as through known injection or compression molding processes. Similarly, the plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and the chair may be formed in a single process. Alternatively, the plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may be formed from a variety of other suitable materials. While the plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are illustrated as two separate pieces, it will be appreciated that they may be formed as a single plate or more than two. Further, while the plates <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are shown attached to the seat back <b>14</b>, it will be understood that they can be attached, either entirely or partially, to other portions of the wheelchair <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The upper plate <b>20</b> preferably has a plurality of through holes <b>24</b> which allow attachment to secure various seat back cushions to the seat back <b>14</b>. The upper plate <b>20</b> also preferably includes a hook latch <b>26</b> that is integrally formed with one or more load distributing structural elements or shapes <b>28</b> that provide support integrity to the hook latch <b>26</b>.

The upper plate <b>20</b> also preferably includes a channel <b>30</b> formed in either side of the upper plate <b>20</b> that allows the upper plate <b>20</b> to be welded to each of the arm handles <b>32</b> of the wheelchair <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lower plate <b>22</b> preferably also has a plurality of through holes <b>34</b>, which allow attachment to secure various seat back cushions to the seat back <b>14</b> of the wheelchair <b>12</b>. The lower plate <b>22</b> also includes at least one guide pin <b>36</b>, which protrudes generally outwardly therefrom, and a clamp bar <b>38</b>. The lower plate <b>22</b> also includes an electrical signal and/or power connector component <b>40</b>. The electrical power signal and/o r power connector component <b>40</b> is in communication with the various controls that are present on the wheelchair, seating device or powerchair <b>12</b>, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the preferred coupling system <b>5</b>, which embodies the mating engagement of the coupling device <b>10</b> to an engagement device <b>50</b>. As shown, the engagement device <b>50</b> is preferably secured to an associated lift mechanism <b>52</b> and includes a latch <b>54</b>, which is intended to receive and lock the clamp bar <b>38</b> therein. The latch <b>54</b> secures the clamp bar <b>38</b> when in an engaged position to secure the wheelchair <b>12</b> to the lift mechanism <b>52</b>. The latch <b>54</b> thus locks the clamp bar <b>38</b> when the lift mechanism <b>52</b> is seated in a desired operating position within the vehicle <b>110</b>. The latch <b>54</b> is in communication with a device <b>55</b> that will release the clamp bar <b>38</b> when the lift mechanism <b>52</b> is being activated to allow movement of the attached chair in a path that is determined by the lift mechanism, such as for lowering to a ground engaging position for ready uncoupling of the chair <b>12</b>. It is understood that latch <b>54</b> could be located on the engagement device <b>50</b>, if engagement device <b>50</b> is provided with full mechanical restraint of motion to effectuate securing of the wheelchair <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The engagement device <b>50</b> also preferably includes an electrical signal and/or power receptor device <b>56</b>, which is intended to mate with the electrical signal and/or power connector component <b>40</b>, such that the controls used to operate the wheelchair <b>12</b> can be utilized by the user to operate the lift mechanism <b>52</b> and/or the vehicle into which the wheelchair <b>12</b> is being lifted. The engagement device <b>50</b> also includes a supporting rod <b>58</b>, that is intended to engage the hook latch <b>26</b>, and at least one channel <b>60</b> that is intended to receive a respective guide pin or pins <b>36</b> therein, as is discussed in more detail below. The connection of the wheelchair controls to the lift mechanism <b>52</b> can be accomplished in a variety of other ways, including mechanical, electrical, infrared, or other known communication methods.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the electrical signal power connector device <b>56</b> remains in the vehicle <b>110</b> and mates with the connector component <b>40</b> when the wheelchair <b>12</b> is located in the vehicle. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the electrical signal and/or power connector device <b>56</b>, which is shown as an infrared connector may also be located on the lift mechanism <b>52</b>. Thus, the electrical signal and/or power connector component <b>40</b> may thus be located on the lift mechanism <b>52</b> or may remain fixed within the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The mating of the coupling device <b>10</b> with the engagement device <b>50</b> allows the wheelchair <b>12</b> to be secured to the lift mechanism <b>52</b> and maintained in a secure position during the lifting process. The coupling system <b>5</b>, through the features of the coupling device <b>10</b> and the engagement device <b>50</b>, including the guide pin or pins <b>36</b> and the tapered path of the hook latch <b>26</b> provide centering capability. It will be understood that a variety of other similar configurations for accommodating coupling tolerance are possible for locating the coupling device <b>10</b> for proper engagement with the engagement device <b>50</b>. Moreover, while the coupling device <b>10</b> has been illustrated on the wheel chair <b>12</b>, it will be understood that the elements of the coupling device <b>10</b> may instead be located on the lift mechanism <b>52</b>. In that event, it will also be understood that the elements of the engagement device <b>50</b> will be located on the wheelchair <b>12</b> such that the functions of the coupling system <b>5</b> are maintained. Further, the specific configurations of the coupling device <b>10</b> and the engagement device <b>50</b> may obviously vary.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The coupling device <b>10</b> is preferably universal in that while it has been shown illustratively incorporated into a wheelchair, it may also be utilized with a variety of other seating devices, including power wheelchairs, assistive seating devices, future wheelchair developments and/or seating modules. As will be understood, the engagement device <b>50</b> preferably embodies a locking device that secures the coupling system <b>10</b> after the centering features of the system <b>5</b> have mated the coupling device <b>10</b> to the engagement device <b>50</b> or after the lift mechanism <b>52</b> is in the vehicle operation position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The configuration of the coupling device <b>10</b> allows it to be used in a variety of ways. For example, the engagement device <b>50</b> may be manipulated by the lift mechanism <b>52</b> toward engagement with the wheelchair <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the wheelchair <b>12</b> may be maneuvered into contact with the engagement device <b>50</b>. Moreover, the coupling device <b>10</b> can be used for a variety of purposes, including for securing the seating device within a moving vehicle, or for attachment to the lift mechanism <b>52</b> for lifting or moving the seating device, or for attachment to another lifting system, such as utilized in a hunter's tree stand device.</p>

The rear portion <b>124</b> is preferably in mechanical communication with the actuator <b>116</b>. As shown, the actuator <b>116</b> is preferably an electrical actuator. The actuator <b>116</b> preferably includes a pair of electric actuators <b>136</b>, however, it will be understood that the actuator <b>116</b> could be comprised of only a single actuator. As will be also understood, the actuator <b>116</b> may be driven by any other known actuation means, including hydraulic actuation, pneumatic actuation or any combination thereof. As will be understood, the vehicle <b>110</b> can have an enclosure module or other structure covering the interior, such that when in place, the movement of the lift arm is retarded. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, actuation of the lift arm would also preferably move this structure out of the way to provide an unobstructed path for the lift arm <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the pair of electric actuators <b>136</b> has a first end <b>138</b> that is preferably secured within the vehicle <b>110</b> and a second end <b>140</b> that is in communication with a respective lever arm <b>142</b>. An axle <b>144</b> is fixedly secured to each of the lever arms <b>142</b> at a respective end thereof. The axle <b>144</b> passes through a respective bushing <b>146</b>, located adjacent each of the lever arms <b>142</b> to provide support therefor. The axle <b>144</b> is fixedly secured to each of the opposing side portions <b>130</b> of the lift arm <b>114</b>. Each of the bushings <b>146</b> is secured to a mounting plate <b>148</b>, which is secured within the vehicle <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A pair of cam sprockets <b>152</b> are preferably secured to the mounting plate <b>148</b> and are also preferably located within the hollow interior portion <b>134</b>. Each of the cam sprockets <b>152</b> has a plurality of teeth <b>154</b>, which are intended to engage a respective chain <b>156</b> as the lift arm <b>114</b> travels forwardly and rearwardly through its range of motion. Each of the chains <b>156</b> has a rearward end <b>158</b> fixedly attached to one of the pair of cam sprockets <b>152</b> and a forward end <b>160</b>, which is attached to a respective lift sprocket <b>162</b>. Each of the lift sprockets <b>162</b> is preferably located within the hollow interior portion <b>134</b> and controls the relative motion between the main lift arm portion <b>126</b> and the face plate portion <b>128</b> of the lift mechanism <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the cam sprockets <b>152</b> is fixedly secured to the mounting plate <b>148</b> and is disposed at least partially around, but does not engage, the axle <b>144</b> which allows the axle <b>144</b> to rotate with respect to the cam sprockets <b>152</b>. The cam sprockets <b>152</b> govern the relative motion of the face plate portion <b>128</b> with respect to the main lift arm portion <b>126</b> during the operation of the lift arm mechanism <b>52</b>. While the coupling device <b>62</b> is mated to the engagement device <b>64</b>, the lift sprockets <b>162</b> and the coupled chains <b>156</b> govern the relative orientation of the face plate portion <b>128</b> to the main lift arm portion <b>126</b> and maintain the coupled device <b>62</b> and the corresponding chair device in a stable horizontal orientation during the elevation process. It will be understood that while a pair of sprockets and two chain mechanisms are preferably utilized for purposes of safety and redundancy, the same functions can be achieved by a single sprocket and chain mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which illustrates another embodiment of a lift mechanism <b>52</b> in accordance with the present invention. The configuration of the electric actuators <b>136</b>, the lever arms <b>142</b>, the bushings <b>146</b>, and the lift arm <b>114</b> are the same as discussed above, and are therefore not re-described. As shown, the lift mechanism <b>52</b> in this embodiment includes a pair of rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b>, which are rotatably secured to an assembly <b>172</b> which is rotatable with respect to the axle <b>144</b>. Each of the pair of rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b> has a plurality of teeth <b>174</b>, which are intended to engage a respective one of the chains <b>176</b>. Each of the chains <b>176</b> is attached at one end <b>178</b> to a respective one of the pair of rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b> and at the other end to a respective one of the lift sprockets <b>162</b>. The assembly <b>172</b> has a lever portion <b>182</b> fixedly secured to an outer surface thereof. The lever portion <b>182</b> is in communication with a sprocket actuator <b>184</b>. The assembly <b>172</b> is secured at either end to the rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b> and is disposed around the axle <b>144</b>, such that the axle <b>144</b> supports the independent pivoting of the assembly <b>172</b> thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The sprocket actuator <b>184</b> is preferably an electric actuator, which is secured to the mounting plate <b>148</b> or directly to the vehicle structure <b>110</b>. However, again it will be understood that the sprocket actuator <b>184</b> may be driven by any other known actuation means, including manual screw, hydraulic actuation, pneumatic actuation or any combination thereof. The sprocket actuator <b>184</b> pushes the lever portion <b>182</b>, which causes the assembly <b>172</b> to rotate with respect to the axle <b>144</b>. The movement of the assembly <b>172</b> causes the rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b> to rotate which pulls or releases the chain <b>176</b> and thereby turns the lift sprockets <b>162</b>. The rotation of the lift sprockets <b>162</b> allows the inclination of the face plate portion <b>128</b> to be changed with respect to the main lift arm portion <b>126</b>. In other words, the angle of the lift plate <b>118</b> is varied to effectuate tilting of the coupled seating device, as is discussed in more detail below. This allows the coupled seating device to recline for relaxation purposes and also allows the seating device to tilt forward to allow a person of limited mobility to enter or exit the seating device more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The face plate portion <b>128</b> preferably has a generally flat front surface <b>118</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the front surface <b>118</b> of the face plate portion <b>128</b> is part of the engagement device <b>64</b>, which also preferably includes the pair of channels <b>60</b> located on either side thereof. As discussed above, the pair of channels <b>60</b> are intended to engage the guide pin or pins <b>36</b> of the coupling device <b>10</b>. Additionally, the support rod <b>58</b> extends between the pair of lift sprockets <b>162</b>. The support rod <b>58</b> is preferably “v” shaped such that a downward bend <b>188</b> is formed therein to provide a structure for coupling with the hook latch <b>26</b> on the coupling system <b>10</b>. The support rod <b>58</b> is secured to the face plate portion <b>128</b> and to each of the lift sprockets <b>162</b>. The support rod <b>58</b> also pivotally engages a bearing block <b>190</b> on either end thereof to provide a rotation axis for the supporting rod <b>56</b> and face plate portion <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lift mechanism <b>52</b> also includes a control handle <b>192</b> which controls the actuation of the lift arm <b>114</b>. The control handle <b>192</b> has at least one button <b>194</b> thereon that is in electrical communication with the actuator <b>116</b> through the wires encased within the cord <b>196</b>. It will be understood that the control handle <b>192</b> may contain a variety of other buttons, including a tilt button to control actuation of the sprocket actuator <b>184</b> and thus the movement of the face plate portion <b>128</b> with respect to the main arm portion <b>126</b>. Thus, any number of buttons may be utilized. It will be understood that the control button <b>192</b> or control buttons may be located in a multitude of locations that are advantageous to the design configuration for easy use. It is understood that in the event that existing wheelchair controls are used in communication with lift mechanism <b>52</b> through an electrical signal and/or power connector component <b>40</b> and electrical signal and/or power receptor device <b>56</b>, that the control handle <b>192</b> need not be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 12</figref>, which illustrate the movement of the lift arm <b>114</b> between a fully retracted position and a fully extended position. The lift arm <b>114</b> and the associated lift mechanism <b>52</b> are illustrated as incorporated into a mobility vehicle <b>110</b>. However, as discussed in detail below, the lift arm <b>114</b> can be utilized for a variety of purposes and incorporated into a variety of different situations. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 12</figref>, the lift arm <b>114</b> is intended to lift an individual seated on a wheelchair <b>12</b> from a position on the ground to a position secured in the vehicle <b>110</b>. The engagement of the lift arm <b>114</b> with the wheelchair <b>12</b> is by mating of the engagement device <b>64</b> with the coupling device <b>10</b>, which is described in detail above. While the present invention is preferably intended for engagement with a wheelchair <b>12</b>, it will be understood that the lift mechanism <b>52</b> can also engage a power wheelchair, a seating module, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or a variety of other seating devices, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in the application here illustrated, the lift arm <b>114</b> extends from the interior <b>120</b> of the vehicle <b>110</b> forwardly through the open front <b>122</b> to engage the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device. In the fully extended position, the face plate portion <b>128</b> of the engagement device <b>64</b> mates with the coupling device <b>10</b> on the wheelchair <b>12</b>. In order to effectuate engagement, the operator of the wheelchair can back the wheelchair <b>12</b> rearwardly until the coupling device <b>10</b> engages the engagement device <b>64</b> and a mating engagement is achieved. Once the wheelchair <b>12</b> is contacting the face plate portion <b>128</b>, the operator can, through the use of the control handle <b>192</b>, activate the actuator <b>116</b> causing the electric actuators <b>136</b> to retract, which causes the lift arm <b>114</b> to move rearwardly, thereby causing engaging of the coupling components and lifting the wheelchair <b>12</b> and an occupant positioned therein. Obviously, the same engagement and lifting procedure would apply to other seating devices, including a power wheelchair and a seating module, as well as to other storage or devices to be lifted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown, the operator can stop the actuator <b>116</b> by releasing the appropriate button <b>194</b> on the control handle <b>192</b> to stop the movement of the wheelchair <b>12</b> at a variety of positions between the initial ground engaging position and the fully retracted position within the interior <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). For example, as shown, the operator can stop the actuator <b>116</b> to halt the movement of the lift arm <b>114</b> at an intermediary position generally designated by <b>114</b>′ such that the wheelchair is in the position designated by reference number <b>12</b>′. This allows an operator to utilize an elevated position while seated in the wheelchair <b>12</b> for a variety of reasons. For instance, the operator can raise himself to a forward eye level position with another person for talking and/or observing outdoor events. Additionally, the operator can change the angle of inclination of the wheelchair <b>112</b> by actuating the sprocket actuator <b>184</b>, as discussed above, in order to tilt the face plate portion <b>128</b> to recline the wheelchair <b>12</b> or seating module.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As the lift arm <b>114</b> raises the operator, the weight of the operator tensions the chains <b>176</b> that extend between the lift sprockets <b>162</b> and the rotating cam sprockets <b>170</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an idler <b>200</b> is used to hold each of the chains <b>176</b> within the confines of the bent arm configuration of the lift arm <b>114</b> to maintain orientation of the wheelchair <b>12</b> when raised back into the vehicle <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the lift arm <b>114</b> moves the wheelchair <b>12</b> to a position at rest within the interior <b>120</b> of the vehicle <b>110</b> designated by reference number <b>12</b>″. In this position, the lift arm is in the position designated by reference number <b>114</b>″. The final position of the lift arm <b>114</b> in the fully retracted position in the mobility vehicle <b>110</b> with the coupling system <b>5</b> attached thereto, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Once in the vehicle <b>110</b>, the coupling system <b>5</b> completes the securing of the wheelchair <b>12</b>, by means of engaging latch <b>54</b>. It is foreseen that other mechanical means, including telescoping boom arm, sliding lift rails and swing booms or any combination of such can be utilized in conjunction with the coupling system <b>5</b> to accomplish the lifting of the wheelchair <b>12</b> and its positioning within the vehicle <b>110</b> as well as to secure the wheelchair <b>12</b> in an operating position to drive the vehicle <b>110</b>, as are described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, which illustrate another embodiment of a lift mechanism <b>210</b> in accordance with the present invention. The lift mechanism <b>210</b> performs the same function as the lift mechanism <b>52</b>. The lift mechanism <b>210</b> is preferably a four bar linkage system including a pair of upper bars <b>212</b> and a pair of lower bars <b>214</b>. The pair of upper bars <b>212</b> are secured to the vehicle <b>110</b> at an inner end <b>216</b> and at an outer end <b>220</b> to a face plate <b>218</b>. The pair of lower bars <b>214</b> are secured to the vehicle <b>110</b> at an inner end <b>222</b> and at an outer end <b>224</b> to the face plate <b>218</b>. The face plate <b>218</b> has an engagement device <b>50</b> located thereon. The inner ends <b>216</b> of the upper bars <b>212</b> has an extended lever <b>227</b> which is in communication with an actuator <b>226</b>. As discussed above, the actuator <b>226</b> effectuates raising and lowering of the lift mechanism <b>210</b> as well as the attached wheelchair or other seating device. A rack and pinion like mechanism may also be utilized, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, which illustrates another embodiment of a lift mechanism <b>230</b> in accordance with the present invention. The lift mechanism <b>230</b> is preferably incorporated into an mobility vehicle <b>110</b>, but as will be understood can be incorporated into a variety of other transportation modes. The lift mechanism <b>230</b> includes a face plate <b>232</b> upon which an engagement device <b>64</b> is preferably disposed. The engagement device <b>64</b> is preferably intended to mate with a coupling device <b>62</b> attached to a wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device. The face plate <b>232</b> is slideably or telescopically disposed on a lift arm <b>234</b>, the actuation of which controls the lifting and covering of the face plate <b>232</b> and thus the attached seating device. The lift arm <b>234</b> is also in communication with a pair of rotary actuators <b>236</b> that are secured to the structure of the vehicle <b>110</b> and when actuated, provide further lifting, lowering and extended location of the face plate <b>232</b> and thus the attached seating device. In this embodiment, the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other device is backed into the open front <b>122</b> of the vehicle <b>110</b> and into engagement with the engagement device <b>64</b>. The wheelchair <b>12</b> or other device can then be lifted to a driving position within the vehicle through the use of the wheelchair controls or other controls, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Rotary actuators <b>236</b> can further be utilized for positioning the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device forwardly and elevated for requirements of the operator for reaching, transfer and visibility needs. The actuators <b>236</b>, as will be understood, control the lifting of the lift arm <b>234</b>. The lift arm <b>234</b> can be controlled to stop its motion anywhere between a ground engaging position and a fully elevated position. The face plate <b>232</b> is preferably rotatably secured to the lift arm <b>234</b>, such that as the lift arm <b>234</b> is raised, the face plate <b>232</b> and thus the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device tilt with respect to the lift arm <b>234</b> such that during lifting, the wheelchair or seating device bottom remains parallel to the ground. Moreover, the lift arm <b>234</b> also preferably utilizes its telescopically or slideably disposed movement. In other words, the lift arm <b>234</b> has an outer stationary portion <b>238</b> and an inner reciprocal portion <b>240</b>. Upon actuation, the inner reciprocal portion <b>240</b> slides outwardly with respect to the outer stationary portion <b>238</b> to allow the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device to be further extended from the vehicle <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, which illustrate another embodiment of a lift mechanism <b>242</b>. In this embodiment, the lift mechanism <b>242</b> is preferably for use in connection with public transportation, such as a bus <b>244</b>, to raise an occupied wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device from a ground engaging position to a position secured within the bus <b>244</b>. As shown, the lift mechanism <b>242</b> includes a lift arm <b>246</b>, which is secured to the bus <b>244</b>, such as to the bus floor <b>248</b>, at an inner end <b>250</b>. The lift arm <b>250</b> is pivotable about its inner end <b>250</b>, such that it can rotate about an axis <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The lift arm <b>246</b> has an outer end <b>254</b> which has a face plate <b>256</b> secured thereto. The face plate <b>256</b> preferably has an attachment device <b>64</b> secured thereto which is intended to engage a coupling device <b>62</b>, which is secured to the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device. The face plate <b>256</b> is rotatably secured to the outer end <b>254</b> of the lift arm <b>246</b>. Thus, as the lift arm <b>246</b> is lowered, the face plate <b>256</b> rotates about an axis <b>257</b>, such that the engagement device <b>64</b> is aligned to mate with the coupling device <b>62</b>. Moreover, the lift arm <b>246</b> may also have telescopic capabilities allowing the arm to extend outwardly as desired. The lift arm <b>246</b> is preferably driven by an electric rotary actuator device <b>258</b> which is in communication with an electric rotary actuator on the axis <b>257</b>, such that the face plate <b>256</b> rotatably maintains a horizontal orientation of the wheelchair <b>12</b> or seating device, while being translated into or out of said vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the lift mechanism <b>242</b> is operative to engage and secure an occupied wheelchair <b>12</b> that is on a curb or sidewalk <b>260</b> and lift them to a position within the bus <b>244</b>. The occupied wheelchair <b>12</b> is then secured within the bus <b>244</b> by means of either remaining attached to the lift system, or by uncoupling and moving to another securing position in the vehicle. No modification of the wheelchair <b>12</b> is required to effectuate lifting. The reverse operation will result in lowering the wheelchair <b>12</b> from the bus <b>244</b> to a ground engaging position. It will be understood that while the preferred lift arm is a rotary arm, the lifting operation could be accomplished by a telescoping lift arm, a four bar linkage lift arm, or a slideable translation arm. Each of these alternative configurations will be understood by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As will also be understood, prior to the rotation of the lift arm <b>246</b>, at least a side portion <b>262</b> of the bus <b>244</b> will swing open to allow a path for the lift arm <b>246</b> to travel and an opening through which the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device can enter and exit the vehicle. The opening of the side portion <b>262</b> can be controlled by the electric actuator <b>258</b> or can alternatively be controlled independently.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates another application for the preferred coupling system <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention. Because the preferred coupling system <b>5</b> is universal in nature and preferably becomes standard in dimension on all wheelchairs and power wheelchairs, it can be utilized for architectural applications, such as to negotiate elevation changes in a building, which is typically a challenge for the physically handicapped or for those that require assistance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the coupling system <b>5</b> is utilized with a lift mechanism <b>270</b> to negotiate a flight of stairs, generally indicated by reference number <b>272</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The lift mechanism <b>270</b> is mounted on a rail system <b>274</b>, which is secured to a wall or other structure. The lift mechanism <b>270</b> includes a face plate <b>276</b> which has an engagement device <b>64</b> secured thereon. The engagement device <b>64</b> is intended to mate with a coupling device <b>10</b> to secure an attached wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device. The face plate <b>276</b> is secured to a lift arm <b>278</b>, which is in slideable communication with and rides on the rail system <b>274</b>. Once the engagement device <b>64</b> is mated with the coupling device <b>10</b>, an actuator <b>280</b> causes the lift arm <b>278</b> to raise the wheelchair <b>12</b> to a height sufficient to engage the coupling system <b>5</b> and clear the stairs. The rail system <b>274</b> with motor drive <b>285</b> engaging tooth rack <b>286</b> then, based on the operator's manipulation of the lift mechanism's or of the wheelchair's controls in communication with the lift mechanism controls, moves the lift mechanism <b>270</b> and thus the wheelchair <b>12</b> up the rail system <b>274</b> to a landing <b>282</b> at the top of the stairs <b>272</b>. It is understood that other mechanisms of translation on the rail system <b>274</b> are possible such as manual assist, chain, cable, screw drive and actuator systems.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Once at the landing <b>282</b>, the lift arm <b>278</b> rotatably pivots about an axis <b>284</b>, such that it is directionally pointed forward. This rotation <b>284</b> can happen automatically once the lift mechanism <b>270</b> reaches the landing <b>280</b> or other suitable actuation point. Alternatively, the rotation can occur based on operator control. Once rotated, the operator can decouple from the lift arm <b>278</b> by lowering the actuator <b>280</b> and move away from the engagement device <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates another application for the preferred coupling system <b>5</b> in accordance with the present invention. The coupling system <b>5</b> can also be utilized to raise and lower a wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device from a ground engaging position to an elevated position for recreational and sport purposes. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates the coupling system <b>5</b> as used with a tree stand <b>300</b>, such as for hunting, which engages the ground at its bottom <b>302</b> and is secured to a tree <b>304</b> at another point by a securing mechanism <b>306</b>. The tree stand <b>300</b> has an elevating mechanism <b>308</b> associated therewith. The elevating mechanism <b>308</b> has a slideable plate <b>310</b> with the engagement device <b>64</b> secured thereto. The engagement device <b>64</b> is intended to mate with a coupling device <b>62</b> secured to a wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device. Once an operator is secured safely in the wheelchair <b>12</b> or other seating device and the wheelchair <b>12</b> is coupled to the lift mechanism <b>308</b>, the operator through the wheelchair controls or other controls can activate the lift mechanism through the elevating mechanism <b>308</b> to elevate themselves. The same applies for lowering. It is understood that the elevating mechanism <b>308</b> can utilize a variety of known methods such as a manual pulley or ratchet system, power screw system, cable and winch system, telescoping actuation, rack and pinion system as well as others. The coupling system <b>5</b> of the present invention thus has an almost unlimited number of uses.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a securing system <b>320</b> for use in connection with the preferred coupling system <b>5</b>. As shown, the securing system <b>320</b> is preferably attached to a pole <b>322</b> or other secure structure. The pole <b>322</b> is preferably secured to or already existing on a public transportation system, such as a bus, an elevated train, a non-elevated train, a subway or other mode of transportation. In one embodiment, a simplified version of the engagement device <b>64</b> is secured to the pole <b>322</b>, but can move slightly up and down. The wheelchair <b>12</b> has coupling device <b>62</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, secured thereto. The up movement of the securing system <b>320</b> would preferably engage the upper support bar <b>78</b> and the lower clamp bar <b>90</b> of coupling device <b>62</b>. The pole <b>322</b> also has a latch security and release device <b>324</b> mounted thereon for effecting engagement of the system and release of engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In operation, once an operator has backed the wheelchair <b>12</b> up to the pole <b>322</b> such that the coupling device <b>62</b> is aligned with the engagement device <b>64</b>, the operator pulls on the latch cord <b>326</b>. The latch cord <b>326</b> causes the engagement device <b>64</b> to move upward on the pole <b>322</b> and into engagement with the coupling device <b>62</b> to secure the wheelchair <b>12</b> thereto. Similarly, to unsecure the wheelchair <b>12</b>, the operator pulls and releases the latch cord <b>326</b> and the engagement device <b>64</b> moves downward to unhitch the wheelchair <b>12</b> thereby allowing the wheelchair <b>12</b> to wheel away. It is understood that other latching methods are possible with utilization of universal dimensional standards of the support bar <b>78</b> and the clamp bar <b>90</b> of the coupling device <b>62</b>. It is further understood that a typical car door latch system could be utilized in conjunction with only one of these bars for effective securing of wheelchair <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Advantages of the present system include the fact that the operator has the wheelchair <b>12</b> with him/her in the vehicle <b>110</b> or other device at all times and is seated therein without the need to transfer. Further, the wheelchair is also available for ready use upon deployment after reverse operation of the lift arm by lowering and unsecuring. Additionally, another advantage is that the seat is secure independent of the rigidity of the wheelchair wheels. Moreover, the system provides complete power entry and automatic latch securing by way of a simple mechanical system and that actuation of the system for exit automatically opens the securing latch to release the coupling system <b>5</b> and the lift mechanism for lowering. While not in the vehicle operating position, it is further foreseen as advantageous that the operator is capable of locating him/herself advantageously, with this mechanism, for effectively sitting forward outside the vehicle while still attached, raising operator viewing position or reach position.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A primary advantage of the coupling device <b>10</b> on the wheelchair frame is the secure latching of the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module to resist movement, in the case of attaching in a vehicle. This attachment further is useful for lifting mechanisms, as in the case of lifting the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module and occupant securely into the vehicle or in elevating the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module, in a building environment. It is foreseen that broad acceptance of the advantages of this system will lead to a standardization of the device system for all wheelchairs and power wheelchairs for common use in future vehicle mode use and building elevation needs. For example, the present universal coupling system <b>5</b> may be utilized to lift wheelchairs or other seating devices into buses, boats, agricultural equipment, up stairs and anywhere else that elevation changes may be required, but are difficult for those needing assistance.</p>

Accordingly, the preceding description is intended to be exemplary and should not be used to limit the scope of the invention.
