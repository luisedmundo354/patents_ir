<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a video system for video telephones and video conferences using video cameras and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, along with the development of microprocessors which can realize high-speed arithmetic operations, personal computers, workstations, and the like for multimedia information can process a large volume of image information and audio information in real time. More specifically, personal computers and workstations can realize a device for reading out a full-color moving image signal, an audio signal, and the like from a CD-ROM, and reproducing these signals in association with each other, and a video conference or video telephone function of achieving a conference such as a meeting by converting a moving image signal and an audio signal from a video camera into digital signals, and transmitting compressed digital signals to a remote station via a communication line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the video telephone or video conference function utilizing a personal computer or workstation, a video camera is arranged on or near a monitor. Recently, a system which can control the video camera in accordance with commands from the personal computer or workstation by a simple operation has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the video telephone or video conference function is realized using a combination of a personal computer or workstation with a video camera, different device driver software programs must be prepared and selectively used in correspondence with the sensor sizes and functions of video cameras, resulting in inconvenience for an operator. In order to detect a photographing range in direction or zoom control of the camera, the range must be confirmed by operating the camera to the limit of the direction or zoom control, and a cumbersome operation is required for displaying a required image on a monitor, resulting in poor operability. Furthermore, in the video conference or video telephone function, since the direction and zooming of the camera can be controlled by the remote station side, an image including contents which are not to be disclosed to a third party is undesirably transmitted to the remote station, thus posing a problem associated with protection of privacy.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a video system which can solve the above-mentioned problems, and is easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide a video system with high operability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a video system which can obtain a required image.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve the above objects, according to one aspect of the present invention, an optical image is converted into a video signal by an image pickup means, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means is changed by an image pickup direction changing means, the video signal output from the image pickup means is displayed on an image display means, and function information of the image pickup means is displayed on a function information display means. With this arrangement, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means can be freely changed by the receiving station side, and a video system which is very easy to use can be provided. Since the function information of the image pickup means is displayed, an operator can recognize functions at a glance, and need not operate the image pickup means to confirm the functions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the present invention, an optical image is converted into a video signal by an image pickup means, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means is changed by an image pickup direction changing means, the video signal output from the image pickup means is stored as a still image in a still image storage means, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means upon photographing of the still image is stored in a photographing direction storage means, the still image stored in the still image storage means is displayed on a still image display means, a moving image output from the image pickup means is displayed on a moving image display means, the position on the still image displayed on the still image display means is designated by a designation means, and the photographing direction change means is controlled, so that the position designated by the designation means becomes a predetermined position of an image. With this arrangement, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means can be freely changed by the receiving station side, and control is made, so that the designated position on the stored still image becomes a predetermined position of an image. For this reason, a video system which is convenient and allows for simple operation can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to still another aspect of the present invention, an optical image is converted into a video signal by an image pickup means, the image pickup direction of the image pickup means is changed by an image pickup direction changing means, a video signal within a photographable range of the image pickup direction changing means is stored, and the stored video signal is displayed.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this manner, after the power switches of the video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e </i>are turned on, function information such as the size of the CCD <b>53</b>, the pan/tilt movable range, and the like of each of the video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e </i>is supplied to the control apparatus, and the operations of the plurality of video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e </i>can be controlled in accordance with the function information. For this reason, a man-machine interface corresponding to the functions of the video cameras <b>13</b> can be constituted. More specifically, when the video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e </i>have different function information, the operator M need not switch a device driver software program in correspondence with the video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e </i>to execute control, thus improving convenience.

The storing unit <b>64</b> receives a video signal output from each of the video cameras <b>13</b><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>e</i>, and also receives a control signal from each video camera <b>13</b> via the interface controller <b>12</b>, the bus <b>8</b>, and the superimposing controller <b>17</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the still image storing unit <b>64</b> sequentially stores position information signals indicating a pan angle (+α), a tilt angle (<b>0</b>), a zoom angle of view (W<b>1</b>), and the like which are input in this order from each video camera <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the monitor <b>11</b> has a still image trigger key <b>65</b> and a still image display picture <b>66</b> in addition to the moving image display picture <b>59</b> for displaying a moving image picked up by the video camera.

When the pan control cursor <b>61</b> is dragged by operating the mouse <b>15</b> and the still image trigger key <b>65</b> is clicked at a position rotated by (+α) in the pan direction, the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> is stored in the still image storing unit <b>64</b>. More specifically, the still image storing unit <b>64</b> stores position information signals indicating the pan angle (+α), the tilt angle (<b>0</b>), the zoom angle of view (W<b>1</b>), and the like in this order, as described above.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When an object person A is zoomed up from this camera position while maintaining the zoom angle W<b>2</b> of view, the pan control cursor <b>60</b> and the like may be moved by controlling the mouse <b>15</b> as in a case wherein the object person B is displayed at the central position. However, if the cursor is moved each time the direction of the video camera is changed, this results in a cumbersome operation and a heavy load on an operator especially in, e.g., a video conference in which different persons speak by turns. Thus, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the mouse <b>15</b> is clicked in a state wherein the object person A is zoomed up and the mouse cursor <b>15</b><i>a </i>is maintained at a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> so as to realize direction control of the video camera toward the still object person A. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, when the video camera <b>13</b><i>a </i>is rotated by −(η+β) from the current position in the pan direction, the video camera <b>13</b><i>a </i>can be direction-controlled toward the object person C.

A digital video decoder <b>304</b> converts the output from the A/D converter <b>302</b> into RGB signals, and supplies the RGB signals to a mirror image conversion circuit <b>305</b>. In accordance with an external control signal, the mirror image conversion circuit <b>305</b> supplies the outputs from the decoder <b>304</b> to a synthesization control circuit <b>306</b> with or without reversal in the horizontal direction. A PLL circuit <b>308</b> supplies clocks of a predetermined frequency to the A/D converter <b>302</b>, the video decoder <b>304</b>, the mirror image conversion circuit <b>305</b>, and the synthesization control circuit <b>306</b>.</p>

Also, the data and address/control signals on the bus <b>310</b> are also supplied to a VGA display signal generation circuit <b>316</b> via a bus interface <b>314</b>. The VGA display signal generation circuit <b>316</b> generates VGA image data of an image stored in a memory <b>320</b> in accordance with a timing signal from a display timing generation circuit <b>318</b>. The generated image data is supplied to the synthesization control circuit <b>306</b> and a color palette <b>322</b>.

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The synthesization control circuit <b>306</b> writes the RGB data from the video decoder <b>304</b> in a video memory <b>324</b>, and generates a switching control signal of a switch circuit <b>326</b> in accordance with the address/control signals form the bus <b>310</b>. The switch circuit <b>326</b> selects the RGB outputs from the color palette <b>322</b> or the RGB data from the video memory <b>324</b> in accordance with the switching control signal, and outputs selected data to a D/A converter <b>328</b>. The D/A converter <b>328</b> converts digital data into an analog signal. An image signal which is synthesized as described above is supplied to a monitor <b>132</b> via an output terminal <b>330</b>, and is displayed on a picture <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the all photographable picture image formation mode, the synthesization control circuit <b>306</b> stores images of video signals input to the input terminal <b>300</b> in an all photographing range images memory <b>325</b>.

When all photographable picture images stored in the all photographing range images memory <b>325</b> are to be output, the synthesization control circuit <b>306</b> sequentially reads out image data stored in the memory <b>325</b>, and transfers them to the switch <b>326</b> via the VRAM <b>324</b>. In this manner, the same function as the image storing unit <b>136</b> and the switch <b>138</b> can be realized by the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>.</p>
