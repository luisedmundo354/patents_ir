<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and particularly to a semiconductor memory device having a self-repair function for an embedded memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">On a system LSI, a DRAM as a large capacity memory storing data is embedded with a logic circuit. A random access operation as fast as a SRAM is demanded from such an embedded DRAM. Further, since a memory cell consists of one transistor and one capacitor (one transistor plus one capacitor structure) as in the case of a generic DRAM, a bit failure may occur (the manufacturing variation of the contact resistance is a major cause). Therefore, a test as fast as that for the SRAM and a redundancy structure with as many rows and columns as that of the generic DRAM in order to relieve bit failures are needed for the embedded DRAM and so is a technique that tests and applies the both efficiently. In such a technique, testing a memory circuit embedded in a device with a built-in self-test circuit (BIST) without using a tester device (that performs DC/AC test on devices) and replacement by a redundant memory cell is performed by cutting the electric fuse according to the result of the self test.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an example of a memory having such a redundancy structure, an integrated circuit semiconductor device comprising a built-in self-repair circuit (BISR) for an embedded memory and a method for repairing the memory are disclosed in Patent Document 1. This integrated circuit semiconductor device comprises an embedded memory including multiple row and column redundancies, a built-in self-test circuit (BIST) for detecting faulty memory cells of the memory, and a built-in self-repair circuit for storing information relating to the detected faulty memory cells by dividing information into row information and column information, determining repair methods of repairing the faulty memory cells base on the row information and column information, and generating repaired addresses in the embedded memory. Further, the priority axis is selected according to the number of faulty cells in a two dimensional redundancy parameter. In other words, whether the faulty cells are replaced with redundant memory cells by column or row is determined according to whether multiple faulty cells exist in particular memory cell column or memory cell row.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, an on chip self-repair system comprising a row repair circuit for repairing row memory lines having at least one defect and an I/O repair circuit, connected to the row repair circuit, for repairing I/O memory blocks having at least one defect is disclosed in Patent Document 2. And an arbitrator, connected between the row repair circuit and the I/O repair circuit, for implementing a priority scheme is further provided.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">[Patent Document 2]</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. JP-A09-311824 (FIG. 1)</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure of the above Patent Documents 1 and 2 are herein incorporated by reference thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The redundant element location operator in Patent Document 1 uses row address and column address as two dimensional redundancy parameters. However, it is preferable that the embedded DRAM comprise a small number of column addresses and a large number of data inputs/outputs in order to obtain a high data transfer bandwidth. When the column address is used as a redundancy parameter, it creates a problem that the redundant memory cell region increases. For instance, in a structure having 8 column addresses and 128 data inputs/outputs, the number of bit lines that the redundant memory cell region has is ⅛ of the total bit lines because 128 bit lines are needed for every redundant address. This means a 12.5 percent increase in chip size. Therefore, it is more common to use input/output data (I/O) as a redundancy parameter instead of column address.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For the reason stated above, it is effective to have a row repair circuit and an I/O repair circuit such as the ones described in Patent Document 2. In this case, a latch circuit that latches at least the number of redundant row addresses plus 1 is needed for every I/O even though it is not mentioned in Paten Document 2. The reason for this is because it is necessary to have it store the state in which all redundant row addresses have been used up (i.e., to make the I/O concerned “redundant MUST”) in order for the device to decide to use a redundant row or redundant I/O. For instance, in the case of a memory having 2 redundant row addresses and 128 I/Os, two flip-flops for storing three defects are needed to decide that a redundant I/O must be used (i.e., to make the I/O redundant MUST), and a total of 256 (2×128) flip-flops must be provided. This creates the problem that the chip area increases. Thus there is much to be desired in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device having a row redundancy unit and an I/O redundancy unit as two dimensional redundancy units for relieving defects of an embedded memory,</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">the row redundancy unit including redundant memory cell groups that replace memory cell rows addressed by row addresses, and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">the I/O redundancy unit including redundant memory cell groups that replace memory cell groups provided for every input/output data,</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">wherein the memory device comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a built-in self-test circuit that tests an embedded memory,</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a redundant element location operator that selects a redundant memory cell group from the row redundancy unit and the I/O redundancy unit based on a preset order and according to the order in which defects are detected by the self-test circuit, and</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">a redundancy replacement unit that replaces defects in the embedded memory with the redundant memory cell group selected by the redundant element location operator.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a second aspect, the redundant element location operator comprises a latch circuit that stores the address of the defect replaced in the embedded memory and an address overlap determining circuit that detects a coincidence between a defect address detected by the self-test circuit and the address of the defect stored in the latch circuit, and the latch circuit latches the defect address detected when no coincidence is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a third aspect, the redundant element location operator further comprises a shift register circuit that shifts a predetermined signal and outputs a pulse signal for the latch circuit to latch the defect address every time the coincidence detection indicates that there is no overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a fourth aspect, the redundant element location operator comprises a counter circuit that counts the number of times that the coincidence detection indicates that there is no overlap, and a decoder circuit that receives and decodes outputs as many as the number of bits of the counter circuit and outputs a pulse signal for the latch circuit to latch the defect address.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The meritorious effects of the present invention are summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, the circuit scale of the redundant element location operator can be reduced by selecting a redundant element based on a preset order and according to the order in which defects are detected.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A semiconductor memory device relating to an embodiment of the present invention has row address and input/output data as two dimensional redundancy parameters for relieving defects of an embedded (built-in) memory (<b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This semiconductor memory device comprises a built-in self-test circuit (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that tests whether or not the embedded memory is defective, a redundant element location operator (<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that determines which redundant element replaces the defect based on a preset order and according to the order of defects detected by the self-test circuit, and a row redundancy unit (<b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an I/O redundancy unit (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that perform replacement of the defect in the embedded memory corresponding to the selected redundant element. The redundant element location operator (<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) determines the order in which the defects of row addresses and input/output data are to be relieved (determines the priority axis) according to a preset order and corresponding to the order in which the defects are detected, and holds redundant element location information. An electric fuse circuit (<b>33</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) programs relief information for relieving the defects based on this redundant element location information. The row redundancy unit (<b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the I/O redundancy unit (<b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) relieve and repair the corresponding bit failures in the embedded memory (<b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) according to the programmed relief information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the semiconductor memory device structured as above, a high-speed operation is easily achieved and a high-speed function test at the same operation frequency as that of the embedded memory is possible since the redundant element location operator simply operates according to the order in which defects are detected. Further, the hold circuit for holding the logical information of the redundant element location is small scale and the pellet area (the area of the entire DRAM circuit including the memory cells) will not increase. Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor memory device comprises a built-in self-test circuit (BIST) <b>10</b>, the redundant element location operator <b>20</b>, and the embedded memory <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The self-test circuit <b>10</b> comprises a self-test controller <b>11</b>, an address generator <b>12</b>, a data generator <b>13</b>, and a comparator <b>14</b>, and has functions of generating test patterns for the embedded (built-in) memory <b>30</b> and of comparing the test results. The structure of the self-test circuit <b>10</b> is almost the same as that of the conventional example, however, the comparator <b>14</b> outputs a total comparison result signal Judge and an individual I/O comparison result signal Jio[i,<b>0</b>] to the redundant element location operator <b>20</b> to test and repair the embedded memory with I/O redundancy. The total comparison result signal Judge shows the test result of the BIST indicating whether or not memory cells selected by an address outputted by the address generator <b>12</b> include any faulty cell. Further, the individual I/O comparison result signal Jio[i,<b>0</b>] individually indicates whether or not there is an error for each I/O. Note that, in the descriptions of signal lines below, [i,<b>0</b>] means that they exist corresponding to the number of the I/Os, and [n,<b>0</b>] means that they exist in multiplicity corresponding to the number of the addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The redundant element location operator <b>20</b> comprises a primary address latch circuit <b>21</b>, a priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b>, and a shift register circuit <b>23</b>. The primary address latch circuit <b>21</b> temporarily latches the address signal outputted to the embedded memory <b>30</b> by the address generator <b>12</b> and outputs it as an output signal Row [n,<b>0</b>] to the priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b>. The priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b> receives the output signal Row [n,<b>0</b>] of the primary address latch circuit <b>21</b> and the total comparison result signal Judge and the individual I/O comparison result signal Jio[i,<b>0</b>] outputted by the comparator <b>14</b>, determines the priority axis according to a preset order and corresponding to the order in which defects are detected, and outputs output signals FILL_R<b>1</b>, FILL_R<b>2</b>, FILL_IO<b>1</b>, Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>], Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>], and Rio[i,<b>0</b>] to the shift register circuit <b>23</b> in order to latch row address and I/Os for redundancy replacement. The shift register circuit <b>23</b> receives output signals FILL_R<b>1</b>, FILL_R<b>2</b>, FILL_IO<b>1</b>, Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>], Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>], and Rio[i,<b>0</b>] from the priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b>, and holds data and adjusts the timing in order to output signals Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>], Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>], and Rio[i,<b>0</b>] as row address information and I/O information to the electric fuse circuit <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The embedded memory <b>30</b> is an embedded RAM and comprises a row redundancy unit <b>31</b>, an I/O redundancy unit <b>32</b>, an electric fuse circuit <b>33</b>, and a memory cell group <b>34</b>. The row redundancy unit <b>31</b> and the I/O redundancy unit <b>32</b> replace and relieve bit failures in the memory cell group <b>34</b> according to the information outputted by the electric fuse circuit <b>33</b>. The electric fuse circuit <b>33</b> programs the information on relief by cutting the electric fuse based on the row address information and the I/O information outputted by the redundant element location operator <b>20</b> in order to relieve and repair the corresponding bit failures. Note that a built-in self-repair circuit (BISR) performing logical repair through software is used in the conventional art, however, the electrical fuse circuit (efuse circuit) repairing physically and electrically is used here. Needless to say, the software means may be used as a repairing means.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the structure of the priority axis sequencer of the semiconductor memory device relating to the first embodiment of the present invention. The priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b> comprises a row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> and flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>48</b>. Note that repairing means for an embedded memory having 2 redundant rows and 1 redundant I/O is shown in this example. Further, each of the flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>48</b> exist in plurality corresponding to the numbers of the addresses and I/Os.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> receives the signals Judge, FILL_R<b>1</b>, FILL_R<b>2</b>, Rrow[n,<b>0</b>], Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>], and Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>] and determines whether or not a failing row address has already been used as a redundant row address, i.e., whether or not the address indicated by Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>] or Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>] and the address indicated by Row[n,<b>0</b>] overlap. And if it determines that they don't overlap, it outputs a signal Judge<b>2</b> as a clock signal to a respective clock input terminal C of the flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Every time the signal Judge<b>2</b> becomes high level, the flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>45</b> shift the high level (VCC) in order. Outputs of the flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>44</b> are respectively outputted as the signals FILL_R<b>1</b> and FILL_R<b>2</b> indicating that the row redundancy is confirmed, and FILL_IO<b>1</b> indicating that the I/O redundancy is confirmed, and are respectively fed to clock inputs of the flip-flop circuits <b>46</b> to <b>48</b>. When the signals FILL_R<b>1</b>, FILL_R<b>2</b>, and FILL_IO<b>1</b> become high level, the flip-flop circuits <b>46</b> to <b>48</b> respectively latch the signals Row[n,<b>0</b>], Row[n,<b>0</b>], and Jio[i,<b>0</b>], and output them as the signals Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>], Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>], and Rio[i,<b>0</b>] to the shift register circuit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The flip-flop circuits <b>46</b> to <b>48</b> respectively become the latch circuit for a first faulty row address, the latch circuit for a second faulty row address, and the latch circuit for a faulty I/O.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the structure of the row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b>. The row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> comprises coincidence detection circuits <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b</i>, NAND circuits NAND<b>1</b>, NAND<b>2</b>, NAND<b>3</b>, and NAND<b>4</b>, and inverter circuits INV<b>1</b> and INV<b>2</b>. The coincidence detection circuit <b>50</b><i>a </i>outputs a high level when all the bits of the signals Rrow<b>1</b>[n,<b>0</b>] and Row[n,<b>0</b>] that it receives coincide. Further, the coincidence detection circuit <b>50</b><i>b </i>outputs a high level when all the bits of the signals Rrow<b>2</b>[n,<b>0</b>] and Row[n,<b>0</b>] that it receives coincide. The NAND circuit NAND<b>1</b> outputs a low level when the coincidence detection circuit <b>50</b><i>a </i>detects a coincidence and the signal FILL_R<b>1</b> is at a high level, and the NAND circuit NAND<b>2</b> outputs a low level when the coincidence detection circuit <b>50</b><i>b </i>detects a coincidence (high) and the signal FILL_R<b>2</b> is at a high level. The NAND circuit NAND<b>3</b> receives the output of the NAND circuit NAND<b>1</b>, and its output is connected to one end of an input of the NAND circuit NAND<b>4</b> via the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>. The signal Judge is fed to the other end of the input of the NAND circuit NAND<b>4</b> and it is outputted as the signal Judge<b>2</b> via the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> as described above outputs the signal Judge<b>2</b> at a high level, indicating a “fail” and that there is no row address overlap, in case the signal Judge becomes high level indicating a “fail” and there is no row address overlap. Further, in case the signal Judge is at a low level indicating a “pass” or in case there is a row address overlap, the signal Judge<b>2</b> outputs a low level indicating a “pass” or that there is a row address overlap and a “fail”.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the operation of the redundant element location operator <b>20</b> will be described with reference to the drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a timing chart illustrating the operation of the semiconductor memory device relating to the first embodiment of the present invention. At time t<b>1</b>, when an initialize signal INIT becomes high level, the flip-flop circuits <b>42</b> to <b>48</b> are initialized and each output of the flip-flop circuits become low level. Then, when a clock signal CLK is supplied, the self-test circuit <b>10</b> starts to operate and test the embedded memory <b>30</b>. The address generator <b>12</b> outputs row/column addresses Add(a<b>0</b>, a<b>1</b>, a<b>2</b> . . . ) to the embedded memory <b>30</b> in order, the row addresses are latched by the primary address latch circuit <b>21</b>, and the signal Row[n,<b>0</b>] is outputted. Meanwhile, output data Dout of the embedded memory <b>34</b> is evaluated and compared by the comparator <b>14</b>, and the signals Judge and Jio[i,<b>0</b>] are outputted to the priority axis sequencer circuit <b>22</b> at a low level when it is a “pass” and at a high level when it is a “fail”.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At time t<b>2</b>, the signal Judge becomes high level when the address al is judged as a “fail.” At this time, the row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> decides that there is no overlap since it is a first “fail,” and outputs the signal Judge<b>2</b> having the same phase as the signal Judge at a high level. The flip-flop circuit <b>42</b> receives the signal Judge<b>2</b>, latches and outputs the high level (VCC) fed to a D terminal, and makes the row redundancy confirmation signal FILL_R<b>1</b> high level. Then, a row address Row_a<b>1</b> latched by the primary latch circuit <b>21</b> is relatched because of the fact that the signal FILL_R<b>1</b> becomes high level in the latch circuit <b>46</b>, and a first redundant row is confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At time t<b>3</b> when an address a<b>3</b> is judged as a “fail,” and the row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> judges that it is confirmed not to be the redundant row address which has been confirmed redundant, the row redundancy confirmation signal FILL_R<b>2</b> becomes high level as in the operation at the time t<b>2</b>, the latch circuit <b>47</b> latches a signal Row_a<b>3</b>, and a second redundant row is confirmed. On the other hand, when the row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> judges that the address overlaps with an address that has already been confirmed to be a redundant address, the signal Judge<b>2</b> remains low level and the “fail” information of the signal Judge is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At an ensuing time t<b>4</b> when an address a<b>6</b> is judged as a “fail,” the signal FILL_R<b>2</b> is at a high level and the second redundant row has already been confirmed, the signal FILL_IO<b>1</b> becomes high level. Then, the latch circuit <b>48</b> latches the individual I/O comparison result signal Jio[i,<b>0</b>] as a confirmed redundant I/O instead of a row address.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the redundancy parameter is confirmed in the order of the first redundant row, the second redundant row, and the redundant I/O every time an address is judged as a “fail”. When an address is judged as a “fail” again with the redundant I/O already confirmed, and the row address overlap determining circuit <b>41</b> judges that there is no overlap, the flip-flop circuit <b>45</b> latches a high level and outputs a high level signal FILL_ALL. The high level signal FILL_ALL means that inability to relieve failures by the redundancy means is confirmed. The signal FILL_ALL is for instance outputted to the outside of the chip and used by a tester (not shown in the drawings) to judge whether or not failures can be repaired by the redundancy means.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, according to the present embodiment, redundancy replacement means is provided by having the individual I/O output Jio[i,<b>0</b>] as a redundancy parameter in the embedded memory having the I/Os as redundancy parameters. Further, the circuit scale of the redundant element location operator <b>20</b> can be made small by determining the priority axis according to a preset location order and corresponding to the order in which defects are detected. In the conventional example, two flip-flops for storing three failures are needed in order to decide that a redundant I/O must be used (i.e., to achieve “MUST redundant I/O”, and a total of 256 flip-flops must be provided in the comparator in a structure having 128 I/Os because two flip-flops are needed to store 3 times of failure (fails) in the conventional art. However, only a total of 128 flip-flops are needed and an increase in circuit scale can be suppressed by applying the replacement means of the present embodiment in which defects are relieved in the order in which they are detected. Further, a high-speed redundancy confirmation is possible since the redundancy confirmation means is constituted by the row address overlap determining circuit constituted by a simple combinational circuit and one stage of the flip-flop circuits in the redundant element location operator <b>20</b>.</p>
