<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A technique to increase transfer rate of command and address signals via a given number of command and address pins in each of one or more integrated circuit memory devices during a clock cycle of a clock signal. In one example embodiment, the command and address signals are sent on both rising and falling edges of a clock cycle of a clock signal to increase the transfer rate and essentially reduce the number of required command and address pins in each integrated circuit memory device.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to memory circuits and, in particular, to circuitry associated with command and address pins of a DRAM (dynamic random access memory).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to perform data transfers, such as a store and an access, to and from conventional DRAM devices, the command and address signals are generally initiated on a rising edge (the transition from logic level “zero” to “one”) or alternatively a falling edge of a clock signal. In a high speed DRAM design, using the current scheme to store and access the data from a DRAM can result in requiring a significantly higher number of command and address pins. Further, any increase in the number of command and address pins, can also result in a significant overhead for the DRAM controller performing data transfers via multiple DRAMs. For example, a DRAM controller coupled to access 8×32 DRAMs in a system, parallelly or concurrently, can require nearly 256 bit input/output (I/O) interfaces. Furthermore, for efficient handling of the command and address signals, the DRAM controller may also have to assign a similar number of command and address pins. Therefore, any increase in the number of command and address pins in a DRAM, in the above system, can also result in requiring similar increase in the command and address pins in each DRAM for the DRAM controller. This is because of operating the command and address signals at half cycles and because of using the command and address pins for a single purpose or a single cycle in conventional double data rate (DDR) DRAM devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, during the last several decades, memory technology has progressed dramatically. The density of commercial memory devices, such as the DRAM, has increased from 1 Kbit to 256 Mbits per chip, a factor of 256,000. Unfortunately, as the density goes up the number of command and address pins required to store and access data has also increased considerably.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following detailed description, reference is made to various specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described with sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be employed, and that structural, logical, electrical, and process changes may be made without departing from the teachings of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments, various features of the invention are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed invention requires more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive aspects lie in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus, the following claims are hereby incorporated into the description of the preferred embodiments, with each claim standing on its own as a separate preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention provides techniques to reduce number of command and address pins required in a DRAM to reduce the package size and to essentially increase the number of command and address signals sent for a given set of command and address pins in the DRAM. The terms “sending” and “initiating” are used interchangeably throughout the document. References to “rising edge” and “falling edge” of a clock or control signal is for illustrative purposes only since those skilled in the art readily know that true or complementary clock and control signals may be used in which a rising edge may be substituted for a falling edge. Therefore, a clock or control signal may substitute any clock transition (rising or falling) and still fall within the scope of this description and claims.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated one conventional technique employed in initiating command and address signals by a DRAM controller to access data from a DRAM upon the rise (active edge) of a timing signal. As shown in the timing diagram <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the DRAM controller sends the command signals <b>120</b>, such as Chip Select (CS#), Row Address Strobe (RAS#), Column Address Strobe (CAS#), and Write Enable (WE#) and the address signals <b>130</b>, such as BA<b>0</b>˜<b>2</b> and A<b>11</b>˜A<b>0</b> during a rising edge <b>112</b> of a clock (CK) signal <b>110</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is clock signal (CK#) <b>115</b> which is an inverse of the CK signal <b>110</b>. It can be envisioned that the command and address signals can also be initiated, similarly as described-above, during a falling edge of the CK# signal <b>115</b>. As described-above, the problem with this technique is as the density of the DRAMs goes up the number of command and address pins required to store and access data can also increase proportionately in each DRAM. Increasing the number of command and address pins can result in a significantly bigger package size. As the packaging density increases, accommodating more number of command and address pins in a smaller package becomes difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated an example timing diagram <b>200</b> of initiating command and address signals by a controller to an integrated circuit memory device according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the command signals <b>220</b>, such as CS#, RAS#, CAS#, and WE# and address signals <b>230</b>, such as BA<b>0</b>˜<b>2</b> and A<b>0</b>˜<b>11</b> are initiated by the controller during both rising and falling edges <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> of a timing cycle of a timing signal <b>210</b> to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals during the timing cycle. In some embodiments, the timing cycle of the timing signal is a clock cycle in a clock signal (CK). In these embodiments, the rising and falling edges <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> comprise transition from a logic level “zero” to a logic level “one” and transition from the logic level “one” to the logic level “zero”, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also in these embodiments, the controller can be a device, such as a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a processor, and/or a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) controller. In these embodiments, the integrated circuit memory device is a DRAM device. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that by sending the command and address signal upon both the rising and falling edges of a clock cycle the number of command and address signals sent during a clock cycle can be significantly more than the conventional technique described-above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It can be envisioned that by increasing the sending of the number of command and address signals in a clock cycle, the number of required command and address pins can be considerably reduced to achieve a higher packaging density in a DRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The clock signal (CK#) <b>215</b> is an inverse of the clock signal (CK) <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Again, it can be envisioned that by initiating the command and address signals during the rising and falling edges of CK# <b>215</b>, similar to initiating the command and address signals during the rising and falling edges of CK <b>210</b> as described-above, the transfer rate of the command and address signals <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> sent during the clock cycle can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated another example timing diagram <b>300</b> of initiating command and address signals by a controller to an integrated circuit memory device according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the command signals <b>320</b>, such as CS#, RAS#, CAS#, and WE# and address signals <b>330</b>, such as BA<b>0</b>˜<b>2</b> and A<b>12</b>˜<b>8</b> are initiated by the controller during a rising edge <b>302</b> of a clock cycle of a CK <b>310</b>. In addition, the address signals, such as A<b>0</b>˜<b>7</b> are initiated during a falling edge <b>304</b> of the clock cycle of the CK <b>310</b> to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals during the clock cycle for a given number of command and address pins in a DRAM device. Again it can be envisioned that using an inverse clock signal (CK#) <b>312</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and initiating command and address signals as described-above can also increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> sent by the controller during the clock cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated an example timing diagram <b>400</b> of initiating command and address signals by a controller to an integrated circuit memory device according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the command signals <b>420</b>, such as CS#, RAS#, CAS#, and WE# and address signals <b>430</b>, such as BA<b>0</b>˜<b>2</b> and A<b>0</b>˜<b>11</b> are initiated by the controller during two substantially consecutive rising edges <b>402</b> of a CK <b>410</b> to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals during the two substantially consecutive cycles. The transfer rate of the command and address signals achieved by using this method <b>400</b> is lower than the transfer rate achieved with the method <b>200</b> described-above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Because, the method <b>400</b> essentially requires one additional clock cycle to complete sending all of the command and address signals <b>420</b> and <b>430</b>. But, in the GHz clock frequency era, adding one additional clock cycle to send the command and address signals <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> does not significantly lower the transfer rates.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated another example timing diagram <b>500</b> of initiating command and address signals by a controller to an integrated circuit memory device according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the command signals <b>520</b>, such as CS#, RAS#, CAS#, and WE# and address signals <b>530</b>, such as BA<b>0</b>˜<b>2</b> and A<b>11</b>˜<b>9</b> are initiated by the controller during a rising edge <b>502</b> of a clock cycle of a CK<b>510</b>. In addition, the address signals, such as A<b>0</b>˜<b>8</b> are initiated during a rising edge <b>504</b> of a substantially subsequent clock cycle of the CK <b>510</b> to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals during two substantially subsequent clock cycles for a given number of command and address pins in an integrated circuit memory device. Again, it can be envisioned that an inverse of the CK <b>510</b> can also be used, as described-above, to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals sent during the clock cycle. Again, it can also be seen that in the GHz range, adding one additional clock cycle to send the address signals <b>530</b> does not significantly lower the transfer rates of the command and address signals between the controller and one or more integrated circuit memory devices. The hatched state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> for the command and address signals indicate that the signals must be held in one state so they may be read. The signal portion marked with vertical lines indicate that the signals may be in any state since they are not being read during that time period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated an example embodiment of a memory circuit <b>600</b> according to the present invention. The memory circuit <b>600</b> includes one or more DRAMs <b>610</b>. Each of the DRAMs <b>610</b> includes multiple data pins <b>640</b> and multiple command and address pins <b>630</b>. The memory circuit <b>600</b> further includes a controller <b>620</b> coupled to the one or more DRAMs <b>610</b> via the data pins <b>640</b> and the command and address pins <b>630</b>. In some embodiments, the controller is a device, such as a CPU, a GPU, a processor, and a DRAM controller. Also in these embodiments, the DRAMs can be any integrated circuit memory devices, such as flash memory device, a volatile memory device, a non-volatile memory device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, and/or a static memory device. In some embodiments, the multiple command and address pins <b>630</b> are coupled to the controller <b>620</b> through a coupling medium <b>650</b>, such as input/output interface and/or a bus.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation, the controller <b>620</b> sends command and address signals to each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> via the associated multiple command and address pins <b>630</b>, respectively, during a clock cycle of a clock signal so as to increase the transfer rate of the command and address signals during the clock cycle. This is accomplished by sending a higher number of command and address signals than available number of command and address pins <b>630</b> in each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the controller <b>620</b> sends the command and address signals upon both rising and falling edges of a clock cycle when transferring data to and from each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> to increase transfer rate of the command and address signals within the clock cycle for a given number of the command and address pins <b>630</b> in each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b>. In other embodiments, the controller <b>620</b> sends the command and address signals upon a rising edge of a clock cycle and further sends remaining address signals upon a falling edge of the clock cycle when transferring the data to and from the integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the controller <b>620</b> sends the command and address signals to each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> via its associated multiple command and address pins <b>630</b>, respectively, upon two substantially consecutive rising edges of a clock signal to increase transfer rate of the command and address signals. In other embodiments, the controller <b>620</b> sends the command and address signals to each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> via its associated multiple command and address pins <b>630</b>, respectively, upon a rising edge of a clock cycle in a clock signal. Further, the controller <b>620</b> sends the address signals upon a rising edge of a substantially subsequent clock cycle to each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> via its associated multiple command and address pins <b>630</b>, respectively, to increase transfer rate of the command and address signals to each integrated circuit memory device <b>610</b> in the two substantially consecutive clock cycles. In the above described embodiments, each of the integrated circuit memory devices <b>610</b> perform the memory command in response to receiving the set of command and address signals. The advantages in using the above techniques to send command and address signals are described-above in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>.</p>
