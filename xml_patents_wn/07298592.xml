<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-83355, filed on Nov. 22, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An apparatus consistent with the present invention relates to a disk drive and, more particularly, to an actuator having an improved dynamic characteristic and a disk drive having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hard disk drives (HDDs), which are data storage devices used for computers, use read/write heads to reproduce data from a disk or record data to a disk. In the HDD, the head performs its functions while being moved by an actuator to a desired position while maintaining a predetermined height from a recording surface of a rotating disk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The storage capacity of the disk drive has continuously increased. The storage capacity of the disk drive is proportional to a surface recording density. The surface recording density is determined by the multiplication of a linear recording density represented by BPI (bits per inch) and a track density represented by TPI (tracks per inch). The increase of BPI is affected solely by the development of a magnetic recording technology while the increase of TPI is greatly dependent on the improvement of a dynamic characteristic of the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the structure of a conventional disk drive. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a plan view illustrating the conventional actuator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. FIG. <b>2</b>B is a vertical sectional view taken along line A-A′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, showing the arrangement of a VCM coil and a magnet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, the conventional disk drive includes a disk <b>10</b> to store data, a spindle motor <b>20</b> to rotate the disk <b>10</b>, and an actuator <b>30</b> to move a read/write head <b>34</b>, which records and reproduces the data, to a desired position on the disk <b>10</b>. The actuator <b>30</b> includes a swing arm <b>32</b> that is rotatably coupled to an actuator pivot <b>31</b>, a suspension <b>33</b>, which is installed at a leading end portion of the swing arm <b>32</b> to support the head <b>34</b> to be elastically biased toward a surface of the disk <b>10</b>, and a voice coil motor (VCM) to rotate the swing arm <b>32</b>. The voice coil motor includes a VCM coil <b>37</b> coupled to a coil support portion <b>36</b> provided at a rear end portion of the swing arm <b>32</b> and magnets <b>38</b> arranged above and under the VCM coil <b>37</b> to face the VCM coil <b>37</b>. Each of the magnets <b>38</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, is magnetized to have two polarities, that is, an N pole and an S pole. The magnets <b>38</b> are typically supported by being attached to yokes <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The voice coil motor having the above structure rotates the swing arm <b>32</b> in a direction according to Fleming's left hand rule due to an interaction between a current applied to the VCM coil <b>37</b> and a magnetic field formed by the magnets <b>38</b>. That is, when the disk drive is turned on and the disk <b>10</b> starts to rotate at a particular angular velocity Ω, the voice coil motor rotates the swing arm <b>32</b> in a predetermined direction, for example, counterclockwise, to move the head <b>34</b> above a recording surface of the disk <b>10</b>. The head <b>34</b> is lifted to a predetermined height from a surface of the disk <b>10</b> by a lift force generated by the rotating disk <b>10</b>. In this state, the head <b>34</b> follows a particular track <b>12</b> of the disk <b>10</b> to record or reproduce data with respect to the recording surface of the disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the disk drive is turned off and the disk <b>10</b> stops rotating, the voice coil motor rotates the swing arm <b>32</b> in the opposite direction, for example, clockwise. Accordingly, the head <b>34</b> exits out of the recording surface of the disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above disk drive, the operation of actuator <b>30</b> is divided into a seeking operation to seek the desired particular track <b>12</b> out of a plurality of tracks on the disk <b>10</b> and a tracking operation to follow the particular track <b>12</b>. Such operations are described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, when current flows through the VCM coil <b>37</b> in a particular direction, a force F acts on the VCM coil <b>37</b> in a direction following Fleming's left hand rule due to the interaction between the current and the magnetic field generated by the magnets <b>38</b>. The force F acts on the VCM coil <b>37</b> at a right angle. Accordingly, the actuator <b>30</b> rotates around the actuator pivot <b>31</b> so that the head <b>34</b>, provided at the leading end portion of the actuator <b>30</b>, is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, the storage capacity of a disk drive increases gradually and accordingly the number of tracks on the disk <b>10</b> increases. When the number of tracks increases, that is, TPI increases, the width of each track decreases. Thus, in order for the head <b>34</b> to follow a track having a very narrow width without generating an error signal, that is, a position error signal (PES), the actuator <b>30</b>, which moves the head <b>34</b>, needs to be controlled more precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, the conventional actuator <b>30</b> has a variety of resonance modes, in which an in-plane resonance mode is known to exert the greatest effect on the tracking operation of the actuator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the shape of an in-plane resonance mode of the conventional actuator <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the in-plane resonance mode in the conventional actuator <b>30</b> has a shape of the swing arm <b>32</b> and the coil support portion <b>36</b> being twisted at the same phase around the actuator pivot <b>31</b>. Such in-plane resonance mode is typically referred to as a butterfly mode.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the force F acting on the VCM coil <b>37</b> of the actuator <b>30</b> is divided into a component force in a direction X parallel to the direction of the track and a component force in a direction Y perpendicular to the direction of the track. Among them, the component force in the direction Y works as an exiting force to excite the butterfly mode.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing the in-plane response of the head in the tracking operation of the conventional actuator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a peak P having a great magnitude appears at a frequency of about 4800 Hz and the peak P is due to the in-plane resonance mode, that is, the butterfly mode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, the in-plane resonance mode, that is, the butterfly mode, of the actuator <b>30</b> is excited by the component force in the direction Y acting on the VCM coil <b>37</b> so that the peak P having a great magnitude is generated. Accordingly, in the tracking operation of the actuator <b>30</b>, the precise track following of the head <b>34</b> becomes difficult as the width of the track is decreased. Thus, the PES increases as the width of the track decreases. Also, as a bandwidth for servo control is restricted by the frequency and magnitude of the peak P, a response to a high frequency becomes defective so that performance of the disk drive is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are views illustrating an actuator having a dual VCM coil to solve the above problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the flow of current during a seeking operation while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the flow of current during a track following operation. The actuator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,104,581.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a dual VCM coil having an outer coil <b>92</b> and an inner coil <b>94</b> is installed at a rear end portion of an actuator <b>90</b>. In the actuator <b>90</b>, when a seeking operation to search for a desired particular track is performed, the direction of current I<sub>o </sub>flowing through the outer coil <b>92</b> and the direction of current I<sub>i </sub>flowing through the inner coil <b>94</b> are made identical. Then, since forces F<sub>o </sub>and F<sub>i </sub>act in the same direction on the outer coil <b>92</b> and the inner coil <b>94</b>, respectively, the actuator <b>90</b> performs the seek operation at a fast speed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when a tracking operation is performed, the direction of the current I<sub>o </sub>flowing through the outer coil <b>92</b> and the direction of the current I<sub>i </sub>flowing through the inner coil <b>94</b> are made opposite. Because the direction of the force F<sub>o </sub>acting on the outer coil <b>92</b> and the direction of the force F<sub>i </sub>acting on the inner coil <b>94</b> are opposite, the component forces in the direction Y of the two forces F<sub>o </sub>and F<sub>i </sub>are offset so that the sum of the two component forces in the direction Y acting on the actuator <b>90</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the in-plane butterfly mode exists at the actuator <b>90</b>, the excitation by the component force in the direction Y is minimized when the head follows the track in the above structure. Thus, the height of the peak corresponding to the butterfly mode is lowered so that a dynamic characteristic of the actuator is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, in the actuator <b>90</b> having the above structure, since the two coils <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are manufactured and coupled to the rear end portion of the actuator <b>90</b>, manufacturing the actuator is difficult. Also, since the rear end portion of the actuator <b>90</b> becomes heavier due to the two coils <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, balancing the overall weight of the actuator is difficult. Furthermore, two input power sources, which can independently drive the two coils <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, are needed. In addition, it is difficult to perform servo control because the directions of the currents flowing through the respective coils <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> need to be changed by recognizing whether the actuator <b>90</b> is in the track following operation or in the seeking operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE, NON-LIMITING EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which illustrative, non-limiting embodiments of the invention are shown. In the accompanying drawings, like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a disk drive according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes a spindle motor <b>120</b> to rotate a disk <b>110</b> which stores data and an actuator <b>130</b> to move a read/write head <b>134</b>, which records and reproduces data, to a predetermined position above the disk <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spindle motor <b>120</b> is installed on a base member <b>101</b> of the disk drive. One or more discs <b>110</b> are installed on the spindle motor <b>120</b> and the disk <b>110</b> is rotated by the spindle motor <b>120</b> at a predetermined angular velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The actuator <b>130</b> includes an actuator pivot <b>131</b> installed on the base member <b>101</b>, a swing arm <b>132</b>, a suspension <b>133</b>, a read/write head <b>134</b>, a coil support portion <b>136</b>, and a voice coil motor. The swing arm <b>132</b> is rotatably coupled to the actuator pivot <b>131</b>. The suspension <b>133</b> is coupled to a leading end portion of the swing arm <b>132</b> and supports the head <b>134</b> to be elastically biased toward a surface of the disk <b>110</b>. The coil support portion <b>136</b> is provided at a rear end portion of the swing arm <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The voice coil motor provides a driving force to rotate the swing arm <b>132</b> in a direction according to Fleming's left hand rule due to an interaction between a current applied to the VCM coil <b>137</b> and a magnetic field formed by magnets <b>138</b>. The VCM coil <b>137</b> is coupled to the coil support portion <b>136</b>. The magnets <b>138</b> are disposed above and under the VCM coil <b>137</b> to face the VCM coil <b>137</b> and are supported through an attachment to a yoke <b>139</b>. The VCM coil <b>137</b> and the magnets <b>138</b> are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the disk drive is turned on and the disk <b>110</b> starts to rotate, the voice coil motor rotates the swing arm <b>132</b> in a predetermined direction, for example, counterclockwise, and loads the head <b>134</b> on a recording surface of the disk <b>110</b>. The head <b>134</b> is lifted to a predetermined height from the surface of the disk <b>110</b> by a lifting force generated by the rotating disk <b>110</b>. In this state, while following a particular track <b>112</b> of the disk <b>110</b>, the head <b>134</b> records data to or reproduces data from the recoding surface of the disk <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the disk drive is turned off, the disk <b>110</b> stops rotation and the voice coil motor rotates the swing arm <b>132</b> in the opposite direction, for example, clockwise, so that the head <b>134</b> exits from the recording surface of the disk <b>110</b>. When the head <b>134</b> is out of the recording surface of the disk <b>110</b>, it is parked on a ramp <b>140</b> provided outside the disk <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The operation of the actuator <b>130</b> includes a seeking operation to search for the desired particular track <b>112</b> of a number of tracks on the disk <b>110</b> and a tracking operation to follow the particular track <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a plan view of the actuator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are vertical sectional views of the actuator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, taken along lines A-A′ and B-B′, respectively, which show the arrangement of the VCM coil and the magnets. In these drawings, a direction X indicates a lengthwise direction of the actuator, that is, a direction parallel to the track direction while a direction Y indicates a widthwise direction of the actuator, that is, a direction perpendicular to the track direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B together, in the actuator <b>130</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention, the VCM coil <b>137</b> includes four sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>which are arranged in the respective directions. The first and second sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>b </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> are disposed away from the actuator pivot <b>131</b> while the third and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>c </i>and <b>137</b><i>d </i>are disposed close to the actuator pivot <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first and second sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>b </i>are disposed on opposite sides with respect to an X axis passing through the center of the actuator pivot <b>131</b>, that is, an X direction center line, and have symmetrically inclined directions with respect to the X direction center line. Also, the third and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>c </i>and <b>137</b><i>d </i>are disposed on opposite sides with respect to the X direction center line and have symmetrically inclined directions with respect to the X direction center line. The inclination directions of the first and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>d</i>, which are disposed on one side with respect to the X direction center line, are opposite to one another. Also, the inclination directions of the second and third sections <b>137</b><i>b </i>and <b>137</b><i>c</i>, which are disposed on the other side with respect to the X direction center line, are opposite to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The VCM coil <b>137</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may have a substantially hexagonal shape on a plane. That is, the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> correspond to the four sides of the hexagonal shape that are not parallel to the rotational direction of the actuator <b>130</b>, that is, the Y direction. Thus, the direction of the current flowing through the VCM coil <b>137</b> changes in each of the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The magnets <b>138</b> include an upper magnet <b>138</b><i>a </i>disposed above the VCM coil <b>137</b> and a lower magnet <b>138</b><i>b </i>disposed under the VCM coil <b>137</b>. The upper and lower magnets <b>138</b><i>a </i>and <b>138</b><i>b </i>are supported by being attached to upper and lower yokes <b>139</b><i>a </i>and <b>139</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The upper magnets <b>138</b><i>a </i>are divided to have four poles corresponding to the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d</i>. The four poles are magnetized such that neighboring poles have the opposite polarities. The lower magnets <b>138</b><i>b </i>are divided to have four poles corresponding to the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d</i>. The four poles are magnetized such that neighboring poles have the opposite polarities. Also, the four poles of the upper magnet <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the four poles of the lower magnet <b>138</b><i>b </i>are magnetized such that poles facing each other have the opposite polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the actuator <b>130</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, when a current is applied to the VCM coil <b>137</b>, forces Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd act on the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>, respectively, in directions according to Fleming's left hand rule due to an interaction between the directions of current at the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> and a magnetic field generated by the magnets <b>138</b>. Since the forces Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd act perpendicularly on the respective first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d</i>, the directions thereof are different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view illustrating component forces in directions X and Y acting on the respective sections of the VCM coil of the actuator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view illustrating a resultant force acting on the VCM coil of the actuator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the four forces Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd acting on the respective first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> can be divided into X directional component forces Fax, Fbx, Fcx, and Fdx and Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy. The Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy acting on the entire VCM coil <b>137</b> are offset by one another. The first and second Y directional component forces Fay and Fby acting on the first and second sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>b </i>disposed away from the actuator pivot <b>131</b> and the third and fourth Y directional component forces Fcy and Fdy acting on the third and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>c </i>and <b>137</b><i>d </i>disposed close to the actuator pivot <b>131</b> have the opposite directions so that the forces can offset one another.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Thus, by adjusting the length and/or direction of the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b>, the resultant force of the first, second, third, and fourth Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy can be zero or minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy applied to the VCM coil <b>137</b> act as a major exciting force to excite the in-plane resonance mode, that is, a butterfly mode, of the actuator <b>130</b>. Thus, when the resultant force of the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy becomes zero, the major exciting force to excite the in-plane resonance mode of the actuator <b>130</b> preferably disappears. However, to drive the actuator <b>130</b> at a faster speed, the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy may be minimized instead of making them zero so that the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy remain to a certain degree.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, although the in-plane butterfly mode exists in the actuator <b>130</b> according to the present invention, because the excitation by the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy is minimized during the tacking operation of the actuator <b>130</b>, the dynamic characteristic of the actuator <b>130</b> can be improved. That is, as the height of a peak corresponding to the butterfly mode which most affects the tracking operation of the actuator <b>130</b> decreases, precision and performance are improved during the track following operation of the head <b>134</b>, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy of the force respectively acting on the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> are offset with one another so as to be zero or minimized. In contrast, the X directional component forces Fax, Fbx, Fcx, and Fdx of the force respectively acting on the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a</i>, <b>137</b><i>b</i>, <b>137</b><i>c</i>, and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> are not offset and work as a driving force to drive the actuator <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first and fourth X directional component forces Fax and Fdx acting on the first and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> are disposed on one side with respect to the X direction center line. The second and third X directional component forces Fbx and Fcx acting on the second and third sections <b>137</b><i>b </i>and <b>137</b><i>c </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> are disposed on the other side with respect to the X direction center line. The first and fourth X directional component forces Fax and Fdx and the second and third X directional component forces Fbx and Fcx act in different directions from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the X directional resultant force Fx<sub>1 </sub>acting on the first and fourth sections <b>137</b><i>a </i>and <b>137</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>137</b> and the X directional resultant force Fx<sub>2 </sub>acting on the second and third sections <b>137</b><i>b </i>and <b>137</b><i>c </i>act in different directions and are on opposite sides with respect to the X directional center line so that a torque to rotate the actuator <b>130</b> around the actuator pivot <b>131</b> is generated. Accordingly, since the actuator <b>130</b> can rotate around the actuator pivot <b>131</b>, the seeking operation and the tracking operation of the actuator <b>130</b> can be performed. When the Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy remain to a certain degree, the torque rotating the actuator <b>130</b> increases and the actuator <b>130</b> can be driven at a faster speed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view of an actuator according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an actuator <b>230</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention includes an actuator pivot <b>231</b>, a swing arm <b>232</b>, a suspension <b>233</b>, a read/write head <b>234</b>, and a coil support portion <b>236</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The actuator <b>230</b> includes a voice coil motor which provides a driving force to rotate the swing arm <b>232</b>.

The structures of the VCM coil <b>237</b> and the magnets <b>238</b> are the same as those in the first embodiment, except for the shape of the VCM coil <b>237</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the present embodiment, the VCM coil <b>237</b> includes four sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d </i>respectively arranged in particular directions. The first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b> are disposed away from the actuator pivot <b>231</b> and the third and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>c </i>and <b>237</b><i>d </i>are disposed close to the actuator pivot <b>231</b>. The first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b </i>are disposed on opposite sides with respect to the X direction center line and are inclined to be symmetrical with each other with respect to the X direction center line. The third and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>c </i>and <b>237</b><i>d </i>are disposed on opposite sides with respect to the X direction center line and are parallel to the X direction center line. Thus, current flowing through the VCM coil having the above structure flows in different directions at each of the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Since the magnets <b>238</b> have the same structure of the magnets <b>138</b> in the above-described first embodiment, a detailed description thereon is omitted herein. The vertical sectional structures of the VCM coil <b>237</b> and the magnets <b>238</b> are the same as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the actuator <b>230</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention having the above structure, when a current is applied to the VCM coil <b>237</b>, the forces Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd act on the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>, respectively, in a direction following Fleming's left hand rule due to an interaction between the direction of the current flowing through each of the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b> and a magnetic field formed by the magnets <b>238</b>. The forces Fa, Fb, Fc, and Fd act in directions perpendicular to the respective first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view illustrating component forces in directions X and Y of the force acting on the respective sections of the VCM coil of the actuator according to the second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a view illustrating a resultant force acting on the VCM coil of the actuator according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the two forces Fa and Fb acting on the first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>, respectively, can be divided into the X directional component forces Fax and Fbx and the Y directional component forces Fay and Fby. Since the third and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>c </i>and <b>237</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b> are parallel to the direction X, the two forces Fc and Fd respectively acting on the third and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>c </i>and <b>237</b><i>d </i>act in the direction Y so that only the Y directional component forces Fcy and Fdy remain. Since the first and second Y directional component forces Fay and Fby respectively acting on the first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b </i>disposed away from the actuator pivot <b>231</b> and the third and fourth Y directional component forces Fcy and Fdy respectively acting on the third and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>c </i>and <b>237</b><i>d </i>disposed close to the actuator pivot <b>231</b> have the opposite directions, they can be offset.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, in the present embodiment, the resultant force of the first, second, third, and fourth Y directional component forces Fay, Fby, Fcy, and Fdy can be zero or minimized by adjusting the length and/or direction of each of the first, second, third, and fourth sections <b>237</b><i>a</i>, <b>237</b><i>b</i>, <b>237</b><i>c</i>, and <b>237</b><i>d </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>. The effect according to the present embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the second embodiment of the present invention, only the X direction component forces Fax and Fbx act on the first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b </i>of the VCM coil <b>237</b>, they are not offset and act as a driving force to drive the actuator <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first and second X directional component forces Fax and Fbx acting on the first and second sections <b>237</b><i>a </i>and <b>237</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are disposed on opposite sides with respect to the X direction center line and have different directions. As a result, a torque to rotate the actuator <b>230</b> around the actuator pivot <b>231</b> by the first and second X directional component forces Fax and Fbx can be generated. Accordingly, since the actuator <b>230</b> can rotate around the actuator pivot <b>231</b>, the seeking operation and the tracking operation of the actuator <b>230</b> can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a graph showing the in-plane response of the head in the tracking operation of the actuator according to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Referring to a graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in the actuator according to the present invention, the peak P corresponding to an in-plane resonance mode, that is, a butterfly mode, appears at a frequency of about 5000 Hz and the magnitude of the peak P is decreased considerably when compared to the conventional technology. This is because, in the actuator according to the present invention, an exciting force exciting the butterfly mode, that is, the resultant force of the Y directional component forces acting on the VCM coil, is minimized or becomes zero. When the magnitude of the peak P corresponding to the butterfly mode decreases, a very accurate tracking operation of the actuator is possible, thus, PES is decreased. Also, since the magnitude of the peak P decreases when compared to the conventional technology, a band width for servo control can be increased so that the performance of a disk drive can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Table 1 below shows the comparison of the servo band width and PES between an actuator consistent with the present invention and the conventional actuator.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In Table 1, RRO (repeatable run-out) refers to a repeated vibration and NRRO (non repeatable run-out) refers to a non-repeated vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to Table 1, the servo band width of the actuator according to the present invention is increased by about 25% when compared to the conventional actuator. PES by an overall vibration including the repeated vibration and the non-repeated vibration in the actuator according to the present invention is decreased by about 32.5% when compared to that of the conventional actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, according to the present invention, the exciting force in a direction perpendicular to the track which excites the in-plane resonance mode of the actuator can be minimized or becomes zero. Thus, the magnitude of a peak corresponding to the in-plane resonance mode decreases so that accuracy and performance in the track following operation of the head are improved. Also, since the servo band width needed for servo control can be increased when compared to the conventional technology, PES is decreased so that performance of a disk drive is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, since the number of tracks can be increased based on the improved dynamic characteristic of the actuator, a disk drive having a large storing capacity can be realized. In addition, since only a single coil is used, difficulties in manufacturing and servo control due to an increase in the number of coils can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, although the VCM coil of the actuator according to the present invention is described to have the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or <b>11</b>, the VCM coil is not limited thereto and may have a variety of shapes within a range of the technical concept of the present invention.</p>
