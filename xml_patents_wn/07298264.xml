<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system that tracks tags in real-time based on EPC codes and on other priority codes written into transponder memory fields of the tags. As an example, a priority code may be written into a memory of an RFID transponder identifying a high-value item or a small high-value item that is likely to be stolen. Based on the use of this priority code, those items can be preferentially tracked as opposed to items of low value or size such that they are unlikely to be stolen. Such use of priority codes and local filtering alleviates the need to go back to large centralized databases associating unique numbers with other parameters and potentially the history of the item.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of provisional application 60/537,728, entitled RFID Tag Filtering and Monitoring; the inventors of which are Peter J. Kuzma and Charles A. Eldering; filed Jan. 20, 2004.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">RFID systems including tags, also known as transponders, and readers, are being deployed in order to track objects for a variety of purposes. This can include tracking of objects in a warehouse or retail environment to determine where objects are and to insure that the product flow from factory to consumer is adequate and optimized. The advent of RFID will allow tracking of individual items based not only on product code but also on individual numbers. This opens up a multitude of possibilities for increasing the efficiency of shipping and sales of customer goods as well as tracking theft in various fields.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The multitude of objects to be read, especially in the retail environment, also creates numerous problems related to the tracking of those items. For example, it will be possible with RFID technology to read all of the items in a store such as a retail outlet or grocery store. The large number of items in a store results in difficulties in organizing that information and in tracking particular items as they leave the shelves. As an example, a store may wish to track high-value items that may be stolen but will have to determine what those items are based on movement of all items within the store. This can lead to tremendous bottlenecks in data processing and can overwhelm servers and the computers that are called upon to do such filtering</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a specific example of the data processing problems that arise in RFID, the EPC code that has been agreed upon by the industry is a 96-bit code which includes the manufacturing company code, an SKU code, and a unique ID number for that particular item. The advent of these EPC codes allows, in theory, the tracking of all items but, in reality, tracking of items even within the store becomes a data processing nightmare. Furthermore, if the store wishes to track items that have arrived at a particular store or are being taken off the shelves after having arrived from a particular transport system, it will be necessary to go back to a centralized database to compare those EPC codes with the data history for those particular items. This can be particularly processor intensive and under some circumstances may be impossible based on the need to retrieve data from multiple databases in real-time while an object is being moved through the store or warehouse.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For at least these reasons, there is a need for a system which is able to better filter and track items containing RFID codes such as EPC codes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present system describes a method for filtering of RFID tag data such that RFID tags can be tracked in real-time based on EPC codes and on other priority codes written into transponder memory fields. In one embodiment, the transponder contains a memory field indicating the store in which the item has been stocked. Having listed the store, it is possible for readers to filter based not only on ID number and information in the EPC but also based on the store ID written into the tag. This facilitates tracking of items that have arrived from another store, are being returned from another store perhaps not part of that chain, or which have had their store ID erased perhaps in an illegal manner</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, priority codes are written into the transponders, and readers and data systems connected to the readers use those priority codes to track those particular items. As an example, a priority code may be written into a high-value item or a small high-value item that is likely to be stolen. Based on the use of this priority code, those items can be preferentially tracked as opposed to items of low value or size such that they are unlikely to be stolen. An advantage of this system is that the ID number, EPC code, and unique number do not need to be referred to and a very simple and rapid filtering process can be performed either at the reader level or in the network to which the reader is immediately connected to. This alleviates the necessity to go back to a larger centralized database to associate the unique number of the item with a list of items that may be potentially stolen.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another embodiment, priority codes are written into the transponder to preferentially track those items not because of potential of theft but because of other reasons that make those transponders and tags and the items associated with those transponders of higher importance than other transponders in the system. As previously described, use of priority codes and local filtering alleviates the need to go back to large centralized databases associating unique numbers with other parameters and potentially the history of the item. By writing into the transponder RFID tag and performing local filtering, the data processing on the multitude of tag data coming back is greatly simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, velocity tracking of transponders is used to establish a threshold for local filtering. In this embodiment, the velocity of an RFID tag through a given environment such as a warehouse or a retail outlet is monitored. Those items having a velocity exceeding a particular threshold are immediately tracked, either through tracking by the read-only memory, or by tracking through an additional field written into the tag to note that that item is of particular interest because of its velocity. In this embodiment, transponders identified by their velocity or by their velocity in combination with a written field or a written field which has been established because of their velocity, are preferentially tracked within a reader, a local assembly of readers, or a local area network within a store to determine where the item is headed and to monitor its presence in the store. One application of this embodiment is the use to track items in a store which may be being stolen because they are moving through the store rapidly. As an example, the common mode of shoplifting called “pick and run” is exemplified by a thief who has put an item in his pocket and is simply running through the store. Instead of returning to a centralized database to analyze the unique number or other items associated with the ID number, the velocity of that RFID tag causes an alarm to be triggered indicating to the store personnel that an RFID tag has achieved an exceptionally high velocity and should be monitored. In one embodiment, this information is passed to the registers or to the security system or a personal alert device held by a security guard and the individual or individuals believed to be holding that RFID tag are monitored or detained. In an alternate embodiment, the system reports the present velocity and predicted future velocity of that RFID tag to registers or a security system such that the person can be intercepted.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In describing an embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be used for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that readers in a particular environment read tags through use of both near field inductive coupling and far field electromagnetic waves. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reader <b>100</b> transmits a signal from antenna <b>102</b>, generating an electromagnetic field <b>104</b> which strikes transponder A <b>200</b>. Transponder A <b>200</b> returns a back-scattered signal which is read by reader <b>100</b> indicating that the tag is present at that location. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a variety of RFID systems can be used to create the reader transponder system including passive RFID and active RFID. A number of standards are in place for such systems which are readily available. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a second reader <b>110</b> also may read tags and, as shown, can read transponder B <b>204</b> but cannot read transponder C <b>202</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, transponder C <b>202</b> is read neither by reader <b>110</b>, nor by reader <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a typical transponder device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this example, transponder <b>210</b> contains a memory that allows storage of an ID number <b>212</b> that, in one embodiment, is a 96-bit number containing a manufacturing company code, an SKU or EPC code, and a unique ID number. The unique ID number is different for each item whereas the SKU or EPC code represents a particular designated product or type of item and the manufacturing company code represents the company or the company that produced the item. In addition, the memory of transponder <b>210</b> may contain volatile memory <b>214</b> structured in 32-bit blocks or other size blocks. This memory <b>214</b> allows for writing in of data to the transponder <b>210</b> in addition to reading of the ID number <b>212</b>. Processor <b>216</b> may also be present to allow for local processing of data and is used to assist in the writing or reading of the memory. An RF section is present in the transponder <b>210</b> to receive the illumination signal from the reader and to perform back-scattered modulation of the data onto the reflected signal such that the transponder <b>210</b> can be read. Since a number of standards have been developed to support the rapid deployment of transponders and the methods for establishing communications between the reader and the transponder tag are well understood by those skilled in the art, such standards and methods will not be elaborated upon here.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates reader <b>100</b> disposed so as to be able to read transponders <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, and <b>166</b>, each containing a unique ID number. Firmware <b>160</b> in reader <b>100</b> is adapted to process these unique ID numbers and to determine whether the item corresponding to each unique ID number previously has been read at the location of reader <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, firmware <b>160</b> in reader <b>100</b> can be set such that only items of interest are reported. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, three tags, <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, and <b>166</b> are read by reader <b>100</b>; however, in this embodiment, only the presence of tag <b>164</b> is reported to the system which may be a PC or network connected to reader <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the firmware <b>160</b> in reader <b>100</b> performs filtering based on unique ID number of the tags being read at that location.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is also possible to use other codes written into the volatile memory <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the tag to provide the basis for the filtering. In this embodiment, reader <b>100</b> contains firmware <b>160</b> which looks for not only ID numbers but also can base its filtering decisions on data written into the volatile memory <b>214</b> of the tags. As an example, the firmware may read tags <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, and <b>166</b> but find that only one of those tags has a field of interest or a field containing a code such that the presence of that tag should be reported out of reader <b>100</b>. As will be further discussed, these codes may be based on priorities or particular parameters not described in the unique ID number and allow for the reader <b>100</b> to filter based on those fields written into the volatile memory <b>214</b> of the transponder or tag</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates how multiple readers can read a tag in a position such that the fields from respective readers overlap and cause signals from multiple readers to strike the tag, resulting in that tag being read by more than one reader. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates tags <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>, and <b>176</b>, where particular tags are within the ranges of particular readers <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>120</b>. In this example, tag <b>162</b> is only read by reader <b>100</b> but tag <b>164</b> is read both by reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b>. Tags <b>166</b> and <b>176</b> are out of range and hence not read by any reader. Tag <b>168</b> is only read by reader <b>110</b> and tags <b>172</b> and <b>174</b> are only read by reader <b>120</b>, while tag <b>170</b> is read both by reader <b>110</b> and reader <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> are able to communicate with each other either directly, through a network, or through a network with a centralized server. In this embodiment, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> use filtering between both readers to determine if the tag that has been commonly read, in this case <b>164</b>, should be reported. For example, in one embodiment, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> use the reading of tag <b>164</b> and the 96-bit code to determine if that reading should be reported to other readers or a centralized system. In an alternate embodiment, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> compare fields written into the tag to determine if that tag <b>164</b> should be read. One advantage of this system is that if reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> singly or jointly decide that a read tag is of interest, the reading of that tag by either reader can be reported. As an example, reader <b>100</b> may have filtering instructions such that it does not believe that the reading of tag <b>164</b> is critical, but reader <b>110</b> has an indication that reading of that tag should be reported and thus indicates to reader <b>100</b> and a centralized system that that tag has been read and should be tracked. In an alternate embodiment, voting takes place between two or more readers to determine if tags that have been read are of significant importance to be reported. In this embodiment, the reading of tags such as tags <b>164</b> or <b>170</b> by multiple readers is filtered as a group to determine if that tag should be further tracked or if those reads should be discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates how directed reading can be performed based on illumination of tags in particular geometric areas. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, shelf <b>300</b> and shelf <b>302</b> contain items with tags that can be preferentially left unilluminated such that those tags are not read. In this embodiment, reader <b>100</b> is placed in aisle <b>304</b> such that tags can be read in the aisle. In one embodiment, filtering of tags based on their having been read in that aisle <b>304</b>, as can occur when the tags are in shopping cart <b>306</b>, may be performed. In this embodiment, other readers may be used to read the shelves, but those tags are not monitored unless they are subsequently read in the aisles. As an example of use of this embodiment, stores may monitor all of the items on the shelves and in the aisles but choose only to filter those items that have actually entered the aisles and are likely to be moving. In this embodiment, velocity itself need not be tracked, but presence of the items in the aisles themselves is sufficient to trigger tracking of those tags.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an alternate embodiment, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> are constructed such that they can direct their electromagnetic fields <b>104</b>, either through individual tuning of antennas or through coordinated tuning of antennas to focus electromagnetic energy into the aisles and track the tags read in those aisles. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, readers are configured such that their electromagnetic fields <b>104</b> are directed at the aisle <b>304</b> rather than the shelves <b>300</b> and <b>302</b>, and that reads from those readers are filtered because those items are in the aisles.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an alternate embodiment, readers are designed such that their electromagnetic fields <b>104</b> can be coupled to read the shelves only, and filtering is performed on the items in the shelves rather than in the aisles. In this embodiment, shelf tracking is performed, and aisle tracking, if performed, is performed either through separate readers or another monitoring system entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In yet another embodiment, both shelf reads and aisle reads are performed. In this embodiment, the store or warehouse is able to monitor the actual inventory, which is the inventory that is on the shelves and is not going to leave the store or warehouse within a short period of time. As an example, all of the items on shelf <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be considered inventory, whereas those items in the shopping cart <b>306</b> headed towards the check-out lanes should not be considered inventory, or may be considered inventory that has left the shelves but has not been paid for yet. By knowing both shelf inventory and what can be termed as “cart inventory,” it is possible to better monitor where the items are in a store and what is happening to them. These systems can, of course, be coupled with the point-of-sale systems that report actual sales of an item and, as such, shrinkage or non-shelf returns can be closely monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One of the advantages of having a separate shelf-reading system from an aisle-reading system is that the two systems can coordinate and better monitor total inventory and not simply attempt to recognize items on the shelves as the entire inventory of the store. Again, when coupled with point of sale, a very accurate reading of the entire workings of the store or warehouse can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which readers can report reads of certain tags to other readers and indicate to those readers that those tags in particular should be tracked. As an example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reader <b>100</b> has been instructed to look for tags T<b>1</b> through T<b>9</b>. When a shopping cart <b>306</b> passes by, reader <b>100</b> notices that only certain tags are present and reader <b>100</b> reports on to a second reader, reader <b>110</b>, that “I have seen tags T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b>. You are now instructed to look for them.” Reader <b>110</b> performs filtering for those particular tags and reports the tags seen by it on to reader <b>120</b>. Similarly, reader <b>120</b> performs filtering and reports its having seen tags T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b> to reader <b>130</b>. An advantage of this system is that each reader can be taught by another reader as to on what parameters it should base its filtering. This eliminates the need for the readers to either contain a complete database of filtering parameters for all tags, or to return to a centralized database within the store or at another location to determine on what to base its filtering. It should be noted that, as noted above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this type of filtering can be both performed on the 96-bit code written into the memory that is present in the memory of the tags, but may also be based on specific fields written into the tags for filtering purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the coordinated reading and filtering of tags using shelf readers. Shelf <b>310</b> contains readers <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b>, where each reader is designated to a portion of shelf <b>310</b>, as shown. Readers may be present on shelf <b>310</b> such that reader <b>100</b> covers a portion of shelf <b>310</b> and can speak with reader <b>110</b> which covers a second portion of shelf <b>310</b>. By being able to communicate, either directly or through a centralized network or server, reader <b>100</b> and reader <b>110</b> can share information as to what filtering should take place. As an example, an item may leave shelf <b>310</b> near reader <b>100</b> which notes that a tag has left its shelf and reports the leaving of that tag to reader <b>110</b> and other readers in the nearby vicinity. If the consumer subsequently decides that they do not want that item and the consumer returns it to an adjacent shelf <b>312</b> such as the shelf read by reader <b>160</b> or <b>170</b>, the system can then halt filtering of that item because it has been returned to a shelf. This eliminates the need to track the item through the entire store because it in fact has been put back on to the shelf inventory and is not going to be stolen. Reader <b>160</b> can issue an alert that that item needs to be returned to its proper location. An advantage of this embodiment is that items can be tracked through the store but it is not necessary to report all events to a centralized server which would rapidly become overwhelmed with items that are simply being moved through the store for purchase or moved from one shelf to another, as opposed to actually being stolen. As a result, because of the local filtering and prioritization of tag reads, it becomes possible to rapidly separate reads of importance from reads of lesser importance.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has been described with respect to a retail environment based on shelves stocked with individual items, the system can be implemented at other levels including, but not limited to, warehouses containing cartons, boxes or crates with individually tagged items, shipping containers with RFID tags, or any other set of tagged items. As such, the system can be applied to tracking and transportation systems in general where it is desirable to filter tag reads and to utilize sets of tag reads to determine location or movement of tagged items to prioritize the reading and tracking of particular items.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a basic filtering process that can be performed on existing codes such as the EPC code in the transponders. As can be seen in step <b>400</b>, a reader receives a list of EPCs to be tracked. Then the list is passed onto a scan for those particular EPCs, step <b>410</b>, which is followed by a code observed test, <b>420</b>. This results in either a reporting, step <b>430</b>, being executed, or a return to the scan for EPCs step <b>410</b>, for further scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the use of priority codes that are written into the tag to form the basis for reporting. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a list of EPCs is received in step <b>400</b> and the reader, either alone or in combination with a centralized server, writes priority codes in the memories of the tags of interest, at step <b>440</b>. As will be described, these codes may indicate various parameters about those items being tracked, but are specifically written in for the purposes of filtering and tracking so that the system may have codes for those purposes as opposed to simply relying on EPCs or other codes inherently existing in the tags. In a subsequent step <b>450</b>, the reader scans for priority codes. A codes observed test, step <b>420</b>, results in the reporting of those codes that were observed, step <b>430</b>, or control may be returned to step <b>450</b> for further scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a system in which readers <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b> are connected to a central processor <b>1100</b> and central database <b>1110</b> from which they can receive filtering parameters and instructions regarding both filtering of tags and writing in of priority codes into tags. In this embodiment, the readers can be connected to the central processor <b>1100</b> through a wired network such as an Ethernet type network or other local area wired network, or may be connected to the central processor <b>1100</b> through a wireless network such as can be created with 802.11 technology. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a high-speed data path can be connected between each reader and the centralized processor <b>1100</b> and database <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates that connections between readers can be established, either through direct interconnection of the readers or through establishment of an ad hoc network. In one embodiment, readers are connected to each other through wired or wireless networks and are instructed as to who their nearest neighbors are. In this embodiment, reader <b>120</b> is connected to readers <b>100</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>130</b>, and reader <b>120</b> is instructed that these are its neighbors. In this embodiment, reader <b>120</b> may be given instructions as to how to deal with communications from those neighbors. In an alternate embodiment, reader <b>120</b> simply discovers its neighbors and creates what is known as an ad hoc network and learns that it should report reads to its neighbors and that it can communicate back to the central processor <b>1100</b> through reader <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates how readers can be configured to establish communication path through each other back to the central processor <b>1100</b> and central database <b>1110</b>, eliminating the need for direct connection between each reader and that centralized database. An advantage of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is that the readers in communicating with each other can pass filtering parameters as have been previously described. In either the ad hoc network or network that is intentionally created, having the readers interconnected allows for instructions and filtering data to be passed between readers without having to go back through the central processor <b>1100</b> and central database <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a flow chart for determination of velocity and determining whether a tag should be read based on its velocity alone or its velocity coupled with a priority field. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a tag is read at a first location and the location and time at which it has been read is recorded in step <b>700</b>. The tag is then read at a second location and the location and time of the reading is recorded in step <b>710</b>. Based on those two parameters, step <b>720</b> can determine the direction of travel and velocity. Algorithms for determining the direction and velocity are well known by those skilled in the art and can be as simple as determining the distance between the two reads and the time difference to determine the velocity and direction of travel. As can be appreciated, some understanding of the location of the readers is necessary. Indicating the location of each reader in a centralized database or simply recording that location in the reader can accomplish this. That location may be in geographic coordinates such as those obtained through a GPS system, or may be store coordinates such as those corresponding to an aisle and end of the store. In an alternate embodiment, the exact location within the store in geometric terms is determined and recorded either in the reader or in the centralized database.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, once the velocity has been determined, the next step <b>730</b> is to determine the priority of that read based either on the velocity, a prioritization field within the tag, or a combination of the velocity and the prioritization tag. Based on one or more of these parameters, step <b>740</b> determines the urgency of the reporting of that read. If it is determined that the reading of that tag needs to be urgently reported, as when the tag is moving rapidly through the store, an alarm can be generated in step <b>744</b>. Alternatively, if it is determined that that read is not critical, the reading of the tag, including the velocity and direction of travel and time of read can be recorded in step <b>742</b>. Subsequent processing of the read can be performed to analyze the history of a particular item.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a prioritization scheme that eliminates the need to rely simply on the EPC code or other information that is stored in the read-only memory of the tag (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As shown, instead of treating all objects in the store/warehouse <b>800</b> equally, items may be identified by specific parameters such as high-value items <b>820</b> or small high-value items <b>822</b>, high-value items in motion <b>824</b>, or high-value items in motion near the exit <b>826</b>. Another set of fields that may be used are store codes and priority fields based on store codes, including a priority field indicating the wrong store code <b>830</b> (i.e. an item that has entered the store but did not emanate from the store), priority fields based on determination of no store code <b>832</b>, or returned items <b>834</b>. By writing in priority fields based on monitoring of those parameters, tags can be marked for prioritized filtering because they are likely to have entered the store in an illegal or inappropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, frequently stolen items <b>810</b> may be monitored as well as frequently stolen items in motion <b>812</b> or those items in motion near the exit <b>814</b>. By writing into tags of items fitting those categories, those items can be efficiently and rapidly monitored. Similarly, perishable or dangerous items <b>802</b> in a store or warehouse may be prioritized by writing a field into those tags as well as perishable/dangerous items in motion <b>804</b> and perishable/dangerous items in motion near the exit <b>806</b>. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, a variety of other schemes can be used to prioritize the reading of tags and appropriate data may be written into the tags such that those tags are preferentially filtered over all the multitude of tags in the store or warehouse.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With respect to perishable items, a particularly useful feature of this system is the ability to write a field into perishable items and track those items preferentially based on the “purchase by” date such that the item is not purchased after the “purchase by” date. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, step <b>808</b> illustrates that a perishable item, such as milk, that has gone beyond its expiration date may have a field written into the tag indicating that the associated milk should not be sold. Upon approaching a register or upon check out, that field alerts the retailer and the consumer that that item should not be purchased. In this embodiment, that particular field is utilized as opposed to returning to a centralized database to compare the item number with the origination date and make a calculation as to whether that item is sellable or not. The clear advantage is that the local filtering based on the priority code eliminates the need to return to the centralized database to make all determinations regarding that item and the salability of that item.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a process for writing priority codes into tags or transponders. As can be seen in step <b>400</b>, EPC codes are received and a priority database is accessed in step <b>750</b>. This priority database indicates the prioritization of tracking and indicates what codes should be written into the tags. In step <b>730</b> prioritization codes are determined and are then coupled with the subsequent step <b>760</b> of determined tracking requirements, which indicates how those particular tags should be tracked. The following step <b>770</b> is to set the readers up to a track or alarm based on the prioritization or, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, to write tracking requirements in the tag in step <b>772</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Step <b>760</b> of determined tracking requirements can include combinations of velocity of an item with other parameters including, but not limited to, the types of prioritization codes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In one embodiment single prioritization codes are utilized, while in another embodiment combinations of prioritization codes are utilized to establish tracking parameters. In yet another embodiment, prioritization codes are combined with velocity determinations to establish tracking parameters and reporting conditions/thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an environment in which one of the embodiments of the invention as described herein may be used. In this environment, which is typically a store or warehouse, there are shelves <b>1210</b> and aisles <b>1220</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, readers <b>1230</b> are located above the shelves <b>1210</b>, although in an alternate embodiment, the readers <b>1230</b> may be located above the aisles <b>1220</b>. The readers <b>1230</b> are interconnected and also report back to a centralized server <b>1250</b> and database <b>1260</b>. Readers <b>1230</b> are also in communication with registers <b>1240</b> such that items can be tracked at the registers either through RFID or through other mechanisms related to point-of-sale tracking. The registers <b>1240</b> are also connected to the centralized server <b>1250</b> and database <b>1260</b>. A security system <b>1200</b> containing monitors as well as interconnections to cameras <b>1270</b> located in the store or which communicates with security personnel though personal alert devices, is also interconnected to the centralized server <b>1250</b> and can receive filtering and alarm information from the readers <b>1230</b>. In this embodiment, the filtering may take place at the reader level such that the server <b>1250</b>, security system <b>1200</b>, and registers <b>1240</b> receive alarms related to particular prioritized items, rather than receiving tracking data for all of the items either in inventory or in motion in the store. An advantage of the present system is that only the information of importance is reported to the security system <b>1200</b> or registers <b>1240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a representative screen <b>1300</b> on a security system, personal alert device of a security personnel, or the monitor of a register. The illustrative screen <b>1300</b> indicates that an item has a particular direction of travel <b>1310</b> as well as a predicted direction of travel <b>1320</b>. As can be understood, the system enables tracking of that item in terms of its previous location and its predicted location. Additionally, a priority code <b>1302</b>, either through a color or other marking of that item, may be assigned with a priority code key or indicator shown on the screen <b>1300</b>. The value <b>1304</b> of the item may also be indicated. An advantage of this embodiment is that personnel are able to determine that a high value item of particular interest is moving through the store and should be further tracked. In one embodiment, items that are moving too rapidly through the store and are of high value are indicated to security personnel such that they may be tracked. In another embodiment, a large number of items may be tracked and the motion of those items through the store indicated on the screen <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although screen <b>1300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> has been described with respect to a retail environment, it should be understood that the system can also be applied to warehouse, transportation networks, or any other systems used to track objects with RFID tags or transponders. As an example, items ranging from containers on cargo ships to livestock can be tracked and presented on a screen such as screen <b>1300</b>, with parameters such as present direction of travel, predicted direction of travel or path, priority or value. By performing selective filtering or prioritization before presentation, it is possible to graphically present items of interest as opposed to presenting all read tags.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The screen <b>1300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> may also show the location of the exits and, as a filtering parameter, the system may report an item that has taken a circuitous route through the store that is unusual and is potentially indicative of theft rather than sale. In this embodiment, an item that has taken an unexpected path is tracked and its location is reported. In one embodiment, items that have taken such a path are reported with increasingly higher alarms as they approach an exit of the store.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a store <b>100</b>A that contains shelves containing goods, aisles between the shelves, an area of registers, and an exit, <b>104</b>A. A storage area, <b>106</b>A, is also contained within store <b>10</b>A. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there are three shelves, shelf <b>1</b>-<b>110</b>A, shelf <b>2</b>-<b>112</b>A, and shelf <b>3</b>-<b>114</b>A. There are also a series of registers <b>102</b>A that are located at the ends of the aisles between shelf <b>1</b>-<b>110</b>A, shelf <b>2</b>-<b>112</b>A and shelf <b>3</b>-<b>114</b>A. A number of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers are located in store <b>100</b>A including aisle readers <b>120</b>A, <b>122</b>A, <b>124</b>A, <b>126</b>A, <b>128</b>A, <b>130</b>A, <b>132</b>A, <b>134</b>A, and <b>136</b>A. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there are also readers in the storage area <b>106</b>A of store <b>100</b>A including warehouse readers <b>150</b>A and <b>152</b>A. In addition, there are three register readers located near the front of the store including register readers <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>142</b>. In the storage area <b>106</b> of store <b>100</b>A are also included a server <b>160</b>A with an accompanying database <b>161</b>A, the server <b>160</b>A being connected to a network <b>170</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the readers may establish interconnectivity such that the readers may pass information to each other and a routing system can be developed such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in which aisle readers pass information up the aisles and over to another aisle and finally through aisle reader <b>136</b>A onto server <b>160</b>A. Server <b>160</b>A may then route that information to the network <b>170</b>A or use the database <b>162</b>A for further processing of that information. Similarly, register reader <b>138</b>A may pass information to reader <b>140</b>A which passes information to reader <b>142</b>A which, in turn, passes that information to the warehouse reader <b>150</b>A for communication to warehouse reader <b>152</b>A, which then communicates it to the server <b>160</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an example of how readers may be interconnected to establish interconnectivity to the server/network and is not meant to limit the number of ways in which readers can be configured and how information may be routed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, RFID tag information may be filtered locally without going to central database <b>162</b>A. In one embodiment, the aisle readers perform reads on tags and go to a local database, stored within the reader and determine what action to take based on locally stored information. That information can include, but is not limited to, a prioritization code, stored in the local memory <b>214</b> of the transponder. As an example, an aisle reader can read a set of tags and determine, based on a locally stored prioritization code indicating that an item is perishable, that the expiration date of the item needs to be checked. The local reader can, based on the detection of a prioritization code indicating that a perishable item has been scanned, determine if the item is past its expiration date. In one embodiment this is accomplished locally without referring to central database <b>162</b>A containing EPC codes and complete information about the product. In another case once the local reader recognizes the prioritization code, the local reader queries central database <b>160</b>A with complete EPC information to determine if the item is past its expiration date. In both instances the determination as to whether or not further action is required is made locally without reference to a remote database containing the complete EPC information. One advantage of this system is that it allows information to be locally filtered and reduces the demands on the EPC database.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another instance an aisle reader reads an item and determines, based on an observed prioritization code, that the scanned item is a high value item. In this instance the aisle reader generates a signal notifying one or more registers that a high value item has been placed in motion. In one embodiment, the registers are placed on alert to detect the presence of that particular EPC, thus confirming that it is being paid for. A time period for the item to appear at the register may be designated, and if the time period is exceeded, a security system can be notified. In another embodiment, a security system is notified immediately, and the progress of the item is monitored, through readings at the various readers in the store. The item may be tracked based on the prioritization code (each reader acknowledges that it has scanned an object with that prioritization code) or by monitoring the specific EPC. In yet another embodiment, the central database <b>162</b>A is notified and sends out a broadcast to all readers indicating that all readers should be on the lookout for that particular EPC. In all instances the initial recognition of the object as an item of particular importance is made based on a prioritization code and with the requirement to access a database containing all of the EPC information.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which a building <b>1800</b> contains a warehouse area <b>1802</b> with an entrance and a dock tunnel reader <b>1804</b> that scans items labeled with RFID tags as they pass through the dock and into the warehouse area <b>1802</b>. A local database <b>1806</b> (local database <b>1</b>) is contained within the warehouse area <b>1802</b>. A set of readers <b>1808</b> creates an RFID curtain <b>1810</b> such that any object that leaves the warehouse area (which may be walled, fenced or open) is scanned. Towards the front of the building there is an exit tunnel reader <b>1812</b> that scans objects as they leave the building <b>1800</b>. A local database <b>1814</b> (local database <b>2</b>) and monitor/alarm system <b>1816</b> is also located towards the front of the building <b>1800</b>. As illustrated, local database <b>1</b> may be connected to a central database <b>1818</b> via a network <b>1820</b>. All of the readers within the building are interconnected via a wired or wireless network (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, items are scanned at the dock tunnel reader <b>1804</b> and, based on the presence of one or more prioritization codes, actions are taken to either inform or query the central database <b>1818</b> regarding the presence of the scanned items, simply register the presence of the items in local database <b>1</b> <b>1806</b>, or inform local database <b>2</b> <b>1814</b>, the monitor/alarm system <b>1816</b>, or other readers of the presence of the scanned items and alert those other systems to perform actions or report the detection of items in a prioritization group or an item with a particular EPC. In all instances, local decisions can be made based on codes associated with EPCs (such as prioritization groups that relate sets of EPCs), codes assigned with individual tags, or codes written into the particular tags. Because the decisions are made locally the system avoids the necessity of having to query an EPC database for each scanned item.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an RFID scanning system with local processing capability, similar to what could be found at an RFID enhanced cash register (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). A local computer <b>1900</b> contains an RFID processing module <b>1902</b> that is connected to a reader <b>1904</b> and to a CPU <b>1906</b> that is connected to memory <b>1908</b> and a local database <b>1910</b>. A register monitor <b>1912</b> is present as is a cash drawer <b>1914</b>, both of which are connected to the local computer <b>1900</b> to provide complete register functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in one embodiment RFID tags <b>1950</b> on items <b>1960</b> are scanned and the EPCs read to determine if there are items that fall within certain prioritization groups. This can be performed on the local computer <b>1900</b> through association of the EPCs with prioritization groups, and with completing lookups on each EPC. In another embodiment, prioritization codes are stored directly on the RFID tags, read by the reader <b>1904</b>, and processed by the local computer <b>1900</b> to determine what actions to take.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the event that the prioritization codes indicate that an RFID tagged item needs to be reported immediately, a visual alarm <b>1970</b> can be indicated on register monitor <b>1912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An example of an application of the present system is the use of the system to track prioritized items in the retail environment, such as a store. In this application tagged items are read by one or more readers, those readers working individually or in cooperation to determine which items should be reported to monitoring systems and external databases. In the retail environment, items of high value, perishable items, or dangerous items may be tracked preferentially and location and direction information with respect to those items processed and reported ahead of any other information related to other items. As a result, personnel involved in the monitoring of the store are alerted to specific items having particular importance rather than having to make decisions as to which items should be preferentially tracked.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Another application of the system is the use of the system to track prioritized items in transit. As an example, tagged items may be present in the form of containers holding cargo such as containers used in railroad or ocean shipping. Use of the present system allows tracking and reporting of specific containers that are marked, either in a database or within the tag on the container, as having a priority code that requires tracking for a particular reason. As such, those specific containers are reported preferentially, and personnel monitoring the items in transit see the particular items being tracked based on individual priority codes, combinations or priority codes, or combinations of priority codes with velocity or direction information. In one embodiment, historical location information can be used in combination with priority codes or velocity or direction information to determine that a specific item should be tracked. Similarly, livestock may be tracked with preferential tracking of livestock that have a particular history, likelihood of infection, or other characteristic that requires preferentially tracking.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The system can also be used to examine historical information including location history to both establish priority codes as well as to provide the basis for filtering of items to be reported. As an example, the location of items in a retail, warehouse, or transportation environment may be stored and subsequently analyzed to determine if a priority code is applicable. In one embodiment, items that have traveled from one store to another are marked as special inventory that should be tracked preferentially over other items. In another embodiment, items that have remained on the shelves for an extended period of time and been subsequently placed in the warehouse are marked with priority codes. These priority codes can be used by the system to indicate to store personnel that those items should be placed on sale and perhaps moved to the front of the store for inventory reduction. Alternatively, the priority codes may be used to indicate that those items should be, after a specified period of time, returned to the manufacturer. Use of the present system allows for the creation of groups of items with particular priorities and allows for preferential tracking and reporting of those items.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a particular set of categories or priorities that can be developed, a number of other categories and priorities can be developed based on manufacturer, item characteristics, item history, item location, associations of items (such as groups of items in a shopping cart). In addition, time dependent priorities can be established such that priority codes, in a database or recorded within the tag of an item, change dependent on the time or date. As an example, an item may be tagged as perishable with a expiration date of Jan. 11, 2005. If that tag is read subsequent to that date, the reader may indicate to a central database, or to the tag on the item itself, that the item is expired and generate a priority code indicating an expired item. That priority code can be used by a subsequent reader to note the expired item without the necessity of performing the calculation again and determining that the item is expired. In one embodiment a local reader simply notes that the item has a priority code indicating expiration and reports that to a cash register. In this embodiment no query to a central database is or additional calculation to determine expiration is required. In another embodiment an item in transit is assigned a priority code based on the amount of time it has been in transit. Readers reading that item notify one or more systems, based on the priority code, of their having read the item. The location or presence of the item is reported to personnel because of the association of that item with the priority group, without requiring access to another database associating the serial number of the item with a detailed history or set of rules. By assigning priority codes to the item based on parameters such as amount of time in transit, the item is rapidly identified by the system and brought to the attention of the personnel involved in monitoring the system</p>

The invention is intended to be protected broadly within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
