<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for collection and storage of the free, non-active, portion of a strap of a manually operated cargo tightener which is used to secure cargo to be transported.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The typical prior art cargo tightener, which is modified to make the present invention, includes a shaft provided at one end of a connecting link or arm. The shaft is journaled in one end of the connecting arm, thus providing for rotatable attachment of a lever to the connecting arm. A first, or short, strap is firmly secured to a bolt or pin in the other end of the connecting arm, and has at its free end, a hook or other device for attachment to a vehicle transporting the cargo.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second strap has a hook or other device at one of its ends. The hook is attached to the transportation vehicle. The other end, or free or non-active, end of the second strap is inserted through a slot in the rotatable shaft. A ratchet arrangement permits tightening of the strap by back and forth movement of the lever with respect to the connecting link. Because the connecting arm or link is held firmly in place by the first strap, the second strap tightens down over the cargo. The cargo tightener is conventional and, therefore, will not be described in any great detail except with regard to the modification of the lever to provide the strap collector portion of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common problem when using the above mentioned cargo tightener with tensioning straps concerns the handling of the free end of the strap not used when securing the cargo. This strap portion has to be thoroughly secured to the cargo in order not to flutter in the encountering wind, or to trail on the ground, both cases leading to a hasty soiling and wearing down of the strap. Further, a freely fluttering strap is a danger to traffic, particularly in connection with the wider 24 to 30 foot long straps used professionally by haulage contractors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many attempts to solve these problems are known in the prior art. US Patent Publication No. US 2004/0094650 A1 to Huang, shows a strap fastener system including a strap fastener for fastening a belt, and a winding device for winding the strap. The winding device includes a housing which is attached to a connecting arm portion of the typical prior art cargo tightener. A reel is put in the housing for winding the strap, and a torque spring is arranged between the reel and the control device for automatically rotating the reel in the non-rotational position of the control device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,520 to Söderström, shows a strap collector which is designed to be attached to the connecting arm of a standard cargo tightener. The strap collector includes a magazine for the protection and storage of the long tensioning strap of the cargo tightener when wound to the shaft of the strap collector.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,275 B1 to Lin, shows a strap tightener with an auto pulling device connected to a seat. The auto pulling device includes a housing and a reversing device. The reversing device is rotatably received in the housing. The housing would correspond to a connecting arm portion of a prior art cargo tightener.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,371 to Wyers, shows a strap tensioning and collection device having a variable length strap and a fixed length strap operatively associated with the strap storage section, and a strap tensioning section.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,721 to Smetz, et al. shows a device for connecting components to a belt.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">German Offenlegungsschrift DE 36 39 712 A1 to Kinnert, shows a tensioning ratchet, in particular for belts, which is equipped with a ratchet body having a retaining bolt for fastening a safety belt, and having a ratchet lever which is mounted at the other end of the ratchet body so as to be rotatable about the axle of a slotted roller for fastening the end of a tensioning belt to be wound thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">All of the above devices perform generally satisfactorily, but share the problem of relatively high costs and difficulty of manufacture. In addition, they are rather bulky. Thus, those skilled in the art continued their search for a better cargo tightener and strap collector.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The aim of the present invention is to provide a cargo tightener and strap collector which is more cost effective compared with prior art devices, is less bulky, and is easier to manufacture. This is accomplished by having the strap collector on the lever portion of the cargo tightener, rather than on the connecting arm segment, as in the prior art. The advantages of this will become apparent by a careful reading of the detailed description, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals designate like parts in the several views.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a prior art cargo tightener and strap collector, generally designed by the numeral <b>10</b>. The cargo tightener and strap collector <b>10</b> comprises a connecting arm or link <b>12</b>, and a lever or arm <b>14</b>. A strap <b>15</b> is provided with a hook <b>16</b> at one end thereof for connection to a transportation vehicle (not shown). The other end of strap <b>15</b> is firmly held to connecting arm <b>12</b> by pin <b>17</b>. Reciprocal motion of lever <b>14</b> using handle <b>18</b> will cause shaft <b>19</b> to rotate due to the ratchet and pawl assembly <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention relates to a modification of the lever or arm <b>14</b> to solve the problems of the prior art. For purposes of understanding, new reference numerals are used when referring to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the present invention relates to an improved cargo tightener and strap collector, generally designated by the numeral <b>20</b>. An improved apparatus for tightening and collecting a strap, or strap collector, or combination cargo tightener and strap collector <b>20</b>, includes a connecting arm or link <b>22</b> and a lever <b>24</b>. Connecting arm <b>22</b> extends in a longitudinal direction, and may be substantially similar to the connecting arm <b>12</b> shown in the prior art construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is a modification to the lever of the prior art construction, identified by the numeral <b>24</b>, which provides a novel cargo tightener and strap collector <b>20</b>. As with the prior art, there is provided a first shaft <b>26</b> journaled for rotation in one, or first, end <b>22</b>A of the connecting arm <b>22</b>. At the other, or second, end <b>22</b>B of the connecting arm <b>22</b> is provided a pin <b>23</b>, to which a first, or short, strap <b>25</b> is attached. A first hook or fastening means or fastening device <b>27</b> is attached to the other end of the strap <b>25</b>. In use, the hook <b>27</b> will be attached to the transportation vehicle on which the cargo being tightened is being transported.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As in the prior art devices, reciprocal rotation of the lever <b>24</b> will cause co-rotation of the first shaft <b>26</b>. Journals for first shaft <b>26</b>, as well as second shaft <b>40</b>, are provided by opposed apertures provided in a first pair of spaced apart sidewalls <b>36</b> provided in connecting arm <b>22</b>, and a second pair of spaced apart sidewalls <b>37</b> in the lever <b>24</b>. A second shaft <b>40</b> has provided therein second slot <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to accept a free end, i.e., the end without the second hook <b>54</b>, of a second belt <b>50</b>, as hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At least a first portion <b>40</b>A of shaft <b>40</b> may extend beyond at least one of the second pair of sidewalls <b>37</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) so that a knob <b>44</b> may be attached thereto for rotation of the second shaft <b>40</b>. In the preferred embodiment, a first portion and a second portion (<b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B) of the second shaft <b>40</b> will extend beyond the second pair of spaced apart sidewalls <b>37</b>, and a knob <b>44</b> will be attached to each portion of the second shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reciprocal rotation of the lever <b>24</b> will cause co-rotational rotation of the first shaft <b>26</b> by virtue of a pair of ratchet wheels <b>60</b> which are mounted on the first shaft <b>26</b> between the first pair of sidewalls <b>36</b> and the second pair of spaced apart sidewalls <b>37</b>. It is preferred that two ratchet wheels <b>60</b> be used, although one may possibly be used. Pawl <b>61</b> aides in the rotation of the first shaft <b>26</b> by operating on the ratchet wheel <b>60</b>. The pawl <b>61</b> is spring loaded and slides in a pair of opposed slots <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the second pair of opposed sidewalls <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Second, or long, strap <b>50</b> is provided having second hook <b>54</b> provided at one end thereof. The free or non-active end of strap <b>50</b>, so referred to because it has no connection to second hook <b>54</b>, is first passed through first slot <b>32</b> and then inserted in second slot <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Second shaft <b>40</b> is then rotated, with the aid of knobs <b>44</b>, to roll up free end of strap <b>50</b> into a roll <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, second hook <b>54</b> and second strap <b>50</b> are completely unrolled and removed from second shaft <b>40</b>. Second hook <b>54</b> is attached to the transportation vehicle on which the cargo is to be transported, at the appropriate location. The free end of the strap <b>50</b> is placed through first slot <b>32</b> in first shaft <b>26</b>, and the lever <b>24</b> is reciprocally rotated, causing co-rotational movement of the first shaft <b>26</b>. Since the first strap <b>50</b> is inserted in the first slot <b>32</b>, and the connecting arm <b>22</b> is restrained by the first strap <b>25</b> and the first hook <b>27</b>, the cargo tightener and strap collector <b>20</b> is tightened down on the cargo. At this point, the free end of the second strap <b>50</b> is inserted in the second slot <b>42</b> in the second shaft <b>40</b> and the knobs <b>44</b> are rotated to take up any slack in the strap before the cargo is transported.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternately, the free end of the strap of the second strap <b>50</b> may be left inserted in the second slot <b>42</b> in the second shaft <b>40</b>, and the second strap <b>50</b> along with second hook <b>54</b> may be pulled out, causing the roll <b>52</b> to unwind until the second hook <b>54</b> may be attached to the transportation vehicle in the appropriate spot. The lever <b>24</b> is then reciprocally rotated causing co-rotational movement of the first shaft <b>26</b>, and the tightening of the cargo tightener and strap collector <b>20</b> on the cargo (not shown) in the manner previously described. Any slack in the second strap <b>50</b> is taken up by rotating the knob or knobs <b>44</b> until the slack is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to provide clearance for the roll <b>52</b> so that it does not strike the cargo being transported, the lever <b>24</b> is provided with a first substantially linearly extending portion <b>70</b>, and a second linearly extending portion <b>71</b> extending at an angle with respect to the first portion <b>70</b>, thus elevating the roll <b>52</b> away from the cargo by elevating the second shaft <b>40</b> away from the cargo.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If it is desired to have the linearly and angularly extending portions <b>71</b> of the second pair of sidewalls <b>37</b> be further apart proximate the roll <b>52</b>, a pair of diverging portions <b>72</b> of the second pair of sidewalls <b>37</b> may be interposed between the first linearly extending portion <b>70</b> and the second linearly and angularly extending portion <b>71</b> of each of said second pair of sidewalls <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, by carefully considering the problems in the prior art devices, we have provided a novel cargo tightener and strap collector which is simpler in construction, easier to manufacturer and less costly than prior art devices.</p>
