<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the fabrication of three-dimensional objects using additive process modeling techniques. More particularly, the invention relates to modeling machines which form three-dimensional objects in a heated chamber by depositing modeling material from a dispensing head onto a modeling base as the dispensing head and the base are moved in three-dimensions with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Additive process modeling machines make three-dimensional models by building up a modeling medium, usually in planar layers, based upon design data provided from a computer aided design (CAD) system. A mathematical description of a physical part to be created is split into (usually) planar layers, and those layers are individually shaped and applied to produce the final part. Three-dimensional models are used for functions including aesthetic judgments, proofing the mathematical CAD model, forming hard tooling, studying interference and space allocation, and testing functionality. The dominant application of layered manufacturing in recent years has been for rapid prototyping.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of apparatus and methods for making three-dimensional models by depositing layers of flowable modeling material are described in Valavara U.S. Pat. No. 4,749,347; Crump U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,329, Batchelder, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,303,141, Crump U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,433, Batchelder, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,402,351, Crump et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,785, Abrams et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,913, Danforth, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,817, Batchelder, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,521 and Comb et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,008, all of which are assigned to Stratasys, Inc., the assignee of the present invention. An extrusion head extrudes heated, flowable modeling material from a nozzle onto a base. The base comprises a modeling substrate which is removably affixed to a modeling platform. The extruded material is deposited layer-by-layer in areas defined from the CAD model, as the extrusion head and the base are moved relative to each other in three dimensions by an x-y-z gantry system. The material solidifies after it is deposited to form a three-dimensional model. It is disclosed that a thermoplastic material may be used as the modeling material, and the material may be solidified after deposition by cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Technology described in the aforementioned patents is commercialized in Stratasys FDM® modeling machines. The extrusion head, which includes a liquifier and a dispensing nozzle, receives modeling material in a solid form. The filament is heated to a flowable temperature inside the liquifier and it is then dispensed through the nozzle. Thermoplastic materials, particularly ABS thermoplastic, have been found particularly suitable for deposition modeling in the Stratasys FDM® modeling machines. A controller controls movement of the extrusion head in a horizontal x, y plane, controls movement of the build platform in a vertical z-direction, and controls the feeding of modeling material into the head. By controlling these processing variables, the modeling material is deposited at a desired flow rate in “beads” or “roads” layer-by-layer in areas defined from the CAD model to create a three-dimensional object that resembles the CAD model. The modeling material thermally solidifies, and the finished model is removed from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a thermoplastic material cools, and particularly as it transitions from a flowable material to a solid, stresses caused by density changes of the thermoplastic (i.e., shrinkage) are generated in the material. These stresses can cause geometric distortion of a model. Accordingly, it is an objective in model building systems which employ thermal solidification to relieve the stresses caused by cooling, so as to minimize geometric distortion. Deposition materials other than thermoplastics, such as metals, thermoset polymers and composites share analogous challenges of minimizing geometric distortion produced by changes in density, shear, temperature and pressure associated with the extrusion process. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,058, building the model in a chamber heated to a temperature higher than the solidification temperature of the thermoplastic or other thermally solidifiable modeling material, followed by gradual cooling, relieves stresses from the material. The stresses are annealed out of the model while is being built so that the finished model is stress free and has very little distortion. As is further disclosed in the '058 patent, the temperature of the chamber should be maintained below the glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of the modeling material, so that the model does not become so weak that it droops. The preferred temperature of the build chamber is in a range between the material's solidification temperature and its creep relaxation temperature (creep relaxation temperature is defined as the point at which the stress relaxation modulus has dropped by a factor of ten from its low temperature limit). In the case of ABS thermoplastic, the temperature window falls between approximately 70° C. and 90° C.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Existing Stratasys FDM® machines build models in a chamber (also referred to as a build envelope or oven) heated to between 70° C. and 90° C. The base on which the model is built is located in the heated chamber, as are the extrusion head and the x-y-z gantry. Placing the extrusion head and the x-y-z gantry in this heated environment has many disadvantages. The x-y-z gantry is comprised of motion control components, such as motors, bearings, guide rods, belts and cables. Placing these motion control components inside the heated chamber minimizes the life of these components. Additionally, the upper limit on the chamber temperature is constricted to a temperature at which the motion control components are operable. Such a limitation on the temperature of the chamber consequently limits the materials useful for modeling in the machine to those which will stress relieve at a relatively low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Similarly, placing the extrusion head in the heated chamber in the Stratasys FDM® machines required that a cooling mechanism be provided to cool the modeling material feedstock as it is supplied to the head in solid form (either as a filament or a wafer of material). A mechanism for cooling wiring harnesses is also provided. In the event of a power failure or power down, the material feedstock and the wiring harnesses that are normally cooled are exposed to the oven temperature. Finally, as a practical matter, in the event that adjustment, servicing, repair, replacement or of the motion control components or of the extrusion head are required, an operator must work inside the chamber. As such, the chamber must be cooled before these activities can be safely performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is a method for three-dimensional modeling that builds up three-dimensional objects by depositing molten modeling material in a predetermined pattern into a heated build chamber, while maintaining thermal isolation of motion control components from the build chamber. Three-dimensional objects are formed by dispensing modeling material from an outlet of a dispensing head onto a base as the dispensing head and the base are moved in three-dimensions relative to one another in a predetermined pattern. The motion control components controlling the motion of the dispensing head and the base are physically and thermally isolated from the heated build chamber as the object is built.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are a number of advantages to thermally insulating motion control components from the build chamber. Because the temperature of the build chamber is not limited by the operating temperature of the motion control components, the method of the present invention permits building models from materials that stress relieve at a relatively high temperature. Further, the life of the motion control components is not negatively effected by the temperature of the build chamber. Thermal separation of motion control components from the build chamber also increases ease of use in the event that the user needs to access and touch these components. The increased life of motion control components in the modeling method of the present invention result in increased throughput and reliability.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method of the present invention builds three-dimensional objects in a heated chamber using a fused deposition process, wherein motion control components are isolated from the heated chamber so that the temperature in the heated chamber is not limited by the temperature limits of the motion control components. The method enables the building of objects from materials that have a high glass transition temperature and thus must be deposited into a high temperature chamber in order for a high quality model to result. These materials include high temperature thermoplastics, such as polycarbonate, polyetherimide, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, amorphous polyamides and others.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A preferred embodiment of the three-dimensional modeling apparatus that operates according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The apparatus <b>10</b> comprises an oven <b>12</b>, an extrusion head <b>14</b>, a platform <b>16</b>, an x-y gantry <b>18</b> which moves the extrusion head <b>14</b> in a horizontal x,y plane, a z-lift <b>20</b> which moves the platform <b>16</b> along a vertical z-axis, and a frame <b>22</b>. The oven <b>12</b> stands on legs <b>23</b> which are mounted inside of the frame <b>22</b>. The frame <b>22</b> lines the outer perimeter of the oven <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with portions broken away), and supports the oven <b>12</b>, the x-y gantry <b>18</b> and the z-lift <b>20</b> in a defined configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The platform <b>16</b> is contained in a heated build chamber <b>24</b> of oven <b>12</b>, beneath the extrusion head <b>14</b>. The apparatus <b>10</b> builds three-dimensional objects in build chamber <b>24</b> by depositing modeling material from extrusion head <b>14</b> onto the platform <b>16</b>, while the extrusion head <b>14</b> is moved in the x,y plane and the platform <b>16</b> is moved along the z-axis. To support an object as it is being built, the platform <b>16</b> must have an upper surface to which the modeling material will adhere. Preferably, a modeling substrate is mounted on top of the platform <b>16</b> upon which the object is built. Use of a modeling substrate allows for easy removal of the model from the apparatus after completion of the model. A modeling substrate selected for use in the present invention should be suitable for use in a high temperature environment. For example, the platform <b>16</b> may be a vacuum platen having a flexible sheet substrate removably mounted thereon, as is disclosed in Comb et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,008. The flexible sheet substrate adheres to the platform when a vacuum pump is turned on and is released from the platform when the pump is turned off. For adaptation to the high temperature environment of the present invention, a heat exchanger (e.g., an in-line heat exchanger coil) may be necessary to cool the air flowing into the vacuum pump. The material chosen for use as a flexible sheet substrate should be a material that will bond with the modeling material. In building a model made of a high temperature thermoplastic, a flexible sheet of high temperature thermoplastic is a preferred substrate. A model made of Ultem™ has been successfully built in a chamber heated to approximately 200° C., on a thin sheet of Ultem™ mounted on a vacuum platen.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The build chamber <b>24</b> of the oven <b>12</b> is accessible through an insulated oven door <b>25</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the build chamber <b>24</b> has a floor and right and left sides which are surrounded by a heating duct <b>26</b>. The heating duct <b>26</b> is formed of sheet metal and opens to the build chamber <b>24</b> at the top right and top left sides of the chamber <b>24</b>. A pair of blowers <b>28</b> (one shown), located underneath the oven <b>12</b> on the right hand side, create a clockwise air flow path through the heating duct <b>26</b>. Thus, the opening at the top right side of the chamber <b>24</b> is an air intake vent <b>30</b> and the opening at the top left side of the chamber <b>24</b> is an air exhaust vent <b>32</b>. Two identical banks of six 750 Watt fin-strip heaters <b>34</b> are mounted in the heating duct <b>26</b> on the air intake side thereof. A venturi <b>36</b> is positioned in the heating duct <b>26</b> to create a straight flow pattern of air returning to the build chamber <b>24</b> through the air exhaust vent <b>32</b>. The build chamber <b>24</b> is heated by convection as air is pulled through the heaters <b>34</b>, circulated through the duct <b>26</b>, and returned to the chamber. A sheaf of insulation <b>37</b> surrounds the right and left side, the bottom, and a back side of the oven <b>12</b> to keep in the heat (insulation <b>37</b> is removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for purposes of illustration). The build chamber <b>24</b> is designed to reach temperatures of at least 200° C. Preferably, a thermocouple and a thermal fuse are placed over the air intake vent <b>30</b> so that the temperature in the chamber <b>24</b> may be monitored, and, if the chamber <b>24</b> becomes too hot, the heaters <b>34</b> can be shut off.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The platform <b>16</b> is held up inside of the build chamber <b>24</b> by the z-lift <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The z-lift <b>20</b>, which is located external to the oven <b>12</b>, is formed of two of two identical I-sections <b>38</b>, a z-motor <b>40</b> and a timing belt <b>42</b>. The I-sections <b>38</b> are secured to the frame <b>22</b> in parallel on right and left sides of the oven <b>12</b>. The platform <b>16</b> is coupled to each I-section <b>38</b> of the z-lift <b>20</b> by a pair of rigid, horizontal beams <b>44</b> which support platform <b>16</b> in a horizontal plane. Each beam <b>44</b> extends through a vertical slit <b>46</b> in the oven <b>12</b>, allowing the z-lift <b>20</b> to move platform <b>16</b> vertically within the build chamber <b>24</b>. On each side of oven <b>12</b>, there is one slit <b>46</b> to the front of the heating duct <b>26</b> and another slit <b>46</b> to the rear of the heating duct <b>26</b>. The slits <b>46</b> are sealed with flexible strips of silicone to as to minimize heat transfer from the chamber <b>24</b> to the z-lift <b>20</b>. The beams <b>44</b> are made of a low conductivity metal such as stainless steel, and are drilled with many holes to further decrease the heat transfer from the chamber <b>24</b> to the z-lift <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each I-section <b>38</b> is comprised of a vertical plate <b>48</b> to which one pair of the beams <b>44</b> connect, a lead nut <b>50</b> mounted on the vertical plate <b>48</b>, and a vertical lead screw <b>52</b> on which the lead nut <b>50</b> rides up and down. The lead screw <b>52</b> connects to the underside of a horizontal upper plate <b>54</b> at its top end, extends through a horizontal lower plate <b>56</b> near its bottom end, and couples to a pulley <b>58</b> at its bottom end. The lead screw <b>52</b> rotates with rotation of the pulley <b>58</b>. The pulleys <b>58</b> of each I-section <b>38</b> are coupled to each other by the timing belt <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pulley <b>58</b> of the right-hand I-section <b>38</b> is driven by the z-motor <b>40</b>, which is preferably a servo motor. The z-motor <b>40</b> can selectively drive the pulley <b>58</b> in either a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction. The timing belt <b>42</b> synchronizes movement of the two pulleys <b>58</b>. The synchronous rotation of the pulleys <b>58</b> effects synchronous rotation of the lead screws <b>52</b>. As the lead screws <b>52</b> rotate, the lead nuts <b>50</b> move either up or down, causing each vertical plate <b>48</b> to be either raised or lowered, depending upon the direction of the pulley rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Two pairs of linear guide bearings <b>60</b> are coupled to each vertical plate <b>48</b>, on opposite sides of the lead nut <b>50</b>. Each pair of guide bearings <b>60</b> has an associated guide rail <b>62</b>, which extends through each the guide bearings <b>60</b> in parallel with the lead screw <b>52</b>. The top of each guide rail <b>62</b> connects to the underside of upper plate <b>54</b>, and the bottom of each guide rail <b>62</b> connects to the top of lower plate <b>56</b>. The guide bearings <b>60</b> rides along the guide rails <b>62</b>, providing lateral support for the vertical plate <b>48</b> as it travels up and down. Pairs of brackets <b>63</b> connected to the upper plate <b>54</b> and to the lower plate <b>56</b> of each I-section <b>38</b> mount the I-sections <b>38</b> to the frame <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The extrusion head <b>14</b> is moved in an x,y plane above the platform <b>16</b> by the x-y gantry <b>18</b>, which is mounted on top of the oven <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the extrusion head <b>14</b> has an inlet <b>61</b> for receiving modeling material and an outlet nozzle <b>66</b> for dispensing the modeling material onto the platform <b>16</b> in a flowable state. The nozzle outlet <b>66</b> will typically be heated so as to deposit the modeling material at a predetermined temperature. The extrusion head nozzle <b>66</b> is located inside of the build chamber <b>24</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the extrusion head inlet <b>61</b> is located external to the build chamber <b>24</b>. Hence, the extrusion head <b>14</b> extends through the top of the oven <b>12</b>. Because the extrusion head <b>14</b> of the preferred embodiment must be allowed to move in the x,y plane, the top of the oven <b>12</b> is formed of a deformable thermal insulator, which is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The x-y gantry <b>18</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The x-y gantry <b>18</b> comprises a base. Plate <b>64</b>, a bridge <b>65</b>, a pair of x-rails <b>68</b>, a pair of y-rails <b>70</b>, a carriage <b>72</b>, an x-motor <b>74</b>, a y-motor <b>76</b>, an x-drive belt <b>78</b>, a y-drive belt <b>80</b> and various pulleys. The base plate <b>64</b>, which has an open center, sits on top of the upper plates <b>54</b> of the z-lift <b>20</b> and is secured to the frame <b>22</b>. The bridge <b>65</b> has an open center and extends across base plate <b>64</b> in the y-direction. The x-rails <b>68</b> are mounted on top of base plate <b>64</b> beneath forward and rearward ends of the bridge <b>65</b>, and extend along the base plate <b>64</b> in the x-direction. The bridge <b>65</b> is coupled to the rails <b>68</b> by two pairs of bearings <b>82</b>. One pair of the bearings <b>82</b> are mounted to the underside of the forward end of the bridge <b>65</b>, and the other pair of bearings <b>82</b> are mounted to the underside of the rearward end of bridge <b>65</b>. Bearings <b>82</b> permit movement of the bridge <b>65</b> along the x-rails <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The y-rails <b>70</b> are mounted to the underside of the bridge <b>65</b> on opposite sides of the open center portion thereof. The y-rails <b>70</b> run parallel to each other in the y-direction. The carriage <b>72</b> is coupled to the y-rails <b>70</b> by two opposed pairs of bearings <b>84</b>. The carriage <b>72</b>, seated on the y-rails <b>70</b>, is positioned in the open center portion of the bridge <b>65</b>. The extrusion head <b>14</b> is mounted to the carriage <b>72</b>, <b>50</b> that movement of the carriage <b>72</b> along the y-rails <b>70</b> moves the extrusion head <b>14</b> in the y-direction. The extrusion head <b>14</b> is mounted in the carriage <b>72</b> such that the extrusion head inlet <b>61</b> is above the bridge <b>65</b> and the extrusion head nozzle <b>66</b> is below the bridge <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The x-motor <b>74</b>, via x-belt <b>78</b> and several pulleys, moves the bridge <b>65</b> back and forth along the x-rails <b>68</b>, to effect movement of the extrusion head <b>14</b> in the x-direction. The y-motor <b>76</b>, via y-belt <b>80</b> and several pulleys, moves the carriage <b>72</b> along the y-rails <b>70</b> to effect movement of the extrusion head <b>14</b> in the y-direction. This system is known as an H-bridge gantry.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A schematic representation of the x-axis drive system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown, x-belt <b>78</b> is driven by the x-motor <b>74</b> by rotation of a drive pulley <b>86</b>. The x-belt <b>78</b> is secured at a tie-down <b>88</b>, sequentially wraps around pulleys <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, and is then secured again at a tie-down <b>104</b>. Pulleys <b>90</b>, <b>96</b> and <b>102</b> are mounted on the bridge <b>65</b>, while pulleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>98</b> and <b>100</b> are mounted on the base plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The y-axis drive system is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The y-belt <b>80</b> is driven by the y-motor <b>76</b> by rotation of a drive pulley <b>106</b>. The y-belt <b>80</b> is secured at a tie-down <b>108</b>, wraps in sequence around pulleys <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, and is then secured again at a tie-down <b>126</b>. Pulleys <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> are mounted to the bridge <b>65</b>, pulleys <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are mounted to the base plate <b>64</b>, and pulleys <b>122</b> and <b>112</b> are mounted to the carriage <b>72</b>. The pulleys <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> share the same axis of rotation as pulleys <b>90</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>96</b>, respectively, of the x-axis drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the x-motor <b>74</b> and the y-motor <b>76</b> are servo motors. In the preferred embodiment, both motors are stationary to reduce the weight of moving components, thus resulting in the fairly extensive belt routing configuration. The tension in the x-belt <b>78</b> may be adjusted by adjustment at the tie-downs <b>88</b> and <b>104</b>. The tension in the y-belt <b>80</b> may be adjusted by adjustment at the tie-downs <b>108</b> and <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The motion control components of the x-y gantry <b>18</b> are located external to and are insulated from the build chamber <b>24</b> by a deformable thermal insulator comprising two sets of insulating accordion-folding baffles, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. An x-baffle tray <b>130</b>, having an open center, is attached to and lines the interior perimeter of the base plate <b>64</b> to support a set of x-baffles <b>132</b>. The x-baffles <b>132</b> extend from the base plate <b>64</b> to the bridge <b>65</b>, on both the right and left sides of the bridge <b>65</b>. A y-baffle tray <b>134</b>, also having an open center, sits beneath and is attached to the underside of the bridge <b>65</b> to support a set of y-baffles <b>136</b>. The set of y-baffles <b>136</b> extend from the base plate <b>64</b> to the extrusion head <b>14</b>, on both the front and back side of the extrusion head. The x-baffles <b>132</b> are secured to the bridge <b>65</b> by attachment to the y-baffle tray <b>134</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sets of baffles <b>132</b> and <b>136</b> are removed in part, so as to show the trays <b>130</b> and <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The x-baffles <b>132</b> supported by tray <b>130</b> and the y-baffles <b>136</b> supported by tray <b>134</b> form a deformable, insulating ceiling of the build chamber <b>24</b>. The x-baffles <b>132</b> compress and expand with the movement of the bridge <b>65</b> back and forth along the x-rails <b>68</b>. The y-baffles <b>136</b> compress and expand with the movement of the carriage <b>72</b> along the y-rails <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the preferred embodiment, the two sets of baffles <b>132</b> and <b>136</b> are made out of a high temperature cloth material, such as Teflon™ coated fiberglass. The baffles are sewn with octagonal cross-sections so as to allow expansion and contraction and to insulate the x-y gantry <b>18</b> from the heat in the build chamber <b>24</b>. Other baffle configurations are known in the art and could be used instead of the coated cloth. For example, the baffles could be welded out of thin stainless steel sheet or the baffles could be formed by sliding plates on plates. Optionally, a fan may be mounted over the x-gantry <b>18</b> so as to dissipate any heat that does escape from the build chamber <b>24</b>, keeping the x-y gantry <b>18</b> at ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The apparatus <b>10</b> builds three-dimensional objects by depositing modeling material layer-by-layer from the extrusion head <b>14</b> onto the platform <b>16</b> under the control of a controller <b>140</b>. The material is deposited in a fluent state and fuses to the previously deposited material. The controller <b>140</b> receives CAD data <b>142</b> defining an object to be built and generates drive signals based upon this data, in a known manner, as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The drive signals are sent to the x-motor <b>74</b>, the y-motor <b>76</b> and the z-motor <b>40</b>, to control movement of the extrusion head <b>14</b> and platform <b>16</b>. Also as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in synchrony with controlling movement of the extrusion head <b>14</b> and the platform <b>16</b>, the controller <b>140</b> generates drive signals to control an extrusion pump <b>144</b>. The extrusion pump <b>144</b> responsively feeds modeling material from a material supply <b>146</b> to the inlet <b>61</b> of extrusion head <b>14</b>, and controls the rate of extrusion of the material from the nozzle <b>66</b>. By controlling the rate of extrusion while moving the extrusion head <b>14</b> over the platform <b>16</b> in a pattern determined by the CAD data, a three-dimensional object which resembles a CAD model is created.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In building an object, the platform <b>16</b> is initially placed in a raised position, in close proximity to the nozzle <b>66</b> of extrusion head <b>14</b>. Deposition of the material may then take place by depositing successive horizontal layers of modeling material while incrementally lowering the platform <b>16</b> following the formation of each layer. Or, the layers can be formed in a vertical plane or in a plane oriented at any angle with respect to horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Those skilled in the art will recognize that enumerable modifications may be made to the deposition forming process to be carried out by the apparatus of the present invention and to the described embodiment of the apparatus. As an alternative to the gantry arrangement of the preferred embodiment, wherein the extrusion head <b>14</b> is moved in the x-y plane while the platform <b>16</b> is moved along the z-axis, the platform <b>16</b> may be supported for movement in an x-y plane with the extrusion head <b>14</b> mounted for movement along the z-axis towards and away from the platform <b>16</b>. In such a case, the deformable thermal insulator would form a portion of the build chamber through which the gantry moves the platform. It will also be appreciated that movement in the x-y plane need not be limited to movement in orthogonal directions, but may include movement in radial, tangential, arcuate and other directions in the x-y plane. Likewise, in place of the x-y gantry <b>18</b> and the z-lift <b>20</b>, an x-y-z gantry may take the form of any of the mechanical drive systems well known in the art, which are controllable by drive signals generated from a controller. In place of the x-baffles <b>132</b> and the y-baffles <b>136</b>, any deformable thermal insulator may be used that is compatible with the build environment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a further alternative, it should be understood that the present invention may be practiced with advantage in an arrangement wherein the x-y gantry <b>18</b> is outside of and insulated from the build chamber <b>24</b> but the z-lift <b>20</b> is inside the chamber <b>24</b>. Where modeling material is deposited in layers from an extrusion head moved in an x-y plane by the gantry <b>18</b> as in the disclosed embodiment, movement in the x-y plane far exceeds movement of the base along the z-axis. So, the z-lift need not have the speed nor precision of the x-y gantry. In such a case, the x-y gantry may be considerably more costly than the z-lift, making replacement of the motion control components of the z-lift more feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that any movable head having at least one outlet for dispensing fluent modeling material may be used in carrying out the deposition process of the present invention, provided that the head can be controlled to dispense fluent material in a geometry determined by control signals. Such apparatus may include, for example, conventional piston or plunger types of dispensing mechanisms, or highly controllable screw-type feeders such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,312,224.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Likewise, various forms of material feedstock may be used for the material supply <b>146</b>. The modeling material may for example be supplied in solid form as a continuous flexible filament wound on a supply reel or as a solid rods of limited length, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,121,329. The modeling material may alternatively be supplied in the form of wafers, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,521, or the material may be pumped in liquid form from a reservoir, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,749,347. Regardless of the form in which the feed stock material is supplied to the dispensing head, the material supply pump must be controllable so that the dispensing rate of the material can be controlled accurately to form the three-dimensional object. The pump must be matched to the feedstock type and to the dispensing head.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The deposition process may be arranged so that multiple and different feedstock materials can be dispensed. In creating three-dimensional objects by depositing layers of solidifiable material, supporting layers or structures are generally needed underneath any overhanging portions of an object, or in cavities of an object under construction, which are not directly supported by the modeling material itself. It is well-known in the art that a support material may be deposited in coordination with deposition of the modeling material to form these supporting structures or layers. In the practice of the present invention, a support structure may be built utilizing the same deposition techniques and apparatus by which the modeling material is deposited. Support material can be deposited either from a separate extrusion head within the modeling apparatus, or by the same extrusion head that deposits modeling material. More specifically, the apparatus <b>10</b> may accommodate the dispensing of the two materials by: (1) providing two dispensing heads each held by a carriage, one supplied with modeling material and one supplied with support material; (2) providing a single dispensing head supplied with both the modeling material and support material, with a single nozzle for dispensing both materials (such as shown in FIG. 6 of the '329 patent); or (3) providing a single dispensing head supplied with both materials, with each material dispensed through a separate nozzle (such as shown in FIG. 6 of the '785 patent). Similarly, the apparatus may be designed to dispense two different modeling materials to form a multi-phase article or multi-colored article as well.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When modeling with a material that absorbs moisture at a fast rate (as many high temperature thermoplastics do), the material supply <b>146</b> should be protected from moisture. If moisture is absorbed by the modeling material, model quality can be impaired. For example, in modeling with Ultem™, a moisture content of greater than 0.05 percent has been found to impair model quality. A suitable dry environment can be achieved by active drying of the material supply <b>146</b>. Or, the build environment could be depleted of oxygen and filled instead with another gas or gas mixture, eliminating the need for active drying.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the embodiment shown, an air deflection duct <b>150</b> is mounted on the extrusion head <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to prevent a hot spot from developing in the area of the nozzle <b>66</b>. When forming a part that calls for only small movements of the extrusion head <b>14</b>, heat radiated from the extrusion head <b>14</b> will tend to stagnate and create a hot spot at the nozzle <b>66</b>. If a hot spot develops, the temperature of the extruded material surrounding the hot spot will increase. If the extruded material approaches its glass transition temperature, the material will deform and poor part quality will result. In prior art systems, which have a build chamber heated to between 70° C. and 90° C., ambient air has been blown into the chamber to avoid development of a hot spot in the area of the nozzle. In a high temperature build environment, ambient temperature air would cool the extruded material too abruptly, causing curl stresses and resulting in geometric distortion of the object being built.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The air deflector <b>150</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, uses air flow within the build chamber <b>24</b> to cool the nozzle area. As shown, the air deflector <b>150</b> has a nose <b>152</b> facing the air exhaust vent <b>32</b>. Above the nose <b>152</b> is a pair of vanes <b>154</b>, that split air flowing from the exhaust vent <b>32</b> into two streams. The air streams flow into two ducts <b>156</b>, located on either side of the nose <b>152</b>. The air ducts <b>156</b> angle downward and then inward towards one another, so that the airflow from both ducts is directed towards the nozzle <b>66</b>. Air ducts <b>156</b> each have a forward vane <b>159</b> and a rearward vane <b>160</b> which further divide the airflow into three channels within each duct <b>156</b>. The channels assure fairly even distribution of air flow to the nozzle area. It is not necessary, however, that the air ducts <b>156</b> be subdivided into multiple channels. Rather, any means of deflecting air flow to the nozzle area can be used with advantage in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In building a model by deposition from an extruder, modeling material can accumulate on the nozzle and can eventually clog the nozzle. High temperature thermoplastics are particularly prone to build up, as they tend to be sticky. Accordingly, the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a nozzle cleaning assembly <b>170</b> for removing modeling material built upon the nozzle <b>66</b>. The nozzle cleaning assembly <b>170</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is mounted near the top of the build chamber <b>24</b> on the right hand side thereof. Beneath the nozzle cleaning assembly is a waste chute <b>172</b> for catching loose modeling material. The waste chute <b>172</b> narrows and travels between the heating duct <b>26</b> and the vertical slits <b>46</b>, to exit through the bottom of the oven <b>12</b>. The assembly <b>170</b> includes two cleaners <b>174</b> mounted side-by-side in counter-rotating shafts <b>176</b> driven by a motor <b>178</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in response to control signals from the controller <b>140</b>. The motor <b>178</b> is mounted external to the oven <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown, each cleaner <b>174</b> is formed of a brush <b>180</b> and two cris-crossed flexible paddles <b>182</b>, spaced apart and centered on a shaft <b>184</b>. Steel is a preferred material for the brushes <b>180</b> and silicone is a preferred material for the paddles <b>182</b>. In use, the extrusion head nozzle <b>66</b> is cleaned by the nozzle cleaning assembly <b>170</b> by driving the nozzle <b>66</b> back and forth between the cleaners <b>174</b>, while the cleaners <b>174</b> are driven so as to impart a downward force against the nozzles. A rotational speed of 550 rpm is effective. The paddles <b>182</b> dislodge material from the nozzle <b>66</b>, and the brushes <b>180</b> brush the material off of the nozzle <b>66</b>. The loose material then drops into the waste chute <b>172</b>. Preferably, a waste receptacle is placed under the exit of the waste chute <b>172</b>. The cleaners <b>174</b> are removable from shafts <b>176</b>, for cleaning or replacement. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many varieties of the nozzle cleaners <b>174</b> are possible, so long as the cleaners will remove material from the nozzle <b>66</b> when rotated against it.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the present invention is not limited to use in extrusion-based deposition modeling systems of the preferred embodiment described herein. Other additive process manufacturing techniques which form three-dimensional objects in a heated chamber can benefit from the present invention, such as systems that build three-dimensional objects by jetting droplets of solidifiable material, by consumable rod arc welding or by plasma spraying.</p>
