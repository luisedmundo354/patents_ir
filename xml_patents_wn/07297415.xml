<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a polymeric fluorescent substance and a polymer light emitting device (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “polymer LED”) using the polymeric fluorescent substance produced by the method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An inorganic electroluminescence device (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “inorganic EL device”) using an inorganic fluorescent substance as a light emitting material has been used, for example, in a display device such as a sheet-shaped light source as a backlight or a flat panel display. However, an inorganic electroluminescence device needs a high voltage alternating current for light emitting.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, an organic electroluminescence device (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “organic EL device”) has been reported which has a two-layered structure in which an organic fluorescent dye as a light emitting layer and an organic charge transport compound that is used in a photosensitizer of electrophotography are laminated on one another (JP-A-59-194393). A lot of attempts to use the organic EL device for device structures, organic fluorescent dyes and organic charge transport compounds have been reported because the organic EL device has the feature that it can easily provide light emissions of many colors in addition to the features of low voltage drive and high luminance in comparison with the inorganic EL device (Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 27, page L269 (1988)), (J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 65, page 3610 (1989)).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, apart from the organic EL device that mainly uses a low molecular weight organic compound, WO9013148, JP-A-3-244630, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 58, page 1982 (1991) or the like propose a polymer LED that uses a high molecular weight light emitting material. WO9013148 describes that a poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “PPV”) thin film that can be obtained by forming a film of a soluble precursor on an electrode followed by heat treatment to convert it into a conjugated polymer and a device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, JP-A-3-244630 describes a conjugated polymer characterized in that the polymer itself is soluble in a solvent and requires no heat treatment. Further, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 58, page 1982 (1991) describes a polymer light emitting material soluble in a solvent and a polymer LED produced by using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the polymer LED, a film of an organic layer can be easily formed by coating. Therefore, in comparison with the case of depositing a low molecular weight fluorescent substance, the polymer LED can be advantageously produced in a large size with a low cost. Since the polymer LED is a polymer, it is considered excellent in mechanical strength of a film.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the polymeric fluorescent substance to be used in these polymer LED, besides the above poly(p-phenylene vinylene), polyfluorene (Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 30, page L1941 (1991), a polyparaphenylene derivative (Adv. Mater., Vol. 4, page 36 (1992) have been heretofore reported.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a method for producing a polymeric fluorescent substance that can provide a polymer LED with longer life has been demanded.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0032">Further, the method for producing the polymeric fluorescent substance of the present invention may include a step other than the step of treating with an acid, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">Examples of the step other than the step of treating with an acid include: a step of removing the acid; when using a solvent, a step of removing the solvent; when using a solvent for separating phases, the step of separating the phases of the solution; and the step of purification by reprecipitation, chromatography or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">Among them, it is preferable to include the step of removing an acid and the step of purification, because the steps remove unnecessary products.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">The method of the above 1) will be described below in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">In the method of 1), the step of treating the starting polymeric fluorescent substance with an acid is preferably the step of bringing the solution of the acid into contact with the solution of the polymeric fluorescent substance in a solvent because of the high efficiency of treatment. The solvent to be used for the solution of the acid may be water or other solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">Meanwhile, the solvent that separates the phase of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in a liquid state from the phase of the acid in a liquid state can easily separate the polymeric fluorescent substance from the acid. Therefore such a solvent is more preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">For the method for separating the phase containing the starting polymeric fluorescent substance from the phase containing the acid, both dissolved in a solvent in liquid states, it is preferred that the acid is dissolved in water to make an aqueous solution, and the starting polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved in a solvent that separates from the phase of the aqueous solution of the acid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">The concentration of the aqueous solution of the acid is not particularly limited but adjusted to about 0.1 to 30 wt %. When the acidity of the aqueous solution of the acid is too high, the polymeric fluorescent substance to be treated is expected to decompose, hence the aqueous solution of the acid has a pH of preferably not less than 0.1 to not more than 5.5 and more preferably not less than 0.5 to not more than 4.5. Water to be used here is preferably water containing only a small amount of impurities such as ions. For example, distilled water, ion exchange water, pure water and extrapure water are preferred. Among them, pure water and extrapure water are preferable, and extrapure water is particularly preferred. A specific index of purity of the pure water is an electrical conductivity, and water of an electrical conductivity of 10 μS/cm or less is preferable and more preferably 1 μS/cm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">The solvent that dissolves the polymeric fluorescent substance may be any solvent that dissolves the polymeric fluorescent substance well. The examples include a chlorine-containing solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride and dichloroethane; an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran; and an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, xylene, mesitylene, tetralin, decalin, n-butylbenzene, but not particularly limited thereto. Among them, the solvents that separate from the phase of the solution of the acid (or water) are preferred. Chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and toluene are particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">The temperature for the treatment with the acid is not particularly limited. It is possible to conduct the treatment at room temperature to a temperature lower than the boiling point of the solvent. Temperatures between room temperature to 50° C. are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">Next, the following is the specific description of one example of the methods for bringing the aqueous solution of the acid into contact with the solution of the polymeric fluorescent substance in the solvent that separates from the phase of the aqueous solution of the acid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">First, the starting polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved in a solvent that well dissolves the polymeric fluorescent substance and separates from the phase of the aqueous solution of the acid (or water), for example, in chloroform, and then the solution is brought into contact with the solution of the acid while stirring for example (step of treating with an acid). After allowed to stand still, the phase of the solution of the acid is separated from the phase that contains the polymeric fluorescent substance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">The phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance that was obtained by separating the phases of the solution is further brought into contact with the aqueous solution of the acid. The step of treating with an acid is repeated for an adequate number of times.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">Then, the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance that was obtained by separating the phases of the solution was brought into contact with water to remove the acid remaining in the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance. By repeating the removal of the acid in the phase containing the polymeric fluorescent substance until the pH of the aqueous phase becomes 7, a solution of the polymeric fluorescent substance is obtained. The solution is added dropwise into a poor solvent for the polymeric fluorescent substance such as methanol, while stirring, to produce the precipitate of the polymeric fluorescent substance. The precipitate is filtered, washed with ethanol and then dried under a reduced pressure to obtain the polymeric fluorescent substance.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">Examples of method 2) include a method comprising mixing a liquid acid with a solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance without using a solvent and then treating by washing operation of stirring repulp type; and a method comprising dissolving the acid in an organic solvent and mixing it with a solid powder of the polymeric fluorescent substance and treating by washing operation of stirring repulp type. When using a solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in the present method, the acid or other unnecessary ingredients can be removed from the solid powder of the starting polymeric fluorescent substance by treating with the acid followed by filtration. Further, the acid remaining in the polymeric fluorescent substance can be removed with an organic solvent or water by washing operation of the stirring repulp type.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">Examples of method 3) include a method in which the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in a liquid state is treated by passing through a column filled with the acid in a solid state.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">Methods 4) and 5) are performed by bringing the gaseous acid into contact with the starting polymeric fluorescent substance in a liquid or solid state, where the gaseous acid means an organic or inorganic gaseous acid that is acidic. Specifically, it means hydrogen chloride gas, hydrogen bromide gas, hydrogen fluoride gas, gaseous formic acid, gaseous oxalic acid, gaseous trifluoroacetic acid or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">In the above step of treating with an acid, the amounts of the followings contained in the starting polymeric fluorescent substance material are preferably reduced: a metal such as, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, manganese, aluminum, zinc, nickel, chromium and lead; and a basic ingredient such as, for example, potassium tert-butoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">Next, the step of treating with an alkali will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">In the production method of the present invention, a good solvent for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is preferably used because it is preferable for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance to be sufficiently dissolved in order to be uniformly treated with the alkali.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">The organic solvent may be any solvent that can dissolve the crude polymeric fluorescent substance without particular limitation. However, examples of good solvents for the crude polymeric fluorescent substance include chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, tetralin, decalin, n-butylbenzene, and dioxane. Typically 0.1 wt % or more crude polymeric fluorescent substances can be dissolved in these solvents, but it depends on the structure or molecular weight of the crude polymeric fluorescent substances.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">The alkali to be used in the production method of the present invention preferably has a pKa value of 10 or more.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">Examples of the alkali include a metal alkoxide, a metal hydroxide, a metal amide compound, a metal hydride compound, ammonia and an amine.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">Examples of the metal alkoxide include LiOCH<sub>3</sub>, NaOCH<sub>3</sub>, KOCH<sub>3</sub>, LiOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, NaOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, KOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, LiO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>), NaO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>) and KO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>). Examples of the metal hydroxide include LiOH, NaOH and KOH. Examples of the metal amide compound include LiNH<sub>2</sub>, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, KNH<sub>2</sub>, LiN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>and KN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Examples of the metal hydride compound include LiH, NaH and KH. Examples of the amine include triethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and diazabicycloundecane.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Among the above, LiO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>), NaO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>), KO(t-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>), LiN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, KN(i-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, ammonia and amines are preferable with respect to the solubility to an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">Further, ammonia and triethylamine are more preferable because they enhance fluorescent intensity. Ammonia is particularly preferable because it has a high volatility and is unlikely to remain after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">The method for producing the polymeric fluorescent substance of the present invention comprises the step of bringing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance into contact with the alkali. This step may be repeated twice or more. In the step of bringing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance into contact with the alkali, it is preferable to contact the crude polymeric fluorescent substance dissolved in an organic solvent with the alkali with respect to the contact efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Examples of the method for bringing into contact with an alkali include (a) a method in which the alkali is just added as it is to a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance; (b) a method in which a solution of an alkali in a solvent is added to a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance; (c) a method in which a solution of a crude polymeric fluorescent substance is added to a solution of an alkali; and (d) a method in which a crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dispersed in a solvent in which an alkali is dissolved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">In methods (b) and (c), the solvent in which the alkali is to be dissolved may be an organic solvent or water. When the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved in an organic solvent, the solvent in which the alkali is to be dissolved may be a solvent homogeneously mixed or unmixed with the organic solvent in which the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved. Among organic solvents, preferred is the same organic solvent as that in which the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is dissolved.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">In the step of bringing into contact with the alkali, contact efficiency between the alkali and the polymeric fluorescent substance may be improved by stirring and shaking the solution, for example, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">In order to obtain a sufficient solubility improving effect, the time for bringing into contact with the alkali is usually not less than 30 minutes to not more than 20 hours, preferably not less than 1 hour to not more than 20 hours, but not particularly limited thereto. Further, the temperature for bringing into contact with the alkali is usually not less than 10° C. to not more than 200° C., preferably not less than room temperature to less than the boiling point of a solvent. The temperature is practically and more preferably not less than 30° C. to not more than 150° C., further preferably not less than 50° C. to not more than 100° C., depending on the solvent to be used. However, when using a highly volatile alkali such as ammonia, it is preferable to treat around room temperature. During the treatment, in order to inhibit the deterioration of the polymeric fluorescent substance, it is preferable to seal in an inert atmosphere and to shield from light having a wavelength absorbable by the polymeric fluorescent substance solution.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">In the present invention, the step of bringing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance into contact with the alkali may be performed continuously with the step of synthesizing the crude polymeric fluorescent substance without separating the two steps. For example, there is a method in which a solution of the crude polymeric fluorescent substance is brought into contact with the alkali without separation of the fluorescent substance as a precipitate. The present production method may comprise other steps such as neutralization, washing, reprecipitation, drying, as required, after bringing into contact with the alkali.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">After the above step of bringing into contact with the alkali, the step for removing the alkali from the polymeric fluorescent substance is preferably provided. The alkali may be removed by sufficiently washing after neutralization treatment or by sufficiently washing with a solvent excellent in dissolving the alkali.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065">The alkali may be removed by once dissolving the polymeric fluorescent substance obtained by bringing into contact with the alkali in a good solvent and then reprecipitating it in a poor solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">A highly volatile alkali such as ammonia may be removed only by drying under a reduced pressure or only by heating in an inert atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">The step of treating with a substance that does not contain an acid or an alkali will be described below in detail.</p>

Moreover, examples of method for obtaining patterned light emission include: a method of arranging a mask provided with patterned window(s) on the surface of the above sheet-shaped light emitting device; a method for forming an organic layer of the non-light emitting part thick to make itself substantially not light emissible; and a method for forming either an anode or a cathode or both of them in patterned forms. A segment type display device that can display numerals, letters, simple symbols and the like can be obtained by forming patterns by any of these methods and arranging some electrodes so that they can be independently turned ON/OFF. Further, a dot matrix device can be obtained by forming both an anode and a cathode in stripe and arranging them orthogonally. A partial color display and a multicolor display can be obtained by partially arranging plural kinds of polymeric fluorescent substances that emit light in different colors or by using a color filter or a fluorescence conversion filter. The dot matrix device can be driven by a passive drive or active drive in combination with TFT and the like. These display devices can be used as a display device such as a computer, a television, a mobile terminal, a mobile phone, a car navigator and a viewfinder of a video camera.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0222">Moreover, the above sheet-shaped light emitting device is of a thin self-emission type and can be preferably used as a sheet-shaped light source for a backlight of a liquid crystal display device or as a sheet-shaped light source for illumination. When using a flexible substrate, it can also be used as a curved light source or display device.</p>

<p id="p-0195" num="0231">A suspension of poly(3,4)ethylenedioxythiophene/polystyrenesulfonic acid (from Bayer A G, Bytron P TP AI 4083) was filtered through a 0.5 μm membrane filter and made into a film of a thickness of 70 nm by spin coating onto a glass substrate having an ITO film of a thickness of 150 nm formed thereon by a sputtering method. The film was dried in a vacuum oven at 120° C. for 1 hour. Then, a light emitting layer of a thickness of 70 nm was formed by spin coating of a 0.4 wt % solution of polymeric fluorescent substance (2) in chloroform. After further drying this film at 80° C. under a reduced pressure for 1 hour, a polymer LED device was produced by depositing about 0.4 nm equivalent of lithium fluoride, 40 nm of calcium and then 70 nm of aluminum as a cathode. All the degrees of vacuum at the time of the deposition were 8×10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr or less. When a voltage of 3.0 V was applied to the resultant device, a current with a current density of 2.5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>flew and yellow EL light emission with a luminance of 320 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>was observed. The luminous efficiency at this time was 13 cd/A, and the light emission spectrum of the device had a peak at 548 nm. After aging the device under a nitrogen stream for 1 hour, the device was continuously driven with a constant current of 25 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The light emission luminance of 2,000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>was reduced to the half after about 60 hours.</p>
