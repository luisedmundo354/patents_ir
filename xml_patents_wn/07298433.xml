<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-0076134 filed in Korea on Oct. 30, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, and more particularly, to a liquid crystal display module having a structure for protecting lead wires of a backlight device from being damaged and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flat panel display devices are increasingly being used in portable devices and household appliances because of their advantageous characteristics of thin profile, lightness, and low power consumption. There are many types of flat panel display devices, such as plasma display panels (PDPs), field emission displays (FEDs), and the widely used liquid crystal display (LCD) devices. While the principles of the present invention are generally applicable to all such displays, it will be discussed with respect to an LCD device used in a portable computer, a computer monitor, or a television as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">LCD devices use optical anisotropy and polarization properties of liquid crystal molecules to generate a desired image. In particular, liquid crystal molecules can be aligned in a specific orientation, which can be controlled by applying an electric field across the liquid crystal molecules. Due to the optical anisotropy, incident light is refracted according to the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, thereby generating the desired image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, a liquid crystal module (LCM) for an LCD device includes a liquid crystal panel having upper and lower substrates with a liquid crystal material interposed therebetween, a backlight assembly having a lamp, a light reflector, a light guide plate and a plurality of optical sheets, a main support supporting the liquid crystal panel and the backlight assembly, and top and bottom cases protecting and accommodating the liquid crystal panel and the backlight assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustrating a liquid crystal display module according to the related art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a liquid crystal module <b>2</b> includes a main support <b>60</b>, a top case <b>70</b>, and a bottom case <b>80</b>. The main support <b>60</b> is coupled to the bottom case <b>80</b> such that the main support <b>60</b> is protected from being twisted and wrinkled. In particular, the bottom case <b>80</b> is generally formed of a metallic material, such as stainless steel, and the main support <b>60</b> is generally formed of a plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, a backlight assembly <b>23</b> having a lamp <b>29</b> is supported by the main support <b>60</b> and the bottom case <b>80</b>. The backlight assembly <b>23</b> also includes a reflector <b>23</b><i>a, </i>a light guide plate <b>23</b><i>b, </i>a first diffusing/protecting sheet <b>23</b><i>c, </i>first and second prism sheets <b>23</b><i>d </i>and <b>23</b><i>e, </i>and a second diffusing/protecting sheet <b>23</b><i>f, </i>which are layered in sequence between the main support <b>60</b> and a liquid crystal panel <b>14</b>. In particular, the lamp <b>29</b> is disposed at one side of the light guide plate <b>23</b><i>b. </i>The lamp <b>29</b> generally is a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) and connects to a connector <b>7</b> outside of the liquid crystal display module <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the liquid crystal (LC) panel <b>14</b> is connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>25</b> by a flexible film. When the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> is assembled, the PCB <b>25</b> is folded onto the bottom of the main support <b>60</b>, and the top case <b>70</b> is coupled to the bottom case <b>80</b>. As a result, the top case <b>70</b> and the main support <b>60</b> hold and retain the liquid crystal panel <b>14</b> and the backlight assembly <b>23</b> together. Although not shown, the main support <b>60</b> may be alternatively disposed adjacent to the liquid crystal panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The backlight assembly <b>23</b> can be a direct-type backlight device or an edge-type backlight device. In a direct-type backlight device, a light source is generally disposed underneath the light guide plate. Light generated from the light source is reflected onto a back surface of the liquid crystal panel using the reflector and diffused using a diffuser sheet. Thus, the direct-type backlight device can be used for the wall-mounted television requiring a high brightness. However, the direct-type backlight device has disadvantages, such as being relatively thick, consuming significant power, and having a high fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In comparison, an edge-type backlight device receives light through one side of a plate-shaped light guide comprised of a transparent acryl resin. The edge-type backlight device directs the received light to a light outputting surface of the light guide plate such that it illuminates the back of a liquid crystal panel. In order to improve light efficiency, an optical reflective plate or an optical reflective film is often provided on the opposite side of the light output surface of the light guide plate. To make the light output uniform, a light diffuser sheet is often provided at the light output surface of the light guide plate. The edge-type backlight device is lightweight, has a thin profile, and consumes little power. Thus, the edge-type backlight device is highly suitable for portable computers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view of an illuminating section of a backlight device according to the related art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illuminating section <b>26</b> of a backlight device includes the lamp <b>29</b>, a lamp holder <b>31</b>, a lamp housing <b>33</b>, and wires <b>27</b>. The lamp housing <b>33</b> reflects light emitted from the lamp <b>30</b> toward a desired direction, and the wires <b>27</b> include a power wire <b>27</b><i>a </i>and a ground wire <b>27</b><i>b. </i>The power wire <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the ground wire <b>27</b><i>b </i>are disposed between the connector <b>7</b> and the lamp <b>29</b>. In particular, the power wire <b>27</b><i>a </i>is soldered to one end of the lamp and the ground wire <b>27</b><i>b </i>is soldered to another end of the lamp <b>29</b>. Further, the lamp holder <b>31</b> covers the solder connections between the lamp <b>29</b> and the power and ground wires <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b. </i>Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connector <b>7</b> is connected to an inverter power supply circuit such that the wires <b>27</b> supply power to drive the lamp <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially enlarged perspective view of a liquid crystal module according to the related art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a liquid crystal module <b>50</b> is assembled, there exists a wire outlet portion near one of its corner portions to allow the wires <b>27</b> that are connected to the lamp <b>29</b> be extended to the outside of the liquid crystal module <b>50</b>. In particular, a top case <b>65</b> and a bottom case <b>67</b> are coupled to each other and hold a liquid crystal panel and a backlight assembly therebetween. A wire holder <b>90</b> having an opening <b>92</b> is disposed at the wire outlet portion, such that the wires <b>27</b> pass through the opening <b>92</b> to exit out of the liquid crystal panel <b>50</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the wires <b>27</b> are connected to the connector <b>7</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> are generally made of a metallic material through a molding die process, and they may have cutting burrs at their edges after the press molding. The burrs formed at the edge portions of the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> may damage the coated material of the wires <b>27</b> and then may cause a short between the wires <b>27</b>. Therefore, the wire holder <b>90</b> is provided at the wire outlet portion between the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> to protect the wires <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the liquid crystal module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the liquid crystal panel and the backlight assembly are not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for the purpose of simplifying the figure. In addition, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the wires <b>27</b> are pulled through the opening <b>92</b> of the wire holder <b>90</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) before the wire holder <b>90</b> is inserted between the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> respectively have protrusions <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>a </i>along one of their edges.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When assembling the liquid crystal module, the wire holder <b>90</b> is first mated with the protrusion <b>67</b><i>a </i>of the bottom case <b>67</b> by sliding into it. Thereafter, a main support <b>58</b> on which the liquid crystal panel and the backlight assembly are disposed is laid onto the bottom case <b>67</b> while the wires are inserted through the opening <b>92</b>. Then, the top case <b>65</b> is coupled to the bottom case <b>67</b>. As a result, the wire holder <b>90</b> is supported and fastened by the protrusions <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>a </i>of the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, since the wire holder <b>90</b> is to be coupled to the bottom case <b>67</b> first, additional time is required to carefully put and slide down the wire holder <b>90</b> into the protrusion <b>67</b><i>a, </i>thereby increasing assembling time and reducing labor efficiency. Moreover, because the wire holder <b>90</b> is a separate element from the top and bottom cases <b>65</b> and <b>67</b>, fabrication cost is increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a liquid crystal display module having a structure for preventing wires from being damaged and a method of fabricating the same that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are upper and lower perspective views of a support of a liquid crystal display module according an embodiment of the present invention. Although not fully shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, a support <b>158</b> is a rectangular frame having a side portion <b>158</b><i>b </i>being thicker than a front portion <b>158</b><i>a. </i>As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the side portion <b>158</b><i>b </i>has a plurality of steps such that a light guide plate and optical sheets of a backlight assembly may be held in place by these steps. Thus, these steps of the side portion <b>158</b><i>b </i>prevent wires that are connected to a lamp of the backlight assembly (not shown) from moving caused by free movement of the backlight assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>includes a wire holding hook <b>191</b> on its front side. The wire holding hook <b>191</b> has a first finger portion <b>191</b><i>a </i>and a second finger portion <b>191</b><i>b </i>to hold and fasten the wires. In particular, the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>are spaced apart from each other and perpendicularly extend from the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>to allow the wires to be extended from the lamp and to pass through between the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b. </i>More specifically, the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>may be separated by a distance substantially equal to the sum of diameters of the wires. The wire holding hook <b>191</b> may preferably have a thickness smaller than that of the front portion <b>158</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the wire holding hook <b>191</b> is protruded slightly from the front side of the front portion <b>158</b><i>a, </i>and then extends along a direction perpendicular to a bottom surface of the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>such that the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>are extending downwards. In particular, the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>may extend covering an outer side of the bottom case (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>is thinner than the side portion <b>158</b><i>b. </i>Thus, the lamp of the backlight assembly may be accommodated between the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>and a corresponding portion of the bottom case (not shown). In addition, the front portion <b>158</b><i>a </i>includes a wire guiding passage <b>159</b> along a longitudinal direction on its bottom surface. The wire guiding passage <b>159</b> may guide and lead the wires to the wire holding hook <b>191</b>. As a result, the wire guiding passage <b>159</b> holds the wires together with the wire holding hook <b>191</b> and prevents the wire from movement when the liquid crystal display module is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a liquid crystal display module having the support shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a liquid crystal display module includes the support <b>158</b>, a top case <b>165</b>, and a bottom case <b>167</b>. The top and bottom cases <b>165</b> and <b>167</b> may be formed of a metallic material, such as stainless steel, and the support <b>158</b> may be formed of a plastic material. In particular, the support <b>158</b> including the wire holding hook <b>191</b> is disposed over the bottom case <b>167</b>, and the top case <b>165</b> is disposed over the support <b>158</b>. When the support <b>158</b> is assembled with the bottom case <b>167</b>, the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>are extending toward the bottom case <b>167</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the liquid crystal panel and the backlight assembly are disposed on the support <b>158</b> such that the wires are held in place by the wire holding hook <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Unlike the liquid crystal display module according the related art as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the liquid crystal display module according to an embodiment of the present invention does not include a separate wire holder element, and the top and bottom cases do not have protrusions for holding such a wire holder. Therefore, when assembling the liquid crystal display module according to an embodiment of the present invention, the step of inserting the wires through an opening of a wire holder is not required. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the support <b>158</b> and the wire holding hook <b>191</b> may be formed integrally, and the wires may be held between the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>of the wire holding hook <b>191</b> as the support <b>158</b> is held between the top and bottom cases <b>165</b> and <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, when assembling the liquid crystal module according to the related art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the connector <b>7</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is not connected to the wires in advance because the wires need to first be pulled through the opening of the wire holder. However, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the wires may already be connected to a connector (not shown) as the wires are being placed between the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>of the support <b>158</b> and as the liquid crystal display module being assembled. Therefore, assembling time for the liquid crystal display module according to an embodiment of the present invention decreases and labor efficiency increases.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a partial perspective view of the liquid crystal display module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when assembled. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when a liquid crystal display module <b>150</b> is assembled, wires <b>127</b> that are connected with a lamp may extend to the outside of the module <b>150</b> near one of corner portions of the module <b>150</b>. In particular, when the top case <b>165</b> is coupled to the bottom case <b>167</b>, the top and bottom cases <b>165</b> and <b>167</b> hold the main support <b>158</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), a backlight device (not shown), and a liquid crystal panel (not shown) therebetween. The first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>of the wire holding hook <b>191</b> may overlap a portion of an exterior side surface of the bottom case <b>167</b>, and the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>may have a length shorter than a height of the side of the bottom case <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the first and second finger portions <b>191</b><i>a </i>and <b>191</b><i>b </i>hold and affix the wires <b>127</b>, thereby preventing the wires <b>127</b> from free movement. The wires <b>127</b> may include a power wire <b>127</b><i>a </i>and a ground wire <b>127</b><i>b </i>connected to an outside source for driving the lamp that is held within the liquid crystal display module <b>150</b>. In particular, since the wire holding hook <b>191</b> holds and protects the wires <b>127</b>, the coated material of the wires <b>127</b> is not damaged from the cutting burrs that may be formed on the top and bottom cases <b>165</b> and <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a result, the liquid crystal display module according to an embodiment of the present invention has the following advantages. First, since the wires come out of the liquid crystal display module through the space between the finger portions of the wire holding hook, the wires do not directly contact the top frame and the bottom cover. Thus, wire damage and short-circuits are prevented. Second, because a separate wire holder element is not required, the production cost is reduced. Third, since the connector can be connected to the wires prior to the wires being placed between the finger portions of the wire holding hook, the liquid crystal module is more easily assembled requiring less assembling time, thereby improving labor efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, the method of assembling a liquid crystal display module according an embodiment of the present invention may include assembling a backlight device including placing a lamp therein, and connecting the lamp to a connector via wires prior to disposing the backlight device on a main support. Then, the backlight device may be disposed on the main support, which includes a wire holding hook having first and second finger portions. Then, the wires may be passed between the first and second finger portions of the wire holding hook to securely affix the wires. Subsequently, the main support may be disposed on a bottom case, a liquid crystal panel may be disposed over the backlight device, and the bottom case may be coupled to a top case such that the wires extend to outside of the module via the wire holding hook. As a result, since the connector can be connected to the wires prior to the wires being placed between the finger portions of the wire holding hook, the liquid crystal module is more easily assembled requiring less assembling time, thereby improving labor efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the liquid crystal display module of the present invention without departing from the sprit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
