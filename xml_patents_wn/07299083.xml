<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a system for, and method of, producing at a particular position on the patient's body, signals having characteristics indicating the functioning of the patient's body at the particular position. The invention is particularly adapted to being used for monitoring a patient's heart.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Measurements are provided in a patient of the functioning of various organs in a patient's body. For example, measurements are made of the functioning of the patient's heart and the patient's brain. These measurements are generally made by applying an electrode or electrodes to the skin of the patient at the appropriate position or positions in the patient's body and by evaluating the characteristics of the signal produced at the particular position or positions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The measurements of the functioning of different organs in the patient's body involve different frequency ranges. For example, measurements of the patient's heart occur in a range of DC to approximately two hundred fifty hertz (250 Hz) and measurements of the patient's brain occur in a range of DC to approximately one hundred and fifty hertz (150 Hz).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The measurement of the functioning of different organs in the patient's body involves acquiring signals of miniscule amplitudes. For example, the range of voltages produced at an electrode attached to the patient's skin for a measurement of the patient's heart is approximately one-half of a millivolt (0.5 mV) to approximately four millivolts (4 mV). The range of voltages produced at an electrode attached to the patient's skin for a measurement of the patient's brain is approximately five microvolts (5 μV) to approximately three hundred microvolts (300 μV).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When an electrode is attached to the patient's skin to measure the function of an organ such as the patient's heart or brain, the bioelectric signal generated from the organ has to penetrate from the patient's organ through the body to the patient's skin and to the electrode attached to the patient's skin. The patient's skin has many layers. The greater the number of layers that the signal has to penetrate in the patient's skin, the greater is the impedance and barrier that the skin presents to the signal generated by the organ whose function is being measured. The problem of high impedances is compounded if the patient's skin is not clean and prepared by abrading when the measurement is being made. Thus, the impedance presented by the patient's skin may be as high as approximately several thousand ohms to approximately several hundred thousand ohms. The input, impedance of the recording amplifier connected to the electrode is preferably very high so as not to alter the characteristics of the original signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A chadd disposed on a patient's skin generates heat at a substantially constant temperature for an extended period of time (e.g. hours and days) when exposed to air. The chadd becomes porous when heated and produces a porosity in the patient's skin as a result of the heat generation to pass ions through pores in the patient's skin to a layer disposed on the chadd. The layer (e.g., silver/silver chloride) (Ag/AgCl) has properties of converting the ions to electrons. The electrons pass to an electrical lead disposed on the layer. The electrical lead passes an electrical signal (produced from the electrons) to a terminal. An amplifier connected to the terminal amplifies the signal without changing the characteristics of the original signal and without producing noise.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged schematic perspective view of the different layers in a patient's skin. As will be seen, there are a number of layers in the patient's skin. The bracketed indications on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represent groupings of layers. These bracketed groupings of layers are respectively designated as epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous. Each of the layers includes a plurality of sub-layers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the layers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has an impedance. This is shown on a schematic basis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows an arrangement in the prior art for attaching an electrode to a patient's skin. The showing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes an electrode, a gel, the epidermis layer and a combination of the dermis and subcutaneous layers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the gel is shown as being disposed between the electrode and the epidermis to facilitate the coupling of the electrode to the epidermis layer with a minimal impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since each of the layers and sub-layers in the patient's skin has an impedance, the impedance of the patient's skin may be in the order of approximately several hundred thousand ohms when all of the layers are in place on the patient's skin. This high impedance limits the ability to create an electrical signal of any significant amplitude on the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It has previously been determined in the prior art that heat applied to a patient's skin increases the skin permeability, thereby allowing drugs to permeate the skin more efficiently and effectively than other methods previously used to introduce drugs into a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In recent years, heat has been used to facilitate the insertion and penetration of drugs by transdermal delivery into a patient's body through the patient's skin. The insertion and penetration of drugs through a patient's skin by the application of heat to the patient's skin is advantageous in that the patient's skin does not have to be broken and no instrument has to puncture the patient's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Heat initiates several physiological responses that facilitate drug penetration through the skin, including:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">1. An increase in skin permeability. The increase in skin permeability provides for an enhanced flow of the drugs through the skin into the patient's body;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">2. An increase in body fluid circulation. The increase in body fluid circulation enhances the rate at which the fluid travels through the patient's body;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">3. Dilation of blood vessels. This enhances permeation of the drugs through the blood vessel wall;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">4. An enhancement in the solubility of most drugs. This enhancement in drug solubility increases the rate at which the drugs can pass through the patient's body; and</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">5. An increase in the release rate of the drugs from local skin tissue into systemic circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A number of patents have been obtained by Zars, Inc. of Salt Lake City, Utah on a system for, and method of, inserting drugs through a patient's skin into a patient's body. These include the following: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,583; 5,919,479; 6,245,347; 6,261,595; 6,488,959; 6,528,086; and 6,546,281.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In these patents, a chadd <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is made from an oxidizable material. For example, the chadd <b>10</b> may be made from a mixture of activated carbon, iron powder, sawdust, sodium chloride and water. The activated carbon, iron powder, sawdust and water may be provided in the mixture in the relative ratios of 5:16:3:2: and 6.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The chadd <b>10</b> may ordinarily be disposed in a wrapper <b>12</b> to prevent air from being introduced to the chadd. A cover <b>14</b> with openings <b>16</b> is disposed between the wrapper <b>12</b> and the chadd <b>10</b>. When the wrapper <b>12</b> is removed from the chadd <b>10</b>, the cover <b>14</b> becomes exposed and the openings <b>16</b> in the cover <b>14</b> cause air to be introduced to the chadd. The oxygen in the air oxidizes the chadd <b>10</b> to generate heat in the chadd and to make the chadd porous. The heat in the chadd produces heat in the patient's skin <b>18</b>. The heat in the chadd opens the pores in the patient's skin <b>18</b> and causes drugs <b>20</b> to pass through the pores in the patient's skin <b>18</b> into the patient's body. The drugs <b>20</b> are disposed in a layer between the chadd <b>10</b> and the patient's skin <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The temperature on the chadd <b>10</b> increases substantially instantaneously to a particular value when the chadd receives the air through the openings <b>16</b> in the cover <b>14</b>. The particular value of the raised temperature of the chadd <b>10</b> is dependent upon the number and size of the openings <b>16</b> in the cover <b>14</b>. The substantially instantaneous increase in the temperature of the chadd <b>10</b> to the particular value is indicated at <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The chadd <b>10</b> is then maintained at the particular temperature for extended periods of time such as in the order of a full day or as many as fifteen (15) days. This is indicated at <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. During this extended period of time, the drugs <b>20</b> are delivered through the patient's skin into the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be seen from the above discussion and from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the drugs <b>20</b> enter into the patient's skin in the prior art as a result of heat applied to the patient's skin by the chadd <b>10</b>. In applicant's invention, however, ions from the patient's body pass through the patient's skin to a position external to the patient's skin as in the prior art. This is in a direction opposite to the passage of the drugs <b>20</b> into the patient's body through the patient's skin <b>18</b>. The ions in applicant's invention provide an indication of the characteristics of the patient's body at a particular position in the patient's body such as functioning of at the heart of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment of applicant's invention, a chadd generally indicated at <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> is attached to a patient's skin <b>51</b> at a particular position on a patient's body. This particular position may be an individual one of a plurality of different anatomical positions on the torso that enable an evaluation of the functioning of the patient's heart. The chadd <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may have a construction corresponding to the construction of the chadd <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described above. This may include openings <b>53</b> in the chadd <b>50</b>. A wrapper <b>52</b> corresponding to the wrapper <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> envelopes the chadd <b>50</b> and prevents the chadd from being oxidized. A cover <b>54</b> may be disposed within the wrapper <b>52</b>. Openings <b>56</b> may be provided in the cover <b>54</b> to provide for the oxidation of the material in the chadd <b>50</b>. The openings <b>56</b> may correspond to the openings <b>16</b> in the cover <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The chadd <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be made from an oxidizable material corresponding to the oxidizable material in the chadd <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, the chadd <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be made from a mixture of activated carbon, iron powder, sawdust, sodium chloride and water. As with the chadd <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the activated carbon, iron powder, sawdust, sodium chloride and water in the chadd <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be provided in the mixture in the relative ratios of 5:16:3:2: and 6.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A layer <b>60</b> of an electrically conductive material may be suitably attached to the chadd <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The layer <b>60</b> may be made from a suitable material such as silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl). The layer <b>60</b> may be provided with openings <b>62</b> corresponding in position and in size to the position and size of the openings <b>53</b> in the chadd <b>50</b>. An electrical lead <b>70</b> is attached to the layer <b>60</b>. The electrical lead <b>70</b> may be provided with openings <b>72</b> corresponding in position and size to the openings <b>62</b> in the layer <b>60</b> and to the openings <b>53</b> in the chadd <b>50</b>. The electrical lead <b>70</b> may be made from a suitable electrically conductive material such as an electrically conductive carbon or an electrically conductive plastic material such as an electrically conductive polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cumulative thickness of the chadd <b>50</b>, the layer <b>60</b> and the electrical lead <b>70</b> may be in the order of approximately two millimeters (2 mm). The openings <b>62</b> in the layer <b>60</b> and the openings <b>72</b> in the electrical lead <b>70</b> assure that the air will flow into the openings <b>53</b> in the chadd <b>50</b> and that the oxygen in the air will oxidize the mixture of the material in the chadd to increase the temperature of the chadd instantaneously and therefore increase the temperature of the conductive layer <b>60</b>. The relationship between temperature and time in the chadd <b>50</b> corresponds to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the chadd <b>50</b> is heated, it enables pores to open in the patient's skin <b>51</b> and in the chadd. This causes ions to pass through the pores in the patient's skin <b>51</b> and in the chadd from the particular positions in the patient's body. These ions pass to the layer <b>60</b> which reacts chemically with the ions to produce electrons. The electrons produce an electrical signal in the electrical lead <b>70</b>. The electrical signal indicates the characteristics of the patient's heart at the particular position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An extension <b>74</b> of the electrical lead <b>70</b> extends to a terminal <b>80</b>. The extension <b>74</b> may be in the form of a single strand or may be in the form of a tape. The extension <b>74</b> is connected to an amplifier generally indicated at <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a circuit diagram, primarily in block form, of the amplifier <b>100</b> included in a preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed and claimed in application Ser. No. 10/611,696 filed into U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Jul. 1, 2003 in the name of Budimir S. Drakulic as a sole inventor and assigned of record to the assignee of record of this application. The amplifier <b>100</b> includes a pair of electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> each of which is suitably attached to the patient's skin at a selective position on the patient's body. The electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> preferably have an identical construction. The electrode <b>112</b> is positioned at a selective position on the skin of the patient's body to produce signals related to the functioning characteristics of an organ in the patient's body. The organ may illustratively be the patient's heart, brain, stomach or intestines. The electrode <b>114</b> is positioned on the skin of the patient's body at a position displaced from the selective position to provide reference signals. The difference between the signals at the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> represents the functioning characteristics of the selected one of the patient's organs such as the patient's heart.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The signals on the electrode <b>112</b> are introduced to an input terminal of an amplifier generally indicated at <b>116</b>. The amplifier <b>116</b> also has a second input terminal which is connected to the output of the amplifier. In this way, the amplifier acts as a unity gain. The amplifier <b>116</b> may be purchased as an OPA 129 amplifier from Texas Instruments which is located in Dallas, Texas. The OPA 129 amplifier was originally provided by the Burr Brown Company which was located in Phoenix, Ariz. and which was acquired by Texas Instruments. In like manner, the signals from the electrode <b>114</b> are introduced to an input terminal of an amplifier, generally indicated at <b>118</b>, which may be identical to the amplifier <b>118</b> has an input terminal which is connected to the output terminal of the amplifier to have the amplifier act as a unity gain.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Resistors <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> respectively extend from the output terminals of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. The resistor <b>120</b> is connected to first terminals of capacitors <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. The second terminal of the capacitor <b>124</b> receives a reference potential such as ground. A connection is made from the resistor <b>122</b> to the second terminal of the capacitor <b>126</b> and to a first terminal of the capacitor <b>130</b>, the second terminal of which is provided with the reference potential such as ground. The resistors <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> may have equal values and the capacitors <b>124</b> and <b>130</b> may also have equal values.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One terminal of a resistor <b>132</b> is connected to the terminal common to the capacitors <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. The other terminal of the resistor <b>132</b> has a common connection with a first input terminal of an amplifier <b>134</b>. In like manner, a resistor <b>136</b> having a value equal to that of the resistor <b>132</b> is connected at one end to the terminal common to the capacitors <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> and at the other end to a second input terminal of the amplifier <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> have identical constructions, they operate to provide signals which represent the difference between the signals on the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. This indicates the functioning of the patient's organ which is being determined by the amplifier system <b>110</b>. Although the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are displaced from each other on the skin of the patient's body, they tend to receive the same noise signals. As a result, the difference between the signals on the output terminals of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> results in only a limited amount of noise.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> respectively provide an impedance as high as of approximately 10<sup>6 </sup>ohms to the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. Each of the amplifiers <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> respectively provides an input impedance of approximately 10<sup>15 </sup>ohms. This impedance is so large that it may be considered to cause each of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> to operate as if it has an open circuit at its input. The output impedance of each of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> is approximately 50 ohms to 75 ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Because of the effective open circuit at the input of each of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, the output signal from each of the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> corresponds to the input signal to the amplifiers and does not have any less magnitude compared to the amplitude of the input signal to the amplifier. This is important in view of the production of signals in the microvolt or millivolt region in the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The capacitors <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> and the resistors <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> provide a low-pass filter and a differential circuit and operate to eliminate the noise on the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. The capacitors <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> also operate to provide signals which eliminate the commonality between the signals in the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> so that only the signals individual to the functionality being determined relative to the selected organ in the patient's body remain. The capacitors <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> operate as a low pass filter and pass signals in a range to approximately one kilohertz (1 KHz). The signals having a frequency above approximately one kilohertz (1 KHz) are attenuated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are identical. Because of this, a description of the construction and operation of the amplifier <b>116</b> will apply equally as well to the amplifier <b>118</b>. The amplifier <b>116</b> is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It is manufactured and sold by Texas Instruments (“TI”) in Dallas, Tex. and is designated by TI as the OPA 129 amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the amplifier <b>116</b> includes an input terminal <b>150</b> which receives the signals at the electrode <b>112</b> and introduces these signals to the gate of a transistor <b>152</b>. The source of the transistor <b>152</b> receives a positive voltage from a terminal <b>156</b> through a resistor <b>154</b>. The emitter of the transistor <b>152</b> is common with an input terminal in a noise free cascode <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another terminal <b>160</b> receives the signals on the electrode <b>114</b> and introduces these signals to a gate of a transistor <b>164</b>. A connection is made from the source of the transistor <b>164</b> <b>10</b> to one terminal of a resistor <b>166</b>, the other terminal of which receives the voltage from the terminal <b>156</b>. The emitter of the transistor <b>164</b> is common with an input terminal in the noise-free cascode <b>158</b>. The resistor <b>166</b> has a value equal to that of the resistor <b>154</b> and the transistors <b>152</b> and <b>164</b> have identical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First terminals of resistors <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> having equal values are respectively connected to output terminals in the noise-free cascode <b>158</b> and input terminals of an amplifier <b>174</b>. The amplifier <b>74</b> provides an output at a terminal <b>176</b>. The output from the terminal <b>176</b> is introduced to the input terminal <b>160</b>. The amplifier <b>174</b> receives the positive voltage on the terminal <b>156</b> and a negative voltage on a terminal <b>178</b>. Connections are made to the terminal <b>178</b> from the second terminals of the resistors <b>168</b> and <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The transistors <b>152</b> and <b>164</b> operate on a differential basis to provide an input impedance of approximately 10<sup>15 </sup>ohms between the gates of the transistors. The output impedance from the amplifier <b>116</b> is approximately fifty (50) ohms to seventy-five (75) ohms. Because of the high input impedance of approximately 10<sup>15 </sup>ohms, the amplifier <b>116</b> provides the equivalent of an open circuit at its input. This causes substantially all of the voltage applied to the input terminal <b>150</b> to be provided at the output of the amplifier <b>116</b>. This is facilitated by the low impedance of approximately 50 ohms (50 ohms) to seventy-five (75) ohms at the output of the amplifier <b>116</b>. This voltage has characteristics corresponding to the characteristics of the voltage at the electrode <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The output signals from the amplifiers <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are respectively introduced to the terminal common to the capacitors <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> and to the terminal common to the capacitors <b>126</b> and <b>130</b>. The capacitors <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> operate as a low-pass filter to remove noise and to provide an output signal representing the difference between the signals on the electrodes <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The capacitors <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> correspond to the capacitors C<b>2</b>, C<b>1</b> and C<b>3</b> in a low pass filter <b>176</b> in application Ser. No. 10/293,105 filed on Nov. 13, 2002 in the USPTO and assigned of record to the assignee of record in this application. The capacitors C<b>2</b>, C<b>1</b> and C<b>3</b> in application Ser. No. 10/293,105 are included in the low pass filter <b>76</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8-1</figref> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of such application. The low pass filter <b>76</b> eliminates noise and passes signals through a frequency range to approximately one kilohertz (1 KHz). If any further information may be needed concerning the construction and operation of the low pass filter, reference may be made to co-pending application Ser. No. 10/293,105 to obtain this information.</p>
