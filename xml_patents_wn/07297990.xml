<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following relates to the semiconductor arts. It especially relates to Si/SiGe interband tunneling diode (ITD) structures such as Esaki-like Si/SiGe ITD's, Si/SiGe resonant interband tunneling diodes (i.e., RITD's), and the like, and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, the following will also find application in conjunction with Esaki-like interband tunneling diode device structures in other material systems, and in electronic and optoelectronic devices incorporating same.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tunnel diodes have numerous potential and actual applications, including but not limited to local oscillators, frequency locking circuits, advanced SRAM circuits, highly integrated analog/digital converters, high speed digital latches, and so forth. Tunneling is a very fast phenomenon; hence ITD-based devices typically are operable at high frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Interband tunneling diode structures include degenerately doped n-type and p-type regions, sometimes very thin, in sufficiently close relative proximity so that electrons and holes can cross the p/n junction by quantum mechanical tunneling. In some ITD structures, the degenerate doping required is achieved using delta doping to concentrate the doping density to approximately the solid solubility limit. If the delta doping is very thin and of high enough doping density, it can also lead to quantum well regions that confine carriers. With a quantum well on the p-side and n-side of the p/n junction diode, resonant interband tunneling (e.g. RITD) can occur when the quantum wells are spaced closed enough for an overlap of the carrier wavefunctions. The ITD structure is challenging to produce, because dopant segregation and dopant diffusion during growth lowers the doping density and degrades the negative differential resistance (NDR). Using low temperature epitaxy reduces dopant movement during growth which increases the tunneling that manifests in an elevated peak current and a larger peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, low temperature epitaxy also typically introduces higher point defect concentrations which increase the valley current of the negative differential resistance region. Point defect concentrations can be reduced by post-growth annealing; however, the annealing can induce solid state dopant diffusion that degrades the peak current of the negative differential resistance region. In some silicon-based ITD structures, a silicon-germanium layer is interposed between the degenerately p-doped and degenerately n-doped regions to reduce diffusion of dopants across the p/n junction during the post-growth anneal. The interposed silicon-germanium layer provides improved thermal stability of the doping profile during post-growth annealing; however, the thermal budget is still found to be limited by dopant diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention contemplates improved apparatuses and methods that overcomes the above-mentioned limitations and others.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect, a silicon-based interband tunneling diode includes a degenerate p-type doping of acceptors, a degenerate n-type doping of donors disposed on a first side of the degenerate p-type doping, and a barrier silicon-germanium layer disposed on a second side of the degenerate p-type doping opposite the first side. The barrier silicon-germanium layer suppresses diffusion of acceptors away from a p/n junction defined by the degenerate p-type and n-type dopings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect, an interband tunneling diode is disclosed, including one or more semiconductor layers selected from a group consisting of (i) a silicon layer and (ii) a silicon-germanium layer. A degenerate p-type doping of acceptors is substantially disposed within a containing silicon-germanium layer of the one or more semiconductor layers. A degenerate n-type doping of donors is substantially disposed within or between one or more of the semiconductor layers other than the containing silicon-germanium layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another aspect, a semiconductor device is disclosed. The device is made by a process comprising forming one of: (i) a barrier silicon-germanium layer, a degenerate p-type doping, and a degenerate n-type doping, in that order, and (ii) a degenerate n-type doping, a degenerate p-type doping, and a barrier silicon-germanium layer, in that order.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Numerous advantages and benefits of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification.</p>

The ITD <b>10</b> includes a plurality of group IV layers epitaxially grown on the substrate <b>12</b> by a suitable low temperature epitaxy method that reduces dopant segregation and diffusion during epitaxial growth, such as low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (LT-MBE), low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV-CVD), solid phase epitaxy, or the like. In the illustrated example embodiment, the ITD <b>10</b> includes an epitaxial p<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>14</b> grown on the substrate <b>12</b> and a barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> grown on the p<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>14</b>, followed by formation of a degenerately p-type doped region <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the degenerately doped p-type region <b>22</b> is a p-type delta doping formed as follows: during a growth interruption in which the group IV epitaxial growth is interrupted, an acceptor species is applied to the exposed surface of the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> to produce a high concentration of p-type dopant in a thin region. In other embodiments, the degenerately doped p-type region <b>22</b> is generated by supplying a high concentration of acceptors during a selected time interval of continuous group IV crystal growth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> is formed, the group IV epitaxial growth continues with formation of one or more interposed layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> followed by formation of a degenerately n-type doped region <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the degenerately doped n-type region <b>32</b> is an n-type delta doping formed during another growth interruption. In other embodiments, the degenerately doped n-type region <b>32</b> is generated by supplying a high concentration of donors during a selected time interval of continuous group IV crystal growth. The interposed layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are interposed between the p-type and n-type degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interposed layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> include interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b> formed on the cladding silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> and the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b>, followed by interposed silicon layer <b>28</b> formed on the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b>. An epitaxial n<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>36</b> is formed on the interposed silicon layer <b>28</b> and the n-type degenerate doping <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> can be delta-doped regions, or can be formed during a time interval of reduced or slow growth rate, or can be formed without interrupting or slowing the group IV crystal growth, as long as the rate of dopant introduction during formation of the degenerate doping is high enough to produce the desired high concentration of dopant. In some embodiments one of the degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> is a delta doping while the other is formed during continuous group IV crystal growth. Moreover, even when the degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> are formed, during a complete growth stop, those skilled in the art recognize that the resulting dopant profiles are not planar; rather, due to dopant segregation, dopant diffusion, or the like during epitaxial growth the acceptors and donors each have some finite distribution along the epitaxial growth direction, which may be Gaussian or otherwise shaped. Using a low temperature epitaxial growth technique generally reduces the width or extent of this finite distribution. The finite distribution is also expected to increase in width or extent in response to thermal processing, such as rapid thermal annealing processing which are described herein. When the p-type degenerately doped region <b>22</b> is thin enough, such as in the case of a narrow-distribution p-type delta doping, a degenerate two-dimensional hole gas is formed. Similarly, when the n-type degenerately doped region <b>32</b> is thin enough, such as in the case of a narrow-distribution n-type delta doping, a degenerate two-dimensional electron gas is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> and the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b> have the same germanium fraction. In these embodiments, it will be recognized that the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> and the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b> define a single silicon-germanium layer of common germanium fraction, and the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> is substantially disposed within that silicon-germanium layer. In other embodiments, the barrier and interposed silicon-germanium layers <b>20</b>, <b>26</b> have different germanium fractions and thus are identifiable as distinct group silicon-germanium layers. In some embodiments one or both silicon-germanium layers <b>20</b>, <b>26</b> may incorporate compositional grading of the germanium fraction. While the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> has a thickness of about 1 nanometer for the specific examples described herein, a barrier thickness of substantially greater than 1 nanometer can be used, which is expected to provide improved suppression of acceptor outdiffusion from the p/n junction. Substantially the only restriction on germanium concentration and overall thickness is the critical thickness, well known to those skilled in the art. Above the critical thickness, lattice mismatch between Si and Ge leads to misfit dislocations when it becomes energetically favorable to relieve the strain energy by dislocation formation over plastic deformation of the lattice. Due to the low growth temperatures, in some embodiments a metastable silicon-germanium layer may be grown above the thermodynamic critical thickness without introducing deleterious dislocation densities.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A p/n junction exists between the p-type and n-type degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>. The barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> is disposed on the p-type side of the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b>. The interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b> on the n-type side of the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> is believed to suppress dopant diffusion across the p/n junction. The interposed silicon layer <b>28</b> has a lower bandgap than the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b>, thus promoting interband tunneling. The additional germanium provides for greater momentum mixing within the tunneling spacer with its unique band structure and gamma valley minimum near the L-valley minimum. The enhanced tunneling within Ge-containing layers versus pure Si allows for higher current densities that often leads to enhanced PVCRS. However, in some contemplated embodiments all the group IV layers interposed between the p-type and n-type degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> contain germanium. For example, a single silicon-germanium layer can be interposed between the p-type and n-type degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>, or a plurality of silicon-germanium layers having different germanium fractions can be interposed between the p-type and n-type degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example, the ITD structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> was grown by LT-MBE using an elemental silicon electron beam source, the p<sup>+</sup> substrate <b>12</b> was a 76 mm diameter boron-doped silicon wafer having a (<b>100</b>) crystallographic orientation with a resistivity of between about 0.015 ohm-cm and about 0.04 ohm-cm. The epitaxial p<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>14</b> was grown to a thickness of about 80 nanometers with a nominal p-type doping of 5×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, and the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> was grown with a germanium fraction of about 0.4 to a thickness of about 1 nanometer, without intentional doping. The acceptor species used for the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> was boron, applied as a delta doping with a nominal planar doping level of 1×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>. Instead of boron, another p-type dopant such as aluminum or gallium can be used. The interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>26</b> was grown with the same germanium fraction as the cladding silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>, that is, with a germanium fraction of about 0.4, to a thickness of about 4 nanometers, without intentional doping. The interposed silicon layer <b>28</b> was grown to a thickness of about 2 nanometers, without intentional doping. The donor species used for the n-type degenerate doping <b>32</b> was phosphorus, applied as a delta doping with a nominal planar doping level of 1×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>. Instead of phosphorus, another n-type dopant such as lithium, antimony, arsenic, or bismuth can be used. The epitaxial n<sup>+</sup> silicon layer was grown to a thickness of about 100 nanometers with a nominal n-type doping of 5×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The ITD structure grown with these parameters is referred to herein as “ITD with barrier”.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To demonstrate the beneficial effect of the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>, two different reference ITD structures were grown without a barrier silicon-germanium layer. A structure designated “ITD ref<b>2</b>” was grown nominally identical to “ITD with barrier” structure except that the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> was omitted. A structure designated “ITD ref<b>1</b>” was grown nominally identical to “ITD with barrier” structure except that: (i) the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> was omitted; and (ii) the interposed layers of the “ITD with barrier” structure were replaced by the following symmetric sequence of not intentionally doped interposed layers: 1 nanometer silicon/4 nanometers silicon-germanium/1 nanometer silicon, with a germanium fraction of 0.4 for the central interposed 4 nanometer silicon-germanium layer. It will be noted that all three structures: “ITD with barrier”, “ITD ref<b>1</b>”, and “ITD ref<b>2</b>”, have the same nominal tunnel barrier thickness of 6 nanometers between the degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>. The structure “ITD with barrier” was compared with “ITD ref<b>1</b>” and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” to demonstrate the advantages of the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Silicon-based ITD structures grown by LT-MBE typically exhibit relatively high valley currents in the negative differential resistance region. Post-growth annealing typically reduces the valley current. The elevated valley current in the as-grown ITD structures is due to high concentrations of point defects produced by the low temperature epitaxy. The concentration of these defects is reduced, or their electrical activity is reduced, by the post-growth annealing. Accordingly, the ITD structures were processed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) for one minute at selected temperatures. Although the RTA processing reduces the valley current, excessive annealing produces solid state diffusion of the dopants, which broadens the degenerate dopings <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> and reduces the peak current of the negative differential resistance region. The “ITD with barrier” structure withstands higher annealing temperature versus the “ITD ref<b>1</b>” and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures. The barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> reduces outdiffusion of the acceptors of the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> away from the p/n junction, thus allowing higher annealing temperature. Boron acceptors are fast interstitial diffusers in silicon; hence, control of diffusion of acceptors away from the p/n junction by the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> facilitates higher thermal annealing budgets.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To perform comparative electrical measurements of the “ITD with barrier”, “ITD ref<b>1</b>”, and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures, RTA processing was performed for one minute in a forming gas ambient using an RTP-600S furnace (available from Modular Process Technology Corporation, San Jose, Calif.). After the RTA processing, Ti/Au metallization dots with various diameters were patterned on the surface of the ITD using contact lithography. A buffered oxide etch was used prior to the metallization. Using the Ti/Au dots as self-aligned masks, HF/HNO<sub>3 </sub>wet etching was performed to define diode mesas. Finally, a Ti/Au backside contact was thermally evaporated on the backside of the ITD.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows log(current)-voltage characteristics for each of the “ITD with barrier”, “ITD ref<b>1</b>”, and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures, using an anneal temperature for each structure that produced a highest peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) for the negative differential resistance region of that structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> plots the PVCR as a function of RTA temperature for each of the three ITD structures.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the “ITD with barrier” structure, a high annealing temperature of about 825° C. for one minute was found to produce the highest PVCR, specifically PVCR=3.6. The peak current density was about 0.3 kA/cm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, the “ITD ref<b>1</b>” and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures which omit the barrier silicon germanium layer <b>20</b> have lower optimal RTA temperatures. Specifically, “ITD ref<b>1</b>” has an optimal RTA temperature of 725° C. yielding PVCR=2.7, while “ITD ref<b>2</b>” has an optimal RTA temperature of 800° C. yielding PVCR=3.2. The higher annealing temperature for “ITD with barrier” was achieved due to suppression of diffusion of the boron acceptors of the p-type degenerate doping <b>22</b> by the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the current-voltage characteristics for each of the “ITD with barrier”, “ITD ref<b>1</b>”, and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures, using the same RTA anneal of 825° C. for one minute. The “ITD with barrier” structure shows the highest PVCR=3.6. The “ITD ref<b>1</b>” structure shows PVCR=1, which corresponds to substantially no negative differential resistance region. The “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structure shows PVCR=3.0. It will be noted that all three structures have similar valley current values, and the difference in PVCR is due principally to differences in the peak current of the negative differential resistance region, suggesting that the improved PVCR for the “ITD with barrier” structure is due to suppressed boron diffusion during the RTA processing due to the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While results for anneals of up to about 825° C. have been illustrated herein, improvement in negative differential resistance has been observed for anneals as low as 500° C., anneals of about 750° C. or higher have been found to substantially improve the negative differential resistance, and good thermal stability of interband tunneling structures with silicon-germanium outdiffusion barriers have been observed for anneals of around 900° C. These results indicate that a substantially extended thermal budget is provided by the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>. Moreover, those skilled in the art recognize that the thermal budget is a function both of anneal temperature and anneal time. While one minute RTA processing examples are illustrated herein, a higher anneal temperature can be traded off for a shorter anneal time or, conversely, a lower anneal temperature can be traded off for a longer annealing time. Since the acceptor diffusion coefficient across the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b> may have a non-linear dependence upon temperature, it is expected that such temperature/time tradeoffs may enable further optimization of the annealing schedule to increase annealing effectiveness for point defect removal while limiting outdiffusion of acceptors.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, commercial simulation software (ATHENA Process Simulation Software, Santa Clara, Calif.) was employed to simulate the dopant displacement during post growth annealing. In the simulations whose results are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the boron degenerate doping before anneal was modeled as a one nanometer lateral width 10<sup>21 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>boron distribution with a lateral 0.2 nanometer waist. The outer regions below 10 nanometers and above about 16 nanometers were silicon in all simulations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> plots the simulated boron distribution after anneal for three simulations: (i) a simulation in which a both the left-hand interior region labeled “A” and the right-hand interior region labeled “B” were silicon-germanium, so that the boron degenerate doping was substantially contained within a single silicon-germanium layer; (ii) a simulation in which the left-hand interior silicon-germanium was replaced by silicon; and (iii) a simulation in which the structure contained no silicon-germanium. For simulation (i), the boron distribution after the simulated anneal remained substantially symmetric and substantially within the “A” and “B” regions. For simulation (ii) in which the left-hand silicon-germanium layer was omitted, the boron distribution has a substantial shoulder extending away from the peak on the left-hand side. For simulation (iii) which omitted silicon-germanium entirely, the boron distribution is greatly broadened compared with simulations (i) and (ii). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the barrier silicon-germanium layer in suppressing boron outdiffusion away from the region of the p/n junction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, simulated boron dopant profiles are plotted for each of the “ITD with barrier”, “ITD ref<b>1</b>”, and “ITD ref<b>2</b>” structures, for a simulated RTA anneal of 800° C. for one minute. The inset plots both the boron and phosphorus dopant profiles for context. The “ITD with barrier” simulation shows the sharpest boron peak and the highest peak boron concentration after anneal. Again, these simulation results demonstrate effective suppression of boron diffusion by the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ITD structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be incorporated into substantially any type of silicon-based device or silicon-based integrated circuitry using suitable modifications in the CMOS or other silicon fabrication process. To simplify incorporation of ITD structures with barrier silicon-germanium layers into standard silicon processing, integration is contemplated to include epitaxial growth of the ITD onto MOS or other silicon circuitry following the high temperature processes of the standard silicon processing but prior to metallization processing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The “ITD with barrier” layer structure depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustrative example. Those skilled in the art can readily modify layer thicknesses, dopant levels, layer germanium fractions, dopant species, interposed layer sequences, and so forth to adapt the example ITD structures for specific applications. For example, it is contemplated to include a second barrier layer on the n-type side of the n-type degenerate doping to suppress diffusion of the donors away from the p/n junction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an ITD <b>110</b> has an inverted polarity versus the ITD <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The ITD <b>110</b> includes a plurality of group IV layers grown on an n<sup>+</sup> silicon substrate <b>112</b> by LT-MBE or another low temperature epitaxial growth method. The ITD <b>110</b> includes an epitaxial n<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>114</b> grown on the substrate <b>112</b> followed by a growth interruption during which an n-type degenerate doping <b>118</b> is formed atop the epitaxial n<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>114</b>. An interposed silicon layer <b>122</b> is formed on the epitaxial n<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>114</b> and the n-type degenerate doping <b>118</b>, followed by an interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>126</b>. During a second growth interruption, a p-type degenerate doping <b>130</b> is formed atop the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>126</b>. A barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>136</b> is formed on the interposed silicon-germanium layer <b>126</b> and the p-type degenerate doping <b>130</b>, followed by an epitaxial p<sup>+</sup> silicon layer <b>140</b>. In some contemplated embodiments of the ITD structure <b>110</b>, the silicon layers <b>114</b>, <b>140</b> are doped to a level of about 5×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>3</sup>, the degenerate dopings <b>118</b>, <b>130</b> are doped at a planar doping level of about 1×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, and the silicon-germanium layers <b>126</b>, <b>136</b> have germanium fractions of about 0.4. The ITD <b>110</b> would be suitable, for example, to be placed onto n-type implanted source and drain regions of NMOS circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In order to obtain a sharp profile for the n-type degenerate doping <b>118</b>, the growth temperature was lowered to about 320° C. during the n-type degenerate doping growth interruption. After the n-type degenerate doping, growth was resumed at about 320° C. for about the first 2-5 nanometers of the interposed silicon layer <b>122</b>, followed by another growth interruption during which the growth temperature was elevated, followed by formation of the remainder of the ITD <b>110</b>. Depositing a capping silicon layer of about 2-5 nanometers at about 320° C. is believed to suppress surface segregation of the n-type dopant and hence provide a sharper n-type degenerate doping profile.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In either ITD <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, the barrier silicon-germanium layer <b>20</b>, <b>136</b> should have a germanium fraction of at least about 0.1. A lower germanium fraction reduces the effectiveness of the layer in blocking diffusion of acceptors.</p>
