<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit (IC) designs, and more particularly to a latch type sense amplifier that is insensitive to device mismatch issues.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sense amplifier (SA) is a basic component that is used for both programming and reading operations for memory devices. During the operation, a typical sense amplifier is turned on in response to the signals on a bit line and its complement. The operation of sense amplifier can be divided into a pre-charge/discharge phase and an evaluation phase. For a conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier, the evaluation speed is proportional to the evaluation chain conductivity and is inversely proportional to its capacitance. The pre-charge speed of the conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier is proportional to the pre-charge transistor conductivity and is inversely proportional to its capacitance. The capacitance of the conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier is a function of the load capacitance, evaluation chain capacitance and pre-charge transistor capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A latch type sense amplifier typically includes a voltage-mode sense amplifier coupled to a latch. The sense amplifier charges the latch to store a value at its data storage node in response to the bit line signal. The stored value can be reversed when the bit line signal and its complement are switched.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The latch type sense amplifier may fail due to the mismatched devices within its latch. The latch typically is configured by two sets of serially coupled PMOS and NMOS transistors where the PMOS transistors are coupled to a power supply and the NMOS transistors are coupled to the sense amplifier. During the operation, the bit line signal and its complement activate the sense amplifier to selectively charge or discharge the storage nodes through the NMOS transistors. Due to reasons, such as fabrication process variation, the two NMOS transistors can have mismatched electric characteristics, such as different threshold voltages. This can significantly delay the time for the sense amplifier to access the storage nodes of the latch. Moreover, as the semiconductor devices continue to shrink in size, the NMOS transistors within the latch becomes increasingly susceptible to process variation, thereby resulting in a higher chance of mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it is desirable to have a latch type sense amplifier that is insensitive to the device mismatch issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention discloses a latch type sense amplifier. In one embodiment of the invention, the latch type sense amplifier includes a latch unit, an amplifying unit and a circuit module for charging or discharging the latch unit. The latch unit includes a first PMOS transistor and a second PMOS transistor coupled to a power supply in parallel, and a first NMOS transistor and a second NMOS transistor serially coupled to the first and second PMOS transistors, respectively. The drains of the first PMOS and NMOS transistors are coupled to gates of the second PMOS and NMOS transistors at a data storage node for storing a value. The drains of the second PMOS and NMOS transistors are coupled to gates of the first PMOS and NMOS transistors at a complementary data storage node for storing a complementary value. The amplifying unit is coupled between the latch unit and a complementary power supply for controlling the latch unit in response to a bit line signal and a complementary bit line signal. The circuit module is designed to charge or discharge the data storage node and the complementary data storage node in response to the bit line signal and the complementary bit line signal, without using a current path across the first or second NMOS transistor, such that the data storage node and the complementary data storage node are charged or discharged in a manner insensitive to a mismatch of electrical characteristics between the first and second NMOS transistors.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional latch type sense amplifier <b>100</b> that is sensitive to mismatch issues. The latch type sense amplifier <b>100</b> includes a basic sense amplifier <b>102</b>, a latch <b>104</b>, two pre-charge PMOS transistors <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, and two PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. The basic sense amplifier <b>102</b> includes three NMOS transistors <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, and <b>118</b>, while the conventional latch <b>104</b> includes three PMOS transistors <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>124</b>, as well as two NMOS transistors <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For the latch <b>104</b>, the gates of the PMOS transistor <b>120</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>126</b> are tied together at a node <b>130</b> while the drains of both transistors <b>120</b> and <b>126</b> are also connected at a node <b>132</b>. The gates of the PMOS transistor <b>122</b> and the NMOS transistor <b>128</b> are coupled together at the node <b>132</b> while the drains of the two transistors <b>122</b> and <b>128</b> are also connected at the node <b>130</b>. The PMOS transistor <b>124</b> is implemented between the nodes <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> for biasing purposes. The sources of both PMOS transistors <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> are tied to a power supply while the sources of both NMOS transistors <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> are coupled to the basic sense amplifier <b>102</b> through nodes <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>. The PMOS transistors <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are implemented for pre-charge purposes for the amplifier <b>100</b> where the drain of the PMOS transistor <b>106</b> is coupled to the node <b>130</b> and the drain of the PMOS transistor <b>108</b> is coupled to the node <b>132</b>. Both gates of the PMOS transistors <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are coupled to their corresponding pre-charge signals that control the on and off states of the transistors to allow the power supply to pre-charge the amplifier <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the basic sense amplifier <b>102</b>, the NMOS transistor <b>118</b> is designed to control the operation state of the amplifier <b>100</b> in response to a sense amplifier enable signal provided at its gate. The gates of NMOS transistors <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> are tied to a bit lines signal BL and a complementary bit line signal BLB, respectively. Only one of the two NMOS transistors <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> is designed to be turned on at one time by a high signal provided from its corresponding bit line signal or complementary bit line signal. The sources of the NMOS transistors <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> are coupled together at a node <b>138</b>, while the drain of the NMOS transistor <b>114</b> is coupled to the node <b>134</b>, and the drain of the NMOS transistor <b>116</b> is coupled to the node <b>136</b>. The PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, with their gates connected to a pass-gate control signal, are implemented for selection of the entire latch type sense amplifier <b>100</b>. The PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> must be turned on in order for the amplifier <b>100</b> to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">During a write operation, the NMOS transistor <b>118</b> and the PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are all turned on. In an exemplary scenario, when the bit line signal BL is high and the complementary bit line signal BLB is low, the NMOS transistor <b>114</b> will be turned on and the NMOS transistor <b>116</b> will be turned off. This results in the node <b>134</b> being pulled low while the node <b>136</b> is pulled high by the bit line signal BL. Assuming that the node <b>130</b> is at a low state and the node <b>132</b> is at a high state before the PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are selected, the NMOS transistor <b>126</b> stays off and the NMOS transistor <b>128</b> stays on. After the PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are selected, the node <b>130</b> is charged to high by the bit line signal BL. As a result, the NMOS transistor <b>126</b> will be turned on, the PMOS transistor <b>120</b> will be turned off, and the value at the node <b>132</b> will be flipped from high to low.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This conventional latch type sense amplifier <b>100</b> is susceptible to mismatch issues between the NMOS transistors <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>. For example, the threshold voltages of the transistors may differ substantially, due to reasons such as fabrication process variation. Since the nodes <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> are charged or discharged through current paths across the NMOS transistors <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>, the mismatch issue may cause the timings for changing the nodes <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> to be imbalanced. In a serious case, this may cause the amplifier <b>100</b> to fail. As semiconductor devices continue to shrink in size as the processing technology advances, the mismatch issue becomes a critical reliability and performance concern in IC designs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an improved latch type sense amplifier <b>200</b> where additional transistors are implemented for improving its immunity to mismatch issues in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The improved latch type sense amplifier <b>200</b> includes a basic sense amplifier <b>202</b>, a latch <b>204</b>, two pre-charge PMOS transistors <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, and four pass-gate PMOS transistors <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. The basic sense amplifier <b>202</b> includes three NMOS transistors <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>222</b>, while the latch <b>204</b> includes two PMOS transistors <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>, as well as two NMOS transistors <b>228</b> and <b>230</b>.</p>

The PMOS transistors <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are implemented for pre-charge purposes for the entire latch type sense amplifier <b>200</b> where the drain of the PMOS transistor <b>206</b> is coupled to the node <b>232</b> and the drain of the PMOS transistor <b>208</b> is coupled to the node <b>234</b>. Both gates of the PMOS transistors <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are supplied with a pre-charge signal that controls the on and off states of the transistors to allow the power supply to pre-charge the amplifier <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the basic sense amplifier <b>202</b>, the NMOS transistor <b>222</b> is designed to control the operation state of the latch type sense amplifier <b>200</b> depending on a sense amplifier enable signal provided at its gate. The gate of the NMOS transistor <b>218</b> is connected to a bit line signal BL, while the gate of the NMOS transistor <b>220</b> is connected to the complementary bit line signal BLB. The signals BL and BLB are complementary in their values so that only one of the two NMOS transistors <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> is designed to be turned on at one time. The sources of the NMOS transistors <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> are coupled together at a node <b>240</b>, while the drain of the NMOS transistor <b>218</b> is coupled to the node <b>238</b> and the drain of the NMOS transistor <b>220</b> is coupled to the node <b>236</b>. The PMOS pass-gate transistors <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>, with their gates connected to a pass-gate control signal, are implemented for selection of the latch type sense amplifier <b>200</b>.

The high charge at the node <b>232</b> turns on the NMOS transistor <b>228</b> and turns off the PMOS transistor <b>224</b>.
