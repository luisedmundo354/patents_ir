<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for manufacturing an article having a peripheral portion (hereinafter referred to as “flanged article”) from a sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A known method for manufacturing a flanged article that comprises a central depressed body coupled to a peripheral flange is taught, for example, by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/103328, in which a material (e.g., a sheet material or a sheet blank) is placed and clamped between upper and lower dies of a press forming device and is then press formed or half die cut, to thereby form an intermediate flanged article that comprises a central depressed body and a peripheral flange. Thereafter, the intermediate flanged article thus formed is then processed by utilizing a squeezing device having upper and lower dies. That is, the intermediate flanged article is clamped between the upper and lower dies so that the peripheral flange is clamped between a clamp ring of the upper die and a piston of the lower die. At this time, the peripheral flange of the intermediate flanged article preferably projects or extends radially outwardly from the piston and the clamp ring, to thereby define an annular extending portion around the peripheral flange. Thereafter, the clamp ring and the punch will be pushed into a die opening of the lower die together with the piston. Consequently, the annular extending portion of the peripheral flange will be radially inwardly squeezed or compressed and the peripheral flange will thicken as a result of plastic flow caused by plastic deformation. Thus, the flanged article having the thickened peripheral flange is produced as the secondary product or final product. Unfortunately, previously known methods has a tendency to squeeze out during the operation to thicken the peripheral flange. The peripheral flange itself could end up uneven in regards to thickness based upon variations resulting from the squeezing out of material.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is, accordingly, one object of the present teachings to provide improved methods and apparatus for manufacturing flanged articles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, in one aspect of the present teachings, a method for manufacturing an article having a peripheral portion may include reverse squeezing an initial peripheral portion of an initial article to form a first intermediate article having a first intermediate peripheral portion that is partly thinned, and squeezing the first intermediate peripheral portion of the first intermediate article to form a second intermediate article having a second intermediate peripheral portion that is thickened throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present teachings, because the first intermediate peripheral portion is partly thinned, the first intermediate peripheral portion of the first intermediate article may effectively radially inwardly move by plastic deformation without substantially squeezing out when squeezed. As a result, the first intermediate peripheral portion can be effectively thickened so that the second intermediate article has the second intermediate peripheral portion that is reliably and evenly thickened throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the reverse squeezing operation is defined as a preliminary processing that is performed prior to the squeezing operation. Typically, the reverse squeezing operation is defined as a compressing operation for compressing the initial peripheral portion of the initial article in the opposite direction of the squeezing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be ready understood after reading the following detailed description together with the accompanying drawings and the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A detailed representative embodiment of the present teachings is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A) to 15(B)</figref>, in which a circular dish-like toothed recessed plate <b>420</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A)</figref>) is exemplified as a flanged article that can be prepared utilizing the present teachings. The recessed plate (i.e., final recessed plate) <b>420</b> is preferably formed by successively processing a previously formed, initial toothed recessed plate <b>20</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>. That is, the recessed plate <b>420</b> is preferably formed through first to third intermediate toothed recessed plates <b>120</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>(A)), <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>) and <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>) from the initial toothed recessed plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, such a recessed plate <b>420</b> may be utilized, e.g., with a housing that defines a locking mechanism for a vehicle seat reclining device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A)-1(C)</figref>, the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> as a primary product may preferably be formed by half die cutting a circular sheet material or sheet blank <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>). That is, the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> may preferably be formed from the sheet material <b>10</b> by a shear press forming operation. The initial recessed plate <b>20</b> thus formed may have a central circular depressed body (offset portion) <b>26</b> and an initial annular peripheral flange (i.e., an initial annular peripheral portion) <b>22</b> having a rectangular cross-sectional shape. The peripheral flange <b>22</b> is integrally and continuously connected to the central body <b>26</b> via an annular shear deformed connecting portion <b>28</b>. Consequently, the inner surface of the peripheral flange <b>22</b> and the top surface of the central body <b>26</b> define a circular open cavity or recess R<b>1</b>. In addition, two opposing toothed portions <b>24</b> are defined on an inner circular surface <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the peripheral flange <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(C)</figref>, the peripheral flange <b>22</b> may have substantially the same thickness as the central body <b>26</b>. Further, the central body <b>26</b> may have a central through bore <b>14</b> and a plurality of (six in this embodiment) depressed portions or dwells <b>12</b>. Typically, the central through bore <b>14</b> and the dwells <b>12</b> may preferably be formed in the sheet material <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the sheet material <b>10</b> may be formed by a variety of known methods, the sheet material <b>10</b> is preferably formed by stamping out a metal plate having a desired thickness. As noted above, the metal plate may preferably be a steel plate (e.g., a boron doped carbon steel plate) and known techniques for cold press forming may be utilized with the present teachings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A)-4(C)</figref>, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> as a secondary product may preferably be formed by partly processing the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. That is, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> may preferably be formed by radially and inwardly deforming (plastic deformation or plastically deforming) the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> (i.e., by a preliminary or reverse squeezing operation). The first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> thus produced may have the same construction as the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> except for the peripheral flange <b>22</b> and the toothed portions <b>24</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> may comprise a first intermediate annular peripheral flange (i.e., a first intermediate annular peripheral portion) <b>122</b> having an outer inclined circumferential surface <b>122</b><i>a</i>. Typically, part of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may be thickened so as to have a thickness greater than that of the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. Simultaneously, part of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may be thinned so as to have a thickness smaller than that of the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. Also, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> may comprise toothed portions <b>124</b> which are modified from the toothed portions <b>24</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. Each of the toothed portions <b>124</b> may have a height higher than that of the toothed portion <b>24</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, similar to the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>, the inner surface of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> and the top surface of the central body <b>26</b> define a circular open cavity or recess R<b>2</b>. As will be recognized, the recess R<b>2</b> may have a depth greater than that of the recess R<b>1</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(A)-7(C)</figref>, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> as a tertiary product may preferably be formed by partly processing the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>. That is, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> may preferably be formed by further radially and inwardly deforming (plastic deformation or plastically deforming) the peripheral flange <b>122</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> (i.e., by a squeezing operation). The second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> thus produced may have the same construction as the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> except for the peripheral flange <b>122</b> and the toothed portions <b>124</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> may comprise a second intermediate annular peripheral flange (i.e., a second intermediate annular peripheral portion) <b>222</b> having a rectangular shape in cross section. That is, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> is evenly thickened throughout and does not have any inclined circumferential surface similar to the inclined surface <b>122</b><i>a </i>of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>. Typically, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> may have substantially the same thickness as (or a thickness greater than that of) the partly thickened peripheral flange <b>122</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>. Also, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> may comprise toothed portions <b>224</b>. Each of the toothed portions <b>224</b> may have substantially the same height as (or a height higher than that of) the toothed portion <b>124</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>. As will be easily understood, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> may have an outer diameter smaller than that of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> may have upwardly projecting small burrs or flashes <b>223</b> which are formed around an upper circumferential periphery during the plastic deformation of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(A)-10(C)</figref>, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> as a quaternary product may preferably be formed by partly processing the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b>. That is, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> may preferably be formed by circumferentially finishing the peripheral flange <b>222</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> (i.e., by a finishing operation) and simultaneously punching the central body <b>26</b> thereof along an axis of the central through bore <b>14</b>. The third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> thus produced may have the same construction as the second intermediate recessed plate <b>20</b> except for a part thereof. That is, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> may preferably comprise a central body <b>326</b> and a third intermediate annular peripheral flange (i.e., a third intermediate annular peripheral portion) <b>322</b>. The central body <b>326</b> has an enlarged central through bore <b>327</b>. The bore <b>327</b> is formed by the punching operation and has a diameter greater than that of the central through bore <b>14</b>. Further, the peripheral flange <b>322</b> is substantially identical with the peripheral flange <b>222</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> except that the flashes <b>223</b> are completely removed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(A)-13(C)</figref>, the final recessed plate <b>420</b> may preferably be formed by partly processing the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b>. That is, the final recessed plate <b>420</b> may preferably be formed by vertically pressing the peripheral flange <b>322</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> (i.e., by a restriking or coining operation). The final recessed plate <b>420</b> thus produced may have the same construction as the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> except for the peripheral flange <b>322</b> and the toothed portions <b>324</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(C)</figref>, the final recessed plate <b>420</b> may have a final annular peripheral flange (i.e., a final annular peripheral portion) <b>422</b>. As will be appreciated, the peripheral flange <b>422</b> may have a desired thickness. Typically, the peripheral flange <b>422</b> may have a thickness slightly smaller than that of the peripheral flange <b>322</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b>. Also, the final recessed plate <b>420</b> may comprise toothed portions <b>424</b>. Each of the toothed portions <b>424</b> may have a desired height which corresponds to the thickness of the peripheral flange <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the inner surface of the peripheral flange <b>422</b> and the top surface of the central body <b>326</b> define a circular open cavity or recess R<b>3</b>. Typically, the recess R<b>3</b> may have a depth slightly smaller than that of the recess R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The initial recessed plate <b>20</b> may be formed by utilizing a press forming device <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thereafter, the intermediate recessed plate <b>20</b> is preferably subsequently processed by utilizing a reverse squeezing device <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), a squeezing device <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a finishing device <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and a restriking or coining device <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), to thereby form the final recessed plate <b>420</b>.</p>

The ejector <b>78</b> may be coupled to a plurality of hydraulically controlled pressure pins <b>79</b> so as to be upwardly biased or forced. Preferably, the ejector <b>78</b> is designed so as to be normally upwardly projected from the lower die <b>76</b>. Further, the ejector <b>78</b> is formed with a plurality of recesses <b>77</b> that can receive the dwells <b>12</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A representative method for manufacturing the recessed plate <b>420</b> using the devices <b>1</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, a circular sheet material <b>10</b> is first disposed on the ejector <b>38</b> of the lower die assembly of the press forming device <b>1</b> such that the dwells <b>12</b> formed in the sheet material <b>10</b> engage the recesses <b>35</b> of the ejector <b>38</b>. Subsequently, the upper die assembly is lowered so that the periphery of the sheet material <b>10</b> is clamped between the lower die <b>36</b> and the clamp ring <b>32</b> of the upper die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the punch <b>30</b>, which is movably received within the clamp ring <b>32</b>, is then extended (e.g., lowered) toward the die opening <b>37</b> defined within the lower die <b>36</b>. As a result, the sheet material <b>10</b> is shear press formed or half die cut, to thereby form the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> as the primary product. Further, when the sheet material <b>10</b> is press formed, the toothed portions <b>24</b> are simultaneously formed along the inner circular surface <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the peripheral flange <b>22</b>, because tooth forming edges <b>31</b> are defined around the circumference of the punch <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Because the ejector <b>38</b> is upwardly biased or forced during the press forming step, the punch <b>30</b> will be lowered against the upward reactive force of the ejector <b>38</b>. Further, the punch <b>30</b> is preferably controlled in order to be lowered a predetermined distance so that the connecting portion <b>28</b> will have the desired thickness. That is, persons skilled in the art can easily determine the predetermined distance for lowering the punch <b>30</b> in order to appropriately define the circular recess R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After completing the press forming operation, the punch <b>30</b> is retracted or withdrawn and then the upper die assembly is lifted or removed. As a result, the ejector <b>38</b> will be upwardly returned to its resting position due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>39</b>. Thus, the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> will be ejected from the die opening <b>37</b> of the lower die <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The initial recessed plate <b>20</b> thus formed comprises the central circular depressed body <b>26</b> and the peripheral flange <b>22</b> that are interconnected via the annular connecting portion <b>28</b>. At this time, the circular body <b>26</b> and the peripheral flange <b>22</b> will have substantially the same thickness as the sheet material <b>10</b>. The initial recessed plate <b>20</b> also includes the circular recess R<b>1</b> that is defined by the peripheral flange <b>22</b> and the central body <b>26</b>. In addition, two toothed portions <b>24</b> are formed around the inner circular surface <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the peripheral flange <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The initial recessed plate <b>20</b> is then processed by utilizing the reverse squeezing device <b>100</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(A)</figref>, the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> is placed or seated on the ejector <b>48</b> of the lower die assembly such that the dwells <b>12</b> engage the recesses <b>45</b> of the ejector <b>48</b>. Subsequently, the upper die assembly is lowered so that the central body <b>26</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> is clamped between the retainer <b>40</b> and the ejector <b>48</b>. At this time, the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> is seated on the lower die <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(B)</figref>, the reverse squeezing punch <b>42</b> is then extended (e.g., lowered) toward the lower die <b>46</b>. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b> will be vertically reverse squeezed or compressed by the reverse squeezing surface <b>43</b> of the punch <b>42</b>, to thereby form the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> as the secondary product.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">After completing the reverse squeezing operation, the punch <b>42</b> is retracted or withdrawn and then the upper die assembly is lifted or removed. As a result, the ejector <b>48</b> will be upwardly returned to its resting position due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>49</b>. Thus, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> will be ejected from the lower die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> thus formed may comprise the central body <b>26</b> and the annular peripheral flange <b>122</b> having the outer inclined circumferential surface <b>122</b><i>a</i>. Typically, at this time, part of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may be thickened so as to have a thickness greater than that of the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. Simultaneously, part of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may be thinned so as to have a thickness smaller than that of the peripheral flange <b>22</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>. Also, the height of the toothed portions <b>124</b> will be higher than that of the toothed portion <b>24</b> of the initial recessed plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> is then processed by utilizing the squeezing device <b>200</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> is placed or seated on the ejector <b>59</b> of the lower die assembly such that the dwells <b>12</b> engage the recesses <b>51</b> of the ejector <b>59</b>. Subsequently, the upper die assembly is lowered so that the central body <b>26</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> is clamped between the retainer <b>50</b> and the ejector <b>59</b>. At this time, the ejector <b>59</b> is retracted in the depressed portion <b>53</b> of the piston <b>58</b> and the peripheral flange <b>122</b> is also clamped between the lower leading end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the clamp ring <b>52</b> and the piston <b>58</b>. That is, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> is restrained vertically by the lower leading end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the clamp ring <b>52</b> and the piston <b>58</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> preferably projects or extends radially outwardly from the clamp ring end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>and the piston <b>58</b>. In this case, an annular extending portion <b>122</b><i>b </i>will be defined around the peripheral flange <b>122</b>. Further, an annular space <b>123</b> will be defined between the clamp ring end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>and the peripheral flange inclined surface <b>122</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref>, the upper die assembly is further moved (e.g., lowered) toward the lower die assembly. Thus, the clamp ring end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>and the retainer <b>50</b> will be pushed into the die opening <b>55</b> together with the piston <b>58</b> and the ejector <b>59</b> against the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>58</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the clamped first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> is also pushed into the die opening <b>55</b> via the guide surface <b>57</b>. Consequently, the annular extending portion <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> will be radially inwardly (laterally) squeezed or compressed by the guide surface <b>57</b> so as to radially inwardly move or migrate as a result of plastic flow caused by plastic deformation. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may preferably be deformed so as to fill up the annular space <b>123</b>. That is, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> may preferably be deformed so that the inclined surface <b>122</b><i>a </i>disappears (i.e., transforms into a vertical and horizontal surfaces). Thus, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> having the thickened peripheral flange <b>222</b> is produced as the tertiary product. Further, as described above, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> may be formed with the small flashes <b>223</b> around the upper circumferential periphery thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As will be recognized, because the annular space <b>123</b> is defined between the clamp ring end portion <b>52</b><i>a </i>and the peripheral flange inclined surface <b>122</b><i>a</i>, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> can be easily and reliably deformed. In other words, the peripheral flange annular extending portion <b>122</b><i>b </i>will effectively radially inwardly move by plastic deformation without excessively squeezing out. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>122</b> can be substantially completely converted to the peripheral flange <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the clamp ring <b>52</b> is downwardly forced by means of the pressure pins <b>54</b> and the piston <b>58</b> and the ejector <b>59</b> are respectively upwardly forced by means of the pressure pins <b>58</b><i>a </i>and <b>59</b><i>a</i>. As a result, during the squeezing operation, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> can be appropriately supported in the squeezing device <b>200</b>. Therefore, the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b> can be effectively prevented from bending, e.g., at the connecting portion <b>28</b>. As will be recognized, the pressure pins <b>54</b> may preferably be controlled such that the clamp ring <b>52</b> can be appropriately retracted (i.e., moved upwardly) when the peripheral flange <b>122</b> is deformed or thickened.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">After completing the squeezing operation, the upper die assembly is lifted or removed. As a result, the piston <b>58</b> will be upwardly returned to its resting position due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>58</b><i>a </i>and then the ejector <b>59</b> is upwardly returned due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pin <b>59</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> will be ejected from the lower die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> thus formed may comprise the central body <b>26</b> and the annular peripheral flange <b>222</b> having the flashes <b>223</b>. Typically, at this time, the thickness of the peripheral flange <b>222</b> will be greater than that of the peripheral flange <b>122</b> of the first intermediate recessed plate <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> is then processed by utilizing the finishing device <b>300</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref>, the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> is placed or seated on the ejector <b>68</b> of the lower die assembly such that the dwells <b>12</b> engage the recesses <b>67</b> of the ejector <b>68</b>. Subsequently, the upper die assembly is lowered so that the central body <b>26</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> is clamped between the retainer <b>60</b> and the annular shoulder <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the lower die <b>66</b>. At this time, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> is also clamped between the annular shoulder <b>60</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>60</b> and the lower die <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref>, the finishing punch <b>62</b> is then extended (e.g., lowered) toward the lower die <b>66</b>. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>222</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b> is preferably circumferentially finished or processed by the punch <b>62</b> so that the flashes <b>223</b> are cut off or removed from the peripheral flange <b>222</b>. Simultaneously, the punching pin <b>64</b> is extended (e.g., lowered) toward the punching element <b>63</b> so as to form the central through bore <b>327</b> in the central body <b>26</b>. Thus, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> is formed as the quaternary product.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">After completing the finishing operation, the punch <b>62</b> and the punching pin <b>64</b> are retracted or withdrawn and then the upper die assembly is lifted or removed. As a result, the ejector <b>68</b> will be upwardly returned to its resting position due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>69</b>. Thus, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> will be ejected from the lower die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> thus formed may comprise the central body <b>326</b> and the annular peripheral flange <b>322</b>. At this time, the thickness of the peripheral flange <b>322</b> will be substantially identical with that of the peripheral flange <b>222</b> of the second intermediate recessed plate <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">This finishing operation is an optional operation and not an essential operation. Therefore, this operation can be omitted, if necessary. If the finishing operation is omitted, the punching operation for forming the central through bore <b>327</b> can preferably be performed during any other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> is then processed by utilizing the restriking device <b>400</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(A)</figref>, the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> is placed or seated on the ejector <b>78</b> of the lower die assembly such that the dwells <b>12</b> engage the recesses <b>77</b> of the ejector <b>78</b>. Subsequently, the upper die assembly is lowered so that the central body <b>326</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> is clamped between the retainer <b>70</b> and the ejector <b>78</b>. At this time, the peripheral flange <b>322</b> is seated on the lower restriking die <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(B)</figref>, the clamp ring <b>74</b> is then downwardly forced. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>322</b> is restrained radially by the retainer <b>70</b> and the clamp ring <b>74</b>. Thereafter, the punch <b>72</b> is extended (e.g., lowered) toward the lower die <b>76</b>. As a result, the peripheral flange <b>322</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b> is preferably restriked vertically between the punch <b>72</b> and the lower die <b>76</b>. Thus, the final recessed plate <b>420</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After completing the restriking operation, the punch <b>72</b> and the clamp ring <b>74</b> are retracted or withdrawn and then the upper die assembly is lifted or removed. As a result, the ejector <b>78</b> will be upwardly returned to its resting position due to the hydraulic force of the pressure pins <b>79</b>. Thus, the recessed plate <b>420</b> will be ejected from the lower die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The recessed plate <b>420</b> thus formed may comprise the central body <b>326</b> and the annular peripheral flange <b>422</b>. At this time, the thickness of the peripheral flange <b>422</b> will be slightly smaller than that of the peripheral flange <b>322</b> of the third intermediate recessed plate <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Optionally, the recessed plate <b>420</b> thus formed may be further treated or processed (e.g., machining or heat treating) by utilizing one or more additional processing machines (not shown), to thereby produce a further finished product. In addition, the second and third intermediate recessed plates <b>222</b> and <b>322</b> also can be used as a final product, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The present methods include the preliminary or reverse squeezing operation prior to the squeezing operation. Therefore, the squeezing operation can be effectively and reliably performed. As a result, it is possible to provide a flanged article superior in quality.</p>
