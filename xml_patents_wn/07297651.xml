<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to European Application No. 05104812.2 filed in the European Patent Office on Jun. 2, 2005 of which is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for removing hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from gas streams, by using a redox process and removing the resulting sulfur particles from an aqueous catalyst solution used during the redox process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The presence of hydrogen sulfide in gas streams causes different problems in oil, gas and petrochemical industries and even wood and drink industries. Removing H<sub>2</sub>S from gas streams has, hence, changed to a necessary process. Furthermore, the regulations of environment conservation organizations, on the permitted amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S are getting more and more strict every day. This is mainly because of the poisonous and corrosive effects of H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Application of an aqueous solution of a polyvalent metal chelate catalyst for the oxidative removing of H<sub>2</sub>S, from gas streams and its conversion to elemental sulfur has been well known. In these processes, H<sub>2</sub>S-containing gas is contacted with an aqueous solution of a polyvalent metal chelate in a contact zone. The contactor can be any suitable device for gas—liquid contact, such as an absorber, a static mixer, a venturi scrubber, or even a combination of all. The aqueous catalyst solution absorbs H<sub>2</sub>S and converts it to elemental sulfur rapidly. As a result of this the higher oxidation state of the ion is reduced to its lower state. The lower oxidation state of the ion metal is then oxidized, as a result of contact with an oxygen containing gas to its higher oxidation state and is returned to the contact zone. Such reactions are called liquid Redox reactions. The separation of the solid particles can take place either before or after regenerating of the polyvalent metal chelate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to settling or sedimentation of sulfur particles, however, the contactor can become plugged. If the settling happens to a great extent and the tower is plugged, this will perturb the contactor, in particular an absorber, and it will ultimately flood. In the case of the application of an absorber, filled with a packing, the choice of the packing material is also important. Usually a suitable packing has to be selected, which results in the least setting of solid sulfur particles. Often, such a packing does not exhibit optimum reaction rates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,754 discloses a process for removing sulfur particles from an aqueous polyvalent metal ion or polyvalent metal chelate solution by a method of sinking the sulfur particles (gravity sedimentation) in a zone. In order to reduce foam and/or froth floating on a surface of the zone, sulfur particles suspended as a froth or foam are agitated and removed in a plurality of streams including at least one stream at a short distance from the top of the solution in the zone and at least one stream from the bottom of the solution in the zone. Subsequently, the streams are recombined for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,238 discloses another process for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from a sour gaseous stream, wherein an aqueous alkaline solution is contacted with a polyvalent metal chelate in a higher valence state in order to oxidize the hydrogen sulfide or sulfide present to sulfur. Particular measures for preventing clogging of sulfur particles in the oxidizer are not disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">EP 0 582 337 A discloses another process for removing hydrogen sulfide from a gas mixture. U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,351 discloses another process for removing hydrogen sulfide from a process gas, wherein a closed loop evaporator/condenser process is interposed in the sulfur washing/filtering/recovery process in order to recover and re-use a catalytic polyvalent metal redox solution. Wash water used to purify the sulfur and any polyvalent metal redox solution recovered from a sulfur melter are fed to an evaporator to concentrate the redox solution to a concentration capable of effective absorption of hydrogen sulfide. Furthermore, the water evaporated in the evaporator is condensed as pure water for use in washing and/or filtering the recovered sulfur. Particular measures for preventing clogging of sulfur particles in the oxidizer are not disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP 0 186 235 A1 discloses a process for removal of acid gases from a sour gaseous stream. In the process a sour gaseous stream comprising H<sub>2</sub>S is contacted in a column with an aqueous reactant solution comprising an effective amount of Fe(III) chelate of an organic acid to obtain a sweet gaseous stream and a mixture including solid sulfur and Fe(II) chelate of the acid. Degradation of the iron chelate in the reactant solution employed in the cyclic process is inhibited by maintaining a relatively high Fe(II) chelate concentration by carrying out the regeneration step in the column as a plug flow contracting procedure. The problem of foaming and flooding of the oxidizer is not discussed specifically. The flow state in the oxidizer zone is not addressed specifically. Separation of the sulfur particles takes place in a separate vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,253 B1 discloses a process for desulfurization of a gaseous feed containing hydrogen sulfide. The sulfur particles and the reduced catalyst solution are separated in a preliminary step and the stream of reduced catalyst solution is sent to a downstream oxidizer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">General principles for use of ferric chelates for the oxidization of hydrogen sulfide are disclosed in lliuta I., et al., ‘Concept of bifunctional Redox iron-chelate process for H2S removal in pulp and paper atmospheric emissions’, Chemical Engineering Science, Oxford, GB, volume 58, no. 34-24, December 2003, pages 5305-5314.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a more efficient, reliable and economical process for removing sulfur particles from an aqueous catalyst solution used to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas stream. It is another object of the present invention to provide a more efficient, reliable and economical process for removing hydrogen sulfide and recovering sulfur from a gas stream. According to another aspect of the invention excessive foaming and flooding of the oxidizer zone is to be avoided in such a process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for removing sulfur particles from an aqueous catalyst solution used to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas stream, comprising the steps of: directing a flow of a suspension comprising reduced catalyst solution and sulfur particles to an oxidizer zone, where the catalyst solution is regenerated by contacting said suspension with a gas containing oxygen; and removing sulfur from said suspension at least by gravity sedimentation at a bottom of said oxidizer zone; wherein a flow deflecting means is disposed at least at an outlet for the oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone for reducing any turbulent state caused at least by a stream of oxidized catalyst solution leaving said oxidizer zone such as to reduce foaming and plugging of the whole system. Thus, excessive foaming is prevented according to the present invention. Furthermore, gravity sedimentation of sulfur particles is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment the flow deflecting means is a baffle disposed under an acute angle with a circumferential surface or wall of the vessel surface of said oxidizer zone such that said streams of oxidized catalyst solution leaving said oxidizer zone are deflected to another direction before leaving said oxidizer zone. Of course, the flow of oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone can be deflected such that the streams within the liquid phase of the oxidizer zone are supported, in particular such that the streams within the liquid phase of the oxidizer zone remain in a laminar state. Further, according to this embodiment the baffle means effectively shields the outlet for the reduced catalyst solution as to prevent the direct transfer of solid sulfur particles during sedimentation within the oxidizer zone into the stream of oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to further embodiments, the afore-mentioned flow deflecting means may also be disposed alternatively or additionally at any inlet or outlet where streams enter or leave the oxidizer zone, in particular a lower section thereof used for sedimentation of sulfur particles by gravity, such as to reduce foaming and plugging of the whole system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment said oxidizer zone is a bubble column, the gas containing oxygen is bubbled into said column by means of at least one sparger so that lighter sulfur particles go up to an upper surface of a liquid phase within said column, and said flow of suspension enters said column at a position vertically disposed at a short distance below said upper surface. Thus, the convection-like roll of streams in the liquid phase within the oxidizer zone is further supported.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention that can also be combined with any other embodiment disclosed herein there is provided a process for removing sulfur particles from an aqueous catalyst solution used to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas stream, comprising the steps of: directing a flow of a suspension comprising reduced catalyst solution and sulfur particles to an oxidizer zone, where the catalyst solution is regenerated by contacting said suspension with a gas containing oxygen; and removing sulfur from said suspension at least by gravity sedimentation at a bottom of said oxidizer zone; wherein the bottom of the oxidizer zone comprises a downwardly slanted surface and a gas is additionally injected at said bottom of said oxidizer zone substantially in parallel or tangentially to said slanted surface for avoiding sedimentation and agglomeration of sulfur particles on said bottom. According to this aspect of the invention, any settled sulfur may be ‘blown’ or pushed away towards the center part of the bottom part where an outlet for transferring the slurry to a subsequent process stage is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another embodiment lighter sulfur particles and/or foam floating on a surface of said liquid phase are collected by a sweeper rotating at low speed and removed from said oxidizer zone for further processing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">The present invention relates to the reduction of foaming and plugging in processes where H<sub>2</sub>S is separated from H<sub>2</sub>S-containing gas streams, by being contacted with an aqueous catalyst solution comprising a chelate of a polyvalent metal ion, which is preferably an iron chelate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the overall process comprises three major sections, namely the contact zone <b>6</b>, the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> and the separator zone <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sour or acid gas <b>1</b> is fed via a heat exchanger E<b>1</b> and line <b>2</b> to a gas-liquid-separator <b>3</b>, which separates any liquid heavy hydrocarbons and water to line <b>4</b>, as outlined further below. The separated gaseous hydrocarbons are fed via line <b>5</b>, Venturi scrubber <b>10</b> and line <b>8</b> to the contact zone <b>6</b>. More specifically, the acid or sour gas stream <b>8</b> enters the contact zone <b>6</b> at a bottom part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">The contact zone <b>6</b> can be an absorber, a static mixer, a venturi scrubber or a combination thereof. Preferably, according to the present invention the contact zone <b>6</b> is a Venturi scrubber. In the contact zone <b>6</b>, the H<sub>2</sub>S-containing gas stream, which enters the contact zone <b>6</b> via the inlet <b>8</b>, is contacted with the aqueous solution of the catalyst, containing the polyvalent metal ion chelate, at temperatures lower than the melting point of sulfur. According to this embodiment, the polyvalent metal ion chelate is preferably a Fe<sup>3+</sup> chelate, although the present invention is not limited thereto. As a result of the contact, the higher oxidation state of the metal ion (Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the case of an iron chelate) is reduced to its lower oxidation state (reduced state; Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the case of an iron chelate), and the ionic sulfur is oxidized to its elemental form, according to the following reactions (1-3):</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="33.95mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US07297651-20071120-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">In this process, solid sulfur particles are formed. As a result of this fast process about 90% of the sulfur content of the gas stream <b>8</b> is removed. The mixture of the solid sulfur particles and of the different oxidation states of the metal ion chelate (a mixture of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the case of the application of the iron chelate), forming a slurry, leaves the contact zone <b>6</b> via line <b>12</b> at the bottom of the contact zone <b>6</b> and is pumped, by means of pump P<b>1</b>, to the inlet <b>13</b> of the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>, which will be described in more detail below. The substantially H<sub>2</sub>S-free gas leaves the contact zone <b>6</b> via the outlet line <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">More specifically, the substantially H<sub>2</sub>S-free gas starts an upward movement in the contact zone <b>6</b>, where some aqueous catalyst is injected to the contact zone <b>6</b> from its top part via inlet <b>7</b>. Thus, the aqueous catalyst solution flows down by gravity while the gas rises counter-currently through the contact zone <b>6</b>. In the contact zone <b>6</b> a mass transfer takes place across the gas-liquid interface thus formed. Thereby, the probability of the formation of the black FeS impurity is minimized, so that it starts a downward movement, opposite to that of the up-going gas, eliminating the remaining 10% of the sulfur.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">Flooding of the system, in particular of the contact zone <b>6</b>, can also be controlled and prevented by using a cascade control system. The control system holds the Δp of the system (the pressure difference between the outlet <b>11</b> and the inlet <b>8</b> of the contact zone <b>6</b>) at a certain predetermined value by varying the flow of hydrocarbon gas stream <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">Extensive experiments of the inventors surprisingly have revealed that the presence of high amounts of heavy hydrocarbons in the absorber can also lead to foaming and the consequent flooding in the various stages of the process, in particular in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>, because heavy hydrocarbons change the surface tension. For preventing high amounts of heavy hydrocarbons, more specifically for preventing excessive foaming and the resulting flooding in the various stages of the process, the H<sub>2</sub>S-containing gas stream <b>1</b> is optionally passed through a cooler E<b>1</b> to keep the temperature of the H<sub>2</sub>S-containing gas stream <b>1</b> within a suitable range, preferably in the temperature range between 30° C. and 40° C., and is then passed through a gas-liquid-separator <b>3</b> for separating liquid particles from the gas stream <b>2</b>. The gas-liquid separator <b>3</b> can rely on any of the known concepts of mechanical gas-liquid separation, namely gravity (knock-out) separation, centrifugal (cyclone) separation, separation by impingement and separation by filters. More preferably, according to the present invention the gas-liquid separator is a gravity or knock-out drum having inlet and outlet connections located on the upper portion of a vessel. The force used to separate the liquid heavy hydrocarbons from the gas stream <b>2</b> is gravity. The gas velocity should be relatively low in this embodiment in order for separation to occur. After separation, the heavy hydrocarbon content which is in a liquid state exits via outlet <b>4</b> at the bottom of the drum <b>3</b> to thereby prevent the subsequent flooding of the contact zone <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">The slurry formed at the bottom of the contact zone <b>6</b>, which is the spent or reduced catalyst solution together with solid sulfur particles, from both the contact zone <b>6</b> and the top part of thereof, is pumped, by pump P<b>1</b>, to heat exchanger E<b>2</b>, before it enters the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>. The heat exchanger E<b>2</b> adjusts the temperature of the slurry to a temperature well below a degradation temperature of the catalyst solution, above which the catalyst degradation is relatively high. More specifically, the heat exchanger E<b>2</b> keeps the temperature of the slurry a predetermined amount below the degradation temperature. In the exemplary embodiment, where polyvalent iron chelate is used as a catalyst, the temperature is adjusted in the range between 30° C. and 50° C., i.e. at a temperature lower than a temperature where the regeneration process is substantially slowed down and not higher than 50° C., above which temperature the catalyst degradation is relatively high.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">According to another embodiment the contact zone <b>6</b> is an absorber. As schematically indicated by reference numeral <b>15</b>, the absorber may contain a packing of a proper physical structure which will reduce the settlement of the solid sulfur particles that are formed during the process on the packing, which may cause plugging of the absorber, turbulancy of the streams and finally the flooding of the absorber. According to the present invention, such a packing consists of a plurality of packing elements that will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which shows an exemplary embodiment of a packing element used according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the packing element <b>50</b> consists of two ring members <b>51</b> that are interconnected by webs <b>52</b> that form concavely curved wing-shaped surfaces that extend radially inwards. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the free ends of the webs <b>52</b> are adjacent to each other but do not contact each other, thereby leaving a free space. Thus, the packing elements <b>50</b> have a very high surface area to be wetted by the catalyst solution. The packing elements let the up-moving gas stream face a much larger surface area wetted by the catalyst solution. The remaining sulfur content of the gas stream reacts with the down-going catalyst solution, on the wetted packing, and approximately all of its sulfur content is removed in this way. The approximately completely H<sub>2</sub>S-free gas leaves from the top part of the absorber <b>6</b> via outlet <b>11</b>, while the down moving reduced catalyst solution joins the other reduced solution, which is from the Venturi scrubber, at the bottom of the absorber <b>6</b>. Extensive experiments of the inventors proved that application of packing material as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, preferably of stainless steel, leads to the least settlement of the solid particles, thereby reducing the probability of flooding of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">The packing is also put in the system in a way that it results in a minimum pressure drop in the system. The lower pressure drop moves the operating point farther away from the critical pressure drop at which flooding occurs (typically 10-20 mbar/m), which means additional vapor/liquid handling capability. This is done by putting the packing in a structured way in the three ends of the absorber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">More specifically, according to another preferred embodiment according to the present invention a part of the absorber <b>6</b> is filled with a structured packing whereas the remaining part of the absorber <b>6</b> is filled with a random packing as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In such an embodiment the random packing may have an aspect ratio of only 1:3, i.e. its height is typically only ⅓ of its diameter, which has a profound effect on the process performance of the packing. In operation, the flat ringshaped packing members tend to orient themselves preferentially in a ‘near-horizontal’ position, i.e. with their cylindrical axis predominantly in the direction of the gas and liquid flow, which results in a lower pressure drop due to an easier gas passage, and in a higher capacity. According to another preferred embodiment, the ringshaped packing members are arranged in cylindrical passages with an outer diameter of about 5 cm. Those parts with a structured packing may be provided adjacent in horizontal or vertical direction of the absorber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">As will become apparent to the person skilled in the art, the present invention is not limited to the use of random packing of the type schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as a packing for the absorber <b>6</b>. In general, other packings may also be used, e.g. conjugate ring packings, VSP ring packings, ball ring packings, saddles, Teller packings, rosette packings, helix packings, polyhedral hollow ball packings. Other structured packings that are also contemplated for use according to the present invention include oblique, gauze, perforated and corrugated plate packings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">In the following, the oxidizer zone according to the present invention will be described in more detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the oxidizer is formed as a cylindrical vessel <b>20</b> having a conical bottom <b>21</b>. The slurry exiting the bottom of the contact zone <b>6</b>, i.e. the spent or reduced catalyst solution together with solid sulfur particles, enters the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> via inlet <b>13</b> and via an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical vessel <b>20</b>, below the top surface of the liquid phase within the vessel <b>20</b>. The temperature of the slurry is adjusted in the optimum range by the heat exchanger E<b>2</b>, as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Air or another gas containing oxygen is blown into the cylindrical part of vessel <b>20</b> via line <b>22</b>, suitably at a distance to the transition region between the bottom part <b>21</b> and the cylindrical part of the vessel <b>20</b>. In the vessel <b>20</b> as result of the reaction of the reduced catalyst with the oxygen containing gas, e.g. air, the lower oxidation state of the metal ion in the chelate (Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the case of an iron chelate) is oxidized to its higher oxidation state (Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the case of an iron chelate). The reactions can be summarized by (4) and (5) as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">More specifically, air bubbles are blown into the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> by means of a sparger <b>23</b>, which is connected with line <b>22</b>. The oxidizer zone <b>20</b> is preferably a bubbling column partially filed with the liquid phase, i.e. the reduced catalyst solution and the slurry, into which air or another air containing gas is bubbled.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">The sparger <b>23</b> induces an upward movement of air bubbles in the liquid phase. Furthermore, also some very small (lighter) sulfur particles <b>25</b> go up (rise) in the liquid phase within the vessel <b>20</b>. As an additional component also heavy hydrocarbons, no matter how it has found its way to the oxidizer, contribute to this upward stream within the vessel <b>20</b>. Thereby, a foam is generated on the top surface of the liquid phase within the oxidizer <b>20</b>, which is to be avoided according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">To reduce the effects of foaming, a low speed sweeper <b>29</b> driven by an electromotor <b>30</b> having a speed of 5-10 rpms is provided at the top end of the vessel <b>20</b>. When rotating, the sweeper <b>29</b> collects any foam generated on the top surface of the liquid phase and leads it to a channel <b>37</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to transfer the foam, via line <b>37</b>′, to a coalescer (V<b>3</b>) wherein the first steps of the separation process are performed and which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bottom of the sweeper <b>29</b> is flush with the surface of the liquid phase within the oxidizer <b>20</b>. At a peripheral portion of the oxidizer <b>20</b>, a channel <b>37</b> is formed by a vertical wall, whose top end is substantially flush with the surface of the liquid phase within the oxidizer <b>20</b>, and a horizontal wall. Thus, any foam generated on the surface of the liquid phase within the oxidizer <b>20</b> is pushed by the rotating sweeper <b>29</b> over the top edge of the vertical wall into channel <b>37</b>, from where the foam is guided, via line <b>37</b>′, to the coalescer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the oxidizer <b>20</b> is composed of two virtually separated sections, namely the upper first section above the sparger <b>23</b> and the lower second section below the sparger <b>23</b>. In the upper first section the reaction between the catalyst and the air containing gas streams happens. In this first section, according to the chemical principles involved, turbulancy of the fluid streams is useful because it increases the reaction rate and efficiency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the volume and dimensions of this first section are relatively large compared to the amount of the catalyst flow. On the other hand, the second lower section acts as a ‘sulfur settling’ section or ‘catalyst clarifier’ section, where the sulfur particles are separated from the catalyst streams. In this section, the turbulancy is reduced so that the heavier sulfur particles can settle and the lighter ones can go up to the surface of the liquid held in the vessel <b>20</b>. In order to reduce turbulent effects in the lower section of the oxidizer in the present invention, the application of flow deflecting means, particularly the application of special baffles, is proposed. As a result of the use of flow deflecting means, in particular baffles, and also taking other measures like simultaneous settlement and floating separations, adding a coagulant in a proper time and place, use of a sweeper, and use of a special packing in the absorber zone, as explained in more detail in this invention, the plugging and foaming effects in the whole system are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">On the other hand, the larger sulfur particles <b>26</b> or those enlarged as a result of attaching to one another (agglomeration) have a tendency to settle in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> (sedimentation by gravity). Extensive experiments of the inventors revealed that one of the measures to reduce plugging and foaming effects in the whole system is to reduce any turbulent state in the lower second section of the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">In order to reduce any significant disturbing effect of the stream of oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> on the streams within the liquid phase in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>, according to the present invention a flow deflecting plate or similar means is disposed in the region near the outlet <b>35</b>, in a manner similar to that to be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flow deflecting plate <b>34</b> consists of a substantially slanted portion <b>34</b>, which extends under an acute angle substantially in a vertically upward direction towards the top of line <b>35</b>. Thus, according to this embodiment the flow of oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> is smoothly deflected in a substantially horizontal direction so that the streams of liquid in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> are substantially not effected and in particular no turbulent state is caused. Furthermore, the flow deflecting plate <b>34</b> also shields the orifice of line <b>35</b> from solid sulfur particles settling in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>. Thus, the flow deflecting plate <b>34</b> effectively prevents the direct flow of settling sulfur particles into the stream of oxidized catalyst solution leaving the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> via outlet line <b>35</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flow deflecting plate <b>34</b> substantially covers the entire cross section of line <b>35</b>. As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art, the flow deflecting plate <b>34</b> may, of course, also be curved in a convex manner. As no turbulent state is induced in the liquid phase in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>, settlement process (sedimentation by gravity) of the larger sulfur particles <b>26</b> is made more efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065">As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art, a plurality of such flow deflecting plates can also be disposed at equiangular distances around the circumference of the cylindrical vessel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">According to a further embodiment (not shown), a similar flow deflecting plate may also be disposed within the path or stream of the slurry flowing out of the line <b>13</b> and into the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>. Thus, according to this embodiment the slurry flow cannot directly enter the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> but is smoothly deflected into another direction so that the slurry flow entering the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> will not disturb the streams within the liquid phase in the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> significantly. In particular, the slurry flow will not cause further turbulent effects in the liquid phase.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">In the following, the agglomeration of sulfur particles at the bottom of the oxidizer zone will be discussed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Extensive experiments of the inventors revealed also, that the solid sulfur particles <b>26</b>, which tend to settle under the conditions as outlined above, will attach to the conical bottom <b>21</b> of the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>. Agglomeration of the heavier sulfur particles <b>26</b> at the conical bottom <b>21</b> does not only make their transfer to the subsequent processing stage (the coalescer <b>40</b>) very difficult, if not impossible, but also results in clogging and even flooding of the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>, which is to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">To avoid this, according to another aspect of the present invention air streams <b>27</b> having a proper strength are injected in parallel to the downwardly slanted segments <b>31</b> of the conical part <b>21</b> of the oxidizer <b>20</b>, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, the heavier sulfur particles <b>26</b> are separated from the conical bottom <b>21</b> of the oxidizer zone <b>20</b> and driven to the outlet line <b>36</b> at the center of the conical bottom <b>21</b>. These settled particles and the floating ones are transferred, via line <b>36</b> and pump P<b>2</b>, to the next separation stage <b>40</b> either simultaneously or at different timings. They can also be transferred continuously or in a batch-wise mode.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flow deflecting plate <b>32</b> is disposed at the orifice of line <b>27</b> supplying the stream of air to the bottom part of the oxidizer zone. More specifically, the flow deflecting plate comprises a substantially horizontal portion extending in radial inward direction as well as a slanted portion <b>32</b>, which extends downwardly in a slanted manner and substantially in parallel with the slanted bottom surface <b>31</b>. Thus, the flow of incoming air, or of an inert gas, is deflected into a direction substantially in parallel with or tangential to the slanted bottom surface <b>31</b>, as indicated by the arrow. As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art, the gap between the inner surface of the flow deflecting plate <b>32</b> and the slanted bottom surface <b>31</b> may be relatively small as long as a stream of air of sufficient strength is obtainable.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">According to another embodiment (not show), the flow deflecting plate <b>32</b> may also be directly attached to the slanted bottom surface as to prevent the direct entrance of the stream of air into the conical bottom part of the oxidizer zone. For causing the stream of incoming air into a direction substantially in parallel with the slanted bottom surface, a curved recessed portion may be provided at the bottom end of the inlet <b>27</b>, so that the stream of air first impinges onto the plate and reflects back to the recession, which finally deflects the air stream in a direction substantially in parallel with or tangential to the slanted bottom surface <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">According to another embodiment (not shown), the flow deflecting plate may also be disposed spaced apart from and substantially in parallel with the slanted bottom surface. The flow deflecting plate may prevent the direct entrance of air into the conical bottom part of the oxidizer zone and may divide the incoming stream of air into a first portion, which is deflected into an upward direction and substantially in parallel with or tangential to the slanted bottom surface, and another portion, which is deflected into a downward direction and substantially in parallel with or tangential to the slanted bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art, a plurality of such flow deflecting plates can be disposed at equiangular distances around the circumference of the slanted bottom surface <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the next separation stage is a coalescer <b>40</b> where coagulating reagent is added that helps the settlement process to be performed more efficiently. According to the present invention the coagulating reagent is preferably acryl amide, which enhances separation significantly. It is noteworthy that the larger sulfur particles transferred to the coalescer <b>40</b> play the role of nuclei in the subsequent nucleation process that will happen in the coalescer, which results in a significantly hither efficiency. Also the time and place of the addition of the coagulating reagent has a great impact on the separating and recovery efficiency. The inventors observed that the best settlement is achieved when the coagulating reagent is added 1-3 seconds before the entrance of the slurry to coalescer <b>40</b>, which can be implemented e.g. by means of a valve through which the coagulating reagent is injected into line <b>36</b> before the slurry enters the coalescer <b>40</b>. Settled (sedimented) sulfur particles are transferred via line <b>41</b> to the separation zone <b>42</b>, which can be any of the various filter elements and preferably a rotary vacuum filter. After the filtration process the amount of the solid particles present in the filtrate <b>43</b>, which is going to be recycled, is considerably reduced to thereby avoid plugging to a large extent. Recovered catalyst solution is transferred via line <b>44</b> back to the oxidizer zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">Also, by the separation of a fraction of about 15-20% of the circulating stream, production costs are reduced, which could not be possible if the separation would be performed e. g. before the regeneration zone.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">As will become apparent to a person skilled in the art, according to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, any of the following measures, as explained in more detail above, can contribute in a particular combinatorial manner to substantially reduce plugging and foaming in a process for removing sulfur particles from an aqueous catalyst solution used to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas stream, as outlined above:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0081">In accordance with the present invention a solution of a polyvalent metal in chelate form is contacted with the hydrogen sulfide-containing gas. The chelate solution, per se, may be selected from among the chelate solutions taught by the art to be useful in sulfur oxidation processes. Further, the metals which may be employed are those polyvalent metals which will oxidize hydrogen sulfide to sulfur and in turn be reoxidized by oxygen or similar gas. These metals are used with proper adjustment in concentration. Any polyvalent metal can be used, but iron, copper and manganese are preferred, particularly iron. The polyvalent metal should be capable of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide, while being reduced itself from a higher to a lower valence state, and should then be oxidizable by oxygen from the lower valence state to the higher valence state in a typical redox reaction. Other polyvalent metals which can be used include lead, mercury, palladium, platinum, tungsten, nickel, chromium, cobalt, vanadium, titanium, tantalum, zirconium, molybdenum and tin. The metals are normally supplied as a salt, oxide, hydroxide etc.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0082">The chelating agents or liquids which may be used together with polyvalent metallic cations are those which form a complex ion having stability in solution. These compounds may be of any substance which will effectively complex the metal ion by forming cyclic structures. These materials include aminopolycarboxylic acid chelating agents of the alkylenediamine and phenylene-diamine types, such as ethylendediamine tetracetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, or the like. They may also contain ammonia or an aliphatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic primary or secondary amine.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0083">As will become apparent to the person skilled in the art, the term ‘zone’ as employed in the specification and appended claims includes, where suitable, the use of segmented equipment operated in series, or the division of one unit into multiple units because of size constraints, etc. E.g. a contacting column or absorption column might comprise two separate columns in which the solution from the lower portion of the first column would be introduced into the upper portion of the second column, the gaseous material from the upper portion of the first column being fed into the lower portion of the second column. Parallel operation of units is, of course, well within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0084">Thus, according to the present invention the following main advantages are achieved:
