<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-179680 filed on Jun. 29, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having capacitors and its manufacture method, and more particularly to a semiconductor device having capacitors disposed on conductive plugs formed in an interlayer insulating film and its manufacture method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">B) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A tendency of high-speed processing or storing a large amount of data has increased recently, with development of digital technologies. From this reason, semiconductor devices used in electronic apparatus are required to have high integration and high performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to realize high integration of a semiconductor memory device, e.g., a DRAM, instead of using conventional silicon oxide or silicon nitride, a variety of studies have been made on technologies of using ferroelectric material or high dielectric constant material as the material of a dielectric film of a capacitor constituting DRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Vigorous studies have been made also on technologies of using a ferroelectric film having spontaneous polarization as a capacitor dielectric film, in order to realize a nonvolatile RAM capable of reading and writing data at low voltage and at high speed. The semiconductor storage device of this type is called a ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A ferroelectric memory stores data by utilizing hysteresis characteristics of ferroelectric substance. A ferroelectric memory has a ferroelectric capacitor which is constituted of a ferroelectric film and a pair of electrodes sandwiching the ferroelectric film. The ferroelectric film generates polarization corresponding to a voltage applied across the electrodes, and spontaneous polarization is left even the applied voltage is removed. As the polarity of an applied voltage is reversed, the polarity of spontaneous polarization is also reversed. Data can be stored by relating two polarities of spontaneous polarization to data “0” and “1”, respectively. Data can be read by detecting the polarity of spontaneous polarization. As compared to a flash memory, a ferroelectric memory can operate at a lower voltage and can write data at higher speed and with a smaller electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A ferroelectric film constituting a capacitor of a ferroelectric memory is made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), La-doped PZT (PLZT), PZT-based material finely doped with Ca, Sr or Si, Bi layer structure compound such as SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9 </sub>(SBT, Y1) and SrBi<sub>2</sub>(Ta, Nb)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9 </sub>(SBTN, YZ) or the like. A ferroelectric film is formed by a sol-gel method, sputtering, metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, by using these film forming methods, a ferroelectric film in an amorphous phase or in a microcrystal phase is formed on a lower electrode. The crystalline structure is transformed into a perovskite structure or a bismuth layer structure by succeeding heat treatment. It is necessary to use, as the electrode material of a capacitor, material hard to be oxidized or material capable of retaining conductivity even if it is oxidized. Platinum group metal such as platinum (Pt) or iridium (Ir), and its oxide such as iridium oxide (IrO<sub>x</sub>) are generally and widely used as the electrode material. Aluminum (Al) is generally used as a wiring material just like general semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A ferroelectric memory is required to have higher integration and higher performance just like other semiconductor devices, so a cell area is required to be reduced further in the near future. In order to reduce a cell area, it is effective to adopt a stack structure instead of a planar structure. The “stack structure” is a structure that a capacitor is disposed just above a conductive plug (contact plug) formed on the drain of a transistor constituting a memory cell. In a ferroelectric memory of a conventional stack structure, a capacitor has a structure that a barrier metal film, a lower electrode, a ferroelectric film and an upper electrode are laminated in this order just above a conductive plug made of tungsten (W) or the like. The barrier metal film has a role of preventing oxidation of the conductive plug. Since material is selected often which provides both the function of a barrier material film and the function of a lower electrode, it is difficult to definitely distinguish between the barrier metal film and lower electrode. Generally, the barrier metal film and lower electrode are made of a combination of two or more films selected from a group consisting of a TiN film, a TiAlN film, an Ir film, an IrO<sub>2 </sub>film, a Pt film and a SRO (SrRuO<sub>3</sub>) film.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is important to control orientation of a ferroelectric film so as to be oriented uniformly to manufacture a ferroelectric memory having good electric characteristics and high product yield. Orientation of the ferroelectric film is influenced greatly by orientation of a lower electrode. Namely, by controlling orientation of the lower electrode so as to be oriented uniformly, orientation of the ferroelectric film can be made uniform. Therefore, in order to manufacture a ferroelectric memory having good electric characteristics and high product yield, it is important to control orientation of the lower electrode so as to be oriented uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">JP-A-2000-91511 discloses a method of executing rapid thermal annealing of a lower electrode in inert gas in a temperature range between about 400° C. and 900° C. after the lower electrode is formed and before a ferroelectric film is deposited, in order to maximize spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">JP-A-HEI 11-168174 discloses a method of executing heat treatment in a temperature range between 200° C. and 300° C. or at a higher temperature after a lower electrode made of Ir is formed, in order to make residual polarization characteristics of a ferroelectric film uniform over the whole substrate surface and to prevent cracks from being generated in the ferroelectric film.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">JP-A-2002-151656 discloses a method of executing heat treatment at a temperature of 550° C. after a lower electrode having a two-layer structure of IrO<sub>x </sub>and Ir is formed and before a PZT film is formed, in order to prevent deterioration of the electric characteristics of the ferroelectric film made of PZT.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The methods disclosed in JP-A-2004-47633 will be described below. After a Ru film is formed which is used as a lower electrode of a ferroelectric capacitor, preliminary heat treatment is executed at 350° C. to 500° C. Thereafter, after a PZT film and the like are formed, heat treatment is executed at about 600° C. to 700° C. for crystallization. If the preliminary heat treatment is not executed, crystals of the Ru film grow abruptly during crystallization heat treatment and the Ru film has crystal grains irregular in size. If the preliminary heat treatment is executed, abrupt crystal growth can be suppressed during crystallization heat treatment and the crystal structure having grains equal in size can be maintained.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A ferroelectric capacitor is disposed on a conductive plug in a via hole formed through an interlayer insulating film under the ferroelectric capacitor. The lower electrode of the capacitor is electrically connected to the conductive plug. When a capacitor ferroelectric film of oxide is formed, an oxygen barrier film of TiAlN or the like is disposed in some cases under the lower electrode in order to prevent oxidation of the conductive plug. In this case, while films from the upper electrode to the oxygen barrier film of the capacitor are patterned, a phenomenon (capacitor stripping phenomenon) is observed in which the capacitor is stripped or peeled off. The present inventor has found from various evaluation experiments that peel-off is likely to occur at the interface between the oxygen barrier film and the lower electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An object of this invention is to provide a semiconductor device capable of improving adhesion at the interface between an oxygen barrier film and lower electrode and preventing a capacitor stripping phenomenon, and its manufacture method.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">an intermediate layer disposed at an interface between the oxygen barrier film and the lower electrode and made of alloy which contains at least one constituent element of the oxygen barrier film and at least one constituent element of the lower electrode.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2Z</figref>, description will be made on the manufacture method for the semiconductor device of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an isolation insulating film <b>2</b> is formed in a surface layer of a substrate <b>1</b> made of n- or p-type silicon to define active regions.

A p-type well <b>3</b> is formed by implanting p-type dopant ions in the surface layer of the active region.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Two MOS transistors <b>5</b> are formed in one active region. Brief description will be made hereunder on a method of forming the MOS transistor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The surface of the active region is thermally oxidized to form a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film to be used as a gate insulating film. A silicon film of amorphous silicon or polysilicon is formed on the substrate and patterned to form a gate electrode <b>5</b>G. Two gate electrodes intersect with one active region generally in parallel as viewed in plan.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">By using the gate electrode <b>5</b>G as a mask, ions of n-type dopant are implanted to form extensions of a source region <b>5</b>S and a drain region <b>5</b>D. Sidewall spacers are formed on the sidewalls of the gate electrode <b>5</b>G. By using the gate electrode <b>5</b>G and sidewall spacers as a mask, ions of n-type dopant are implanted to form deep source and drain regions <b>5</b>S and <b>5</b>D. With these processes, the MOS transistor <b>5</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a film of refractory metal such as cobalt (Co) is formed on the substrate by sputtering. Heat treatment is executed to react silicon and the refractory metal film and form a refractory metal silicide film <b>6</b> on the supper surfaces of the gate electrode <b>5</b>G, source region <b>5</b>S and drain region <b>5</b>D. Thereafter, an unreacted refractory metal film is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A cover insulating film <b>11</b> of SiON having a thickness of 200 nm is formed on the substrate by plasma CVD, covering the MOS transistors <b>5</b>. An interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a thickness of 1000 nm is formed on the cover insulating film <b>11</b>. For example, the interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> is formed by plasma CVD using oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Thereafter, the surface of the interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> is planarized by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). CMP is controlled so that a thickness of the planarized interlayer insulating film is about 700 nm in a region where the underlying surface is flat.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A via hole reaching the refractory metal silicide film <b>6</b> on the drain region <b>5</b>D and via holes reaching the refractory metal silicide film <b>6</b> on the source regions <b>5</b>S are formed through the interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> and cover insulating film <b>11</b>. A diameter of each of the via holes is 0.25 μm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The inner surfaces of the via holes and the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> are covered with two layers of a Ti layer having a thickness of 30 nm and a TiN layer having a thickness of 20 nm. On these layers, a W film is deposited until the via holes are filled completely. A thickness of the W film is 300 nm for example, unnecessary W film, TiN film and Ti film are removed by CMP to leave glue film consisting of the Ti film and the TiN film, and conductive plugs <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> of W in the via holes. The conductive plugs <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are connected to the drain regions <b>5</b>D and source region <b>5</b>S, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an oxidation preventive film <b>21</b> of SiON having a thickness of 130 nm is formed on the interlayer insulating film <b>12</b> by plasma CVD. Instead of SiON, the oxidation preventive film <b>21</b> of SiN or AlO may be formed. An interlayer insulating film <b>22</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a thickness of 300 nm is formed on the oxidation preventive film <b>21</b> by plasma CVD using O<sub>2 </sub>and TEOS.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, via holes are formed through the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b> and oxidation preventive film <b>21</b> to expose the underlying conductive plugs <b>15</b>. The inner surface of the via hole is covered with a glue film and the via hole is filled with a conductive plug <b>25</b> of W. The conductive plug <b>25</b> and glue film are formed by the same method as that of forming the underlying conductive plug <b>15</b> and glue film.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">CMP for removing an unnecessary W film and glue film is executed under the condition that a polishing rate of the W film and glue film is faster than a polishing rate of the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b>. For example, SSW2000 manufactured by Cabot Microelectronics Corporation is used as slurry. Over-polishing is executed slightly so as not to leave the glue film and W film on the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b>. Therefore, the upper surface of the conductive plug <b>25</b> becomes lower than the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b> closing around the conductive plug <b>25</b>, and a recess <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed. A depth of the recess <b>25</b><i>a </i>is 20 nm to 50 nm, typically about 50 nm for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">After CMP, the upper surfaces of the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b> and conductive plug <b>25</b> are exposed to plasma of ammonium (NH<sub>3</sub>). This plasma process is executed by using a diode parallel plate plasma cleaning apparatus under the following conditions for example:</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Distance between substrate surface and opposing electrode: about 9 mm (350 mils);</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Pressure: 266 Pa (2 Torr);</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Substrate temperature: 400° C.;</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">NH<sub>3 </sub>gas flow rate: 350 sccm;</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">RF power at 13.56 MHz supplied to substrate side electrode: 100 W;</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">RF power at 350 kHz supplied to opposing electrode: 55 W; and</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Process time: 60 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Instead of NH<sub>3 </sub>plasma, plasma which contains nitrogen element may be used, such as N<sub>2</sub>O plasma and N<sub>2 </sub>plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Processes up to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> will be described. First, a Ti film having a thickness of 100 nm is formed by DC sputtering on the surface subjected to the plasma process. For example, the sputtering conditions are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Distance between substrate and target: 60 mm;</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Ar gas pressure: 0.15 Pa;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Substrate temperature: 150° C.;</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">DC power: 2.6 kW; and</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Film forming time: 35 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Under these conditions, a Ti film is formed which has the hexagonal closest packed structure and is oriented in (002). If the substrate surface is processed by NH<sub>3 </sub>plasma before the Ti film is formed, NH groups are bonded to oxygen atoms on the surface of the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b>. As a result, Ti atoms supplied to the surface of the interlayer insulating film <b>22</b> become easy to move on the surface without being captured by oxygen atoms. Orientation of the Ti film can therefore be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Next, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. For example, the conditions of RTA are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Annealing temperature: 600° C.; and</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Process time: 60 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">With this annealing, the Ti film is nitrided and a base conductive film <b>30</b> is formed which has a face-centered cubic structure and made of TiN oriented in (111). A thickness of the base conductive film <b>30</b> may be set in a range between 100 nm and 300 nm. At this stage, the surface of the base conductive film <b>30</b> has a recess above the conductive plug <b>25</b> by reflecting the recess <b>25</b><i>a </i>on the underlying surface. The surface of the base conductive film <b>30</b> is planarized by CMP. For example, SSW2000 manufactured by Cabot Microelectronics Corporation is used as slurry. A thickness of the base conductive film <b>30</b> after CMP is 50 nm to 100 nm, typically about 50 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">After CMP, the surface of the planarized base conductive film <b>30</b> is exposed to NH<sub>3 </sub>plasma. Crystalline strains generated in a surface layer of the base conductive film <b>30</b> during CMP can be recovered. Nitrogen-element-containing plasma such as N<sub>2</sub>O plasma and N<sub>2 </sub>plasma may be used instead of NH<sub>3 </sub>plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Processes up to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> will be described. A Ti film having a thickness of 20 nm is formed on the base conductive film <b>30</b> by sputtering. This Ti film has a hexagonal closest structure and is oriented in (002). Next, RTA is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. For example, the conditions of RTA are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Annealing temperature: 650° C.; and</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Process time: 60 seconds.</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">For Sample A, a temperature when the lower electrode layer <b>36</b> is formed is relatively low so that crystalline grains are small just after the lower electrode <b>36</b> is formed.

Therefore, the surface of the PZT film formed on the lower electrode layer <b>36</b> becomes rough and clouded. There is a tendency that a temperature of a wafer peripheral area becomes relatively low while the lower electrode layer <b>36</b> is formed. As a result, while the PZT film is formed, growth of crystalline grains is likely to occur and the white turbidity is conspicuous in the wafer peripheral area.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">For Samples B and C, after the lower electrode layer <b>36</b> is formed, heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than that at which the PZT film is formed.

Therefore, the surface of the PZT film does not become clouded. In order to prevent a white turbidity of the PZT film, it is preferable to set a heat treatment temperature at which the intermediate film <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> is formed, higher than a temperature at which the dielectric film <b>37</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> is formed.</p>
