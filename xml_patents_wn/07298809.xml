<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims priority from European Patent Application No. 02-447227.6, filed Nov. 21, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a fractional-N frequency synthesizer used in digital communication systems. More precisely, it relates to a frequency synthesizer based on a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with multiphase clocks, in which a self-calibrating loop is used.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many applications, e.g., in mobile radio systems, it is necessary to synthesize frequencies in a digital way, i.e., using a Phase-Locked Loop. A conventional integer-N frequency synthesizer produces an output frequency that is N times the input reference frequency, such that its frequency resolution is the same as the PLL reference frequency. Therefore, narrow channel spacing is accompanied by a small loop bandwidth, which leads to long settling times. With a fractional-N frequency synthesizer, an output frequency is generated that is N+X/Y times the input reference frequency, i.e., a fractional multiple of the reference frequency, such that narrow channel spacing is achieved along with a higher phase detector frequency. If Y is not too big the fractional-N frequency synthesizer can be based on multiphase clock signals. The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) then disposes of Y copies of the signal, each shifted over 2π/Y. The value of X then determines at which instances a VCO output pulse is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several major drawbacks arise from this approach. A mismatch between the various clock signal phases causes reduced quadrature accuracy, if the phases are used in an image-reject transceiver. Further, when the PLL is locked, the delay mismatches introduce periodic phase errors that give rise to fractional spurs in the output frequency spectrum, resulting in an out-of-spec transmitter spectrum and in a reduced interference capability in the receiver. A solution to this problem is suggested in IEEE JSSC, Vol. 36, No. 5, May 2001, pp. 777-783. It consists in adding to the PLL a self-calibrating loop to eliminate the delay mismatches. The calibration loop adjusts the phases of the multiphase clock signal based on the timing information present in the phase frequency detector (PFD) outputs. The calibration loop has a much smaller bandwidth in order to avoid disturbance of the locking behavior of the main loop. A safe solution here is to activate the calibration loop only when the main loop is locked. In the calibration loop there is a multiplexing switch that guides the current coming out of the calibration charge pump towards one of the Y calibration loop filters. Which one of the Y calibration loop filters is to be selected is determined by a control logic that knows which phase is currently selected by the phase-switching fractional divider and thus knows which phase must be calibrated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Still the problem remains that a mismatch between the main charge pump of the original loop and the calibration charge pump of the calibration loop will result in an incorrect compensation of the phase errors. Therefore, the quadrature accuracy is still not yet correct and the fractional spurs are not completely removed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of these drawbacks, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks and to provide a device that synthesizes a fractional-N frequency based on a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with multiphase clocks, in which a self-calibrating loop is used in such a way that mismatch problems between the two charge pumps are avoided.</p>

The Phase-Locked Loop includes a main loop, a calibration loop, and a Demultiplexer. The main loop includes, coupled in series, a Phase Frequency Detector, a Main Charge Pump, a Main Loop Filter, a Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator and a Phase-switching Fractional Divider. The calibration loop includes Y Calibration Loop Filters, with Y being an integer, coupled to the Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator, and Control Logic for controlling the Phase-Switching Fractional Divider. The Demultiplexer is coupled between an output of the Main Charge Pump and inputs of the Main Loop Filter and the Y Calibration Loop Filters. A Reference Frequency Signal is coupled to the Phase Frequency Detector, a control signal from the Control Logic is coupled to the Demultiplexer, and a Calibration Signal is coupled to a control input of the Control Logic.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with multiphase clocks, in which a self-calibrating loop is used. In order to avoid any mismatch problems between the main charge pump of the original loop and the calibration charge pump of the calibration loop, the same main charge pump is used for both loops.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The prior art solution is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown, a first (Main) loop comprises, coupled in cascade, a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) <b>1</b>, a Main Charge Pump <b>2</b>, a Main Loop Filter <b>3</b>, a Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) <b>4</b> and a Phase-switching Fractional Divider <b>5</b>. A second (Calibration) loop comprises the series connection of a Calibration Charge Pump <b>9</b>, a Demultiplexer <b>6</b> and Y Calibration Loop Filters <b>7</b>, with Y being an integer, coupled between the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) <b>1</b> and the Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) <b>4</b>. The Demultiplexer <b>6</b> is controlled by Control Logic <b>8</b> coupled to the Phase-Switching Fractional Divider <b>5</b>. A Reference Frequency Signal <b>10</b> is applied to the Phase Frequency Detector <b>1</b>. The Calibration signal <b>11</b> is applied to a control input of the Control Logic <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents one embodiment of the present invention. In this device, the control logic <b>8</b> controls the demultiplexer <b>6</b> in such a way that most of the time the main loop filter is chosen and sometimes one of the calibration loop filters-is chosen. Most of the cycles of this charge pump are indeed used for the main loop, which has the highest bandwidth. In this state, demultiplexer <b>6</b> is just a through connection. However, from time to time, a cycle of the charge pump current is taken from the main loop and used for the calibration loop. When this occurs, the demultiplexer <b>6</b> guides the current towards one of the filters <b>7</b>. Which filter exactly is chosen is determined by the state that the phase-switching fractional divider is in.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the two loops in the system. A first (Main) loop comprises, coupled in cascade, a Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) <b>1</b>, a Main Charge Pump <b>2</b>, a Main Loop Filter <b>3</b>, a Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) <b>4</b> and a Phase-switching Fractional Divider <b>5</b>. A second loop (Calibration) comprises the series connection of a Demultiplexer <b>6</b> and Y Calibration Loop Filters <b>7</b>, with Y being an integer, coupled between the Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) <b>1</b> and the Multi-Phase Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) <b>4</b>. The demultiplexer <b>6</b> is controlled by Control Logic <b>8</b> coupled to the Phase-Switching Fractional Divider <b>5</b>, and a Reference Frequency Signal <b>10</b> is applied to the Phase Frequency Detector <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The demultiplexer <b>6</b> has an input connected to an output of the Main Charge Pump <b>2</b>, and has outputs connected to inputs of the Main Loop Filter <b>3</b> and of Y Calibration Loop Filters <b>7</b>. The Calibration signal <b>11</b> is applied to a control input of the Control Logic <b>8</b>.
