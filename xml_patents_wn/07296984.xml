<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to gear pumps and liquid ejection apparatuses employing such gear pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, gear pumps are configured relatively simply and thus advantageous with respect to other types of pumps. As such gear pumps, for example, the gear pump <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is known. The gear pump <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>101</b> in which an accommodating chamber <b>102</b> is defined for accommodating a drive gear <b>103</b> and a driven gear <b>104</b>. An opening for the accommodating chamber <b>102</b> in the housing <b>101</b> is sealed by a non-illustrated seal plate. The upper surfaces of the drive gear <b>103</b> and the driven gear <b>104</b> are held in contact with the seal plate in a slidable manner. If the drive gear <b>103</b> is rotated through rotation of a drive shaft <b>105</b>, the driven gear <b>104</b> is rotated as driven by the drive gear <b>103</b>. In this state, the liquid retained in the suction chamber <b>110</b> defined in the accommodating chamber <b>102</b> is moved to the space defined by each gear groove of the gears <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> and the inner walls of the accommodating chamber <b>102</b>. The liquid is eventually discharged into a discharge chamber <b>112</b>. The liquid is continuously introduced into the discharge chamber <b>112</b>, which is defined in the accommodating chamber <b>102</b>, through rotation of the gears <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The pressure in the discharge chamber <b>112</b> thus becomes higher than the pressure in the suction chamber <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">If the gap between the gears <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> and the seal plate is relatively large, the liquid leaks through the gap and is recirculated from the discharge chamber <b>112</b> under relatively high pressure to the suction chamber <b>110</b> under relatively low pressure. It is thus necessary to minimize the gap between the gears <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> and the seal plate. To meet this need, a gear pump in which a plate spring is deployed between the bottom surface of the accommodating chamber <b>102</b> and the gears <b>103</b>, <b>103</b> has been proposed (as described in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 8-093657). The plate spring urges each of the gears <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> toward the seal plate or the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, if the gears are pressed by the plate spring against the seal plate, relatively great friction torque or viscous load torque is produced when the gears slide along the seal plate or the housing. This causes a relatively great load to act on the drive source of the gear pump <b>100</b>, which is a problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a gear pump and a liquid ejection apparatus capable of reducing load when a gear is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the foregoing objectives, an aspect of the present invention is a gear pump. The gear pump includes a housing defining an accommodating chamber and a seal plate for sealing the accommodating chamber. A drive gear and a driven gear are received in the accommodating chamber. Each of the drive and driven gears has a side surface opposed to the seal plate, and a projection projects from the side surface of the drive gear or the driven gear for contacting the seal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present invention is also a gear pump. The gear pump includes a housing defining an accommodating chamber and a seal plate for sealing the accommodating chamber. A drive gear and a driven gear are received in the accommodating chamber. Each of the drive and driven gears has a side surface opposed to the housing, and a projection projects from the side surface of the drive gear or the driven gear for contacting the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present invention is also a gear pump. The gear pump includes a housing defining an accommodating chamber and a seal plate for sealing the accommodating chamber. The seal plate includes a first side surface and a second side surface. A drive gear and a driven gear are received in the accommodating chamber. A first urging member is formed at the first side surface of the seal plate for urging the seal plate toward the housing. A second urging member is deployed between the seal plate and the housing for urging the seal plate in a direction opposed to the urging direction of the first urging member by an urging force smaller than the urging force of the first urging member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention is a liquid ejection apparatus. The liquid ejection apparatus is provided with any one of the above-described gear pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An embodiment of the present invention will hereafter be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a printer <b>1</b>, or a liquid ejection apparatus according to the illustrated embodiment, includes a substantially rectangular parallelepiped frame <b>2</b>. A platen <b>3</b> is provided in the frame <b>2</b>, and recording paper (not shown) serving as a target is fed to the platen <b>3</b> by a non-illustrated paper feeder mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A guide member <b>4</b> is provided in the frame <b>2</b>, extending parallel with the longitudinal direction of the platen <b>3</b>. The guide member <b>4</b> is passed through a carriage <b>5</b> such that the carriage <b>5</b> is movable along the guide member <b>4</b>. A carriage motor <b>6</b> is secured to the frame <b>2</b> and drives the carriage <b>5</b> through a timing belt <b>7</b> held by a pair of pulleys P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. In this manner, when the carriage motor <b>6</b> is actuated, the drive force of the carriage motor <b>6</b> is transmitted to the carriage <b>5</b> through the timing belt <b>7</b>. The carriage <b>5</b> is thus moved reciprocally and parallel with the longitudinal direction of the platen <b>3</b> as supported by the guide member <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At the lower surface of the carriage <b>5</b> (the surface opposed to the platen <b>3</b>), a recording head <b>8</b> serving as a liquid ejection head is formed. Although not illustrated, the recording head <b>8</b> includes a nozzle forming surface defined at the lower surface of the recording head <b>8</b> opposed to the platen <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame <b>2</b> includes a cartridge case <b>9</b>. Ink cartridges <b>10</b> each serving as a liquid retaining portion are installed in the cartridge case <b>9</b>. The number of the ink cartridges <b>10</b> is six in the illustrated embodiment, and each of the ink cartridges <b>10</b> retains ink. The ink in each ink cartridge <b>10</b> is pressurized by a non-illustrated pressurizing pump and thus fed to the recording head <b>8</b> through a corresponding one of tubes T.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The ink is then pressurized by a non-illustrated piezoelectric element formed in the recording head <b>8</b>. The ink is thus ejected to the recording paper through a nozzle of the recording head <b>8</b>, as an ink drop.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a non-printing area of the frame <b>2</b>, as viewed to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cap member <b>12</b> is provided for sealing the nozzle of the recording head <b>8</b> when the printer <b>1</b> is in a non-printing state. The cap member <b>12</b> is formed of elastic material and in a box-like shape. The cap member <b>12</b> is supported by a cap holder <b>11</b> such that the opening of the cap member <b>12</b> faces the nozzle forming surface of the recording head <b>8</b>. The cap holder <b>11</b> is actuated by a non-illustrated actuation mechanism and operates to place the cap member <b>12</b> in close contact with the nozzle forming surface for preventing dryness in the vicinity of the nozzle opening.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A suction hole (not shown) is defined in the cap holder <b>11</b> such that the interior of the cap member <b>12</b> is communicated with the exterior through the suction hole. The proximal end of the tube <b>13</b> is connected to the suction hole. The distal end of the tube <b>13</b> is connected to a pump unit <b>14</b> provided in the frame <b>2</b>. A waste ink reservoir <b>16</b> is connected to the pump unit <b>14</b> through a tube <b>15</b>. If the pump unit <b>14</b> is actuated with the nozzle forming surface sealed by the cap member <b>12</b>, negative pressure is generated in the space defined by the cap member <b>12</b> and the nozzle forming surface. The highly viscous ink and air bubbles in the nozzle of the recording head <b>8</b> or the ink or dust adhered to the nozzle forming surface are thus drawn to be removed such that the recording head <b>8</b> is cleaned. The ink and the like removed from the recording head <b>8</b> is recovered in the waste ink reservoir <b>16</b> through the pump unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The pump unit <b>14</b> includes a non-illustrated drive motor, a non-illustrated drive mechanism, and a gear pump <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When the drive motor is actuated, the gear pump <b>20</b> is actuated through the drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The gear pump <b>20</b> of the pump unit <b>14</b> will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gear pump <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>21</b>. A bearing portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed in an outer side surface of the housing <b>21</b>. A drive shaft <b>22</b> projects from the bearing portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>and is rotatably supported by the bearing portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The drive shaft <b>22</b> is connected to the drive mechanism and rotated through actuation of the drive motor. In this manner, the drive shaft <b>22</b> rotates a drive gear <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) received in the housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the housing <b>21</b> is formed in a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape. An accommodating chamber <b>23</b> is defined in a side surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>21</b>. The accommodating chamber <b>23</b> includes a first accommodating portion <b>24</b> and a second accommodating portion <b>25</b>. Each of the first and second accommodating portions <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> has a shape capable of receiving a substantially columnar component.

In the side surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the accommodating chamber <b>23</b>, a suction portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and a discharge portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>are defined between the first accommodating portion <b>24</b> and the second accommodating portion <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a shaft hole <b>28</b> with a substantially circular shape is defined in the bottom surface of the first accommodating portion <b>24</b> and extends through the bearing portion <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The drive shaft <b>22</b> is rotatably supported by the shaft hole <b>28</b>. A shaft support portion <b>29</b> is formed in the bottom surface of the second accommodating portion <b>25</b>. The shaft support portion <b>29</b> forms a recess for supporting an end of a driven shaft <b>30</b> of a driven gear <b>27</b>, which will be later described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Cylindrical bolt passing portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>are formed at the four corners of the side surface <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>21</b>. Each of the bolt passing portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>receives a bolt P, as will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> will be explained. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, an annular projection <b>33</b> and an annular projection <b>34</b> project respectively from an upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and from a lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b>. The height of each projection <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> is not more than 50 μm. A shaft hole <b>35</b> extends through the substantial middle of each projection <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>. The shaft hole <b>35</b> receives the drive shaft <b>22</b>, which is passed through the shaft hole <b>28</b> of the housing <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a groove <b>22</b><i>b </i>is defined in a distal end of the drive shaft <b>22</b> projecting from the shaft hole <b>35</b> of the drive gear <b>26</b>. A seal ring R (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is fitted into the groove <b>22</b><i>b</i>. This structure connects the drive shaft <b>22</b> to the drive gear <b>26</b> in an inseparable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Like the drive gear <b>26</b>, the driven gear <b>27</b> includes an annular projection <b>36</b> and an annular projection <b>37</b> projecting respectively from an upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>and from a lower surface <b>27</b><i>b</i>. The height of each of the projections <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> is not more than 50 μm. A shaft hole <b>38</b> extends through the substantial middle of the annular projections <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>. A substantially columnar driven shaft <b>30</b>, which is supported by the shaft support <b>29</b> of the housing <b>21</b>, is passed through the shaft hole <b>38</b>. The driven gear <b>27</b> is rotatably supported by the driven shaft <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are received respectively in the first accommodating portion <b>24</b> and in the second accommodating portion <b>25</b>, as meshed with each other. In the accommodating chamber <b>23</b>, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> define a suction chamber <b>39</b> and a discharge chamber <b>40</b>. The suction chamber <b>39</b> and the discharge chamber <b>40</b> are arranged such that the meshed portion of the drive and driven gears <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> is located between the suction chamber <b>39</b> and the discharge chamber <b>40</b>. A section of the suction chamber <b>39</b> is configured by the suction portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and a section of the discharge chamber <b>40</b> is configured by the discharge portion <b>23</b><i>b</i>. The suction chamber <b>39</b> temporarily retains the ink introduced from the exterior through a suction port <b>41</b>, which will be later described. When the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are rotated respectively in the direction r<b>1</b> and in the direction r<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ink in the suction chamber <b>39</b> is sent to the space defined by the inner walls of the accommodating chamber <b>23</b> and the grooves of the drive or driven gear <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. The ink is eventually discharged to the discharge chamber <b>40</b>. The pressure in the discharge chamber <b>40</b> is thus higher than the pressure in the suction chamber <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereafter, a cover <b>32</b> functioning as a seal plate for sealing the accommodating chamber <b>23</b> of the housing <b>21</b> will be explained.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cover <b>32</b> includes the suction port <b>41</b> and a discharge port <b>42</b> each having a cylindrical shape, projecting from an upper surface (a first side surface) <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. A central opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>defined by the suction port <b>41</b> and a central opening <b>42</b><i>a </i>defined by the discharge port <b>42</b> have openings at a lower surface (a second side surface) <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b> opposed to the upper surface <b>32</b><i>a</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this manner, the central opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the central opening <b>42</b><i>a </i>correspond respectively to the suction chamber <b>39</b> and to the discharge chamber <b>40</b>, when the cover <b>32</b> is attached to the housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A distal end of the tube <b>13</b> extending from the cap member <b>12</b> is connected to the suction port <b>41</b>. The ink in the cap member <b>12</b> is thus sent to the suction chamber <b>39</b> defined in the gear pump <b>20</b> through the suction port <b>41</b>. The tube <b>15</b> extending from the waste ink reservoir <b>16</b> is connected to the discharge port <b>42</b>. The ink in the discharge chamber <b>40</b> is thus introduced to the waste ink reservoir <b>16</b> through the tube <b>15</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, four circular projections <b>55</b> project from the upper surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. The projections <b>55</b> are held in contact with a cover holding spring <b>53</b>, which will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a shaft support portion <b>44</b> is defined in the lower surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b> at a position corresponding to the driven shaft <b>30</b> of the driven gear <b>27</b>. The shaft support portion <b>44</b> is shaped identical to the shaft support portion <b>29</b> of the housing <b>21</b>. Further, a groove <b>47</b> is defined in the lower surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. The groove <b>47</b> has an annular shape defined around the shaft support portion <b>44</b>, the central opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the suction port <b>41</b>, and the central opening <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the discharge port <b>42</b>. When the housing <b>21</b> is sealed by the cover <b>32</b>, the groove <b>47</b> is located outward from the opening end of the accommodating chamber <b>23</b>. A seal member <b>48</b>, which has a similar annular shape, is fitted into the groove <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the seal member <b>48</b> includes a packing <b>49</b> formed of elastic material such as elastomer, a spring member <b>50</b> functioning as a second urging member, a first washer <b>51</b>, and a second washer <b>52</b>. The packing <b>49</b>, the spring member <b>50</b>, and the first and second washers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are all formed in annular shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, an annular groove <b>49</b><i>a</i>is defined in an outer circumferential surface of the packing <b>49</b>. The packing <b>49</b> thus has a substantially channel-like cross-sectional shape. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the washers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, which are shaped substantially identical to each other and each include a bent outer circumferential portion, are fitted into the annular groove <b>49</b><i>a</i>. An outer circumferential edge of the first washer <b>51</b> faces toward a lower end <b>49</b><i>c </i>of the packing <b>49</b> (i.e., downward as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). An outer circumferential edge of the second washer <b>52</b> faces toward an upper end <b>49</b><i>b </i>of the packing <b>49</b> (i.e., upward as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The spring member <b>50</b> is fitted into the annular groove <b>49</b><i>a </i>such that the spring member <b>50</b> is clamped between the first washer <b>51</b> and the second washer <b>52</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the spring member <b>50</b> includes an annular portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>and a plurality of spring portions <b>50</b><i>a </i>extending from the annular portion <b>50</b><i>b</i>. Each of the spring portions <b>50</b><i>a </i>has a substantial L shape and includes a proximal portion extending inward from the annular portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>and a distal portion extending along the annular portion <b>50</b><i>b</i>. The distal portion of each spring portion <b>50</b><i>a</i>, which extends along the annular portion <b>50</b><i>b</i>, is slanted toward the distal end of the spring portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>in an upward direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or, in other words, in a direction approaching the second washer <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first and second washers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are urged by the spring member <b>50</b> in directions separating from each other. That is, the first washer <b>51</b> and the second washer <b>52</b> are urged toward the lower end <b>49</b><i>c </i>and the upper end <b>49</b><i>b </i>of the packing <b>49</b>, respectively. The seal member <b>48</b> formed by the packing <b>49</b>, the first and second washers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and the spring member <b>50</b> is fitted into the groove <b>47</b> such that the upper end <b>49</b><i>b </i>opposes the bottom of the groove <b>47</b>. When clamped between the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b>, the seal member <b>48</b> urges the cover <b>32</b> separately from the housing <b>21</b> by means of the urging force of the spring member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cover holding spring <b>53</b> functioning as a first urging member is secured to the upper surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the cover holding spring <b>53</b> is a plate-like member having opposed side edges that are bent toward the housing <b>21</b>. Two holes H<b>3</b> are defined in the cover holding spring <b>53</b> and a corresponding one of the suction port <b>41</b> and the discharge port <b>42</b> is passed through each of the holes H<b>3</b>. Further, four spring portions <b>54</b> are formed in the cover holding spring <b>53</b>. Each of the spring portions <b>54</b> is formed by a section of the cover holding spring <b>53</b> defined by a substantially U-shaped cutout, which is urged in a manner projecting not from the upper surface (one side surface) <b>53</b><i>a </i>but from the lower surface (the opposed side surface) <b>53</b><i>b </i>of the cover holding spring <b>53</b>. Thus, when the cover holding spring <b>53</b> is secured to the cover <b>32</b>, the spring portions <b>54</b> are urged upward by the corresponding projections <b>55</b> of the cover <b>32</b>. As a result, each of the spring portions <b>54</b> urges the cover <b>32</b> toward the housing <b>21</b> through the corresponding one of the projections <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First through holes H<b>1</b> are defined in the four corners of the cover <b>32</b> and second through holes H<b>2</b> are defined in the four corners of the cover holding spring <b>53</b>.

A fastening member such as a nut (not shown) is fastened to each of the bolts P, which is passed through the first and second through holes H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>. This structure secures the cover <b>32</b> and the cover holding spring <b>53</b> to the housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the cover <b>32</b> is secured to the housing <b>21</b>, the annular projection <b>33</b> of the drive gear <b>26</b> is held in contact with the lower surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, while, in contrast, the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> located radially outward from the annular projection <b>33</b> is spaced from the cover <b>32</b>. Similarly, the annular projection <b>34</b> projecting from the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> is held in contact with the bottom of the first accommodating portion <b>24</b>, while, in contrast, the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> located radially outward from the annular projection <b>34</b> is spaced from the bottom of the first accommodating portion <b>24</b>. Also, the annular projection <b>36</b> projecting from the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> is held in contact with the lower surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b>, while, in contrast, the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> located radially outward from the projection <b>36</b> is spaced from the cover <b>32</b>. Further, the annular projection <b>37</b> projecting from the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> is held in contact with the bottom of the accommodating portion <b>25</b>, while, in contact, the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> located radially outward from the projection <b>37</b> is spaced from the bottom of the accommodating portion <b>25</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the gap size between the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> or the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> and the housing <b>21</b> and the gap size between the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> or the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> and the cover <b>32</b> are illustrated as exaggerated for the purposes of illustration. However, each of the gap sizes is not greater than 50 μm, making it difficult for the ink to flow through the gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As has been described, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are held in contact with the cover <b>32</b> by means of the associated annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>36</b> and with the housing <b>21</b> by means of the associated annular projections <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>. Therefore, when the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are rotated, the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>36</b> slide along the cover <b>32</b> and the annular projections <b>34</b>, <b>37</b> slide along the housing <b>21</b>. However, the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> are spaced from the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b>. The annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> are each formed around the shaft hole <b>35</b>, or at a portion of the drive gear <b>26</b> spaced from the rotational axis of the drive gear <b>26</b> by a relatively short interval. The annular projections <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> are each formed around the shaft hole <b>38</b>, or at a portion of the driven gear <b>27</b> spaced from the rotational axis of the driven gear <b>27</b> by a relatively short interval. Such arrangement reduces friction load.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cover <b>32</b> is pressed against the housing <b>21</b> by the cover holding spring <b>53</b>. The seal member <b>48</b> secured to the cover <b>32</b> is clamped between the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b> and thus seals the accommodating chamber <b>23</b> tightly. The seal member <b>48</b> urges the cover <b>32</b> toward the cover holding spring <b>53</b> by the urging force of the spring member <b>50</b>. That is, the cover <b>32</b> is urged toward the housing <b>21</b> by the force generated through equilibrium between the urging force of the cover holding spring <b>53</b> and the urging force of the seal member <b>48</b>. This prevents the cover holding spring <b>53</b> from pressing the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> against the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b> by excessive force.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation of the gear pump <b>20</b> will now be explained by an example in which cleaning of the recording head <b>8</b> is carried out. In head cleaning, the cap holder <b>11</b> is actuated such that the nozzle forming surface of the recording head <b>8</b> closes the cap member <b>12</b>. If a non-illustrated control unit of the printer <b>1</b> generates a prescribed timing drive instruction, the drive motor is actuated such that the drive shaft <b>22</b> is rotated in the direction indicted by arrow r<b>1</b>. The driven gear <b>27</b> meshed with the drive gear <b>26</b> is thus rotated in the direction indicated by arrow r<b>2</b>. In this state, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are pressed against the housing <b>21</b> through the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> by the force generated through equilibrium between the urging force of the cover holding spring <b>53</b> and the urging force of the seal member <b>48</b>. Further, the annular projection <b>33</b> and the annular projection <b>36</b> projecting respectively from the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> and from the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> are sliding along the cover <b>32</b>. The remaining portion of the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>other than the projection <b>33</b> and the remaining portion of the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>other than the projection <b>36</b> are held as spaced from the cover <b>32</b>. Further, the annular projection <b>34</b> and the annular projection <b>37</b> projecting respectively from the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> and from the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b> are sliding along the housing <b>21</b>. In this state, the remaining portion of the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>other than the projection <b>34</b> and the remaining portion of the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>other than the projection <b>37</b> are held as spaced from the housing <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are rotated, the ink that has been temporarily retained in the suction chamber <b>39</b> is sent to the space defined by the grooves of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> and the inner walls of the accommodating chamber <b>23</b>. The ink then flows to the discharge chamber <b>40</b> and is eventually discharged into the discharge chamber <b>40</b>. The pressure in the suction chamber <b>39</b> thus becomes relatively low. As a result, the ink retained in the cap member <b>12</b> flows into the suction chamber <b>39</b> through the tube <b>13</b> for raising the pressure in the suction chamber <b>39</b>. At this stage, the pressure in the suction chamber <b>39</b> is lower than the pressure in the discharge chamber <b>40</b>. However, the gap size between the upper surfaces <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the cover <b>32</b> and the gap size between the lower surfaces <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>and the housing <b>21</b> are not greater than 50 μm. Therefore, only a slight amount of ink is returned from the discharge chamber <b>40</b> to the suction chamber <b>39</b> through these gaps. The suction performance is thus not hampered greatly by the returned ink. Further, the gears are ejection-molded such that the shape of a surface of the mold is transferred to the product for forming each of the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>. Each projection <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> is thus shaped with relatively high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After being introduced from the cap member <b>12</b> to the suction chamber <b>39</b> and then to the discharge chamber <b>40</b> by the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b>, the ink is discharged to the waste ink reservoir <b>16</b> through the tube <b>15</b>. This draws the retained ink and air from the cap member <b>12</b> such that the pressure in the cap member <b>12</b> becomes negative. The ink and air bubbles are thus drawn from the nozzle of the recording head <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The illustrated embodiment has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">(1) In the illustrated embodiment, the annular projection <b>33</b> and the annular projection <b>36</b> are projected from the upper surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the upper surface <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b>, respectively, for contacting the cover <b>32</b>. The upper surfaces <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>a </i>are maintained as spaced from the cover <b>32</b>. Similarly, the annular projection <b>34</b> and the annular projection <b>37</b> are projected from the lower surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the lower surface <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the driven gear <b>27</b>, respectively, for contacting the bottom of the accommodating chamber <b>23</b> (the housing <b>21</b>). The lower surfaces <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>are maintained as spaced from the housing <b>21</b>. Such arrangement decreases the area of the portion of each of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> sliding along the cover <b>32</b> or the housing <b>21</b>. As a result, load is decreased when the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> are rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(2) In the illustrated embodiment, each of the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> is arranged at the substantial center of the corresponding one of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b>. More specifically, the interval between each projection <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and the rotational axis of the corresponding one of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> is relatively short. This structure decreases generation of the viscous load torque.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">(3) In the illustrated embodiment, the cover holding spring <b>53</b> for urging the cover <b>32</b> toward the housing <b>21</b> is secured to the upper surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. Also, the spring member <b>50</b> for urging the cover <b>32</b> in a direction opposed to the housing <b>21</b> is provided in the seal member <b>48</b>, which is fitted into the lower surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>32</b>. The cover <b>32</b> is thus pressed against the housing <b>21</b> by the force generated through equilibrium between the urging force of the cover holding spring <b>53</b> and the urging force of the spring member <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the drive gear <b>26</b> and the driven gear <b>27</b> (more specifically, the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>) are prevented from being pressed against the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b> excessively. This reduces the friction force generated by the drive gear <b>26</b> or the driven gear <b>27</b> with respect to the cover <b>32</b> or the housing <b>21</b>. Further, even if the packing is deteriorated due to long term use, the urging force is reliably generated by the spring member <b>50</b>, such that the accommodating chamber <b>23</b> is maintained as sealed for a relatively long time.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The illustrated embodiment may be modified as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the illustrated embodiment, the spring member <b>50</b>, which functions as the second urging member provided in the seal member <b>48</b>, has a shape with a number of substantially L-shaped spring portions <b>50</b><i>a </i>arranged along the inner side of the annular portion <b>50</b><i>b</i>. However, instead of the spring member <b>50</b>, a compression spring or an elastic member formed of elastomer may be employed as the second urging member.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the illustrated embodiment, the first washer <b>51</b> and the second washer <b>52</b> are provided in the seal member <b>48</b>. However, as long as the urging force of the spring member <b>50</b> acts uniformly on the cover <b>32</b> and the housing <b>21</b>, the first and second washers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the illustrated embodiment, each of the spring portions <b>54</b>, which are formed in the cover holding spring <b>53</b>, functions as the first urging member. However, a compression spring or the like for pressing the cover <b>32</b> may function as the first urging member, instead of the spring portions <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the illustrated embodiment, the annular projections <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> formed around the shaft hole <b>35</b> of the drive gear <b>26</b> and the annular projections <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> formed around the shaft hole <b>38</b> of the driven gear <b>27</b> each function as a projection contacting the housing <b>21</b> or the cover <b>32</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), an annular projection <b>60</b> that is formed not immediately around a shaft hole <b>61</b> but at a position spaced outward from the shaft hole <b>61</b> at a predetermined interval may function as the projection. Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>), a plurality of projecting pieces <b>62</b> that are aligned at predetermined angular intervals about the shaft hole <b>61</b> may function as the projections. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>c</i>), a plurality of projecting pieces <b>63</b> that extend radially from the shaft hole <b>61</b> may function as the projections. In other words, any suitable configuration may be selected as long as the configuration decreases the area of the sliding portion with respect to the housing <b>21</b> or the cover <b>32</b> and thus reduces the viscous load. In order to lower the friction load, it is preferable that the interval between the rotational axis of the gear and the projection is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrated embodiment, the gear pump <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is installed in the printer <b>1</b> in which the ink cartridge <b>10</b> is not mounted on the carriage <b>5</b>, or a so-called off-carriage type printer. However, the gear pump <b>20</b> may be installed in a printer having an ink cartridge mounted on a carriage. Also, the gear pump <b>20</b> may be installed in different apparatuses other than the liquid ejection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention may be embodied as a different liquid ejection apparatus other than the printer <b>1</b>. That is, the present invention may be embodied as, for example, a printing apparatus such as a fax and a copier or a liquid ejection apparatus ejecting a different liquid (fluid) other than ink. The liquid ejection apparatus ejecting a different liquid may be a liquid ejection apparatus ejecting a liquid such as an electrode material or color material used in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays, EL displays, and surface emitting displays, or a liquid ejection apparatus ejecting a biological organic substance used in the manufacture of bio chips, or a sample ejection apparatus serving as a precision pipette.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although the embodiments of the present invention has been explained in connection with the attached drawings, the invention is not restricted to the above description but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims.</p>
