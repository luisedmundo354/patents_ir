<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Methods are known in the art for using lenses and holographic optical elements (HOEs) to direct infrared optical signals onto a detector for use in wireless infrared communication. See, for example, Jivkova et al., “Holographic Parabolic Mirror as a Receiver Optical Front End For Wireless Infrared Communications: Experimental Study,” Applied Optics, Vol. 41, No. 28, October 2002, pp. 5860-5865. U.S. Pat. No. 4,534,614 to Silverglate discloses an optical signal detection apparatus for use in diffuse infrared light communication comprising an aspherical lens, a filter and a photodetector. International Publication No. WO 02/21734 A1 to Green et al. discloses a wireless communication receiver comprising a dielectric totally internally reflecting concentrator having a convex receiving surface (i.e., a dielectric lens), a filter and a photodetector. U.S. Pat. No. 4,682,841 to Afian et al. discloses a holographic light radiation concentrator comprising at least two concentrating facets arranged in a planar configuration. Kahn et al., “Imaging Diversity Receivers for High-Speed Infrared Wireless Communication,” IEEE Communications Magazine, December 1998, pp. 88-94, describes several types of receivers for high-speed infrared wireless communication. U.S. Pat. No. 6,498,662 to Schuster discloses an optical receiver comprising HOEs arranged in a planar configuration. U.S. Pat. No. 4,028,104 to Graube, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses making an infrared hologram using the Herschel reversal effect. U.S. Pat. No. 4,099,971 to Graube, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses fabrication of infrared holograms by recording using a visible wavelength and then treating the hologram to make it swell, thereby altering the fringe spacings and making it suitable for playback in the infrared.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lin et al., “Efficient and Aberration-free Wavefront Reconstruction from Holograms Illuminated at Wavelengths Differing from the Forming Wavelength,” Applied Optics, Vol. 10, No. 5, June 1971, pp. 1314-1318, discloses a method of preparing a HOE for use at 633 nm in dichromated gelatin, which is not sensitive to light at 633 nm. Herzig, “Holographic Optical Elements (HOE) for Semiconductor Lasers,” Optics Communications, Vol. 58, No. 3, June 1986, pp. 144-148, discloses a multi-step process for preparing an infrared HOE comprising recording a first hologram H1 with an HeNe laser at 633 nm, reconstruction of the hologram H1 with a plane wave from an argon laser at 514 nm, recording a second hologram H2 with an astigmatic wave provided by the hologram H1 and a plane reference wave at 514 nm, and reconstruction of the hologram H2 with a plane wave from a GaAs laser at 800 nm that produces a desired spherical wave. U.S. Pat. No. 6,381,044 to Schuster et al., the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method and apparatus for correcting aberrations in an HOE recorded at a visible wavelength for reconstruction at an infrared wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another type of HOE referred to as a holographic shear lens is also known. Holographic shear lenses can generate multiple image points from one object point and can be useful in imaging and measurement applications, such as disclosed in N. Mohan et al., “Electronic speckle pattern interferometry with holo-optical element,” Proceedings SPIE Vol. 1821, pp. 234-242, 1992, and in optical testing applications, such as disclosed in C. Shakher et al., “Testing of off-axis parabola by holo-shear lens,” Proceedings SPIE Vol. 1999, pp. 341-345, 1999.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Han et al., “Accurate diffraction efficiency control for multiplexed volume holographic gratings,” Optical Engineering, Vol. 41, No. 11, November 2002, pp. 2799-2802, discloses a method for controlling and estimating diffraction efficiency for a HOE with multiple recording exposures. Kostuk, “Practical Design Considerations and Performance Characteristics of High Numerical Aperture Holographic Lenses,” SPIE Vol. 1461, Practical Holography V, 1991, pp. 24-34, discusses factors affecting diffraction efficiency of holographic lenses, such as recording geometry and recording material.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Described herein is a light receiving apparatus that is suitable for use in a multidirectional or omnidirectional receiver for optical data communication. The optical data preferably comprises wireless optical data. The light receiving apparatus can be used, for example, in a manufacturing environment (e.g., cigarette manufacturing) to communicate manufacturing parameters or in a warehouse environment to communicate inventory and/or environmental parameters. The light receiving apparatus can be used in any device that utilizes wireless optical communication such as, for example, televisions, VCRs, DVD players/recorders, or any other electronic device that utilizes an optical (e.g., infrared) remote control. For example, the light receiving apparatus can be used in portable computers or hand-held devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or wireless telephones that have a wireless optical communication port. In one embodiment, the light receiving apparatus can increase the optical-link distance of an optical wireless link (e.g., an infrared link) and can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of an optical signal of a given wavelength detected by a detector in ambient light. In another embodiment, the light receiving apparatus can enable multiple light transmitting and/or receiving devices located at different positions relative to the light receiving apparatus (e.g., distributed around the light receiving apparatus over a predetermined angular range, such as 90, 180 or 360 degrees) to communicate optically with the light receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The light receiving apparatus can be configured to receive light that is transmitted from one or more light sources (e.g., lasers or light-emitting diodes), optionally through a light modulation component (e.g., liquid-crystal light modulators), to the light receiving apparatus via different light transmission media such as free space (e.g., wireless communication) or fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates in perspective view an exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>100</b>. The light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a holographic optical device <b>102</b> having a plurality of holograms <b>104</b> recorded in a light receiving surface <b>106</b> thereof. For ease of illustration, only two holograms <b>104</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, but it will be understood that many holograms <b>104</b> can be recorded in the light receiving surface <b>106</b>. The holographic optical device <b>102</b> is preferably configured to diffract light L of a predetermined wavelength λp incident thereon from different directions onto a common focal area <b>108</b>. Thus, the holographic optical device <b>102</b> can serve as a holographic light concentrator. A detector <b>110</b>, such as an infrared detector, can be positioned at the focal area <b>108</b> to collect light diffracted and focused by the holographic optical device <b>102</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the holographic optical device <b>102</b> can be shaped such that a first vector normal to the light receiving surface <b>106</b> at a first location <b>112</b> thereon is oriented along a first direction n<b>1</b> and such that a second vector normal to the light receiving surface <b>106</b> at a second location <b>114</b> thereon is oriented along a second direction n<b>2</b>, the second direction n<b>2</b> being different from the first direction n<b>1</b>. The holographic optical device <b>102</b> can also be viewed as an off-axis device (an off-axis holographic light concentrator), because the incident light beam L does not necessarily intersect the plane of the focal area <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the holographic optical device <b>102</b> can comprise a plurality of holographic optical elements (HOEs) <b>116</b>. The plurality of HOEs <b>116</b> can be arranged edge to edge to surround the focal area <b>108</b> in two dimensions (e.g., in the x-y plane). Also, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the plurality of HOEs <b>116</b> can be arranged in a hexagonal configuration. In addition, configurations with a different number of sides can also be used, such as an octagonal configuration or configurations with 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more sides.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The holographic optical device <b>102</b> can be constructed such that the holographic optical device <b>102</b> is centered about the focal area <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the holographic optical device <b>102</b> can be constructed such that the focal area <b>108</b> is displaced from the center of the holographic optical device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>is a side view of the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> can further comprise a base <b>122</b> upon which the HOEs <b>116</b> are supported. In addition, the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> can also comprise a cover <b>126</b> that seals the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> against contaminants such as dust and moisture. In one arrangement, the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured to receive light only from lateral directions, and therefore the cover <b>126</b> can be made of an opaque material. However, in another arrangement, the cover <b>126</b> can also serve as a holographic optical element having a light receiving surface with a plurality of holograms recorded therein so that light may enter the device from both lateral and vertical directions and directions therebetween. As used herein, a vertical direction is a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane formed by focal area <b>108</b>, and a lateral direction is a direction substantially coplanar with the plane formed by focal area <b>108</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the light receiving apparatus can further comprise a support member <b>120</b> that supports the detector <b>110</b>. The detector <b>110</b> can be used to convert an optical signal to an electrical signal, and electrical connections (not shown) carrying the electrical signal can be taken out of the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> through the support member <b>120</b> and the base <b>122</b>, and can be input into an appropriate processing unit coupled to the detector <b>110</b> (e.g., a processing unit of a communication device). In addition, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the HOEs <b>116</b> can comprise opaque portions <b>124</b> having no holograms recorded therein. These portions can be provided at locations where the geometrical design of the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> would prevent such incident light from being diffracted, since it would not fall on the focal area <b>108</b>. This can be advantageous because it can reduce the cost of recording materials.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, light of the predetermined wavelength λp illustrated by solid lines, or light of a narrow band of wavelengths centered about λp, can be diffracted by the holographic optical device <b>102</b> onto the focal area <b>108</b>. The HOEs <b>116</b> are preferably recorded such that the focal points of the HOEs <b>116</b> substantially coincide in a small area centered on a geometrical axis Z of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Light of other wavelengths illustrated by dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>is not concentrated at the same focal area <b>108</b> due to dispersion. Thus, a small-area detector, such as detector <b>110</b>, placed at the focal area <b>108</b> will have a higher signal for the predetermined wavelength compared to a situation where a holographic optical device <b>102</b> is not used. For the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, non-desirable light outside the predetermined wavelength λp incident from the same direction as light of the predetermined wavelength λp will either not be incident on the detector <b>110</b>, or the illuminance on the detector <b>110</b> will be small. In either case, utilizing a holographic optical device <b>102</b> such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>can improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the detector for the predetermined wavelength λp.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Light receiving apparatuses as described herein, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c</i>, for example, can be used in a wireless optical communication system, such as an infrared wireless optical network. For example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein can be mounted on the ceiling of a room where wireless optical communication is desired such that the light receiving surface of the detector <b>110</b> faces downward, or on a wall of a room such that the light receiving surface of the detector <b>110</b> faces sideways. As another example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein can be placed on a table to communicate with one or more wireless communication devices (e.g., laptop computers or hand-held devices such as PDAs and wireless telephones). Also, a light receiving apparatus as described herein can be utilized, for example, in an infrared wireless communication system implementing standards and protocols established by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA). Wireless infrared communication signals in accordance with such standards and protocols typically utilize a wavelength of 875 nm±30 nm (i.e., in the range of 845-905 nm). However, the light receiving apparatus <b>100</b> is not limited to use at infrared wavelengths and could be used, for example, at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, and at infrared wavelengths other than those noted above. Preferably, the predetermined wavelength can be selected from the wavelength range of 845-905 nm, and nominally can be chosen at approximately 875 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Holographic optical devices as described herein can be configured to receive light from an angular range of up to 360°, such as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, light can enter all six light receiving surfaces <b>106</b> corresponding to the six HOEs <b>116</b>. Alternatively, holographic optical devices as described herein can be configured to receive light from a smaller angular range of up to, for example, 330°, 300°, 270°, 240°, 210°, 180°, 150°, 120°, 90°, or 60°. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d </i>shows, in top view, a light receiving apparatus <b>100</b>′ comprising a holographic optical device <b>102</b>′ constructed in a half-hexagon configuration. In particular, the holographic optical device <b>102</b>′ comprises three HOEs <b>116</b> such as discussed above arranged in a half-hexagon configuration and having a common focal area <b>108</b>′ located adjacent to a long side <b>126</b> of the half-hexagon. The vector normal to the focal area <b>108</b>′ can be either parallel to, or perpendicular to the long side <b>126</b>. Such a configuration can be useful, for example, for placement on a side wall of a room where wireless infrared communication is desired. Of course, a holographic optical device as described herein can be constructed to receive light from any desired angular range, and is not limited to angular ranges of 360° or 180°. Preferably, such a holographic optical device is configured to receive light from an angular range of at least 60° to provide sufficient angular coverage to facilitate wireless optical communication within a conventional building setting.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, the holographic optical device of the light receiving apparatus can have a cylindrical shape. For example, as illustrated in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, there is shown an exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>200</b>. The light receiving apparatus <b>200</b> comprises a holographic optical device <b>202</b> having a plurality of holograms <b>204</b> recorded in a light receiving surface <b>206</b> thereof. The holographic optical device <b>202</b> is configured to focus light of a predetermined wavelength λp incident thereon from different directions onto a common focal area <b>208</b>. Moreover, the holographic optical device <b>202</b> is shaped such that a first vector normal to the light receiving surface <b>206</b> at a first location <b>212</b> thereon is oriented along a first direction n<b>1</b> and such that a second vector normal to the light receiving surface <b>206</b> at a second location <b>214</b> thereon is oriented along a second direction n<b>2</b>, the second direction n<b>2</b> being different from the first direction n<b>1</b>. The first and second directions n<b>1</b> and n<b>2</b> can intersect, but this is not necessary. If the first and second directions intersect, the angle between the first and second directions can be in a range of up to, for example, 45°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, 180°, 210°, 240°, 270°, 300°, 330° or 360°. The holographic optical device <b>202</b> can be formed from any suitable plastic or polymer deformable sheet on which or in which is formed any suitable holographic emulsion, such as, for example, silver halide or dichromated gelatin. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, the exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>200</b> can receive light from an angular range of up to 360°. In this example, the holographic optical device <b>202</b> comprises a single HOE, which corresponds to the holographic optical device <b>202</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a variation of the exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, a half-cylindrical configuration can be utilized for a light receiving apparatus, such as illustrated in top view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>illustrates an exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>200</b>′ comprising a holographic optical device <b>202</b>′ in the shape of a half cylinder. The holographic optical device <b>202</b>′ has a light receiving surface <b>206</b>′ in which are recorded a plurality of holograms (not shown). The holographic optical device <b>202</b>′ is configured to have a focal area <b>208</b>′ (e.g., corresponding to the light receiving surface of a detector) arranged along a diameter <b>226</b>′ of the half cylinder. Such a half-cylinder configuration can be useful where it is desired to collect light from an angular range of up to 180° (e.g., for a wall mounting configuration or for mounting on a surface of a portable computer or hand-held device).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to another embodiment, the holographic optical device of the light receiving apparatus can have a conical shape. For example, as illustrated in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown an exemplary light receiving apparatus <b>300</b> comprising a holographic optical device <b>302</b> having a plurality of holograms <b>304</b> recorded in a light receiving surface <b>306</b> thereof. The holographic optical device <b>302</b> is configured to focus light of a predetermined wavelength λp incident thereon from different directions onto a common focal area <b>308</b> (e.g., the light receiving surface of a light detector <b>310</b>). The holographic optical device <b>302</b> is shaped such that a first portion of the light receiving surface <b>306</b> faces a first direction and a second portion of the light receiving surface faces a second direction, the second direction being different from the first direction. In this regard, a top view of the light receiving apparatus <b>300</b> is similar to the top view of the light receiving apparatus <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b. </i>Accordingly, no further description of a top view of the light receiving apparatus <b>300</b> is necessary. The holographic optical device <b>302</b> can be formed from any suitable plastic or polymer deformable sheet on which or in which is formed any suitable holographic emulsion, such as, for example, silver halide or dichromated gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to another embodiment, a light receiving apparatus as described herein can be used in portable computers, hand-held devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless telephones, and other electronic devices that utilize optical (e.g., infrared) remote controls. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary laptop computer <b>400</b> comprising a light receiving apparatus <b>402</b> such as described above. The light receiving apparatus <b>402</b> receives an optical signal (e.g., a wireless infrared communication signal consistent with IrDA standards and protocols), which can then be processed by an internal processor of the laptop computer <b>400</b> in any suitable manner. The laptop computer <b>400</b> also comprises a light transmission port <b>404</b> having a light transmitting element that transmits an optical signal (e.g., a wireless infrared light signal) to another suitable light communication device, such as a light receiving apparatus as described herein. A light receiving apparatus similar to light receiving apparatus <b>402</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>d</i>, <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b>, for example, can also be used in other devices that utilize wireless optical communication such as, for example, televisions, VCRs, DVD players/recorders, or any other electronic device that utilizes an optical (e.g., infrared) remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Light receiving apparatuses comprising holographic optical devices as described herein can preferably increase the optical-link distance and performance of an optical wireless link and/or improve the signal-to-noise ratio of an optical signal having a specified wavelength detected in ambient light. Such advantages can be achieved because the holographic optical device can focus a greater amount of the optical signal light onto a detector than would be achieved without the holographic optical device. In addition, use of a light receiving apparatus as described herein with remotely controlled electronic devices also allows the possibility of reducing the intensity of optical radiation emitted by the remote control while maintaining good optical-link performance and distance, thereby reducing power consumption in the remote control. Further, multiple portable transmitters or transceivers, such as portable computers or hand-held devices with optical communication ports, can be located surrounding a transceiver that comprises a holographic optical device and detector as described herein to communicate with a computer or server coupled to the transceiver. The optical communication ports of the portable transceivers can also be equipped with holographic optical devices such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>d</i>, <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b>, for example. Such an arrangement of a central transceiver and one or more portable transceivers can provide an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of an infrared wireless link in ambient light.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Any suitable detector, such as an infrared detector, can be used in conjunction with holographic optical devices as described herein, and such detectors and holographic optical devices can have a range of sizes. In an exemplary embodiment, an infrared detector having a light receiving area approximately 5 mm×5 mm in size can be used in conjunction with a hexagonal arrangement of HOEs, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c</i>, each HOE being approximately 63 mm×63 mm in size. Of course, these dimensions are only exemplary and are not intended to be restrictive. For example, holographic optical devices as described herein for use in transceivers for communication within a room of a building can have overall widths in the range of approximately 10-50 cm and heights in the range of approximately 5-15 cm. Also, for example, an optical communication port of a portable computer or hand-held device can be equipped with a holographic optical device having an overall width in the range of approximately 10-30 mm and an overall height in the range of approximately 5-15 mm, which can focus signal light onto a detector having a size in the range of approximately 2-5 mm×2-5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Holographic optical devices as described herein can be constructed from any suitable holographic recording medium or emulsion. For example, the HOEs <b>116</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>can comprise glass sheets upon which a holographic film of dichromated gelatin or silver halide (e.g., Slavich PFG-01) is formed. Alternatively, holographic optical devices as described herein can be formed of any suitable holographic emulsion formed on or in a plastic or polymer sheet such as one or more DuPont photopolymers. The plastic or polymer sheet can be rigid or deformable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another embodiment, light receiving apparatuses as described herein can be utilized in hand-held or stationary light-communication devices, and in ceiling and/or wall-mounted receivers/transceivers, in conjunction with a wireless optical communication network. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic view of an exemplary optical wireless communication network <b>500</b>. The network <b>500</b> can be implemented, for example, in a warehouse environment (e.g., for housing cigarette inventory), in a manufacturing environment (e.g., cigarette manufacturing), or in an environment that includes both inventory and manufacturing activities, as well as other activities. The network <b>500</b> can include one or more hand-held light-communication devices <b>504</b> and/or one or more stationary light-communication devices <b>534</b>, all of which can be equipped with light receiving apparatuses <b>506</b> as described herein and/or light transmitting elements <b>508</b> for analog or digital optical communication. For example, a user <b>502</b> can be equipped with a hand-held light-communication device <b>504</b>, which can be a hand-held computer for recording and communicating inventory parameters and/or environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) in an inventory environment. As another example, a piece of manufacturing equipment <b>530</b> can be equipped with stationary light-communication device <b>534</b>, which can be interfaced with the manufacturing equipment <b>530</b> to monitor and communicate manufacturing information, such as, for example, quality-control information (e.g., rate of cigarettes failing a visual inspection) or other manufacturing parameters (e.g., number and rate of cigarettes packaged, processing temperature, etc.). The stationary light-communication device <b>534</b> need not be mounted directly on the manufacturing equipment and can be mounted on any suitable structure either temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The hand-held device <b>504</b> and the stationary device <b>534</b> each comprise a light receiving apparatus <b>506</b> such as has been described herein. The light receiving apparatus <b>506</b> receives an optical signal (e.g., a wireless optical signal) of a predetermined wavelength λp.

Of course it is not necessary for the device <b>504</b> to be a hand-held device, and the device <b>504</b> could be a stationary device fixedly mounted to and/or in communication with any suitable piece of manufacturing or monitoring equipment or other suitable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the hand-held device <b>504</b> and the stationary device <b>534</b> can receive a wireless optical signal from the transmitter <b>514</b>, and the devices <b>504</b> and <b>534</b> can transmit a wireless optical signal to either or both of the light receiving apparatuses <b>512</b> and <b>518</b>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Considerations pertaining to preparation of a holographic optical device or element will now be discussed. A conventional way to record an infrared hologram is to record the hologram using an optical wavelength at which a suitable holographic emulsion is sensitive (e.g., a visible wavelength for dichromated gelatin or silver halide) using optical parameters that will provide for desired performance during reconstruction (playback) at a desired infrared wavelength. In particular, for a desired playback wavelength (e.g., an infrared wavelength), a particular diffraction angle may be desired. By knowing the desired playback wavelength and the desired diffraction angle, a corresponding fringe spacing of the desired hologram can be calculated using the Bragg relation nλ=d sin θ, where n is the order of the diffraction, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the fringe spacing, and θ is the desired diffraction angle. The calculated fringe spacing can then be used to determine an appropriate recording angle for the recording wavelength by substituting the recording wavelength into the Bragg relation and solving for the recording angle. In particular, for a given desired diffraction angle θ<sub>IR </sub>for a desired infrared wavelength λ<sub>IR</sub>, the recording angle in a visible wavelength is given by sin θ<sub>V</sub>=(λ<sub>V </sub>sin θ<sub>IR</sub>)/λ<sub>IR</sub>, where λ<sub>V </sub>is the visible wavelength, θ<sub>V </sub>is the visible recording angle, λ<sub>IR </sub>is the infrared wavelength and θ<sub>IR </sub>is the desired infrared diffraction angle.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While recording an infrared hologram using a visible wavelength in this manner typically results in undesired aberrations, such aberrations can be reduced or avoided using known techniques, such as disclosed by Herzig, “Holographic Optical Elements (HOE) for semiconductor lasers” and by U.S. Pat. No. 6,381,044, referred to above. The recording method can comprise a multiple-exposure process or a single-exposure process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An approach for recording an off-axis holographic optical element using multiple reference beams for use in connection with light receiving apparatuses described herein will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary optical recording arrangement for recording an off-axis HOE using multiple reference beams. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in particular, provides for using five reference beams, but the approach is not limited to five reference beams. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a laser beam from a laser <b>602</b> (e.g., a 35 mW He—Ne laser at 633 nm) passes through a shutter <b>604</b> (S) and is split into two beams at a beam splitter <b>606</b> (BS). One beam <b>608</b> is reflected off the beam splitter <b>606</b> and serves as a reference beam. The reference beam <b>608</b> is reflected off a mirror <b>610</b> (M<b>1</b>) and passes through a half wave plate <b>612</b> (HP<b>1</b>) and a spatial filter <b>614</b> (SF) (e.g., 10× objective, 25 micron pinhole) through an aperture plate <b>616</b> (AP<b>1</b>), and is collimated by a collimating lens <b>618</b> (CL). An exemplary collimating lens has a 300 mm focal length. The beam <b>608</b> then reflects off a beam steering mirror <b>620</b> (TM<b>1</b>) and off another beam steering mirror <b>622</b> (TM<b>2</b>) and is directed to a rotation mirror <b>624</b> (RM) that is mounted on a servo controlled rotation stage <b>626</b> (SRS) driven by a stepper motor drive <b>627</b> (SMD). The servo controlled rotation stage <b>626</b> is mounted on a tilting stage <b>628</b>. The beam <b>608</b> is reflected from the rotation mirror <b>624</b> (RM) onto one of five reference mirrors <b>630</b>-<b>638</b> (RM<b>1</b>-RM<b>5</b>) and is directed onto the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) at which the HOE to be recorded is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Using multiple exposures, the reference wavefront from each mirror is sequentially made to interfere with the same object wavefront. Each grating structure generated by interference of the object wave and the individual reference beams is recorded sequentially. Preferably, identical incident power is used for each exposure. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the reference mirrors <b>630</b>-<b>638</b> are aligned to be in the same horizontal plane, and they act to provide multiple sequential reference beams at equal intervals of a desired angle (e.g., 3°) at the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) where the HOE is located. The angle of rotation mirror <b>624</b> is initially calibrated with respect to the reference mirrors RM<b>1</b>-RM<b>5</b> to generate the reference wavefront at, for example, −6°, −3°, 0° (normal illumination), +3° and +6° about the z-axis in the x-y plane. The position of the object wave is unchanged and the resultant HOE recording stores different grating structures. Each grating propagates the wavefront in a different direction. The light concentrator illuminated by a monochromatic light from multiple directions in a plane can focus the light onto a detector having a plane parallel to the table.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another beam <b>642</b> is transmitted through the beam splitter <b>606</b> (BS) and is reflected off the mirror <b>644</b> (M<b>2</b>) and is directed to and reflected from mirrors <b>646</b> (M<b>3</b>), <b>648</b> (M<b>4</b>) and <b>650</b> (M<b>5</b>). The mirrors <b>646</b>, <b>648</b> and <b>650</b> fold the optical beam to provide for optical path length compensation. The beam <b>642</b> is directed from mirror <b>650</b> (M<b>5</b>) through halfwave plate <b>652</b> (HP<b>2</b>) and through aperture plate <b>654</b> (A<b>2</b>). The beam <b>642</b> is then focused as a spot at mirror <b>658</b> (M<b>6</b>) by a microscope objective <b>656</b> (MO) (e.g., 40×, 0.65 numerical aperture). The spherical wave thus generated from the mirror <b>658</b> provides the desired off-axis object beam and interferes with the reference beam at the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) where the HOE <b>640</b> is located. Exemplary parameters for the off-axis angle and the focal distance (optical path length from the objective <b>656</b> to the center of the recording plane <b>640</b>) are approximately 37.7° and 83.4 mm, respectively. By appropriately controlling the rotation mirror <b>624</b> to direct the reference beam <b>608</b> sequentially off the reference mirror <b>630</b>-<b>638</b>, a holographic optical element having multiple exposures (i.e., multiple holograms), can be created.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The polarization properties of the reference beam at the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) are changed due to the beam steering device from s-polarization (vertical) to p-polarization (horizontal) relative to the optical table. To compensate for this, the half-wave plate <b>612</b> is introduced before the spatial filter <b>614</b>. The orientation of the half-wave plate <b>612</b> is such that, at the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP), the reference beam <b>608</b> is s-polarized.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The polarization of the object beam <b>642</b> has a different orientation relative to each ray of the reference beam <b>608</b> illuminating the recording plane. A half wave plate <b>652</b> is placed in the object beam <b>642</b>, and the orientation of the half wave plate <b>652</b> (HP<b>2</b>) is aligned such that the polarization of the ray of the object beam <b>642</b> at the center of the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) is in a vertical plane. The ratio of intensities of the reference beam and the object beam is approximately unity at the center of the recording plane.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, a plate holder can be used that covers the outer edge (e.g., the outer 3 mm) of the HOE to be recorded at the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) to eliminate the influence of the multiple internal reflections that are produced due to off-axis object beam elimination.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Exemplary optical parameters for recording a holographic optical element with multiple exposures as described above are as follows. The reference beam intensity at the center of the recording plane is 48.3 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>±2%. The object beam intensity at the center of the recording plane <b>640</b> is 48 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>±8%. The total intensity at the center of the recording plane <b>640</b> (RP) is approximately 95 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The exposure time for a single exposure is governed by the relation T=E/P, where E is the exposure sensitivity of the red-sensitive Slavich PFG-01 silver halide emulsion material, for example, and P is the total incident beam intensity on the HOE to be recorded. The exposure sensitivity E for PFG-01 as provided by Slavich is approximately 110 μJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for light at 633 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Taking into account the absorption and other parameters of the PFG-01 material, a total intensity of 190 μW/cm<sup>2 </sup>was used to record an exemplary holographic optical element with five exposures corresponding to five reference beams. For five exposures, the total intensity falling on the recording plane <b>640</b> can be divided equally, yielding approximately 40 μW/cm<sup>2 </sup>per exposure. Thus, each of the five exposures is carried out using approximately 40 μW/cm<sup>2 </sup>of light at 633 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the foregoing embodiment, for a given holographic recording material, there will be a total exposure limit, and the multiple exposures combined will preferably not exceed that total exposure limit. Thus, when increasing the number of exposures for recording a given HOE, it is preferable to adjust (reduce) the exposure time (or intensity) for each exposure. Reduction in the exposure time or intensity can also reduce the resulting diffraction efficiency of the HOE. Thus, if a certain efficiency per exposure is desired, this information can be used to determine the total number of exposures that can be recorded in a given area of the HOE. This information can also be used, then, to determine the appropriate angular distance between exposures to achieve acceptable light concentration behavior with the HOE without exceeding the total exposure limit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After recording the multiple exposures in the HOE material, the HOE can then be developed. For a HOE made using Slavich PFG-01, development can be achieved using CWC-2 developer for three minutes, followed by washing in water for five minutes, followed by bleaching using Amidol bleach for five minutes, followed by a final wash in water for 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reconstruction geometry and the diffracted focal spots corresponding to normal illumination from mirror RM3 are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The central symmetrical circular focal spot in the photograph is due to normal illumination recording and reconstruction. By changing the angle of incidence of the illuminating beam (within the recording angle range) the light concentrator generates an aberration-free focal spot at the same location.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An aperture having a diameter of 1 mm can be placed in front of the normal illumination beam to measure the efficiency of a small area of the HOE along the vertical y-direction (x=0) at the horizontal center of the plate. Diffraction efficiency with respect to the rotation of the HOE about the y-axis is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Efficiency measurements can also be obtained by illuminating the full aperture of the recorded region, and by rotating the HOE with respect to the x- and y-axes from −10° to +10° at intervals of 0.5°. The corresponding graphs for rotation about the x- and y-axes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, respectively. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, since the recording geometry is designed for recording with different illumination beams that are confined in the x-z plane (the plane of the table), a substantially uniform efficiency of about 15% for a silver halide HOE measuring 58 mm×58 mm can be obtained. Furthermore, the light concentrator can provide a circular spot at the same location with respect to the recording illumination angles.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The above described example for recording and developing a five exposure HOE at 633 nanometers is exemplary in nature and should not be construed as limiting in any way. If desired, different holographic emulsion materials can be used and/or a different number of exposures can be used to fabricate suitable holographic optical devices and HOEs as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The example discussed above relating to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> pertains to recording a planar HOE at the recording plane <b>640</b>. However, a cylindrical HOE, a conical HOE, a HOE of another shape with a curved surface, or a HOE with a plurality of planar surfaces oriented normal to different directions can be recorded using the above-described approach by placing the HOE on an appropriate rotation and/or tilting stage to expose different areas of the HOE successively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For single exposure recording, the object wave interferes with the normal illumination beam from mirror RM<b>3</b>. The recording can be carried out on Slavich PFG-01 holographic plates having a size of 63 mm×63 mm with the emulsion side facing the beams. The area of recording of the HOE is 58 mm×58 mm. Using the geometry described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the spatial frequency of the slanted grating structure along the vertical y-axis can vary due to a change in the off-axis angle of the object beam. The frequency of the grating at the center of the HOE is about 1000 lines mm<sup>−1</sup>. The recording grating structure on the PFG-01 plate can be developed (e.g., using CWC-2 developer), and bleached (e.g., using Amidol bleach) to obtain a phase element.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The recorded transmission HOE can be reconstructed using the same normal s-polarization illumination beam that was used for the single-exposure recording geometry, with the grating surface facing away from the reference beam. The diffracted beam is a converging spherical wave. Evaluation of the off-axis diffracted spot may be performed using an OPHIR Optronics BeamStar charged coupled detector (CCD) laser beam profiler. This profiler has a rectangular 4.6 mm×6.2 mm CCD that is sensitive from 320 nm to 1100 nm. A photograph of the intensity pattern on the detector is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the corresponding 3-D profile of the spot. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>c</i>) is a table of the Gaussian curve fitting parameters for the spot intensity along both vertical and horizontal directions of the detector plane, which is parallel to the table. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>d</i>) shows a plot of the Gaussian fit to spot intensity data along the vertical (top graph) and horizontal (bottom graph) axes. Since the HOE is illuminated with the same reference beam that is used for recording, a substantially circular diffraction spot of about 0.7 mm diameter is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">To determine the diffraction efficiency for reconstruction at 633 nm, a mask with a 1 mm diameter aperture can be mounted on an x-y translation stage. The mask is placed in the illumination beam path, which allows efficiency measurements of the HOE to be carried out at discrete spot locations. The beam power is measured using a calibrated Newport silicon detector (Model 818-ST) and a calibrated Newport optical power meter (Model 1830C). The detector is placed parallel to the table and a 4 mm<sup>2 </sup>area of the detector is used to capture the diffracted beam. As defined herein, “diffraction efficiency” (η<sub>D</sub>) is the ratio of the diffracted beam power to the incident beam power. The diffraction efficiency as a function of HOE coordinates is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Near the center the HOE has a peak efficiency of about 59%, which decreases symmetrically along a given horizontal line to about 80 to 90% of the peak value at a given height.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The efficiency can vary near the vertical edges of the plate. The reduction in efficiency along the vertical direction from the center of the recording plate may be due to one or more of a) over- or under-exposure, or b) deviation from unity of the object-to-reference beam ratio. As disclosed by Syms and Solymar in Appl. Phys. B 1983; 32:165-173 and Kostuk in Proc. SPIE 1461: 24-34; 1991, the non-uniformity in efficiency across the recording plane may be caused by a) deviation from the Bragg condition along the edges, and/or b) variation in off-axis angles between the rays of the object (spherical) and the reference (plane) beams at the recording plane. The diffraction efficiency of the recorded HOE when illuminated with the full beam of 58 mm×58 mm is about 48%, which is approximately equal to the diffraction efficiency of the HOE for s- and p-polarized beams.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Changing the reconstruction incident beam angle or rotating the HOE decreases the efficiency and distorts the symmetric shape of the diffracted spot. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the diffracted spot when the angle of incidence of the illuminating beam is changed from 0° (normal illumination) to 3° (oblique illumination) by rotating the plate about the vertical axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(</figref><i>b</i>)-<b>13</b>(<i>d</i>) show the corresponding data as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In comparison, data for the undistorted circular spot (at normal illumination) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The diffraction efficiency as a function of rotation of the HOE about the x- and y-axes is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, respectively. In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, the HOE light concentrator is illuminated with the full identical beam that was used for recording. The efficiency is uniform (and equal) for a rotation of 1° about the vertical and horizontal axes, which is consistent with a single-exposure recording geometry using silver halide recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Various configurations of light receiving apparatuses have been described herein, but other configurations are possible. For example, light apparatuses have been described in conjunction with a single light detector, but the multiple light detectors can be used with a single light receiving apparatus. In addition, light receiving apparatuses as described herein can have a light detector arranged in any suitable orientation. For example, the light detector <b>108</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d </i>is shown with the light receiving face being oriented in the plane of the page; however, the plane of the light receiving face could be oriented perpendicular to the plane of the page so as to receive light through HOEs <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, various examples of using a light receiving apparatus have been described herein, but other uses are possible. For example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein could be used in financial point-of-sale transactions by incorporating a light receiving apparatus as described herein at a check-out station of a retail store, for example. Products being sold can be equipped with infrared transmitting units in the packages of such products (e.g., smart packages) that can transmit signals comprising information to be detected and processed at the check-out station. Whereas bar codes are presently used to obtain information about a package, the amount of information contained within a bar code is relatively limited. In contrast, utilizing a check-out station comprising a light receiving apparatus as described herein to read information from smart packages having infrared transmitters coupled to associated memories within the packages can provide substantially more information about the package, the information being limited only by the capacity of the package memory.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As another example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein could be placed in an appliance to receive a wireless optical signal from a “smart product” having a wireless optical transmitter embedded in its packaging. For example, a light receiving device as described herein could be placed on the front panel outside the microwave cavity of a microwave oven to receive a wireless optical signal from the package of a food product having a transmitter therein that becomes activated when the package is activated (e.g., mechanically opened) and that transmits cooking instructions to the microwave oven.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As another example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein can be used in conjunction with a photovoltaic cell as a solar cell to increase the intensity of sunlight incident on the cell. Such a light receiving apparatus can advantageously concentrate light from different directions onto a focal area as previously described, and is therefore well suited for concentrating light onto a photovoltaic cell as the sun changes orientation relative to the cell. In this regard, holograms can be recorded in the holographic optical device of light receiving apparatus so as to be compatible with either a broad band of wavelengths present in sunlight or to take advantage of discrete wavelengths for efficient absorption by the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As a further example, a light receiving apparatus as described herein could be utilized in a home setting or a commercial setting for receiving information from a smart package (e.g., a product with smart packaging) and transmit that information directly to a manufacturer, brand owner, or retailer. If the package/product is also equipped with a light receiving apparatus itself, two-way, direct, real-time communication between a consumer and a retailer, manufacturer or a brand owner can be carried out, for example, through the use of sound chips and/or a display on the package.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition to the foregoing, the focusing characteristics of the devices described herein can be used in multiple image formation in integrated circuit manufacture; and laser deflecting and/or focusing (e.g., in lasers scanners).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The terms “comprises” and “comprising”, when used in this specification, are taken to specify the presence of stated features, steps or components; but the use of these terms does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, components or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments. However, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that it is possible to embody the invention in specific forms other than those of the embodiments described above.
