<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a plasma tube array which includes an array of two or more light-emitting tubes incorporating fluorescent substance layers therein, produces discharge inside the two or more light-emitting tubes and causes the fluorescent substance layers inside the light-emitting tubes to emit light and thereby displays an image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a large image display device which performs self light emission, there is a proposal on a technique (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-103187) of displaying an image by using the principle of plasma display with an array of multiple light-emitting strings made up of glass tubes incorporating fluorescent substance layers therein and controlling light emission by parts of the respective light-emitting strings (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-103187).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each light-emitting string includes a protective film such as an MgO film and a fluorescent substance layer in the glass tube filled with a discharge gas composed of, for example, Ne and Xe. The fluorescent substance layer is formed on a supporting member, a mounted part, called a “boat”, which has a substantially semicircular cross-section and the supporting member (boat) is inserted into the glass tube. Then, the glass tube is heated in a vacuum chamber and the gas is exhausted, the tube is filled with a discharge gas and then both ends of the glass tube are sealed. Multiple light-emitting strings created in this way are arranged in parallel and fixed and the light-emitting strings are provided with electrodes and a voltage is applied to the electrodes to thereby provoke discharge in the light-emitting strings and cause the fluorescent substance to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing a basic structure of a plasma tube array.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The plasma tube array (PTA) <b>100</b> shown here has a structure in which light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . containing fluorescent substance layers which emit red (R), green (G), blue (B) fluorescence filled with a discharge gas are arranged in parallel and in a planar shape as a whole, and a transparent front supporting member <b>20</b> and a transparent back supporting member <b>30</b> are placed on the front and back of the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . respectively and the array of multiple light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . are held between the front supporting member <b>20</b> and back supporting member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the front supporting member <b>20</b> are multiple display electrode pairs <b>21</b> each made up of two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> arranged parallel to each other forming a discharge slit in between in the direction of the array of the multiple light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . that is, the direction in which the display electrodes extend across the multiple light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . . These display electrode pairs <b>21</b> are arranged in two or more rows in the longitudinal direction of the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . forming a non-discharge slit between the neighboring display electrode pairs <b>21</b>. Furthermore, the two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> making up one display electrode pair <b>21</b> consist of metallic (e.g., Cr/Cu/Cr) bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>on the mutually far sides (non-discharge slit sides) and transparent electrodes <b>211</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>each made up of an ITO thin film on the mutually near sides (discharge slit sides). The bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>are intended to reduce the electric resistance of the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> and the transparent electrodes <b>211</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>are designed so as to allow light emitted from the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . to pass through up to the front supporting member <b>20</b> side without being intercepted and thereby realize brighter display.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, on the back supporting member <b>30</b> are multiple metallic signal electrodes <b>31</b> which are associated with and extend parallel to the multiple light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B, . . . respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the PTA <b>100</b> having such a structure is viewed two-dimensionally, the intersections between the signal electrodes <b>31</b> and display electrode pairs <b>21</b> become unit light-emitting regions (unit discharge regions). Display is realized by using either one of the display electrode <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> as a scanning electrode, producing a selective discharge at the intersection between the scanning electrode and signal electrode <b>31</b> to select a light-emitting region, using wall charge formed on the inner surface of the light-emitting string of the region accompanying the discharge and thereby generating a display discharge between the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>. A selective discharge is an opposed discharge produced in the light-emitting string between the opposed scanning electrode and signal electrode <b>31</b> in vertical direction, while a display discharge is a planar discharge produced in the light-emitting string between the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> arranged in parallel on a plane. Such an electrode arrangement causes two or more light-emitting regions to be formed inside the light-emitting string in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view showing the structure of light-emitting strings making up the PTA <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, three light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B are shown. Each of the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B has a structure in which a protective film <b>12</b> of MgO, etc., is formed on the inner surface of a glass tube <b>11</b> and a boat <b>13</b> which is a supporting member on which fluorescent substance layer <b>14</b>R, <b>14</b>G, <b>14</b>B emitting R, G, B fluorescence is formed is inserted in the glass tube <b>11</b> (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-86141).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the boat on which the fluorescent substance layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The boat <b>13</b> has a semicircular or U-figured cross-section or the like and has an elongated shape as with the glass tube <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and each of three types of fluorescent substance layers <b>14</b>R, <b>14</b>G, <b>14</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>: here represented by the fluorescent substance layer <b>14</b>) corresponding to the three type of light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed on the inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the explanation will be continued.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each of the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a structure in which the boat <b>13</b> having the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is inserted in the glass tube <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of the two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, between which a discharge slit is formed, is arranged on the light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B. The two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> are made up of metallic bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and transparent electrodes <b>211</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Here, in the case of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a region D<b>1</b> defined by one set of the three light-emitting strings <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B provided with the three types of fluorescent substance layers <b>14</b>R, <b>14</b>G, <b>14</b>B respectively and one display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of the two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> constitutes one pixel which is a unit for displaying a color image. The diameter of each light-emitting string <b>10</b>R, <b>10</b>G, <b>10</b>B is typically on the order of 1 mm, and therefore in the case of the structure shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the size of the region D<b>1</b> of one pixel is about 3 mm×3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the PTA having the basic structure described above, instead of arranging light-emitting strings two-dimensionally, it is also possible to form a curved image display plane by arranging the light-emitting strings along a curve (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-92085) or make the image display plane flexibly modifiable into various types of curved surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In such a case, a flexible substrate, for example, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate is used as the front supporting member <b>20</b> and back supporting member <b>30</b> and the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> formed on the front supporting member <b>20</b> are also required to have a structure resistant to bending. In this case, when the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> combining the metallic bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and transparent electrodes <b>211</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>each made up of an ITO thin film as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are used, since the ITO thin film has poor ductility, it may be cracked or subject to breaks when the flexible substrate is bent. For this reason, instead of the transparent electrodes <b>211</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>b </i>made of the ITO thin film, there is a proposal on an electrode structure with metal thin wires wired in a mesh, ladder stitch, or comb-like pattern (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-338244). The electrodes having wiring of these metal thin wires are more appropriate in the sense that they are resistant to bending of the substrate and that the image display plane is formed on a flexible curved surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The problem to be solved when using the display electrodes having a structure with wiring of metal thin wires as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is to make compatible reducing the resistance of the display electrodes and allowing light emitted from the fluorescent substance to pass through the structure with a high degree of efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Wiring relatively wide (or thick) metal thin wires or wiring metal thin wires relatively densely can reduce the electric resistance of the display electrodes but this causes the ratio of the area of the openings <b>621</b>, <b>622</b> to the total area of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>(hereinafter referred to as “opening ratio”) to decrease, which causes the light emitted form the fluorescent substance to be shielded, reducing the transmission coefficient and resulting in a dark image.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the contrary, using thinner metal thin wires and using more coarse wiring of metal thin wires will increase the opening ratio and improve the transmission coefficient accordingly, but the electric resistance of the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> is also increased, which requires a higher drive voltage to be applied to the display electrodes to obtain necessary light-emission intensity, etc., leading to deterioration of the discharge characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides a plasma tube array including display electrodes adopting more flexible wiring of metal thin wires and having an electrode structure which makes both a discharge characteristic and a high opening ratio compatible at a high level.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Various embodiments which will be described below differ from the conventional techniques explained so far only in the electrode structure of the display electrode, and therefore the overall structure in the respective embodiments will be explained with reference to the explanations given so far and the electrode structure of the display electrode specific to the respective embodiments will be mainly described here.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates display electrodes of a plasma tube array according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">This figure shows a display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> between which a discharge slit <b>210</b> is formed and the respective display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> are constructed of bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>made up of mesh-like metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> as in the case of the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Multiple openings <b>621</b>, <b>622</b> surrounded by the metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> are formed over the entire surfaces of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">What has been explained so far about the display electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are similar to the display electrodes in the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but unlike the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> adopts metal thin wires having a greater width, as metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> and extending the discharge slit, than metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>b</i>, <b>612</b><i>b </i>forming regions close to the non-discharge slit sides formed in a space with the neighboring display electrode pair. For example, the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>are metal thin wires having a wire width of 20 μm and the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>b</i>, <b>612</b><i>b </i>are metal thin wires having a wire width of 5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when thicker metal thin wires are used only for the parts facing the discharge slit <b>210</b>, the discharge characteristic is improved a great deal. In this case, the overall opening ratio of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>decreases slightly, but it is possible to maintain a sufficiently high opening ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates display electrodes of a plasma tube array according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows three light-emitting strings <b>10</b>. In this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the same components as those of the display electrodes of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are assigned the same reference numerals as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> between which a discharge slit <b>210</b> is interposed. As in the case of the display electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the respective display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> are constructed of bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c</i>. However, unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>making up the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> have an electrode structure with ladder-like wiring of metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">An experiment is conducted here by creating the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> using a wire width W of 12 μm and 20 μm as metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> and extending along the discharge slit <b>210</b>. The wire width of metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>b</i>, <b>612</b><i>b </i>other than the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> out of the metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> making up the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>is 5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the experiment result.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the result of continuously applying a high-voltage square wave voltage to the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, so-called sustained drive, and graphs A, B, C, D show a last ON voltage, first ON voltage, first OFF voltage and last OFF voltage, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Here, the voltage at which at least one of pixels originally controlled so as not to emit light discharges (emits light) when the voltage applied to the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> is increased gradually from a sufficiently low voltage is the first ON voltage B and the voltage at which all pixels including even pixels originally controlled so as not to emit light discharge (emit light) is the last ON voltage A. Furthermore, the voltage at which at least one of pixels which should originally emit light stops emitting light when the voltage is increased gradually from a state in which all pixels originally controlled so as to emit light are discharging (emitting light) is the first OFF voltage C and the voltage at which all pixels which should originally emit light stop emitting light when the voltage is further decreased is the last OFF voltage D.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Therefore, it is necessary to drive the display electrodes at a voltage not higher than the first ON voltage B and not lower than the first OFF voltage C (region with hatching in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and this region between the first ON voltage B and first OFF voltage C corresponds to an operation allowance.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the case of the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first ON voltage B exceeds the first OFF voltage C when the wire width W of the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> is approximately 13 μm or above. The wire width at the intersection between the first ON voltage B and the first OFF voltage C varies depending on the electrode structure, etc., but the wire width of the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> needs to be 13 μm or above when the electrode structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to change the discharge characteristic drastically by only adjusting the wire width of the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> and secure a sufficient operation allowance and realize a stable discharge (light emission, image display) using the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>having a relatively large wire width. Furthermore, since the discharge characteristic can be improved by only adjusting the wire width of the metal thin wires <b>611</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>a </i>facing the discharge slit <b>210</b>, it is possible to secure a sufficient opening ratio, maintain a high transmission coefficient and provide bright display.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates display electrodes of a plasma tube array according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">This <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> between which a discharge slit <b>210</b> is interposed and the respective display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> are constructed of bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are formed of metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> arranged parallel to the discharge slit <b>210</b> and slit-like openings <b>621</b>, <b>622</b> are formed between these metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b>. Here, all the metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> making up the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>have the same wire width. However, first regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b> enclosed by one metal thin wire <b>6111</b>, <b>6121</b> facing the discharge slit <b>210</b> and neighboring metal thin wire <b>6112</b>, <b>6122</b> have a narrower space so as to have a smaller opening ratio than that of second regions D<b>12</b>, D<b>22</b> of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>other than the first regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b>. The opening ratio here refers to the ratio of the area of the openings except the area covered with metal thin wires to the area of the region, and a higher opening ratio means a higher transmission coefficient of light from the light-emitting strings. Furthermore, instead of the opening ratio, a “coverage rate” representing the ratio of the area covered with metal thin wires represented by (1−opening ratio) may also be used below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, reducing only the opening ratio of the first regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b> in the vicinity of the discharge slit <b>210</b> also improves the discharge characteristic, eliminates the necessity for drastically reducing the overall opening ratio of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>and can balance the discharge characteristic and the opening ratio at a high level.</p>

This <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a result of continuously applying a high-voltage square wave voltage to the display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, a so-called sustained drive. The horizontal axis shows a coverage rate (%) (1−opening ratio) of the regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b> and the vertical axis shows voltage (V) and graphs A, B, C, D represent last ON voltage A, first ON voltage B, first OFF voltage C and last OFF voltage D respectively as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As is evident from this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the discharge characteristic is also improved by increasing only the coverage rate (reducing the opening ratio) of the regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b> in the vicinity of the discharge slit <b>210</b>. That is, both the first ON voltage B and first OFF voltage C decrease, and therefore it is possible to reduce the drive voltage and increase the brightness of light emission when the same drive voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a relationship between a drive voltage (V) and brightness of light emission (cd/m<sup>2</sup>) in the electrode structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(A) and 9(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, graph A corresponds to the case where the opening ratio of only the first regions D<b>11</b>, D<b>21</b> adjacent to the discharge slit <b>210</b> is reduced (shield factor is reduced to 57%) and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref>, graph B corresponds to the case where the opening ratio of the overall region of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>is the same (coverage rate is 33%).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In order to obtain the same brightness of light emission, the graph A when only the coverage rate in the vicinity of the discharge slit <b>210</b> is increased requires a lower drive voltage than the graph B when the coverage rate is uniform, and therefore the graph A can obtain higher brightness of light emission when driven at the same drive voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, reducing the opening ratio (increasing the coverage rate) of the region in the vicinity of the discharge slit <b>210</b> improves the discharge characteristic, does not require the opening ratio to be reduced considerably for the entire region of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>and can thereby balance the discharge characteristic and opening ratio at a high dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates display electrodes of a plasma tube array according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>are formed at positions facing a discharge slit <b>210</b> and branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>are formed at positions farther from the discharge slit <b>210</b> (non-discharge slits formed between neighboring display electrode pairs (not shown)) than the bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>are formed of metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b> of the same wire width extending vertically and horizontally and rectangular openings <b>621</b>, <b>622</b> are formed between the metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b>. However, the sides farthest from the discharge slit <b>210</b>, that is, openings <b>621</b><i>a</i>, <b>622</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the non-discharge slit have no metal thin wire which would partition the neighboring non-discharge slit and are open to the non-discharge slit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the case of the display electrodes having the electrode structure shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>are formed at positions adjacent to the discharge slit <b>210</b>, which produces the same effect as that of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, that is, using a thick metal thin wire only for the metal thin wire adjacent to the discharge slit <b>210</b> produces the effect of improving the discharge characteristic. Furthermore, the absence of a metal thin wire extending laterally on the non-discharge slit side to be formed in spaces with the neighboring display electrode pairs can narrow the slit width of the non-discharge slit and expand the areas of the branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>accordingly to thereby balance the high opening ratio and the improvement of the discharge characteristic as a whole at a further higher level.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates display electrodes of a plasma tube array according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The figure shows a display electrode pair <b>21</b> made up of two display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> between which a discharge slit <b>210</b> is interposed and the respective display electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> are constructed of bus electrodes <b>211</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>a </i>and branched electrodes <b>211</b><i>c</i>, <b>212</b><i>c </i>made up of mesh-like metal thin wires <b>611</b>, <b>612</b>.
