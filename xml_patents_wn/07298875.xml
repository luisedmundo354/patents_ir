<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a capacitance-type fingerprint sensor, and more particularly to a capacitance-type fingerprint sensor using a two-stage electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A fingerprint recognition system acquires a fingerprint image, and compares the acquired fingerprint image with a pre-stored fingerprint image using unique characteristics of people's fingerprints such that it can recognize a specific person from among a plurality of persons. The fingerprint system has been widely used for security and authentication systems, and includes a fingerprint sensor for acquiring a fingerprint image and an image processor for comparing the acquired fingerprint image with a pre-stored fingerprint image. Typically, the fingerprint sensor includes an image sensor and additional devices (e.g., a light source, and a lens, etc.) for generating an optical fingerprint image. There have recently been researched semiconductor-type sensors capable of acquiring a fingerprint using only a single chip without using additional devices required for a conventional optical system, such that they have been widely applied to mobile devices such as a mobile phone and a smart card, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particularly, the capacitance-type fingerprint sensor from among the above-mentioned semiconductor-type sensors is adapted to recognize a fingerprint using a difference in capacitor's capacitance generated when the fingerprint contacts a sensing electrode, and has an advantage in that it can be implemented with a conventional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuit fabrication without using additional processes, such that it is most widely used to recognize a fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A basic capacitance-type fingerprint sensor structure has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,056 filed by Siemens Corporation in Germany, entitled “CAPACITIVE FINGERPRINT SENSOR”. A structure for enhancing an output fingerprint image quality of a fingerprint sensor and detecting characteristics of the output fingerprint image has been described in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 1999, vol. 34, no. 7, pp. 978˜984, proposed by S. Jung. A method for removing a parasitic component from a capacitance-type fingerprint sensor and enhancing a fingerprint image quality of the fingerprint sensor has been described in IEEE International Solid-State Circuit Conference on 2002, proposed by K. Lee.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the conventional capacitance-type fingerprint sensing apparatus detects capacitor's capacitance formed between a finger skin surface and each uppermost metal plate <b>10</b> used as a sensing electrode, such that it acquires a fingerprint image. The metal plate <b>10</b> acting as a sensing electrode has a two-dimensional layout, and each pixel positioned at a lower part of the metal plate <b>10</b> includes a detection circuit <b>20</b> for detecting capacitor's capacitance. An output terminal of the detection circuit <b>20</b> contained in each pixel is connected to a column-direction selection drive <b>22</b> by a row-direction selection drive <b>21</b>, and output signals of pixels arranged by the column-direction selection drive <b>22</b> are sequentially generated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the detection circuit <b>20</b> connected to the metal plate <b>10</b> acting as a sensing electrode is formed in an insulating layer <b>40</b> formed on a substrate <b>30</b>, such that it is insulated from an external part. However, not only capacitance formed between a finger and a sensing electrode to form a fingerprint image, but also parasitic capacitance is formed among the sensing electrode, the substrate and the detection circuit, such that the parasitic capacitance acts as a fixed signal irrespective of the fingerprint image.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>is a schematic diagram illustrating how a fingerprint image is differently represented according to the degree of moisture left on a finger surface in the case of using the fingerprint sensing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>˜<b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, if the finger surface is not in an especially dry or moist state, the skin of the finger acts as an electrode, such that a fingerprint image matched with a real fingerprint is formed. Otherwise, if the finger surface is moist, moisture left on the finger surface acts as an electrode. Also, if the finger surface is dry, the dermis of the finger acts as an electrode, such that a fingerprint image different from a real fingerprint is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As mentioned above, capacitor's capacitance formed when the sensing electrode contacts the finger surface has difficulty in acquiring a high-quality fingerprint image due to parasitic capacitance formed in a circuit capable of detecting the dry or moist state of a finger surface or the capacitor's capacitance, such that it causes the conventional fingerprint recognition system to be erroneously operated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a capacitance-type fingerprint sensor for reducing the influence of parasitic capacitance and the influence of a dry or moist state of a finger, such that it acquires a high-quality fingerprint image.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The capacitance-type fingerprint sensor apparatus includes a first step, in which the first sensing-electrode switches, the second sensing-electrode switches, the third sensing-electrode switches, and the coupling-electrode switches are turned on, and a voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the first and second voltage sources; a second step, in which the third sensing-electrode switches are turned off not to interconnect the pixel groups, the first sensing-electrode switches are turned off to block the first voltage source, and a voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is applied to the second voltage source, such that a mean capacitance value for each pixel group is calculated in association with each of the pixel groups; and a third step, in which the second sensing-electrode switches are turned off to prevent the pixels contained in each pixel group from being electrically interconnected, and a voltage of V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the second voltage source, such that changed capacitance for each sensing electrode is calculated, wherein a voltage corresponding to a difference between the mean capacitance value for each pixel group at the second step and the capacitance calculated at the third step is detected, such that distortion of a fingerprint image formed by a dry or moist state of a finger brought into contact with the insulating layer surrounding the sensing electrodes can be corrected.</p>

The sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b> are each surrounded by the insulating layer, and are positioned on the coupling electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b>, respectively, such that they are connected to the above-mentioned coupling electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> on a one to one basis. If a user's finger is brought into contact with the insulating layer surrounding the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b>, the detection circuit detects variable capacitance between the user's finger and each of the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> includes a plurality of pixels. The sensing electrodes are connected to each other in the pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b>, and the coupling electrodes are connected to each other in the pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b>. Individual sensing electrodes contained in one pixel group are connected to a first voltage source installed at an external part, and individual coupling electrodes contained in one pixel group are connected to a second voltage source. The connection between the sensing electrodes or the coupling electrodes is established by a plurality of switches.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The switches are classified into a plurality of sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, and a plurality of coupling-electrode switches (not shown). The sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>331</b>, and <b>332</b> are classified into first sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, second sensing-electrode switches <b>321</b> and <b>322</b>, and third sensing-electrode switches <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b> connect the selected one from among a plurality of sensing electrodes contained in the pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> to the first voltage source positioned at the external part.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The third sensing-electrode switches <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> connect the sensing electrodes contained in the pixel groups <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> to each other. For example, the third sensing-electrode switch <b>331</b> connects one sensing electrode <b>222</b> from among a plurality of sensing electrodes contained in the first pixel group <b>210</b> to the sensing electrode <b>232</b> from among other sensing electrodes contained in the second pixel group <b>220</b>. In this way, the above-mentioned third sensing-electrode switches <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are mounted to all pixel groups.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the meantime, each selected coupling electrodes contained in each pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> is connected to the second voltage source positioned at the external part.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The capacitance-type fingerprint sensor according to the present invention generates parasitic capacitance between the substrate <b>100</b> and each of the coupling electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> and capacitance (hereinafter referred to as fixed capacitance) between each of the coupling electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> and each of the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b> along with variable capacitance between each of the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b> and a finger. In this case, the coupling electrodes are charged with a predetermined voltage received from an external part and are controlled by the predetermined voltage, such that the individual parasitic capacitances do not affect the sensing electrodes. The fixed capacitance is calculated when the capacitance-type fingerprint sensor according to the present invention is designed. Therefore, the fixed capacitance is corrected, and the corrected result is reflected in the measured variable capacitance, such that a high-quality signal not affected by the parasitic capacitance and the fixed capacitance can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A method for recognizing the dry or moist state of a user's finger, correcting the finger state and the fixed capacitance, and implementing a high-quality fingerprint image, and the relationship between the fixed capacitance and the variable capacitance will hereinafter be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), the first sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, the second sensing-electrode switches <b>321</b> and <b>322</b>, the third sensing-electrode switches <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>, and the coupling-electrode switches are turned on, and the voltage of V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the first and second voltage sources. Therefore, a voltage is applied to individual fixed capacitors by means of the voltage sources, such that the amount of electric charge stored in capacitors is initiated at step (a). In this case, the amount of charge stored in the fixed capacitor ‘C’ is indicative of ‘0’, and the amount of charge stored in the variable capacitor ‘C<sub>f</sub>’ (i.e., capacitance generated by the contact between the sensing electrode and the user's finger) is indicative of ‘C<sub>fi</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>−V<sub>f</sub>)’. In this case, the voltage of V<sub>f </sub>is indicative of a voltage generated on the finger surface, and is constant during the operation time of the detection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the third sensing-electrode switches <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are turned off to prevent pixel groups from being interconnected, and the first sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b> are turned off to block the first voltage source. The voltage of V<sub>2 </sub>is applied to the second voltage source, such that a mean capacitance value for each pixel group is calculated at step (b).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the fixed capacitance generated by any pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> comprised of 8×8 pixels is indicative of ‘64×C’, and the variable capacitance is indicative of ΣC<sub>fi</sub>. Under this condition, in the case where the first and third sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are turned off in the same manner as in the above step (b) so as to allow the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b> of the fixed capacitor to enter a floating state, and the voltage of the coupling electrodes <b>211</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>231</b>, and <b>241</b> is changed to the voltage of V<sub>2</sub>, charges are applied to the fixed capacitance having a charge of ‘0’. However, a total amount of charges contained in each pixel is constant, and the charges are re-distributed again according to a fixed capacitance value and a variable capacitance value, such that the voltage of the sensing electrodes <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b> is changed to another. The sensing electrodes contained in each pixel group <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> have the same voltage, and this voltage can be represented by the following equation 1:</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to Equation 3, the voltage V<sub>o</sub>′ of each sensing electrode is dependent on a mean capacitance value C<sub>favg </sub>of a variable capacitor formed between a finger surface covering a predetermined area and each of the sensing electrodes contained in one pixel group, and is also dependent on capacitance C<sub>fi </sub>of a variable capacitor formed between the finger surface and each sensing electrode contained in each pixel. Therefore, the shape of a fingerprint may be differently formed according to individual areas due to a difference in the dry or moist state of a finger surface, such that the influence of the finger surface state is reduced by considering a mean capacitance value of a variable capacitor arranged in the vicinity of each pixel. Also, the voltage of V<sub>o</sub>′ is indicative of a function of the fixed capacitance C, the fixed capacitance C is corrected, and the corrected result is applied to the measured variable capacitance C<sub>fi</sub>, such that a high-quality signal not affected by parasitic capacitance can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a method for generating mean capacitance of a variable capacitor for each pixel group acquired by the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> such that a fingerprint image quality is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first signal S<sub>1</sub>, which is acquired when pixel's variable capacitance formed by grooves and ridges of a finger surface is differently distributed according to individual areas due to a difference in partial state of the finger surface, and a second signal S<sub>2</sub>, which is formed by a mean capacitance value of a variable capacitor contained in each pixel group, are generated, and a third signal S<b>3</b> generated by a difference between two signals S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>is generated. In the case of substituting the first to third signals S<sub>1</sub>˜S<sub>3 </sub>into a reference line S<sub>0</sub>, a fingerprint image quality is increased, such that grooves and ridges of the finger can be distinguished from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In more detail, as shown in the upper graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first area A in which the signal S<sub>1 </sub>generated by variable capacitance of each pixel and the signal S<sub>2 </sub>generated by a mean capacitance value of a variable capacitor contained in a pixel group are higher than the reference line S<sub>0 </sub>is in an average state in which the finger surface is not in an especially dry or moist state, and a second area B in which the signal S<sub>1 </sub>and the signal S<sub>2 </sub>are less than the reference line S<sub>0 </sub>is in a moist state. In the case of substituting the signal S<sub>3 </sub>generated by the mean value of the signals S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>into the reference line S<sub>0</sub>, a high-quality fingerprint image composed of grooves and ridges of a fingerprint can be acquired irrespective of the finger state. As shown in the lower graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the area positioned at the upper part of the reference line is indicative of grooves of the fingerprint, and the other area positioned at the lower part of the reference line is indicative of ridges of the fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a circuit for converting voltages of individual sensing electrodes into gray levels according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a comparator compares the voltage V<sub>o</sub>′ of the sensing electrode with an external reference voltage V<sub>R</sub>, outputs the value of 0 when the voltage V<sub>o</sub>′ of the sensing electrode is less than the reference voltage V<sub>R</sub>, and outputs the value of 1 when the voltage V<sub>o</sub>′ of the sensing electrode is higher than the reference voltage V<sub>R</sub>. In the case of using the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a gray level value corresponding to a reference voltage when a current output value is changed to the value of 1 acts as a fingerprint image.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the signals S<sub>3 </sub>in which a mean capacitance value C<sub>favg </sub>of a variable capacitor contained in one pixel group and capacitance C<sub>fi </sub>of a variable capacitor of the sensing electrode contained in each pixel are not included, are formed in the vicinity of the reference line S<sub>0</sub>. Therefore, if the reference voltage signal V<sub>R </sub>applied to the comparator is gradually changed to be less or higher than the voltage of V<sub>R</sub>′ corresponding to the reference line S<sub>0</sub>, the fingerprint image is more improved.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first, second, and third sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>333</b>, <b>334</b>, and <b>335</b> are implemented with transistors, and on/off operations of the transistors are controlled, such that all sensing electrodes contained in each pixel group may be connected to each other or may be connected to the first voltage source V<sub>a</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first to third sensing-electrode switches <b>310</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>333</b>, <b>334</b>, and <b>335</b> are disconnected from the first voltage source V<sub>a</sub>, and the sensing electrodes contained in each pixel group are connected to each other. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a configuration in the above step (b). In the case where individual switches <b>310</b>, <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>333</b>, <b>334</b>, and <b>335</b> contained in the detection circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are arbitrarily controlled, the number of connected pixels is changed to another number, such that fingerprint images having different resolutions can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As apparent from the above description, the present invention blocks or corrects capacitance generated by internal components of a conventional fingerprint sensor using a two-stage electrode, such that it removes unnecessary signals not associated with a fingerprint image, resulting in an improved fingerprint image.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, the present invention corrects or reduces the influence of the dry or moist state of a finger surface, such that a fingerprint image differently shown according to individual areas can be more uniformly indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
