<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a flat panel display device comprising a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor and provides a flat panel display device having improved characteristics by having a different number of grain boundaries included in polycrystalline silicon thin film formed in active channel regions of a driving circuit portion and active channel regions of pixel portion. This may be achieved by having a different number of grain boundaries included in the polycrystalline silicon thin film formed in active channel regions of a switching thin film transistor and a driving thin film transistor formed in the pixel portion, and by having a different number of grain boundaries included in polycrystalline silicon thin film formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor for driving the pixel portion for each red, green and blue of the pixel portion. Further, this may be achieved by having a different number of grain boundaries included in polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of an NMOS thin film transistor and a PMOS thin film transistor for forming CMOS transistor used in flat panel display device, thereby constructing a thin film transistor to obtain the improved characteristics for each transistor.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIMS TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application Numbers. 2003-36519, 2003-37245, 2003-51659 and 2003-51681, filed on Jun. 5, 2003, Jun. 10, 2003, Jul. 25, 2003 and Jul. 25, 2003 respectively, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a flat panel display device with a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor, and more particularly, to a flat panel display device with a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor in which the number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in an active channel region of thin film transistor included in the flat panel display device varies according to the thin film transistor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bonding defects such as dangling bonds existing on grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon included in active channel region are known to function as a trap for an electric charge carrier during fabrication of a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as “TFT”) using polycrystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, the size of grains, uniformity of grain size, number and position of the grains and the direction of the grains may not only have a fatal effect on TFT characteristics directly and/or indirectly, such as threshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold slope, charge carrier mobility, leakage current and device stability, but may also have a fatal effect on TFT uniformity according to position of the grains when fabricating an active matrix display substrate using TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The number of fatal grain boundaries (hereinafter referred to as “primary” grain boundaries) included in the active channel regions of TFT all over the substrate of the display device can be equalized or varied according to size of grains, inclination angle θ of the grains, dimension of the active channel (length (L) and width (W)) and the position of each TFT on the substrate (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the number of “primary” grain boundaries included in the active channel regions for grain size Gs, active channel dimension L×W and inclination angle θ of the grains (that is, the number of “primary” grain boundaries included in the active channel regions according to position of TFT substrate or display device) is Nmax (3 in case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or Nmax-1 (2 in case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) when the maximum number of grain boundaries is Nmax. More uniformity in the TFT characteristics may be secured when the number of “primary” grain boundaries of Nmax for all TFTs is included in active channel regions. That is, the more each TFT has an equal number of grain boundaries, the more uniformity the device obtains.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, it may be understood that uniformity is worse in characteristics of TFTs on TFT substrates or display devices if the number of TFT including Nmax “primary” grain boundaries is equal to the number of TFT including Nmax-1 “primary” grain boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Polycrystalline or single crystalline grains may be capable of forming large silicon grains on a substrate using sequential lateral solidification (SLS) crystallization technology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Characteristics similar to characteristics of TFT fabricated of single crystalline silicon may be obtained when fabricating TFT using the large silicon grains. However, a plurality of TFTs for driver and pixel array should be fabricated for an active matrix display.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, approximately one million pixels are made in fabricating an active matrix display having SVGA resolution. One TFT may be required in each pixel in the case of liquid crystal display (LCD). At least two or more TFTs may be required in a display using organic light emitting materials such as organic electroluminescent device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it may be difficult to fabricate an active matrix display by growing a certain number of grains to a certain direction only in the active channel regions of each of more than one million or two million TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A technology for converting the amorphous silicon on the whole substrate into polycrystalline silicon, or for crystallizing selected regions only on the substrate using SLS technology after depositing amorphous silicon by PECVD, LPCVD or sputtering is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,322,625 as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The selected region is also quite a large region compared to an active channel region having dimension of several μm by several μm. Furthermore, the size of the laser beam used in crystallization technology is approximately several mm×scores of mm. Stepping and shifting of the laser beam or stage are required to crystallize the amorphous silicon of the whole region or a selected region on substrate, where misalignment exists between regions on which the laser beam is irradiated. Misalignment may be included in active channel regions of a plurality of TFTs. The number of grain boundaries vary, and TFT on the whole substrate or in the driver region or the pixel cell region may have unpredictable non-uniformity. The non-uniformity may have a fatal effect on an active matrix display device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Fabricating TFTs for an LCD device comprising a driver and pixel array by forming large silicon grains using SLS crystallization technology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,391. Barrier effects of grain boundaries for the electric charge carrier direction may be minimized, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, so that the large silicon grains obtain TFT characteristics next to those of single crystalline when the direction of the active channels is parallel to direction of grains grown by a SLS crystallization method. Many grain boundaries in which TFT characteristics function as trap of electric charge carrier, also exist such that TFT characteristics may deteriorate, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Practically, there are cases that a TFT inside the driver circuit and a TFT inside the pixel cell regions generally have an angle of 90° when fabricating an active matrix display, wherein uniformity of the device can be improved by fabricating the active matrix display in such a way that the direction of the active channel regions is inclined to grain growing in a direction at an angle of 30 to 60°, so that uniform characteristics between TFTs are improved and characteristics of each TFT do not greatly deteriorate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, it is likely that fatal grain boundaries are included in active channel regions since limited sized grains formed by SLS crystallization technology are also used in this method. Therefore, there is a problem that unpredictable non-uniformity causing a difference in characteristics between TFTs exists in this method.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">On the other hand, a polycrystalline silicon thin film consists of transistors to be used as a switching device or a driving device for pixels in a flat panel display device, such as an organic electroluminescent display device or a liquid display device, wherein an active driving type active matrix organic electroluminescent display device comprises at least two thin film transistors for each sub-pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An organic electroluminescent device comprises an emission layer formed of an organic matter between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode. In the organic electroluminescent device, holes injected from the anode electrode are moved to the emission layer via a hole transport layer as anode and cathode voltages are being applied to the respective electrodes. Electrons are injected into the emission layer from the cathode electrode via an electron transport layer so that the electrons and holes are reunited with each other in the emission layer to produce exitons, and light emitting materials of the emission layer are emitted to form a picture as the exitons are being changed from the excited state to the ground state. A full color organic electroluminescent display device comprises pixels emitting the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) in order to realize full colors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the emission efficiency (Cd/A) of each emission layer of red, green and blue for emitting each color varies by color in the organic electroluminescent display device. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain an appropriate degree of color balance, or white balance as some colors have lower luminance while other colors have higher luminance. This may occur even when an equal current is applied to the sub-pixel since luminance of the emission layer is approximately proportional to the current values applied to each sub-pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, a corresponding amount of additional current should flow to the red and blue emission layers to adjust white balance, since the emission efficiency of the green emission layer is three to six times higher than the emission efficiency of the red emission layer and the blue emission layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">On the other hand, a method for applying different voltages supplied through a driving line, that is, a driving voltage (Vdd) to each pixel, is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Heisei 5-107561 as a conventional method for adjusting white balance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, a method for adjusting white balance by controlling the size of the driving TFT is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-109399. The amount of current flowing to respective red, green and blue organic electroluminescent devices is controlled by differently designing W/L values for each red, green and blue pixel where the channel width is W and the channel length is L in the channel regions of the driving TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A method for adjusting the white balance by forming different sized pixels is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-290441. The white balance and a long life cycle may be enabled by forming the green color emitting region in such a way that the emission area of the green color emitting region having the highest emission efficiency is the smallest compared to the emission area of the red color and the blue color emitting regions. This emission efficiency difference can be enabled by the area of the anode electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, one method for controlling luminance varies the voltage range applied through data lines for each red, green and blue pixel, thereby controlling the current amount.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, the foregoing methods do not consider the crystal structure of the polycrystalline silicon in a TFT of a flat panel display device using polycrystalline silicon. Current mobility can be varied according to the crystal state of the polycrystalline silicon included in the active channel regions of TFT. Even in this case, the white balance may not be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, a flat panel display device is driven by generally using complementary metal oxide semiconductor thin film transistor (CMOS TFT) in constructing circuits in the flat panel display device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, an absolute value of the threshold voltage of a TFT is generally larger than an absolute value of the threshold voltage of a MOS transistor using a single crystalline semiconductor. Furthermore, an absolute value of the threshold voltage of an N type thin film transistor is quite different from an absolute value of the threshold of a P type thin film transistor. For example, if the threshold voltage of the N type thin film transistor is 2 V, the threshold of the P type thin film transistor may be −4 V.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, a great threshold voltage absolute value difference between the P type thin film transistor and N type thin film transistor may not be desirable in operating circuits, and it may function as a barrier in reducing the driving voltage. For example, typically, a P type thin film transistor having a large threshold voltage absolute value not properly operated at a lower driving voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">That is, the P type thin film transistor generally functions only as a passive element, such as a resistor, and is not operated fast enough. It may be necessary to increase the driving voltage to operate the P type thin film transistor just as a passive element.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Particularly, a difference in the work function between the gate electrode and the intrinsic silicon semiconductor may be decreased as much as −0.6 eV in the case where the gate electrode is formed of a material having a work function of 5 eV or less, such as aluminum. Consequently, the threshold voltage of the P type thin film transistor is shifted to a negative value while threshold voltage of the N type thin film transistor approaches a zero voltage. Therefore, the N type thin film transistor generally becomes the on-state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the above state, it is desirable that the threshold voltage absolute value of the N type thin film transistor be almost equal to that of the P type thin film transistor. The threshold voltage has been controlled by doping N type or P type impurities at a very low concentration of 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. That is, the threshold voltage has been controlled to about 0.1 V or less by doping impurities having a concentration of 10<sup>15 </sup>to 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, a shift of the threshold voltage may not observed even if impurities are added to the semiconductor in a concentration of 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less when using a semiconductor that is not a single crystalline semiconductor. Furthermore, the threshold voltage is rapidly changed, and the conductivity becomes p-type or n-type if the concentration of impurities is 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more, since the polycrystalline silicon has many defects. The added impurities are trapped and can not be activated by the defects since the defect concentration is 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, the concentration of the impurities is larger than the concentration of the defects, excess impurities are activated, and the conductive type is changed to n or p type.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to solve these problems, the length of the channels is varied so that the channel length of a P type thin film transistor is shorter than that of an N type thin film transistor, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,492,268, 6,124,603 and 5,615,935. However, these patents also have problems in that the manufacturing process is complicated, since the channels are manufactured in such a way that length of the channels is different.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, in order to solve the foregoing problems of the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a flat panel display device comprising thin film transistor using polycrystalline silicon capable of satisfying TFT characteristics of a driving circuit portion and TFT characteristics of a pixel portion when forming polycrystalline silicon.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. For reference, like reference characters designate corresponding portions throughout several views.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Grain boundaries are generated between neighboring grains due to the limited size of the grains if grains of polycrystalline silicon having an effect, either directly or indirectly, on TFT characteristics are enlarged and regularized to improve TFT characteristics when fabricating a TFT for an active matrix display.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the present invention, “grain size” is said to be a confirmable distance between grain boundaries and defined as the distance between the grain boundaries belonging to an ordinary error range.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Particularly, when the grain boundaries exist in active channel regions, the grain boundaries may have a fatal effect on TFT characteristics. This may result from limitations in the process of forming a polycrystalline silicon thin film.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a TFT comprising a driving thin film transistor and a switching thin film transistor fabricated on a display substrate may vary based on the size and direction of the grains and the dimension of active channels. Therefore, characteristics of a TFT and a fabricated display become non-uniform, and the TFT and display may not be driven.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, the present invention provides a flat panel display device comprising a TFT controlled by electrical characteristics by changing the number of grain boundaries existing in active channel regions of each TFT for respective thin film transistors fabricated on the substrate of driving circuit portion and pixel portion.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor formed in a pixel portion and a driving circuit portion in an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein enlarged view A shows a thin film transistor of the pixel portion, and enlarged view B shows a thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention is divided into gate lines and data lines and comprises a pixel portion <b>20</b> comprising thin film transistors driven by signals applied to the gate lines and data lines. A driving circuit portion <b>10</b> comprises one or more thin film transistors respectively connected to the gate lines and data lines to apply signals to the pixel portion <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The average number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor installed at the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> and which meet the current direction line is at least one or more less than the average number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor installed at the pixel portion <b>20</b> and meet the current direction line for a unit area of active channels.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The shape of the grains of polycrystalline silicon is anisotropic, and the grains of polycrystalline silicon are preferably formed by one of a sequential lateral solidification (SLS) method and a metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC) method. Although grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed by a SLS method include “primary” grain boundaries ordinarily perpendicularly formed to growing direction of grains and “side” grain boundaries of anisotropic grains ordinarily perpendicularly formed to the “primary” grain boundaries, grain boundaries of a type which is not specified hereinafter represent “primary” grain boundaries, since grain boundaries having a primary effect on electrical characteristics of a thin film transistor mean “primary” grain boundaries. Grain boundaries having an incidental effect on electrical characteristics of a thin film transistor mean “side” grain boundaries of anisotropic grains.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, referring to enlarged views A and B, the primary grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor installed at driving circuit portion <b>10</b> and pixel portion <b>20</b> may be inclined to a current direction line at an angle of −45 to 45° and further may be inclined to the current direction line at an angle of 0 (zero)°.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, the pixel portion <b>20</b> may achieve greater uniformity than the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> by lengthening length d<sub>1 </sub>of active channels of the thin film transistor installed at the pixel portion <b>20</b> more than length d<sub>2 </sub>of active channels of the thin film transistor installed at the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> so that more side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains are included in the pixel portion <b>20</b> than the driving circuit portion <b>10</b>. This may result in a reduction of current change according to a change in the number of grain boundaries meeting the current direction line.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor formed in pixel portion <b>20</b> and driving circuit portion <b>10</b> in an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Enlarged view A shows a thin film transistor of the pixel portion, and enlarged view B shows a thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment, primary grain boundaries may be inclined to current direction line at an angle of −45 to 45°, and the primary grain boundaries further may be inclined horizontally to the current direction line in the pixel portion <b>20</b> as illustrated in the enlarged view A, so that the number of primary grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor of driving circuit portion <b>10</b> to meet a current direction line is one or more less than the number of primary grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor of pixel portion <b>20</b> to meet a current direction line. On the other hand, the primary grain boundaries may be inclined to a current direction line at an angle of 45 to 135°. The primary grain boundaries further may be inclined perpendicularly to the current direction line in the driving circuit portion <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The active channel regions of a thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> and pixel portion <b>20</b> may have an equal length of d.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor formed in pixel portion <b>20</b> and driving circuit portion <b>10</b> in an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Enlarged view A shows a thin film transistor of the pixel portion, and enlarged view B shows a thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor installed at the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> may be inclined to a current direction line at an angle of −45 to 45°, and, further may be arranged that the grain boundaries are parallel to the current direction line.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, the grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor installed at the pixel portion <b>20</b> are inclined to a current direction line at an angle of −45 to 45°, and may be arranged that the grain boundaries are parallel to the current direction line, wherein active channels of a thin film transistor installed at the pixel portion <b>20</b> and active channels of a thin film transistor installed at the driving circuit portion <b>10</b> have an equal length of d.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">However, in this case, distance w<sub>1 </sub>between primary grain boundaries in the pixel portion is shorter than distance w<sub>2 </sub>between primary grain boundaries in the driving circuit portion since uniformity in the pixel portion is secured when the number of primary grain boundaries meeting a current direction line included in active channel regions of a thin film transistor of the pixel portion <b>20</b> is larger than the number of primary grain boundaries meeting a current direction line included in active channel regions of a thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of thin film transistors formed in pixel portion and driving circuit portion in an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Enlarged view A shows a thin film transistor of the pixel portion, and enlarged view B shows thin film transistor of the driving circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, grains of polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of a thin film transistor of driving circuit portion <b>10</b> and pixel portion <b>20</b> are formed in an isotropic shape. More grain boundaries are included in a thin film transistor at the pixel portion than in a thin film transistor at the driving circuit portion if the size of the grains of polycrystalline silicon formed in the pixel portion illustrated in enlarged view A is larger than the size of the grains of polycrystalline silicon formed in the driving circuit portion illustrated in enlarged view B. Therefore, more grain boundaries meeting a current direction line are included in a thin film transistor at the pixel portion than in a thin film transistor at the driving circuit portion. The number of grain boundaries in the pixel portion may be at least one or more larger than the number of grain boundaries in the driving circuit portion, wherein the driving circuit portion and pixel portion of active channel regions of a thin film transistor have an equal length d.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Isotropic shaped polycrystalline silicon in this embodiment may be formed by excimer laser annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph illustrating changes in threshold voltage values according to the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a thin film transistor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph illustrating changes in current mobility values according to the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it can be seen that threshold voltage is increased, and current mobility is decreased, as the number of grain boundaries meeting a current direction line is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The grain boundaries may have an effect on electrical characteristics of thin film transistor, wherein the electrical characteristics of a thin film transistor are influenced mainly by primary grain boundaries and additionally by side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the fabricated polycrystalline silicon is applied to a TFT with one or more gates, the average number of grains included in an area of equal active channel regions may be at least one or more larger in a pixel portion than in a driving circuit portion, and the number of grain boundaries included may also be larger in the pixel portion than in the driving circuit portion.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, in active channel regions of a gate included in one TFT, the size of polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of the pixel portion may be more uniformized than the size of polycrystalline silicon grains formed in active channel regions of the driving circuit portion. The difference in the number (area) of grain boundaries due to a difference in the number of grains existing in active channels may be decreased as the area of grain boundaries covering the one grain is decreased while the number (area) of grain boundaries included in active channels is increased when the size of the grains is small.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, the average grain size of polycrystalline silicon grains included in active channel regions of each gate may be larger in the driving circuit portion than in the pixel portion.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Therefore, uniformity of current may be better in the pixel portion than in the driving circuit portion, as grain size is more uniform in the pixel portion than in the driving circuit portion, although current characteristics such as current mobility may be better in the driving circuit portion than in the pixel portion.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the present invention, a TFT has two or more gates.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A flat panel display device comprising the above formed polycrystalline silicon thin film may be an organic electroluminescent device or liquid crystal display device.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The switching thin film transistor <b>120</b> is driven by scan signals applied to gate lines which control transmission of data signals applied to data lines. The driving thin film transistor <b>130</b> determines the amount of current flowing through the EL device <b>150</b> based on the data signals transmitted through the switching thin film transistor <b>120</b>, (e.g., by voltage difference (Vgs) between the gate and the source).

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The average number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of the switching thin film transistor and meet the current direction line may be at least one or more greater than the average number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of the driving thin film transistor and meet the current direction line for a unit area of active channels.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to enlarged views A and B, primary grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon formed in active channel regions of the switching thin film transistor and the driving thin film transistor may be arranged in such a way that the primary grain boundaries are inclined to the current direction line at an angle of −45 to 45°, preferably at an angle of 0 (zero)°.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, improved uniformity may be obtained in the driving thin film transistor compared to the switching thin film transistor by lengthening length d<sub>1 </sub>of active channels of the driving thin film transistor compared to length d<sub>2 </sub>of active channels of the switching thin film transistor so that more side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains are included in the driving thin film transistor than in the switching thin film transistor.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it can be seen that threshold voltage is increased, and current mobility is decreased as the number of grain boundaries meeting a current direction line is being increased.</p>

However, formation of these pixels is not necessarily limited to this formation.

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It can be seen in Table 1 that the current values flowing to the sub-pixels to adjust the white balance may be increased in the order of green sub-pixel, blue sub-pixel and red sub-pixel. Alternative orders may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Polycrystalline silicon may be used in the present invention as a semiconductor layer for forming a transistor. Therefore, in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor used as a driving thin film transistor in the present invention, different numbers of primary grain boundaries are included in an equal size of the active channel regions per respective red, green and blue indicating pixel so that the white balance may be adjusted for the same driving voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a structure in which a thin film transistor may be arranged on polycrystalline silicon. Although polycrystalline silicon may be formed by crystallizing amorphous silicon thin film using an ordinary SLS method, the foregoing crystal structure is not necessarily limited to a crystal structure formed by the SLS method. Any crystallization method can be applied. Laser crystallization method may be used if the polycrystalline silicon thin film has a crystal structure similar to a structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a graph illustrating a change in current mobility according to the number of primary grain boundaries. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, current mobility of a PMOS thin film transistor or an NMOS thin film transistor may be linearly reduced as the number of primary grain boundaries is being increased.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a graph illustrating change of current mobility according to the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains. Current mobility of a PMOS thin film transistor or an NMOS thin film transistor may also be reduced as the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains is being increased.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Current mobility characteristics may be improved compared to when the primary grain boundaries are parallel to the direction of current flowing from the source to the drain, since primary grain boundaries may have more effect on the number of grain boundaries capable of functioning as trap for current flow than side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Uniformity of a TFT may be secured, since variations for position change inside the substrate of active channels is less (e.g., variation changes when the number of grain boundaries is changed from one to two and when the number of grain boundaries is changed from 100 to 102), while current characteristics may degrade due to an increase in the number of grain boundaries. A trap may result when the electric charge carrier traverses one or more of the grain boundaries (e.g., side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains), in case that “primary” grain boundaries are parallel to current direction.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains may have small variations according to the current movement in accordance with the change in the number of grain boundaries, although “primary” grain boundaries may have large variations according to current movement in accordance with the change of the number of grain boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Therefore, this current value difference in the present invention may be accomplished by changing the number of primary grain boundaries and/or the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains of polycrystalline silicon included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, e.g., a driving thin film transistor for supplying current to emission device. A current value supplied to the emission device of each sub-pixel, for example, an organic electroluminescent device, may be changed by changing the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a first thin film transistor of red, green and blue sub-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channels of the second thin film transistor may be determined by a current value flowing to each sub-pixel at the same driving voltage. Therefore, the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of the green sub-pixels may be controlled to the minimum in such a way that the current value of the green sub-pixels having the highest luminance becomes the lowest to adjust white balance. Alternatively, the number of primary grain boundaries included in each active channel region of the second red thin film transistor, the second blue thin film transistor and the second green thin film transistor may be controlled in such a way that the current value for each sub-pixel is lowered in the order of red, blue and green sub-pixels. Therefore, luminance of each sub-pixel may be complemented so that the white balance is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor may also be determined by the electric charge mobility of the active channel regions, since more current flows if the electric charge mobility in the active channel regions is higher while less of current flows if the electric charge mobility in the active channel regions is lower.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Therefore, the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of a green sub-pixel may be controlled in such a way that the electric charge mobility of the green sub-pixel having the highest emission efficiency is lowered to the minimum to adjust the white balance. The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of each sub-pixel may be controlled in such a way that the number of primary grain boundaries is increased in the order of red, blue and green sub-pixels, or the number of primary grain boundaries may be equivalent to each other in the blue and green sub-pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The number of the primary grain boundaries may be increased in the order of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the red sub-pixel, primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the blue sub-pixel and primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the green sub-pixel, so that the active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of the red sub-pixel has the highest electric charge mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Accordingly, the respective sub-pixels have different current values as mentioned above so that luminance of each sub-pixel is supplemented to adjust white balance. Furthermore, the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor varies according to the emitting material for forming the emitting layer, and the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of each sub-pixel may be set based on the green sub-pixel after obtaining the luminance of each pixel and current ratio for adjusting the white balance in advance.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Furthermore, the present invention may adjust white balance, supplying proper current for each sub-pixel to obtain proper luminance and prevent deterioration of the life cycle by having equal sized active channel regions without changing of the width or size of active channel regions of a driving thin film transistor for driving pixels, and without changing of driving voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Furthermore, the present invention may solve a reduction problem of an opening ratio and improving reliability by avoiding increasing an area taken by driving a thin film transistor per each pixel, but by controlling only an amount of current flowing to a device.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
