<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates, in general, to tool systems for bending sheet materials and methods for their use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bending two-dimensional (2D) sheet materials to form three-dimensional (3D) structures is known. Machinery and tooling for effecting bends in 2D sheet materials is also known. Generally, such machinery and tooling receives the sheet material in a horizontal orientation. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,198 to Huda et al. discloses an apparatus for bending large area construction units. U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,058 to Iwaki et al. shows an apparatus that is configured to manufacture box-shaped structures from metal sheet. U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,640 to Moore discloses an apparatus for forming box-shaped sheet metal ducts from sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disadvantageously, such known apparatuses generally have presses and/or clamping members disposed above the horizontally-oriented sheet material which serve to clamp or shape the sheet material. While such componentry may be effective in their intended purposes, such presses and/or clamping members may present severe physical harm to an operator whom inadvertently catches a finger or limb within such componentry or between such componentry and the sheet material during the clamping or bending process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, such known apparatuses generally clamp the sheet materials such that a significant portion of the sheet materials overhang the apparatus, allowing the overhanging portion to swing unobstructed during the bending process. Again, severe physical harm may come to an inattentive operator in that the swinging portion of the sheet material may strike and injure the operator during the bending process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another disadvantage of such known apparatuses is that they are generally configured for forming a particular 3D structure and may require significant time and expense in retooling in order to be used with another 3D structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed is a tool system for bending sheet materials which overcomes the above and other disadvantages of known bending machinery and tooling.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present invention is directed to a bending tool system for forming a three-dimensional structure from a two-dimensional sheet material which includes a predetermined fold line and a clamping aperture adjacent the fold line and spaced from a peripheral edge of the sheet material. The system includes a tool base for receiving and supporting the sheet material in a work plane, an actuator slot in the tool base, and a bend actuator extending through the actuator slot. The bend actuator includes a mounting bracket, a clamp connected to the bracket, and a bending arm connected to the bracket. The clamp extends above the tool base and is movable between an open position and a secured position for securing a portion of the sheet material relative to the tool base. The bending is movable between an initial position located below the work plane and an upper position in order to apply a force against an unsecured portion of sheet material to effect bending of the sheet material about the fold line. The system may further include a locator for positioning the sheet material relative to the work base such that the clamp extends through the clamping aperture of the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The tool base may be configured to be used with a particular sheet material design having a peripheral shape and predefined fold pattern, wherein the tool base further includes an outline corresponding to the peripheral shape for identifying the particular sheet material design to be worked on the tool base. The system may further include one or more legs removably attached to the tool base for supporting the tool base and providing access to the aperture slots from below the tool base. The system may further include a rest removably attached to the tool base for supporting the sheet material above the tool base in the work plane. The tool base may have a first bore having a first size and shape complimentary to the locator, a second bore having a second size and shape complimentary to the legs, and a third bore having a third size and shape complementary to the rest, whereby the respective size and shape of the bores provide visual indication of the location of the locater, legs and rest.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bracket may include having a channel and an opposing jaw with a downward-facing shoulder, wherein an upper portion of the bend actuator is inserted through the actuator slot from below the tool base, the channel is interlocked to one end of the actuator slot, and the bend actuator is dropped downward to abut the downward-facing shoulder against an opposite end of the actuator slot to secure the actuator to the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The bend actuator may include a driver operably connected to the bending arm, wherein actuation of the driver moves the bending arm between the initial position and the upper position. The driver may be operably connected to the clamp such that actuation of the driver also moves the clamp between the open position and the engaged position. The driver may be a pneumatic cylinder having a cylinder stroke, wherein a first portion of the cylinder stroke effects movement of the clamp and a second portion of the cylinder stroke effects movement of the bending arm. The clamp may be pivotally mounted on the bracket and the bending arm may be pivotally mounted on the clamp. One end of the pneumatic cylinder may be operably connected to the bracket and an opposite end of the pneumatic cylinder may be operably connected to the bending arm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The sheet material may have a predetermined pattern of fold lines and a clamping aperture adjacent each of the fold lines, in which case, the system may include a plurality of bend actuators positioned to effect bending along a respective fold line. The tool base may include a corresponding actuator slot for each bend actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each bend actuator may include a driver for moving each respective bending arm between the initial position and the upper position and for moving a respective clamp between the open position and the engaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system may include a programmable logic controller for controlling the actuation sequence of the drivers and the actuation force and dwell time of each driver. The driver may be a pneumatic cylinder having a cylinder stroke, and the controller may provide two-stage actuation of each driver wherein the driver controls a first portion of the cylinder stroke to effect movement of the clamp and a second portion of the cylinder stroke to effect movement of the bending arm.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a bending tool system including a tool base for receiving and supporting the sheet material in a work plane, a clamp for engaging against the sheet material to secure a portion of the sheet material relative to the tool base, a locator for positioning the sheet material relative to the tool base such that the clamp extends through the clamping aperture, and a bending arm located adjacent the clamp, the bending arm movable from an initial position located below the work plane to an upper position in order to apply an upward force against an unsecured portion of the sheet metal to effect bending of the sheet material about the fold line.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bend actuator may include the bending arm and the tool base may include an actuator slot configured to removably receive a portion of the bend actuator inserted through the actuator slot.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The bend actuator may include a driver operably connected to the bending arm, wherein actuation of the driver moves the bending arm between an initial position located below the work plane and an upper position located above the work plane. The bend actuator may include the clamp, wherein the driver may be operably connected to the clamp such that actuation of the driver also moves the clamp between an open position free of the sheet material and an engaged position holding the sheet material down relative to the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of forming a three-dimensional structure from a two-dimensional sheet material which includes a predetermined fold line. The method includes one or more of the steps: forming a clamping aperture in the sheet material adjacent the fold line and spaced from a peripheral edge of the sheet material; positioning the sheet material on a tool base such that the clamp extends through the clamping aperture, a lower surface of the sheet material defining a work plane above the tool base; engaging the clamp against the sheet material to secure a portion of the sheet material relative to the tool base; and moving a bending arm, located adjacent to the clamp, from an initial position below the work plane to an upper position thereby applying an upward force against an unsecured portion of the sheet metal to effect bending of the sheet material about the fold line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bend actuator may include the bending arm and the tool base may include an actuator slot configured to removably receive the bend actuator, in which case, the method may include inserting a portion of the bend actuator through the actuator slot and securing the actuator to the work base. The bend actuator may include a bracket having a channel and an opposing jaw with a downward-facing shoulder, in which case, the inserting and securing step may include inserting an upper portion of the bend actuator through the actuator slot from below, interlocking the channel against one end of the actuator slot, and dropping the actuator downward such that the downward-facing shoulder abuts against an opposite end of the actuator slot thereby securing the actuator to the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The bend actuator may include a driver operably connected to the bending arm, wherein the moving step may be accomplished by actuating the driver to move the bending arm from the initial position located below the work plane to the upper position located above the work plane. The bend actuator may include the clamp and the driver may also be operably connected to the bending arm, in which case, the engaging step may be accomplished by actuating the driver to move the clamp from an open position free of the sheet material to an engaged position holding the sheet material down relative to the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool system for forming a three-dimensional structure from a two-dimensional sheet material which is to be folded along a line, the sheet material including an opening adjacent the line to allow holding the sheet material. The system includes support means for receiving and supporting the sheet material, the means having at least one slot formed therein, actuator means extending through the slot, the actuator means including a mounting means, holding means connected to the mounting means, extending from the support means, and movable between one position and another position for securing a portion of the sheet material relative to the support means, bending means connected to the mounting means and movable between an initial position and another position in order to apply a force against an unsecured portion of the sheet material to effect bending of the sheet material about the line, and means for positioning the sheet material relative to the support means such that the holding means extends through the opening of the sheet material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to the drawings, wherein like components are designated by like reference numerals throughout the various figures, attention is directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which illustrates a bending tool system generally designated by the numeral <b>30</b> that may be used to fold two-dimensional (2D) sheet materials into three-dimensional (3D) shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bending tool system of the present invention is particularly suited for bending 2D sheet materials having engineered fold lines utilizing various fold geometries and configurations including, but not limited to, those disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,481,259 to Durney, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/256,870, filed Sep. 26, 2002 and entitled METHOD FOR PRECISION BENDING OF SHEET OF MATERIALS, SLIT SHEETS AND FABRICATION PROCESS, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/672,766, filed Sep. 26, 2003 and entitled TECHNIQUES FOR DESIGNING AND MANUFACTURING PRECISION-FOLDED, HIGH STRENGTH, FATIGUE-RESISTANT STRUCTURES AND SHEET THEREFOR, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/795,077, filed Mar. 3, 2004 and entitled SHEET MATERIAL WITH BEND CONTROLLING DISPLACEMENTS AND METHOD FOR FORMING THE SAME, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/821,818, filed Apr. 4, 2004 and entitled METHOD OF DESIGNING FOLD LINES IN SHEET MATERIAL, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/861,726, filed Jun. 4, 2004 and entitled TECHNIQUES FOR DESIGNING AND MANUFACTURING PRECISION-FOLDED, HIGH STRENGTH, FATIGUE-RESISTANT STRUCTURES AND SHEET THEREFOR, the entire contents of which patent and patent applications are incorporated herein by this reference. Unlike known apparatuses, the bending tool system of the present invention allows the use of 2D sheet materials to build 3D structures around components in a manner that is described in the above mentioned patents.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One will appreciate, however, that the bending tool system of the present invention is also suited for bending other types of sheet materials about a fold line including, but not limited to, the above-mentioned engineered fold lines, predetermined fold lines defined by scoring and/or other suitable means, or intended bend lines in which the sheet materials do not have any physical structure extending along the bend line for promoting bending along the bend line.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Generally, bending tool system <b>30</b> includes a tool base <b>32</b> and one or more bend actuators <b>33</b> which are arranged such that each is positioned under a corresponding fold line <b>35</b> of a work piece <b>37</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The bend actuators are configured to secure a portion of the work piece to the tool base and apply force against an unsecured portion of the work piece to effect bending along the fold line, as is discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, bending tool system <b>30</b> of the present invention includes little folding equipment on top of the tool base and, in particular, does not include equipment that exerts force or pressure on the work piece from above. Thus, the bending tool system promotes safety as it minimizes the likelihood of an operator getting pinched. All of the effort is being done from below thereby providing an easier, faster and safer mode of assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Tool base <b>32</b> may be formed of a metal plate or other suitable structure which provides a stable base for supporting actuators <b>33</b>. The tool base may be dedicated to a particular work piece such that the tool base positions one or more actuators along each fold line of the work piece. In the event that the tool base is configured for use with a particular work piece design, the tool base may include an outline <b>39</b> of the particular work piece design thereby providing an operator with visual means identifying the type of work piece for which the tool base is configured. In the illustrated embodiment, tool base <b>32</b> is configured for bending work piece <b>37</b> into a chassis for support of components such as electrical components, in a manner that is described in, and illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A-28E</figref> of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2004/0134250 A1 to Durney (“the '250 application”), the entire content of which application is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Outline <b>39</b> may be applied to tool base <b>32</b> by etching, painting, printing and/or other suitable means. In addition to, or in place of, the outline, the tool base may also be provided with an identification flange <b>40</b> upon which an edge code <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be etched into or otherwise marked on the flange to identify the particular silhouette of the work piece that corresponds to the particular tool base. In the illustrated embodiment, the edge code is a geometric pattern, however, one will appreciate that the edge code may be in the form of numerals, letters, shapes and other suitable means to provide a unique identifying indicia corresponding to a particular work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, bend actuators <b>33</b> are removably supported by the tool base and have a modular design such that the actuators may be readily removed from one tool base and installed on another as necessary or so desired. Tool base <b>32</b> includes an actuator slot <b>42</b> for each bend actuator. In the illustrated embodiment, the bend actuators have a “drop-in” design such that it may be partially inserted through the actuator slot from below and dropped into place. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), each actuator includes a bracket <b>44</b> having a jaw <b>46</b> and a channel <b>47</b>. The configuration of the bracket allows the jaw to be inserted through the actuator slot such that the channel can be slid into engaging contact with one end of the actuator slot and, once the channel has received the end, the bracket is pivoted about the channel and end such that a downward facing shoulder <b>49</b> of the jaw abuts against the work piece <b>37</b> and laterally secures bracket <b>44</b> within actuator slot <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the illustrated embodiment, tool base <b>32</b> is supported by a plurality of legs <b>51</b> which provide ready access to the underside of the tool base thus facilitating installation and removal of the bend actuators. The legs are secured to the tool base by suitable means including, but not limited to, threaded fasteners. One will appreciated that other suitable means may be used to support tool base <b>32</b>. For example, a workbench or other surface may be provided with an opening having a peripheral shoulder dimensioned to removably receive and support the tool base. Such an opening would allow an operator to remove one tool base from the workbench and replace it with another tool base as so desired. Alternatively, a mounting bracket or other means may be used to releasably or permanently mount the tool base directly to a wall, shelving or other structure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), a portion of bracket <b>44</b> extends above tool base <b>32</b> such that the top surfaces of the bracket provide support points <b>53</b> upon which work piece <b>37</b> can be positioned, thereby forming a work plane coincident with the bottom surface of the work piece. One or more rests <b>54</b> may also be provided to abut against the underside of work piece <b>37</b> thereby vertically supporting the work piece with respect to the tool base. Such rests are particularly useful for supporting portions of the work piece which are not directly between two fold lines and are thus unsupported by actuators. One or more locators <b>56</b> may also be provided to laterally position the work piece on tool base <b>32</b>, and more particularly, on support points <b>53</b>. The tool base may be populated with locaters <b>56</b> about outline <b>39</b> such that the locaters will substantially abut against the peripheral side edges of the work piece, thereby laterally positioning the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An advantage of the modular design of bending tool system <b>30</b> is that the actuators, legs, rests, locators and other additional components may be readily removed from tool base <b>32</b> thereby allowing the tool base to be stored flat. One will appreciate that the legs, rests locators and other additional components may be configured to fold down against and/or into the tool base thereby also allowing the system to be stored flat. Also, the modular design allows for multiple tool bases, each configured for a particular work piece, may be easily stored when not in use. Furthermore, the modular design allows reductions in tool component inventory. It is only necessary to stock a sufficient number of actuators and components that is necessary to populate the one, two, three or however many tool bases will be used simultaneously. For example, if an assembly facility has the capability to assembly dozens of different 3D structure designs but only intends to assembly three or four 3D structure designs simultaneously or contemporaneously, the facility need only stock a sufficient number of actuators and additional components to populate three or four tool bases at a time, instead of having enough components to populate all of the tool bases.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">One will appreciate that any particular design of a work piece will have one or more predefined fold lines, a definite folding sequence, or at least a preferred folding sequence, and a unique silhouette. For example, work piece <b>37</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) has five fold lines <b>35</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>3</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>4</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>5</b>. In one embodiment, a fold sequence includes simultaneous folding along fold lines <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>35</b>.<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>)), then along fold line <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>)), fold line <b>35</b>.<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>d</i>)), and finally along fold line <b>35</b>.<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>e</i>)) thereby forming the final 3D structure. One will appreciate that folding along fold lines <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>35</b>.<b>2</b> may be sequential instead of simultaneous. For example, folding may occur along fold line <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> followed by folding along fold line <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One will also appreciate that the above-described folding sequences allow for folding to occur about a component <b>57</b> that has already been mounted on work piece <b>37</b>. For example, component <b>57</b> may be a circuit board, cooling fan, or other desired component that is mounted to the work piece before the work piece has been positioned on the tool base. Alternatively, the component may be installed once the work piece is positioned on the tool base. As can be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>e</i>), such component installation and all folding operations may take place at the same workstation, namely, on tool base <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Engineers and designers may decide where to put one or more fold actuators <b>33</b> along each fold line and how to populated in the base plane with complementary rests <b>54</b> and locators <b>56</b>. Also, the base plane may be provided with holes <b>58</b> to accommodate “swing outs” such as tabs <b>60</b>. The holes provide clearance to allow the swing outs to swing through the tool base as the work piece is bent along the corresponding fold line, for example, hole <b>58</b> provides clearance for tab <b>60</b> to swing out through tool base <b>32</b> as the work piece is bent along fold line <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, as indicated by arrow SO in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The tool base may also be provided with suitable clamping means in order to secure the work piece with respect to tool base <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, actuators <b>33</b> are provided with actuator clamping hooks <b>61</b> which extend through clamping apertures <b>63</b> and pivot to secure work piece <b>37</b> with respect to tool base <b>32</b>. The clamping apertures may be provided adjacent the desired fold lines of the work piece in order to provide a fulcrum point about which the unsecured portion of the work piece may be bent.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">One will appreciate that other suitable clamping means may be used instead of, or in addition to the clamping hooks. For example, vacuum clamps which act upon the undersurface of the work piece, hook clamps discrete from the actuators which similarly extend though corresponding clamping apertures positioned adjacent to or remote from the fold lines, and/or other suitable clamping means may be used to secure the work piece to the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the illustrated embodiment, actuator <b>33</b> includes a two-stage driver <b>65</b> that controls movement of both the clamping hook <b>61</b> to secure a portion of the work piece to the tool base and a bending arm <b>67</b> to apply force against an unsecured portion <b>68</b> of the work piece to effect bending along the fold line. The two-stage configuration of the driver is advantageous in that it reduces part count of the actuator thereby simplifying the design and reducing the manufacturing cost thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A first portion of the driver stroke actuates the clamping hook while the remainder of the driver stroke actuates the bending arm. One will appreciate that means other than a two-stage actuator may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. For example, a first dedicated actuator means may be provided for bending and a second dedicated actuator means may be provided for clamping, particularly when discrete clamping means are used in addition to or instead of the clamping hooks. One will also appreciate that, while the illustrated driver <b>65</b> includes a double-acting pneumatic cylinder <b>70</b>, other suitable actuator means can be used including, but not limited to, single-acting pneumatic cylinders, single or double acting hydraulic cylinders, electric motors, linear actuators and other suitable means to effect movement of the clamping hook and/or the bending arm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the clamping hook is pivotally supported on bracket <b>44</b> by hook pivot <b>72</b>, while the bending arm is pivotally supported on clamping hook by arm pivot <b>74</b>. In an initial stage, clamping hook <b>61</b> is positioned off-center of hook pivot <b>72</b> (e.g., left of center), thus allowing placement of the work piece onto the tool base, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>). Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), clamping hook <b>61</b> extends through clamping aperture <b>63</b> in the initial stage and is thus ready to engage work piece <b>37</b>. In the initial stage bending arm <b>67</b> is positioned in its initial retracted position in which the upper most portion of the bending arm is even with or slightly below support points <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As cylinder <b>70</b> is actuated, piston rod <b>75</b> extends upwardly and pushes bending arm <b>67</b> upward and causes the uppermost portion of the bending arm to contact work piece <b>37</b>, in the event that it is not already contacting the work piece. Continued extension of the piston rod causes the bending arm, via arm pivot <b>74</b> to push against and effect pivotal motion of clamping hook <b>61</b> about hook pivot <b>72</b> in the direction of arrow CH, thereby causing the clamping hook to engage work piece <b>37</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With clamping hook <b>61</b> engaging work piece <b>37</b>, the clamping hook is limited from further motion, thus ending the clamping stage and beginning the bending stage. Continued extension of piston rod <b>75</b> causes bending arm <b>67</b> to pivot about the now-stationary arm pivot <b>74</b> in the direction of arrow BA until the unsecured portion <b>68</b> of the work piece <b>37</b> is bent to the desired angle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>). The uppermost portion of bending arm <b>67</b> presses against the unsecured portion <b>68</b> of work piece <b>37</b> and effects bending about the fold line of work piece <b>37</b>. The uppermost portion of the bending arm may be provided with a contact roller <b>77</b> which is free to roll along the undersurface of the work piece during bending. Such a contact roller prevents sliding contact of the bending arm along the work piece and thus minimizing scratching, wear or other damage to the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>), clamping hooks <b>61</b> are designed to clamp work piece <b>37</b> down against the upper portion of brackets <b>44</b>, the bending tool system leverages each bend on the actuator itself. Thus, minor torsion loads are conveyed back to the tool base thereby contributing for a light and relatively simple design of the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The dimensions and configuration of the bend actuator will dictate the particular angle bend imparted on the work piece. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, bend actuator <b>33</b> is configured to impart a 90° bend on work piece <b>37</b>. One will appreciate, however, that the actuator may be adjustable such that the bend angle may be adjusted by adjusting the stroke of the driver, or by other suitable means. One will also appreciate that the pressure and dwell time of the actuators may also be adjusted to further control bending action.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One will also appreciate that the actuators may be dedicated to a particular type of fold (e.g., specific angle, etc.), a particular type of work piece (e.g., a work piece gauge, material type, etc.), or other parameters. For example, in one embodiment, the actuator is designed and configured to bend sheet metal having a thickness in the range of approximately 0.020″ to 0.080″. One will appreciate that additional larger actuators configured to bend thicker gauge sheet metal, for example, having a thickness in the range of approximately 0.050″ to 0.110″, or other greater thickness ranges, or additional smaller actuators configured to bend thinner gauge sheet metal, for example, having a thickness up to approximately 0.050″ may be provided. Furthermore, in the event that different sized actuators are utilized, the actuator slits may be provided with a size and/or shape that is unique to each actuator size. Such a design will facilitate an assemblyperson in setting up the bending tool system as the assemblyperson need not refer to an assembly manual or other instructions and need only look at the size and/or shape of each actuator slot in a particular tool base and insert the appropriately sized actuator in each actuator slot.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">One will also appreciate that the tool base may be similarly indexed to facilitate installation of the legs, rests, locators and other components. For example, the tool base may be provided with a first diameter bore <b>79</b> for the legs, a second diameter bore <b>81</b> for the rests, a third diameter bore <b>82</b> for the locators, and so on. Similarly, differently shaped holes or flanges may be provided which correspond to each component, for example, a square hole for the legs, a triangular hold for the rests, and so on. The sizes and/or shapes of the holes inform the assemblyperson what particular type component goes in each hole, thus obviating the need for referring to paperwork in setting up the bending tool system. The geometric code self-informs the assemblyperson which components, and quantity thereof, are necessary to set up the system.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The actuators may be controlled by suitable means to control the pressure and dwell time of each actuator, as well as the actuation sequence of the actuators. For example, a programmable logic controller <b>84</b> having a <b>16</b> channel valve assembly <b>86</b> is provided to control actuators <b>33</b> in any desired combination duration and/or sequence. The controller may be configured with a manual override <b>88</b> to activate any one or more actuators as desired, and/or a safety/off switch <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As noted above, identifying indicia may be burned into the tool base including an outline corresponding to the silhouette of the corresponding work piece. Similarly, the actuator order sequence, that is, the fold sequence may similarly be applied to the tool base. Such sequence indicia may be used to confirm that the bending sequence is in the correct order before the work piece is mounted on the bending tool system.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">One will appreciate that the actual configuration of the controller may vary in accordance with the present invention. For example, the valve assembly may be configured to adjust the pressure applied to each actuator in order to adjust the amount of force each actuator applies to the work piece. Also, in the event that actuator means other than pneumatic cylinders are used, the controller may be configured to activate single or double acting hydraulic cylinders, electric motors or solenoids, and or other suitable actuator means.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Advantageously, the bending tool system of the present invention provides a simple and safe method of defining 3D objects from 2D sheet materials. The tool system may be used in the assembly environment instead of the fabrication environment as it obviates the use of press brakes, progressive dies and other heavy machinery. The bending tool system of the present invention may readily be located in an assembly line after or between various fabrication stations on which a profiling, punching, laser cutting or other operation takes place. Furthermore, the bending tool system may be located in an assembly line before or after various finishing stations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, the bending tool system of the present invention allows 2D sheet material parts to be transported directly to the assembly space, and thus allows the product to be transported flat through as much of the manufacturing process as possible. Various methods can be utilized to feed the work piece to the tool base including, but not limited to, overhead vacuum delivery devices that can be used to place the work piece onto the tool base.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The bending tool system can be used in an environment having varying degrees of skilled labor. Operators need not be skilled in using press brakes, progressive dies and other machine tools. The bending tool system and method of the present invention promote safety as all moving parts are substantially confined below tool base <b>32</b> and the work piece <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">One will also appreciate that the bending tool system of the present invention may also be used to assist in bending sheet materials. For example, assembly tabs may be used to interlock folded sections of the 2D sheet material once it has been into a 3D object, as is shown in FIGS. 28(<i>a</i>)-(<i>e</i>) of the '250 application. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to utilize known apparatuses to bend and assemble such “tabbed” 2D sheet materials as such assembly tabs need to be carefully aligned with corresponding slots during the assembly process. In contrast, the bending tool system of the present invention may be used to assist an operator by providing sufficient force to effect bending of the work piece in such a manner that the operator may simultaneously align the tabs <b>91</b> with their corresponding assembly slots <b>93</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>e</i>)). Thus, the bending tool system may also be used to minimize the physical exertion required by the operator and thus avoid repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and other ailments.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the pneumatic cylinder, or other actuator means, may be adjusted such that the force applied to the work piece is sufficient to bend the work piece, but is insufficient to cause injury to the operator in the event that the operator inadvertently pinches a finger or limb. Similarly, the actuator means may be adjusted such that the tooling system uses forces that are sufficiently low such that there is no danger of damaging the components, such as the above-mentioned component <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is also anticipated that the bending tool system of the present invention may be fully automated with increased folding speed. In the event that the process is fully automated, for example, with automated work piece delivery and transfer, an operator need not be present at the tool base. In such case, folding speed could be increased as such increase in speed would not increase the likelihood of injury to the operator because the operator need not be present. Thus, the bending tool system of the present invention may be used to increase throughput speed of the assembly process.</p>
