<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention is generally directed to damage detection and evaluation systems, and, more particularly to aircraft damage detection and evaluation systems that use a plurality of wireless transmitters.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Description</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Identification of damaged locations in a system or on a vehicle is commonly dependent upon operator perception and analysis. Often, an operator is unable to adequately perceive the entire damaged location due to dynamic system movement or limited field of vision. For example, a machine operator may not be able to see a portion of the machine because it may be blocked by other parts of the machine or workers. Additionally, poor lighting may contribute to inadequate perception of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Quite often, the operator must rely on sensors for secondary systems or subsystems to obtain information relating to possible system damage. For example, a machine may have a sensor that reports hydraulic pressure available. When the available hydraulic pressure drops below a normal operating pressure, the operator may know that there is a malfunction or damage in the hydraulic system. Of course, sensors for other subsystems may include, but are not limited to, electrical systems, pneumatic systems, navigation systems, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems that are particularly susceptible to this type of problem include vehicles, and specifically include aircraft. Often a pilot of an aircraft is confined to a cockpit area that has a limited field of view. The pilot must rely almost exclusively on instrument readings that are reported to the cockpit. However, the pilot may also perceive vibrations through the aircraft. Should an aircraft be involved in a collision, with a bird for example, the pilot may not be able to ascertain the full extent of damage to the aircraft until after landing. This is often too late.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aircraft are generally designed with certain safety features that may isolate aircraft systems in the case of an emergency. However, the pilots often have no indication of potential system failure due to aircraft damage until system resources are depleted. For example, during combat, small arms fire may be a threat to the aircraft. If a bullet pierces the body of the aircraft and damages a hydraulic line thereby creating a small leak in the hydraulic system, the pilot may have no indication of the damage for several minutes or longer. During this time, the hydraulic system may be losing hydraulic fluid and the fluid may not be replaceable. Eventually, the hydraulic system may be depleted of fluid potentially causing even more serious problems. However, if the pilot were aware of the slow leak, the pilot may be able to isolate a portion of the hydraulic system that includes the leak, thus preserving the hydraulic fluid for the rest of the hydraulic system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One well known incident involved a commercial aircraft crash at Sioux City Iowa. In this incident, an engine failure ruptured lines of all three hydraulic systems causing a total loss of hydraulic pressure to the aircraft. Had the pilots been aware of the damage to the hydraulic systems soon after the failure of the engine, they may have been able to isolate the damaged area before the total failure of the hydraulic system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems or disadvantages associated with the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">3. Discussion of Relevant Art</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Systems have been developed which sense positions of certain components. For example, a method of sensing position for a workpiece and a tool that performs a manufacturing operation on the workpiece is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/096,612, assigned to The Boeing Company, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. This method includes measuring at least three discrete point positions associated with a first component by using a transmitter having a known position and orientation and in a line of sight with the three distinct point positions. The three distinct point positions have known distances relative to one another. The method computes a current position and orientation of the first component using data provided by the transmitter and the three distinct point positions, along with position and orientation data from a last known location of the first component. The method assumes no sudden position changes for the first component. While this method tracks and senses position of certain components, the method does not detect or analyze damaged locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A damage detection system is described herein that includes a processor and at least one transmitter communicatively connected to the processor. The transmitter sends a signal to the processor and the processor may be programmed to assign a spatial coordinate to the transmitter. The processor may be further programmed to identify a transmitter location as damaged when the transmitter fails to send the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of identifying a damaged location is also described herein. The method includes attaching a plurality of remotely powered transmitters to a vehicle, and each of the plurality of transmitters is adapted to send a signal to a processor. The method may further include providing remote power to the plurality of transmitters, thereby causing each of the plurality of transmitters to send the signal to the processor. The processor may then assign spatial coordinates to each of the plurality of transmitters and may monitor the plurality of transmitters to identify non-functioning transmitters. The processor may determine a damaged location by identifying an area of the vehicle based upon the spatial coordinates assigned to any non-functioning transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Damage detection systems may be employed on vehicles such as an aircraft. However, damage detection systems, such as the systems disclosed herein, can easily be adapted for use on any type of vehicle, for example, a car, a truck, a tank, a submarine, an airship, a space vehicle, a ship, or virtually any other type of vehicle. Such damage detection systems may be especially useful for combat aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an aircraft <b>10</b> generally includes a cockpit or flight deck <b>12</b> from which one or more pilots controls the aircraft <b>10</b>. Often, the pilot's view of the aircraft <b>10</b> is obscured by the body <b>14</b> of the aircraft <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the pilot is unable to view large portions of the aircraft <b>10</b>, for example, the underside of the wings <b>16</b>, the landing gear <b>18</b>, and/or the empennage <b>20</b>. As a result, the pilots must rely on system instrumentation indications, such as hydraulic pressure, electrical volts and amperes, pneumatic pressures, etc., to alert the pilots to potential damage on the aircraft <b>10</b>. The aircraft <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown as an example of a vehicle that may use the damage detection system. Virtually any vehicle could use such a system, for example, automobiles, ships, submarines, helicopters, trucks, earth moving equipment, spacecraft, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the aircraft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having a damage detection system. The damage detection system includes a processor <b>30</b> located in the aircraft <b>10</b> and a plurality of transmitters <b>32</b> arranged on the aircraft <b>10</b> at various locations. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows only certain locations having transmitters <b>32</b>, the entire aircraft <b>10</b> could be substantially covered with such transmitters <b>32</b>. Additionally, transmitters <b>32</b> may be located at certain critical locations within the body of the aircraft <b>10</b> itself to enhance early detection of damage to internal aircraft systems. The transmitters <b>32</b> may communicate with the processor <b>30</b> by sending a coded signal to the processor <b>30</b> continuously or periodically. The processor <b>30</b> may be programmed to decode the signal and determine the location of the transmitter <b>32</b> that sent the signal. The processor <b>30</b> may monitor all of the transmitters <b>32</b> and if a transmitter <b>32</b> fails to send the expected signal, the processor <b>30</b> may alert the pilot and identify the location of the transmitter <b>32</b> as a damaged location. The processor <b>30</b> may also determine if the transmitter <b>32</b> is simply malfunctioning, in which case, the processor <b>32</b> may simply remove the transmitter <b>32</b> from the system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the damage detection system may allow the pilots to monitor the entire aircraft <b>10</b> without needing the ability to visually observe each part of the aircraft <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic view of the damage detection system. Each of the transmitters <b>32</b> transmits a signal to the processor <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the transmitters <b>32</b> first transmit the signal to a node <b>34</b> which summarizes signal data from a group <b>36</b> of transmitters <b>32</b>. The transmitters <b>32</b> may be assigned to certain groups <b>36</b> based on location or based on system type. For example, transmitters <b>32</b> placed on a wing structural component may be assigned to one group while transmitters <b>32</b> inside the wing on a hydraulic line may be assigned to another group. The nodes <b>34</b> may act as intermediaries between the transmitters <b>32</b> and the processor <b>30</b>. This arrangement of nodes <b>34</b> may speed up transmission of the signals and may minimize processing time to analyze the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The transmitters <b>32</b> preferably communicate with the processor <b>30</b> wirelessly. However, the transmitters <b>32</b> could be wired to the processor <b>30</b> if desired. Additionally, where nodes <b>34</b> are employed, the transmitters <b>32</b> preferably communicate wirelessly with the node <b>34</b> which in turn communicates wirelessly with the processor <b>30</b>. However, in certain locations, it may be advantageous for the transmitters <b>32</b> to be wired to the node <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transmitters <b>32</b> may either generate power internally, or rely on an excitement signal for power. For example, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be piezo-electric in nature and generate power from vibrations of the aircraft <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the piezo-electric transmitters may be chips that generate approximately 100 microcoulombs of electricity which may be stored temporarily in a capacitor. This amount of power is sufficient to generate and transmit the signal to the processor <b>30</b>. Because an aircraft, or any vehicle, constantly generates vibrational energy, a virtually endless energy supply exists for the transmitters <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be radio frequency stimulated (e.g., RFID tags). The processor <b>30</b> may send out a radio frequency signal to the transmitters <b>32</b> which reflect back a signal to the processor <b>30</b>. This arrangement is especially desirable for combat aircraft where the pilot may select a scanning time based on potential threats. For example, the pilot may only scan the aircraft <b>10</b> on egress after a mission to avoid potential detection by enemy anti-aircraft systems.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A wireless system is much lighter than a like wired system. Thus a wireless system is desirable over a wired system for an aircraft <b>10</b> because any reduction in empty weight of an aircraft <b>10</b> results in a corresponding increase in payload available. Furthermore, should one transmitter <b>32</b> fail, there is no doubt as to whether the transmitter <b>32</b> itself failed or the wiring between the transmitter and the processor has broken because there is no wire to break. Moreover, such wireless systems are very easily scaled and adaptable. For example, if an external fuel tank is added to an aircraft after an initial production, one or more transmitters <b>32</b> may simply be added to the external fuel tank and the programming of the processor <b>30</b> updated accordingly. Similar modifications could be made to the wireless system after repair or replacement of a component of after a rebuild of the wireless system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other means of powering the transmitters may exist, for example, solar power or wind power. The means of powering the transmitters <b>32</b> is not limiting so long as the transmitters <b>32</b> are able to transmit the signal to the processor <b>30</b>. Additionally, while one embodiment of the damage detection system may use power scavenging chips as transmitters, the transmitters are not limited to a chip-like configuration and could vary widely in size and shape as long as the transmitters are able to send a signal to the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of data that may be generated by the processor <b>30</b> in response to signals sent from the transmitters <b>32</b>. The data is only shown in table form for ease of reading and explanation. The processor <b>30</b> does not actually need to tabulate the data before analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The table <b>100</b> includes several columns of information. The first column <b>110</b> shows an identification number assigned to the individual transmitter <b>32</b>. The second column <b>112</b> shows a System ID, which corresponds to a particular aircraft system to which the transmitter <b>32</b> is assigned. For example, the System ID of “1000” shown in the figure may correspond to a structural member, such as a wing, tail, fuselage, etc. Other systems can be identified as well, for example, a System ID of “2000” may correspond to an engine, a System ID of “3000” may correspond to the hydraulic system, a System ID of “4000” may correspond to the electrical system, etc. Of course this labeling system allows for various sub-system identifiers as well. For example, a System ID of “2100” may correspond to the #1 engine, and a System ID of “2110” may correspond to the fuel control unit of the #1 engine. The System ID's may be kept very general or be made extremely specific based on user requirements, the complexity of the aircraft or vehicle and/or the number of transmitters employed in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Columns <b>114</b>-<b>118</b> show the X, Y, and Z spatial coordinates assigned to the transmitter <b>32</b>. These spatial coordinates may be assigned to the transmitter <b>32</b> at installation by exciting the system and recording the location of each transmitter <b>32</b> based on a reference location. Thereafter, the processor <b>30</b> is able to correlate a particular spatial coordinate to a particular location on the aircraft or vehicle. The Assigned Size column <b>120</b> shows how large an area is assigned to each transmitter <b>32</b>. The assigned size may depend on the proximity of other transmitters <b>32</b>. For example, transmitters <b>32</b> that are placed 1 inch apart may be assigned a size of one inch square. The Transmitting column <b>122</b> simply shows whether the particular transmitter <b>32</b> is sending the processor <b>30</b> a signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The Damage Data table <b>130</b> shows a summary of data for a non-functional transmitter <b>32</b>. The non-functional transmitter's 32 spatial coordinates are shown in columns <b>132</b>-<b>136</b>. The processor may be programmed to identify the area bounded by the spatial coordinates in columns <b>132</b>-<b>136</b> as the damaged area. The system column <b>138</b> shows that this particular transmitter <b>32</b> was assigned to a structure group meaning that the transmitter <b>32</b> was attached to a structure of the aircraft <b>10</b> as opposed to a sub-system. The information in column <b>138</b> corresponds to the System ID information of column <b>112</b> of table <b>100</b>. The size column <b>140</b> shows that the area assigned to this particular transmitter is 0.1 inches square. The information from the Damage Data table <b>130</b> may be available to the processor <b>30</b> for further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The processor <b>30</b> may be programmed to analyze the data from the Damage Data table <b>130</b> for assessing structural integrity of the aircraft <b>10</b>. After identifying the damage area, the processor may compare the damage area to structural information about the aircraft <b>10</b> and the processor <b>30</b> may determine whether the aircraft <b>10</b> remains airworthy based on the location and size of the damaged area. For example, should the size and location of the damage area indicate that a wing spar can no longer support its design load, the aircraft <b>10</b> should be subjected to only limited maneuvering until an appropriate repair is made. The processor <b>30</b> may further analyze the damage location to determine whether any sub-systems may be affected. For example, should the damage area be in the vicinity of a hydraulic line, the processor <b>30</b> may prompt the pilot to accomplish a particular checklist or to isolate the hydraulic system in the vicinity of the damage area if possible.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Should the damage detection system determine that a critical sub-system is located in the damage area, the processor <b>30</b> may immediately notify the pilot (or vehicle operator) through some sort of alert system, e.g., visual or aural alerts in the cockpit. The pilot may then take appropriate action based on the possible loss of the critical sub-system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The processor <b>30</b> may be further programmed to infer potentially affected sub-systems or components based on two separate damage areas. For example, a projectile may enter a bottom portion of a wing and exit through a top portion of the wing. Should the damage detection system only have transmitters <b>32</b> disposed on the outer surfaces of the aircraft, the processor <b>30</b> may interpolate between the upper and lower damage locations to determine whether any sub-systems within the wing structure may have been damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The damage detection system disclosed herein requires very little processing power due to the fact that only a limited amount of data is required for transmission. Each of the transmitters <b>32</b> may essentially send an identity code that can be a single number, and the processor <b>30</b> has stored the location and system data assigned to each particular transmitter <b>32</b>. Data storage requirements for such a system are small as well. This limited amount of data also enables very fast processing times and simple programming for cross-referencing of each transmitter <b>32</b>. As a result, damage detection systems described herein are relatively inexpensive and very light weight.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Additionally, the processor <b>30</b> may transmit the damage data to a ground station for further analysis. As a result, a maintenance technician may have access to the damage data and may recommend actions or procedures in addition to the actions and procedures recommended by the on-board damage detection system. Furthermore, the maintenance personnel may have additional time to prepare for potential repairs to the aircraft <b>10</b> before the aircraft <b>10</b> arrives at a maintenance station, thus saving valuable time and enabling a faster repair of the aircraft <b>10</b>. This ability may prove critical in a war fighting situation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Still further, based on the downloaded damage data, maintenance personnel may be able to determine an ideal repair facility to direct the aircraft <b>10</b> to should repair facilities with different capabilities be available. For example, if two repair facilities are available, but only one has a sheet metal shop, an aircraft with sheet metal damage should be directed to this particular repair facility if it is safe to do so.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Installations of such damage detection systems are simple as well. As transmitter sizes get smaller in response to technological advances, several application techniques may be available such as using light-duty adhesive bonding, for example. Furthermore, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be individually attached to the aircraft with an adhesive, or for smaller transmitter sizes, via brushing, spraying or spreading the transmitters over the selected surface. Moreover, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be integrated into the structures during fabrication of the structures. For example, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be mixed with or bonded into raw material prior to forming a particular structural element, such as a wing or a tail. For example, the transmitters <b>32</b> may be bonded between layers of a laminated structural element.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a result, certain areas of the aircraft may be targeted for the transmitters <b>32</b>. For example, only critical flight surfaces may be integrated in an effort to reduce cost and weight. Furthermore, a malfunctioning transmitter <b>32</b> may be “locked out” of the system. In other words, malfunctioning transmitters <b>32</b> may simply be ignored by the processor <b>30</b>. Additionally, malfunctioning transmitters are easily replaced because the processor need only be updated to recognize the identity of each new transmitter <b>32</b>. The spatial coordinates of the old transmitter <b>32</b> may then simply be assigned to the new transmitter <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the damage detection system has identified the damage area, this information may be sent to other aircraft systems for further analysis. For example, the damage area information may be sent to the fuel management system which may account for extra drag associated with the damage area. As a result, the navigation system may update the maximum range of the aircraft <b>10</b> and inform the pilot if the original destination is unreachable with the added drag.</p>
