<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 7,048,778 (application Ser. No. 10/471,527), having a §371(c) filing date of Sep. 10, 2003, which is a national phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/GB02/01079, filed Mar. 18, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an apparatus and method for separating gases and in particular an apparatus comprising inorganic membranes for removing acidic gases from natural gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Natural gas reserves known to contain a relatively high content of nitrogen, carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulphide are rarely recovered due to the costs incurred to purify the gas mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Impure methane is also commonly produced by landfill sites but its commercial exploitation is generally prohibited by the costs associated with purifying it.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current processing systems are generally regarded to be uneconomical above 1.5% levels of carbon dioxide. To remove carbon dioxide from natural gas, chemical scrubs are commonly used. This results in a significant amount of waste product which must be suitably disposed of, adding further costs to remove the carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, the mechanical equipment used with such chemical scrubs is susceptible to failure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>show an inorganic membrane <b>1</b> in accordance with the present invention. In summary, the membrane <b>1</b> is used to remove carbon dioxide CO<sub>2 </sub>from a gaseous mixture comprising methane CH<sub>4 </sub>and carbon dioxide CO<sub>2 </sub>in accordance with the present invention. The inorganic membrane <b>1</b> comprises a relatively highly porous ceramic support <b>2</b> and a separation layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The support <b>2</b> is a coarse porous support, and this first preferred example of support <b>2</b> comprises 76% alpha alumina and 23% titania, the support <b>2</b> typically having a pore size of 500 nm and a porosity of 45%. Such a support <b>2</b> is commercially available, but hitherto has only been used as a filter for microfiltration. The support <b>2</b> may alternatively be made from any other suitable material, for example, silicon carbide, zirconia, stainless steel or carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The separating layer <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>is a layer of silica.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The membrane <b>1</b> is prepared by a repeated dip-coating technique. The support <b>2</b> is repeatedly dipped into a precursor or “sol” (not shown) and dried to form an evaporated layer of sol on the support <b>2</b>, thereby forming the membrane <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The sol is prepared by mixing nine parts of isopentane and one part silicon elastomer, to obtain a clear and colourless sol. A curing agent such as one from the Sylgard® series is then added equivalent to one-tenth of the elastomer and the resulting sol mixed at room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sol is permitted to age over a period of 5-30 minutes (most preferably 20 minutes), and thereafter, the support <b>2</b> is immersed into the aged the support <b>2</b> by drying the support <b>2</b> at 65° C. for 24 hours in an oven to form a layer on the support <b>2</b>. The procedure is repeated a number of times until the layer is of the required thickness, normally between 1-12 μm, preferably 6 μm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the membrane thickness in relation to deposition time and No. of dips.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When a CO<sub>2 </sub>molecule collides with the separation layer <b>3</b> of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b>, it may be adsorbed into the separation layer <b>3</b> and proceed through the pores <b>5</b> in the support <b>2</b>. The CO<sub>2 </sub>molecule continues through the support <b>2</b> and is recovered along with other CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules by any suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In contrast, when a CH<sub>4 </sub>molecule collides with the separation layer <b>3</b> of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b>, it is unlikely to be adsorbed into the separation layer <b>3</b> and will instead continue through the bore of the tube of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b> where it may be collected along with other CH<sub>4 </sub>molecules. Generally, CH<sub>4 </sub>molecules form bonds with the separation layer <b>3</b> less readily than CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Carbon dioxide is currently injected downhole to increase the rate of recovery of production fluids from reservoirs. The present invention therefore provides a means to obtain carbon dioxide proximate to where it may be used. A continuous loop is thus formed in which carbon dioxide is recovered from the natural gas and may be utilised to recover further production fluids. Indeed the CO<sub>2 </sub>may never need to be transported to the surface as it may be transported from the membrane <b>1</b> to the reinjection point which saves on further time and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The inorganic membrane may be formed as a flat sheet or preferably, in thin tubes having an inner diameter of, for example 3-11 mm and an outer diameter of for example 5-12 mm. The gaseous mixture <b>4</b> is directed through the inner bore of this tube membrane <b>1</b>. Such tubes may be coiled or corrugated to increase the number of collisions between the molecules in the gaseous mixture <b>4</b> and the inner surface of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An example of the tube arrangement suitable for use in accordance with the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A tubular stainless steel vessel <b>9</b> comprises an inner tube <b>11</b>, inlet ports <b>13</b>, <b>17</b> and a seal <b>12</b>. The inner tube <b>11</b> is made from the inorganic membrane <b>1</b> and the outer tube <b>10</b> can be made from any suitable material, such as stainless steel. Normally approximately 10 tubes are used in any one vessel <b>9</b>, although only one end <b>15</b> of one tube is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Certain embodiments of the invention with high flow rates may use more than 10 tubes. The seal <b>12</b> is preferably made from graphite as this is compressible, inert, high-temperature resistant to enable permeability studies at elevated temperatures, and cost effective. The second end <b>16</b> of the vessel <b>9</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, but typically mirrors the configuration of the first end <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The gaseous mixture <b>4</b> is injected through the inlet port <b>13</b> into the annulus <b>14</b> between the inner <b>11</b> and outer <b>10</b> tubes. In this example CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules are separated from CH<sub>4 </sub>molecules, but other mixtures may be separated. The mixture <b>4</b> flows through the annulus <b>14</b>, the CO2 molecules selectively adsorbing in the inorganic membrane <b>1</b> which forms the tube <b>11</b>. The second end <b>16</b> of the inner tube <b>11</b> of the vessel <b>9</b> corresponds to a first outlet (not shown), and the second end <b>16</b> of the annulus <b>14</b> of the vessel <b>9</b> corresponds to a second outlet (not shown). The relatively pure CH<sub>4 </sub>and CO<sub>2 </sub>are recovered separately through their respective outlets. A sweep gas <b>18</b> may optionally be injected through the inlet <b>17</b> of the inner tube <b>11</b>, to increase the flow rate of the CO<sub>2 </sub>therein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A simplified embodiment of the tube <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with like parts labelled correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The efficiency of the membrane <b>1</b> in separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from natural gas is dependent on both the geometry in terms of surface area and flow rate and the membrane <b>1</b> characteristics. The tests conducted to date have only considered the factors relating to the membrane and not optimised the geometry. Hence a standard test set up can be used for all testing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus the measures of selectivity and efficiency relate to a staged separation factor. The tests are conducted in two stages using the equipment as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a first test, a feed gas was introduced in known CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4 </sub>composition and mass flow rates and the permeate gas is fed through a flow meter and the concentration of the permeate is analysed ignoring the sweep gas. This gives a measure of the staged separation factor. The retentate gas is free to exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">To calculate the Staged Separation Factor (SSF), the following formula is used:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>SSF </i>=(Conc. Of CH<sub>4</sub>/Conc. Of CO<sub>2 </sub>in permeate)/(Conc. Of CH<sub>4</sub>/Conc. of CO<sub>2 </sub>in feed)×100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Therefore the lower the SSF the better is the separation efficiency of the separating means (in this case membranes).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the second test, a feed gas is introduced in known CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4 </sub>composition and mass flow rates and the retentate gas is fed through a flow meter and the concentration of the retentate is analysed ignoring the sweep gas. This gives a measure of the Staged Recovery Factor. The permeate gas is free to exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The SRF is calculated using the following formula—
<br/>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Therefore the higher the SRF, the better is the efficiency of the separating means (in this case membranes.) Parameters affecting separation efficiency are discussed in Industrial Gas Separations, pp 132-134 (Schell &amp; Houston) and Gas Purification, Membrane Permeation Processes ppl 242-1245.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">SSF and SRF measurements on the present example of an inorganic membrane is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The measurements were taken under conditions of 1 atmosphere and for a relatively small tube. It is expected that the selectivity of separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from CH<sub>4 </sub>will increase when the pressure is increased. Moreover, use of longer tubes or two-three smaller tubes in series will also increase selectivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An inorganic membrane <b>1</b> according to the invention comprises a porous ceramic support <b>2</b> and a separation layer <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Example 2 differs from Example 1 only in the composition of separation layer <b>3</b> provided. Common features between Example 1 and Example 2 are not described here for example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The separation layer <b>3</b> of the Example 2 comprises a gamma-alumina layer (not shown) mounted on the support <b>2</b>, a silica layer (not shown) and a carbon molecular sieve (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">To form the membrane <b>1</b> of the Example 2, the support <b>2</b> is exposed to a boemite sol maintained at 0.6 mol/L (as the gamma alumina source) using the dip-coating technique as described for example 1. The support <b>2</b> is immersed into the boemite sol for approximately two minutes. The membrane is then air dried overnight and heated to between 700 and 800° C. at a rate of 1° C./minute. The process is normally repeated three times or more to achieve the required thickness of gamma alumina on the support <b>2</b>, normally between 1-12 μm, preferably 6 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Once the required gamma-alumina layer thickness has been added to the support <b>2</b>, a silica or carbon molecular sieve layer is then applied to form the final separating layer <b>3</b>. The silica-layer is deposited over the gamma alumina by the method described above in relation to Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">To deposit the carbon molecular sieve layer, the alumina/silica coated support <b>2</b> is dipped in a polyetherimide solution of between 1 and 5 moll<sup>−1</sup>, preferably 3 moll<sup>−1</sup>. The support <b>2</b> is then dried in air.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Carbonisation is performed in an argon atmosphere using a predefined temperature profile. In this example, the support was heated from 20-80° C. for 2 hours and then from 80-120° C. for 4 hours although a variety of temperature profiles may be suitably employed. Such a process may be repeated as necessary to achieve the required CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>selectivity and CO<sub>2 </sub>permeability.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">An inorganic membrane <b>1</b> according to the invention comprises a porous ceramic support <b>2</b> and a separation layer <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Example 3 differs from Example 1 only in the composition of separation layer <b>3</b> provided. Common features between Example 1 and Example 3 are not described here for Example 3.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The separation layer of Example 3 does not comprise a silica layer in contrast to the previous Examples 1 and 2. A layer of gamma-alumina is added directly onto the support <b>2</b> as detailed for Example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The support <b>2</b> is then chemically modified by impregnating its surface using magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>reduces to form magnesium oxide MgO which is thus located in the pores of the separating layer so that the surface concentration is 4 mmols Mg per square metre.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The chemical affinity between the magnesium oxide and the carbon dioxide increases the selectivity of the membrane <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The ceramic nature of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b> may be used at high temperatures and pressures and in extreme conditions, for example downhole. Moreover, the ceramic materials are resistant to acidic degradation; acids such as carbonic acids being commonly formed thereabouts by the combination of CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, embodiments of the invention can be used to separate mixtures of ‘wet’ gases which would degrade other separating means.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Ceramic materials also have a high mechanical strength.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Embodiments of the invention used downhole have the advantage that acidic gases are removed before transfer by pipeline thereby reducing the corrosion of the pipeline caused by such acidic gases.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The passage of CO<sub>2 </sub>through the membrane <b>1</b> enables continuous production of a relatively pure methane at high pressure making the process extremely cost effective.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Most territories impose restrictions on releasing the environmentally damaging CO<sub>2 </sub>to the atmosphere and so certain embodiments of the present invention provide a means to remove this gas from natural gas before flaring.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The apparatus according to the present invention may also be used in exhaust stacks to remove, for example, CO<sub>2 </sub>from exhaust fumes. For example, the impure methane produced from landfill sites may be purified on site and then used as a fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The hybrid structures may be characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen absorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET surface analysis and EDAX surface elemental analysis. SEM photographs are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>at 2500 and 1000 times magnification respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Embodiments of the invention may be used to separate other gaseous or fluid mixtures, e.g. N<sub>2 </sub>or H<sub>2</sub>S may be separated from raw natural gas at mildly high temperatures of ˜50-100° C. This is permitted by the relative molecular dimensions of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>S which are summarised in the table below</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thus, even though CH<sub>4 </sub>is lighter than the other molecules and so would be expected to penetrate the membrane more readily than the heavier molecules, it has been found that membranes according to the invention allow passage of the heavier molecules while restricting passage of the lighter methane molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Preferably, the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>is 150 at 350° C.; that is 150 CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules will travel through the membrane for each CH<sub>4 </sub>molecule that travels through the membrane. Preferably, the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>is 120 at 350° C. Preferably, the permeability of CO<sub>2 </sub>through the membrane <b>1</b> is &gt;4×10<sup>−7 </sup>mol/m<sup>2</sup>sPa at 350° C. Preferably, the durability of the inorganic membrane <b>1</b> is greater than 500 hours at 350° C. in corrosive environments.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">An advantage of using ceramic membranes to purify natural gas is their durability. Absorbent performance of known separating means generally decrease with their age whereas the absorbent performance of ceramic materials do not decrease with age. Embodiments including a silica layer are particularly durable.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further advantages of the use of ceramics in such applications may include enhanced plant performance and a reduction in energy consumption. Ceramic materials may also be used for mixtures with high CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations for example, ranging from 3% to 72% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Improvements and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
