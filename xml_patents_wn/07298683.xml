<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for recording/reproducing optical information, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for recording/reproducing optical information that corrects spherical aberration generated by an error in the thickness of a substrate of an optical recording medium, in accordance with reproduced signal quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to record a high-definition TV, a BD (Blu-ray Disk) apparatus has in recent years been proposed which is designed to increase density and capacity compared to the prior art apparatuses. In the BD apparatus, a semiconductor laser has a shorter oscillation wavelength, and an objective used has a higher NA.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, in a case where there is an error with respect to a designed value for the thickness of a substrate (light-transmissive layer) of an optical disk, spherical aberration on the optical recording medium is in proportion to the fourth power of the NA of the objective and is in inverse proportion to the wavelength. It is thus known that an error in the thickness of the substrate reduces a spot quality on the optical recording medium to degrade the recording/reproducing performance. Accordingly, because a BD apparatus using a shorter wavelength and a higher NA is more likely to generate spherical aberration than DVD apparatuses or the like, the spherical aberration must be corrected, so that apparatuses that correct the spherical aberration have been proposed. Further, techniques to use a plurality of data recording surfaces, for example, two layers have also been examined, and it is also necessary to correct spherical aberration in order to condense a light spot on two layers with different cover thicknesses without spherical aberration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A technique for correcting spherical aberration is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-233917 that detects an index such as amplitude, jitter or the like of a reproduced signal that indicates the quality of the reproduced signal to control a spherical aberration correcting element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, with an increase in recording density in the recent years, it is not necessarily effective in terms of the accuracy of spherical aberration corrections to use the amplitude or jitter to evaluate the quality of the reproduced signal to control the spherical aberration correcting element, and it has thus been desirable to provide an apparatus and method for recording/reproducing optical information that can easily, reliably, and accurately correct spherical aberration.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for recording/reproducing optical information that can easily, reliably, and accurately correct spherical aberration.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the waveform equalization <b>301</b> is composed of an FIR adaptive filter with N taps; a reproduced signal x(n) is processed by N−1 delay units <b>311</b> and N coefficient multipliers <b>312</b>; and an adder <b>313</b> adds outputs from the multipliers together to obtain a sum corresponding to a filter output y(n).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An adaptive operation is performed as follows.</p>

Further, when a signal such as user data which has an unknown recorded pattern is reproduced to perform an adaptive operation, the output level of the filter is determined and the determined values are set for the ideal waveform. For example, for PR (1, 2, 2, 1) as in the case of the present embodiment, the ideal output values are seven values including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and <b>6</b>, so that the determination can be made by using a comparator that can determine the filter output level on the basis of the seven values, to simply perform level comparison.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A sample value output from the PR (1, 2, 2, 1) is input to the Viterbi decoding <b>302</b>. Then, the metric calculation <b>801</b> calculates a branch metric. For the branch metric, the addition/comparison/selection <b>802</b> executes the Equation x.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The branch metric input at the time k is added to the path metric value at the time k−1 in each state.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Now, the SAM value calculation <b>305</b> will be described. The SAM (Sequenced Amplitude Margin) is the difference between the most plausible path and the second most plausible path. This is reported in, for example, Tim Perkins and Zachary A.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the metric difference calculation <b>805</b> stores the path metric difference between the most plausible path and the second most plausible path from the output results of the addition/comparison/selection <b>802</b> in a register <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In Viterbi decoding, the most plausible path is selected, that is, the path is selected which has the smallest accumulated error (path metric value) between the sample value of the data sequence at each time and the ideal value of the waveform equalization. Accordingly, the reliability of the Viterbi decoding and thus the decoded data increases with the increase in the metric difference between the most plausible path and the second most plausible path. In contrast, when the metric difference between the most plausible path and the second most plausible path is small, an error is likely to occur in the choice between the two paths, so that the reliability of the decoded data decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows histograms of the output values of the metric difference calculation <b>805</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the axis of abscissa indicates the metric difference, while the axis of ordinate indicates frequency. The figure extracts and exemplifies histograms corresponding to the region of the smallest metric differences of a plurality of histograms showing the accumulation of metric differences at respective sample points. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows three types of histograms involving different reproduced signal qualities. In the region of a small metric difference indicated in the axis of abscissa, the most plausible path and the second most plausible path are close to each other, so that an error in path identification in Viterbi decoding, that is, an error in decoded data is prone to occur. Accordingly, for <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and <b>4</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when taking note of the frequency of the region with small metric differences, the order of <b>4</b><i>c</i>&gt;<b>4</b><i>b</i>&gt;<b>4</b><i>a </i>is seen, so that the reproduced signal <b>4</b><i>c </i>is most likely to undergo erroneous determinations in Viterbi decoding. In other words, the reproduced signal <b>4</b><i>c </i>has a low signal quality (grade). The reproduced signal <b>4</b><i>b </i>has the second lowest signal quality, and the reproduced signal <b>4</b><i>a </i>is most unlikely to undergo erroneous determinations, that is, has a good signal quality.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The standard deviation calculation <b>806</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has a function for determining a standard deviation from the histograms of the metric difference shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The reproducing processor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described again.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An operational procedure according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the optical disk apparatus according to the present embodiment is activated, activation of a spindle, lightening of a laser, starting-up of a servo, and the like are executed, whereby the apparatus is thus ready to read data from the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A spherical aberration correcting routine is started (step S<b>1</b>). First, the spherical aberration generating means <b>11</b> is set to generate a predetermined appropriate aberration (step S<b>2</b>). For example, when the thickness of the substrate of the medium is standard, the spherical aberration generating means is set to provide such an aberration as to eliminate spherical aberration on a surface of the medium in design value. This amount of correction for spherical aberration is defined as “<b>0</b>”.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Then, the drive controller instructs the waveform equalization <b>301</b> to activate an adaptive operation (step S<b>3</b>). Thus, the waveform equalization <b>301</b> starts updating the coefficient so that the output is similar to the PR (1, 2, 2, 1) characteristic. The drive controller checks how the coefficient converges (step S<b>4</b>). Once the coefficient converges, the drive controller instructs the waveform equalization <b>301</b> to stop the adaptive operation (step S<b>5</b>). To check the convergence, it is possible not only to check the coefficient but also to wait for a period of sufficient to surely converge.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then, the amount of aberration generated by the spherical aberration generating means <b>11</b> is set at −<b>4</b> (step S<b>6</b>). This is performed such that, for example, the lens <b>8</b> is moved by 10 μm per unit amount thereof. Specifically, the value −4 means that the lens <b>8</b> is moved by 40 μm from a reference position so as to approach the lens <b>7</b>. In this state, a signal is reproduced from the medium and its SAM value is measured. The SAM value is related to the correction amount of −4 and stored in a memory of the CPU or the like (step S<b>7</b>). The amount of correction for spherical aberration is sequentially increased by one unit until it becomes 4 (steps S<b>8</b> and S<b>9</b>), and the SAM value is measured and related to the correction amount and then stored. Sequentially increasing the correction amount by one unit means that the lens <b>8</b> is sequentially moved by 10 μm and the quality (grade) of the reproduced signal at each position is evaluated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph in which the axis of abscissa indicates the amount of correction, while the axis of ordinate indicates the SAM value. In order to determine the optimum correction amount for spherical aberration, the SAM values stored so as to be related to the correction amount are used. The correction amounts at two positions at which the SAM value exceeds or falls below a reference value (for example, the SAM value at which the bit error rate corresponds to 10<sup>−4</sup>) are determined and the median of the correction amounts at the two positions is defined as an optimum correction amount for spherical aberration. In order to accurately determine the optimum correction amount for spherical aberration from discrete correction amounts, the correction amounts at those positions corresponding to the reference value are determined from the respective correction amounts by linear interpolation or the like. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, because the correction amounts corresponding to the reference value are −3.0 on the negative value side and 3.3 on the positive value side, the optimum correction amount for spherical aberration is determined to be 0.15. The thus determined correction amount is set in the spherical aberration generating means <b>11</b> (step S<b>10</b>). The drive controller <b>209</b> instructs the waveform equalization <b>301</b> to perform an adaptive operation (step S<b>11</b>). When the correction of the spherical aberration is completed (step S<b>12</b>), the optical disk apparatus is ready to record and reproduce user data. In response to a reproduction instruction from a higher-order apparatus, the optical disk apparatus accesses a data track to reproduce the signal and effects the waveform equalization <b>301</b> to perform an adaptive equalization operation during the reproduction of the signal, whereby a highly reliable optical disk apparatus can be provided which can reproduce high-quality signals. Further, at the beginning of the spherical aberration correcting routine, by bringing the spherical aberration generating means into a reference state and having the waveform equalization <b>301</b> perform an adaptive equalization operation to make the output similar to the PR (1, 2, 2, 1) characteristic to thereby improve the signal quality, when the spherical aberration correcting means <b>11</b> is activated to change the aberration and evaluate the SAM value, the waveform equalization <b>301</b> is in the best conditions, so that the optimum spherical aberration can be appropriately determined.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, because the output from the waveform equalization <b>301</b> is used for the adaptive equalization operation, a quick adaptive operation can be performed, the time required by the spherical aberration correcting routine can effectively be reduced, and the quickly responsive adaptive operation serves to maintain a high signal quality even during the reproduction of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Incidentally, when the apparatus is activated, data used to evaluate a reproduced signal may be recorded in a test area preformed on the medium. In this case, by roughly adjusting the spherical aberration generating means <b>11</b> to perform a test recording so as to increase the amplitude of a track error signal when the tracking servo is in off state, subsequent fine-tuning of the spherical aberration using an evaluation index such as SAM or the like can be effectively performed.</p>

This configuration also enables a more accurate adaptive equalization operation to be performed when user data is reproduced, so that even when inclination of a surface of a medium with respect to an optical pickup, i.e., the so-called tilt occurs, the reproduced signal can maintain a good quality.</p>
