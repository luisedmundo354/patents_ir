<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An oral odor control agent admixture of generally equivalent proportions of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils shows efficacy as an odor control agent in oral care for control of garlic odor.</p>
</abstract>
<description id="description">
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a dentifrice composition useful for reducing oral malodor. In particular, the present invention includes dentifrices incorporating a malodor agent containing thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many individuals desire a “bright” smile, healthy teeth, and a pleasant personal presence in social interactions. Unfortunately, some foods, while enjoyable when consumed, deposit and/or transfer chemical compounds into the oral cavity or into the blood stream that linger to afflict the social presence of a person with malodor during exhalation accompanying conversation and/or respiration. This malodor generally detracts from the desired pleasant social presence. Garlic and onion containing foods are especially of concern in this regard and have frustrated long term efficacy in malodor remedies.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides oral care compositions. In somewhat greater detail, the invention is for an oral odor control agent composition, comprising:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">(a) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent thymol essential oil;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">(b) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent anise essential oil;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0006">(c) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent fennel essential oil;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0007">(d) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent basil essential oil; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0008">(e) a remainder of juniperberry essential oil wherein said juniperberry essential oil is from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent of said oral admixture composition.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0009">In one aspect, the oral control agent is provided in from about 0.3 weight percent to about 2 weight percent of an oral care vehicle in a product such as mouthwash, dental cream, or toothpaste. In another aspect, the oral control agent is provided in a lozenge or other portable form such as a mint, bead, wafer, liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable nebulizer (spray bottle), liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable drop-generating bottle, or a soft pliable tablet (“chewie”).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0010">The invention is also for admixing an oral control agent into an oral care vehicle according to any of the above-described formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for suppressing malodor by applying the above formulation to the oral cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0014">The following definitions and non-limiting guidelines must be considered in reviewing the description of this invention set forth herein. The headings (such as “Introduction” and “Summary,”) and sub-headings (such as “Compositions” and “Methods”) used herein are intended only for general organization of topics within the disclosure of the invention, and are not intended to limit the disclosure of the invention or any aspect thereof. In particular, subject matter disclosed in the “Introduction” may include aspects of technology within the scope of the invention, and may not constitute a recitation of prior art. Subject matter disclosed in the “Summary” is not an exhaustive or complete disclosure of the entire scope of the invention or any embodiments thereof. Classification or discussion of a material within a section of this specification as having a particular utility (e.g., as being an “active” or a “carrier” ingredient) is made for convenience, and no inference should be drawn that the material must necessarily or solely function in accordance with its classification herein when it is used in any given composition.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The citation of references herein does not constitute an admission that those references are prior art or have any relevance to the patentability of the invention disclosed herein. Any discussion of the content of references cited in the Introduction is intended merely to provide a general summary of assertions made by the authors of the references, and does not constitute an admission as to the accuracy of the content of such references. All references cited in the Description section of this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">The description and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Moreover, recitation of multiple embodiments having stated features is not intended to exclude other embodiments having additional features, or other embodiments incorporating different combinations the stated of features. Specific Examples are provided for illustrative purposes of how to make and use the compositions and methods of this invention and, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are not intended to be a representation that given embodiments of this invention have, or have not, been made or tested.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">As used herein, the words “preferred” and “preferably” refer to embodiments of the invention that afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">As used herein, the word “include,” and its variants, is intended to be non-limiting, such that recitation of items in a list is not to the exclusion of other like items that may also be useful in the materials, compositions, devices, and methods of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">As used herein, the term “about,” when applied to the value for a parameter of a composition or method of this invention, indicates that the calculation or the measurement of the value allows some slight imprecision without having a substantial effect on the chemical or physical attributes of the composition or method. If, for some reason, the imprecision provided by “about” is not otherwise understood in the art with this ordinary meaning, then “about” as used herein indicates a possible variation of up to 5% in the value.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">As referred to herein, all compositional percentages are by weight of the total composition, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Compositions</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">The present invention provides an oral care composition having an odor control agent (malodor oral care) composition and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject. In overview, the oral care composition and odor control agent composition is achieved with an odor control admixture comprising thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">As referred to herein, an “oral care composition” is any composition that is suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity of a human or animal subject for enhancing the health, hygiene or appearance of the subject, preferably providing such benefits as: the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of the teeth, gums, mucosa or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity; the prevention or treatment of a systemic condition or disorder; the provision of sensory, decorative or cosmetic benefits; and combinations thereof. In various embodiments, an oral care composition is not intentionally swallowed, but is rather retained in the oral cavity for a time sufficient to effect the intended utility. In other portable embodiments (such as a lozenge, mint, bead, wafer, liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable nebulizer, liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable drop-generating bottle, or a soft pliable tablet), an oral care composition is intentionally swallowed, optionally after retention in the oral cavity for a time sufficient to effect intended utility. Preferably, specific materials and compositions to be used in this invention are, accordingly, pharmaceutically- or cosmetically-acceptable, clinically effective, and/or clinically efficacious. As used herein, such a “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “cosmetically acceptable”, “clinically effective”, and/or “clinically efficacious” component is one that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals and is provided in an appropriate amount (a clinically efficacious amount) to provide the desired therapeutic, prophylactic, sensory, decorative, or cosmetic benefit without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Orally Acceptable Carrier</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">The present invention provides compositions comprising an orally acceptable carrier in a product such as mouthwash, toothpaste, dental cream, or portable dosage article such as, without limitation, a lozenge, a mint, bead, wafer, liquid formulated for oral application in a small portable nebulizer (spray bottle), liquid formulated for oral application in a small portable drop-generating bottle, or a soft pliable tablet (“chewie”). As used herein, an “orally acceptable carrier” refers to a material or combination of materials that are safe for use in the compositions of the present invention, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, with which the blended thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils may be associated while retaining significant efficacy. Preferably, the carrier does not substantially reduce the efficacy of the blended thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0035">In this regard, a surprising result (see the Examples) shows that this particular mixture of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils provides especial efficacy in reducing garlic odor in human testing. This surprising find surmounts the traditional challenge of controlling complex and systemically sustained garlic odor and onion odor. Actives such as copper chlorophyllin and parsley seed oil have traditionally been used to control garlic malodor. However, a mixture embodiment of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils in equivalent parts shows a surprisingly dramatic reduction of nearly 80 percent in garlic malodor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">In one embodiment, each of the thymol, anise, fennel, and basil essential oils are independently from about 15 weight percent to about 25 weight percent of the composition. In one embodiment, each of the thymol, anise, fennel, and basil essential oils are independently about 20 weight percent of the odor control agent in the oral care composition.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0037">In one embodiment, the oral odor control agent admixture provides from about 0.3 weight percent to about 2 weight percent of an oral care composition in an oral care vehicle.

<p id="p-0046" num="0055">As shown in Table 1, anise star, basil, dill seed, sweet fennel, juniperberry, lemongrass, parsley, rosemary, sage, camphor, cinnamon, clove, neroli, pine, saffron, and thyme extracts all show significant efficacy in reducing garlic odor when used at less than 0.13 weight percent levels in the test.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0056">The best-performing odor control actives of Example 1 are tested in combination to explore synergistic effects using the technique of Example 1. A control of a traditional garlic odor oral care active blend is also tested according to the same technique. The five actives of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils, when combined at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 (20 weight percent each respective to the odor control active test formulation) indicate the most effective additive and/or synergistic effect of all combinations. Quantitative garlic odor efficacy for the thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils blend in ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 indicates a 78 percent reduction in garlic odor components in the test headspace. Quantitative garlic odor efficacy for the control (the traditional garlic odor oral care active blend) indicates a 53 percent reduction in garlic odor components in the test headspace. The results indicate a surprising efficacy for the thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils blend in 1:1:1:1:1 blending.</p>
