<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of determining bias in a measurement of a constituent concentration level in a sample gas is provided. The method comprises establishing a sample gas flow from an emission stream into a sample gas line of an emissions monitoring system. The method further comprises removing water from the sample gas flow and cooling the sample gas flow to a temperature below about 41° F. to produce a cooled, dried sample gas flow. The constituent concentration level is then determined for the cooled, dried sample gas flow. The method further comprises introducing a span gas having a known span gas constituent concentration level into the sample gas flow to form a combined sample and span gas flow, the span gas being introduced at a desired span gas flow rate. The method still further comprises removing water from the combined sample and span gas and cooling the combined sample and span gas to a temperature below about 41° F. to produce a cooled, dried, combined sample and span gas flow. A combined sample and span gas constituent concentration level is then determined for the cooled, dried, combined sample and span gas flow. The method also comprises determining a measurement bias using the known span gas constituent concentration level, the sample gas constituent concentration level and the combined sample and span gas constituent concentration level.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the measurement of air pollutant emissions from gas turbines, boilers, process heaters, furnaces and other combustion sources. More particularly, the invention relates to a continuous emission monitoring method and system that minimizes bias in the measurement of air pollutant emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Power plants and other users of combustion sources such as gas-fired turbines are required to keep emissions of certain exhaust constituents at or below specified levels. Continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) are required in order to assure on a continuous basis that the mandated levels are maintained. Over time, however, improved methods of minimizing emissions have evolved and emissions standards have become more stringent. CEMS systems are therefore required to consistently measure lower and lower concentrations of pollutant emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the maximum allowable concentrations of air pollutants have decreased, the effects of bias in CEMS measurements have become more and more significant. One example of particular interest is in the measurement of nitrogen oxides concentration. Nitrogen oxides emitted from combustion sources are defined as the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). The combination of the two is referred to as NO<sub>x</sub>. The majority of NO<sub>x </sub>from many combustion sources is NO with about 2% to 5% as NO<sub>2</sub>. For gas turbines, NO<sub>2 </sub>typically represents 5 to 15% of the total NO<sub>x</sub>. Under certain circumstances, however, in gas turbines equipped with NO<sub>x </sub>control systems, NO<sub>2 </sub>may represent as much as 50% of total NO<sub>x</sub>. In most cases, the relative amounts of NO and NO<sub>2 </sub>need not be determined. Nevertheless, the presence of a greater or lesser amount of NO<sub>2 </sub>can have an impact on bias in the measurement system used to determine the total NO<sub>x </sub>concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current CEMS systems are subject to a number of sources of bias with respect to NO<sub>x </sub>measurement. The resulting biases become more significant as the total NO<sub>x </sub>concentration level gets smaller. Recent technology improvements have resulted in combustion systems with NO<sub>x </sub>emissions in the range of 1 to 10 ppm. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations place upper limits on the sum of all measurement bias and constituent interference effects. Bias effects in the systems now in use may prevent these systems from meeting the accuracy requirements that go along with the measurement of smaller concentrations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is accordingly a need for a CEMS that minimizes bias in the measurement of emission constituent concentration levels generally and NO<sub>x </sub>concentration levels in particular. There is also a need for a CEMS that provides for routine monitoring of the remaining bias in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an emissions monitoring system for monitoring constituent concentration levels in an emission stream flowing through a combustion source exhaust stack. The system comprises a sampling device configured and positioned for extraction of sample gas from the emission stream in the stack. A chamber is positioned adjacent the stack and defines a chamber interior. The system includes an arrangement for maintaining in the chamber interior a temperature above a dew point temperature of the sample gas. At least one sample gas line is in fluid communication with the sampling device. At least a portion of the sample gas line is disposed in the chamber interior. The system includes an arrangement for removing particulate matter from the sample gas. The arrangement for removing particulate matter is disposed adjacent the stack and is in fluid communication with the at least one sample gas line. The system also includes an arrangement for removing water from the sample gas. This arrangement is also in fluid communication with the at least one sample gas line. The system further comprises at least one analyzer in fluid communication with the at least one sample gas line, each of the at least one analyzer being configured for determination of a concentration level of a constituent in the sample gas.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention provides an emissions monitoring system that minimizes bias effects in the capture and analysis of NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. The invention also provides a method for routinely monitoring the system to identify changes in measurement bias. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of a typical prior art emissions monitoring system <b>10</b>. In the system <b>10</b>, multiphase exhaust emissions are drawn from a stack <b>18</b> using a sampling device <b>12</b>. At the outlet of the sampling device <b>12</b>, the emissions are passed through a filter <b>14</b> to remove large particulate matter on the order of 7 microns or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The resulting sample gas and any remaining particulate matter are then passed through a heated sampling line <b>16</b> to a CEMS analysis room <b>20</b>. The analysis room <b>20</b> is typically a small ground level building, trailer or mobile sampling van that houses the analyzers for the various types of emissions that must be assessed. Such a building is typically carefully climate controlled. Upon entering the analysis room <b>20</b>, the sample gas is passed through a dryer <b>22</b>, which is typically a refrigeration condenser with condensate traps for removal of water from the sample gas. The sample gas is then passed through a second filter <b>24</b> which removes approximately 99.99% of all particles greater than 0.5 microns. The sample gas is then split so that a portion of the gas proceeds into a NO<sub>x </sub>analyzer <b>30</b>. The remainder of the gas is passed to other CEMS analyzers <b>26</b>, which assess concentration levels of such constituents as oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The NO<sub>x </sub>analyzer <b>30</b> includes an NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>32</b> and an NO analyzer <b>34</b>. In general, NO<sub>x </sub>concentration levels need only be determined as a total of NO and NO<sub>2 </sub>levels. Available NO<sub>x </sub>analyzers are only able to determine the concentration of NO in a sample gas. It is therefore necessary to convert any NO<sub>2 </sub>in the gas to NO. This is accomplished using the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>32</b>. The converter <b>32</b> may be a separate module but is often an integral part of the analyzer. After conversion of the NO<sub>2 </sub>to NO, the analyzer <b>34</b> determines the concentration of NO in the sample gas.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The system <b>10</b> is calibrated by closing off the sampling device <b>12</b> and injecting calibration gases upstream of the first filter <b>14</b>. The calibration gases, which are sometimes referred to as span gases, include known concentration levels of the emission gases of interest. The calibration gases are then passed through the same sequence as the sample gases in order to determine if the system <b>10</b> is properly measuring the sample gas constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above-described emissions monitoring system <b>10</b> has a number of sources of bias relative to the measurement of NO<sub>x </sub>concentration. Chief among these is the potential for low measurements due to the presence of interfering species in the gas sample. Flue gases from most combustion sources typically contain about 8 to 30% water. For example, because NO<sub>2 </sub>is water soluble (as opposed to NO, which is not water soluble), condensation and subsequent removal of liquid water from the sample gas can result in the removal of significant amounts of NO<sub>2</sub>. As a result, it is imperative that condensation be minimized. Typical prior art systems have therefore required significant measures to assure that the water in the sample gas does not condense out prior to the passage of the gas through the dryer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">These measures generally depend on keeping the sample gas at a temperature above the temperature at which water would condense out (i.e., the dew point). Stack gases from which the sample gases taken are generally at elevated temperatures. For a simple cycle gas turbine, stack gases are typically on the order of 1200° F. The stack gases must be cooled to a temperature that will not damage system components but must be kept above the dew point to prevent condensation. While the dew point of these gases may vary depending on composition, it is typically about 200° F. or higher. To keep the sample gas above this temperature, the filter <b>14</b> must be heated. Moreover, the sample gas must be transported from the sampling device <b>12</b> and the filter <b>14</b> to the dryer <b>22</b> using a heated sample line <b>16</b>. The sample line <b>16</b> is heated using electrical heating elements imbedded in the line. These heating elements maintain the sample gas at a constant temperature of approximately 250° F. Because the dryer <b>22</b> is remote from the stack <b>18</b>, the heated line <b>16</b> may be hundreds of feet long.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Heating and maintaining the sample line <b>16</b> is expensive. Moreover, there are often localized failures of the electrical heating elements. Such failures can result in water condensation in the line <b>16</b> and consequent loss of NO<sub>2 </sub>from the sample gas.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">NO<sub>x </sub>measurement bias can also result from the conversion of other nitrogen-containing species to NO by the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>32</b>. One example where this might occur is in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system subject to ammonia slip. Such a system could result in an inadvertently high NO<sub>x </sub>concentration determination because of the conversion of ammonia to NO. This type of bias is highly dependent upon the catalytic material used in the converter <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An additional potential for bias in CEMS systems stems from the fact that the stack gases are composed of a mixture of gases, typically N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO<sub>x</sub>. Emissions analyzers are typically calibrated by injecting a span gas with a known concentration of the key constituent (potentially a trace species such as NO) in a background of molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). The electronic components of the analyzer are adjusted such that instrumental response agrees with the known span gas concentration. When the analyzer is used to determine the concentration of the key constituent (such as NO) in an actual flue gas, the sample background matrix will be much more complex than the N<sub>2 </sub>in the span gas. The differences in background gas composition can result in potentially significant measurement bias known as a matrix effect.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention provides a monitoring system wherein the above described biases are significantly reduced or eliminated. The system also allows remaining biases to be quantified. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration of a CEMS <b>100</b> according to the present invention. The CEMS <b>100</b> uses a fundamentally different approach to NO<sub>x </sub>concentration measurement in that it uses an NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b> that is specifically designed and configured for use on hot, wet gas samples. The NO<sub>2</sub>-converter <b>136</b> is housed in an environmentally controlled converter chamber <b>120</b> that is situated in close proximity to the stack <b>102</b> from which the sample gas is withdrawn. After passage through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b>, the sample gas is passed through a refrigeration dryer <b>140</b> where water in the sample gas is condensed out and removed. The sample gas is then passed through a conduit <b>150</b> to an analysis room <b>110</b> and an NO analyzer <b>192</b>. Because the NO<sub>2 </sub>in the gas has already been converted to NO and the gas has already been dried, the conduit <b>150</b> need only be configured to maintain the sample gas at temperatures above freezing. The CEMS <b>100</b> also includes subsystems for back-flushing the filters in the system, for calibrating the system and for a dynamic spiking process that allows assessment of interference and other biases remaining in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An illustrative embodiment of the invention will now be discussed in more detail. The CEMS <b>100</b> uses a sampling device to withdraw sample emission gas from a stack <b>102</b>. The sampling device may be configured for passive extraction of exhaust gases or for active extraction through the use of an applied vacuum. In embodiments of the invention, the sampling device <b>104</b> is a dual-annulus, air-cooled probe that extends into the stack interior. In this configuration, compressed air flows through an annular outer jacket of the probe <b>104</b> to cool the sample gas from stack temperatures of about 1000-1300° F. to a temperature that is just above the dew point of the gas, which is typically in the range from about 190° F. to 250° F. The gas temperature of the probe outlet <b>122</b> will typically be in a range from about 250° F. to about 350° F. Higher temperatures may be used depending on the materials in the system. Such temperatures, may however, tend to degrade system components formed from low tolerance materials such as TEFLON™. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that reduced gas temperature and the relatively low temperature of the inner liner of the probe <b>104</b> also lower the tendency for CO in the gas to oxidize to CO<sub>2</sub>, which can bias the measurement of CO concentration in the gas. It will also be understood that other cooling arrangements could be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Such arrangements could include the passage of other fluids through the jacket, dilution cooling or the use of refrigeration.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The flow rate of the compressed air through the outer jacket of the probe <b>104</b> is controlled in such a way as to maintain a desired gas temperature at the outlet <b>122</b> of the probe <b>104</b>. A compressed air source <b>106</b> provides compressed air through a valve <b>108</b> controlled by a controller electrically connected to a thermocouple at the probe outlet <b>122</b>. The thermocouple provides a sample gas temperature to the controller which opens or closes the valve <b>108</b> as appropriate to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The probe <b>104</b> extends out through the wall of the stack <b>102</b> and into the converter chamber <b>120</b>. In one exemplary configuration, the converter chamber <b>120</b> may be mounted on or adjacent the stack <b>102</b>. The converter chamber <b>120</b> may be weatherproofed and may be heated as described hereinafter. At the exit <b>122</b> of the probe <b>104</b>, the sample gas flow is split between two sample lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>. A first line <b>152</b> is used to carry sample gas that will be used to assess NO<sub>x </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>concentration levels. A second line <b>154</b> is used to carry sample gas that will be used to assess concentration levels of other compounds such as CO, CO<sub>2 </sub>and SO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the probe <b>104</b> may have multiple sampling tips at different locations in the stack <b>102</b> to provide a representative sample of the exhaust stream. Alternatively, multiple separate probes may be used. The sample gas from the various locations may be analyzed separately or as a single overall sample.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The sample gas flow is split in order to avoid the potential for biasing the measurement of other constituents. For example, when sample gas is passed through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b>, there is a strong potential for creation of trace levels of CO by the catalytic reaction of NO<sub>2 </sub>on the carbonaceous surface of the converter <b>136</b>. As will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art, reducing NO<sub>2 </sub>to NO liberates an oxygen atom that may be attached to a carbon atom on the converter surface. The resulting CO molecule can be released to the gas stream and bias the CO emission measurement. This problem is avoided by splitting the sample gas into two streams, only one of which is passed through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b>. Only the sample gas that is not passed through the converter <b>136</b> is used to assess CO concentration. Splitting the flow also provides the advantage of minimizing the required size (i.e., flow capacity) of the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter, which reduces system cost.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first and second sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are passed through first and second span gas valves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, respectively. As will be discussed in more detail hereafter, the span gas valves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are used during the calibration and dynamic spiking processes to introduce gases with known constituents into the system. Filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> are disposed across the sample gas lines <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to remove solid particles from the sample gas. These filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> are configured to remove 99% of all particles greater than about 2.0 microns in size. It will be understood that the two filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> could be replaced with a single filter positioned upstream of where the flow sample gas flow is split. It will also be understood that the filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> could be housed separately from the converter chamber <b>120</b>, in which case the sample gas lines would pass from the probe <b>104</b> to the filter housing(s), then to the converter chamber <b>120</b>. This approach would acquire additional heating measures to assure that the sample gas remains above its dew point.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Just downstream of the filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are passed through back-flush valves <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. These valves <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, which may be, for example, three-way valves with one input, are connected to compressed air lines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, which in turn are connected to a compressed air supply <b>172</b>. Using these valves <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, compressed air may be introduced into the gas sample lines <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to back-flush the filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and the sample probe <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first sample gas line <b>152</b> is connected to the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b>, which is also disposed within the heated converter chamber <b>120</b>. The NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b> used in the CEMS <b>100</b> is designed for operation in high temperature, wet gas streams. As used herein, high temperature refers to temperatures above 250° F. and a wet gas stream is one having a dew point above about 5° C. (41° F.). The converter <b>136</b> uses carbon or carbon/molybdenum to establish the catalytic reaction and convert NO<sub>2 </sub>to NO. Typically, the converter <b>136</b> does not include stainless steel. This reduces the potential for reaction with ammonia, thereby reducing or eliminating bias in the NO<sub>x </sub>measurement due to the presence of ammonia in the gas. An exemplary converter that is suitable for use in the invention is the model CG-2H converter produced by MProducts Analysentechnik GmbH. This converter is capable of operation at temperatures up to about 635° F. The converter is capable of handling gas flow rates of 3 L/min., which is suitable for use in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The converter chamber <b>120</b> and all components disposed therein are maintained at a temperature of at least 250° F. to prevent condensation from occurring in the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> and, in particular, to prevent condensation from occurring upstream of the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b>. This may be accomplished with a chamber heater <b>118</b> using electric heating coils, a forced air heating system, steam or any other arrangement suitable for heating the interior of the converter chamber <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Both sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> pass out of the converter chamber <b>120</b> to a dryer <b>140</b>, which is preferably disposed adjacent the converter chamber <b>120</b>. The dryer <b>140</b> is divided into a first leg <b>142</b> wherein water is removed from the NO<sub>x </sub>sample gas line <b>152</b> and a second leg <b>144</b> wherein water is removed from the second sample gas line <b>154</b>. The dryer <b>140</b> is a refrigerated unit that reduces the temperature of the gas to about 40° F., thereby causing the water in the sample gas to condense out. Because the dryer <b>140</b> is downstream of the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter, the first dryer leg <b>142</b> does not need to be configured to minimize subsequent contact of the gas with the liquid water. The sample gas at this point contains no significant amount of NO<sub>2 </sub>that could otherwise be lost through water contact. The result is a simpler dryer configuration, which significantly reduces the cost of the dryer <b>140</b>. As an additional benefit, increased contact between the sample gas and liquid water in the dryer <b>140</b> has the effect of removing certain reactive species such as ammonia from the sample gas. The process of removing moisture from the sample gas results in the sample gas being saturated at the temperature of the gases when they leave the cooler.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second dryer leg <b>144</b> may be configured differently from the first dryer leg. In particular, if sample gas from the second sample gas line <b>154</b> is to be used to determine the concentration level of a water soluble compound such as ammonia or SO-<sub>2</sub>, the second dryer leg may be configured to minimize contact of the sample gas with the condensate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After passage through the dryer <b>140</b>, the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are routed to an analysis room <b>110</b>. Both the converter chamber <b>120</b> and the dryer <b>140</b> are in close proximity to the stack <b>120</b> but the analysis room <b>110</b> is typically relatively remote. In the CEMS <b>100</b> of the present invention, the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are routed along with two compressed air lines <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and two span gas lines <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> through a conduit <b>150</b> to the analysis room <b>110</b>. Unlike the lines in prior art systems, the conduit <b>150</b> need not be heated to a high temperature (e.g., 250° F.) to keep the sample gases above the dew point of the gas. The conduit <b>150</b> need only be configured to assure that the sample gas temperature remains above freezing. This may generally be accomplished through the use of insulation or in some cases a warming system. In either case, the cost of installation and maintenance of the conduit <b>150</b> is significantly lower than for the heated lines of prior system. Moreover, there is no concern over biases introduced due to localized failures of a heating system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The analysis room <b>110</b> houses an analyzer bank <b>190</b> comprising a variety of analyzers for different types of emissions. The analysis room <b>110</b> may be a room within the main building of a plant, a separate ground level building, a ground level trailer or other facility. Because some analyzers may be subject to variation as a result in changes to ambient conditions, the primary requirement for the analysis room is that it include the capability to maintain precise environmental control.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The analyzer bank <b>190</b> of the CEMS <b>100</b> includes an NO analyzer <b>192</b>, an O<sub>2</sub>-analyzer <b>194</b> and a bank of other analyzers <b>196</b>. The other analyzers may include one or more units for determination of concentration levels of SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2 </sub>or other sample gas constituents. Upon entering the analysis room, the first sample gas line <b>152</b> is passed through a first mass flow meter <b>166</b> and the second gas flow line <b>154</b> is passed through a second mass flow meter <b>168</b>. After passage through the second gas flow meter <b>168</b>, the second gas flow line <b>154</b> is passed to the bank of analyzers <b>196</b> where it is split into as many separate lines as are necessary for analysis by the various constituent analyzers. The first gas flow line <b>152</b> is split into two lines, one of which proceeds into the NO analyzer <b>192</b> and the other of which proceeds into the O<sub>2 </sub>analyzer in, for example, the manner described above. These analyzers are substantially similar to the analyzers used in prior art systems and may include any analyzer suitable for taking measurements in compliance with regulatory specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be understood that the sample gas from the first gas flow line <b>152</b> may also be used to assess other constituents, such as CO<sub>2 </sub>that would not be affected by passage through the converter <b>136</b>. As a result, the first gas flow line <b>152</b> may be further split to provide sample gas to other analyzers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the system <b>100</b>, the analysis room <b>110</b> also houses a compressed air source <b>172</b> and two span gas sources <b>174</b>, <b>178</b>. As previously mentioned, the compressed air source <b>172</b> provides compressed air for use in back-flushing the filters <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and the sampling probe <b>104</b>. The span gas sources <b>174</b> and <b>178</b> provide gases having known constituent concentrations for use in calibration of the system <b>100</b>. The first span gas source <b>174</b> is connected to a first span gas line <b>156</b>, which passes through a first flow meter/controller <b>176</b>. Similarly, the second span gas source <b>178</b> is connected to a second span gas line <b>158</b>, which passes through a second flow meter/controller <b>180</b>. Both span gas lines <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> are then passed out of the analysis room <b>110</b> and through the freeze-protected conduit <b>150</b> to the converter chamber <b>120</b>. The first span gas line <b>156</b> is connected to the first sample gas line <b>152</b> at the first span gas valve <b>124</b> and the second span gas line <b>158</b> is connected to the second sample gas line <b>154</b> at the second span gas valve <b>126</b>. The span gas valves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are configured to selectively close off the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> from the sample probe <b>104</b> and allow span gas from the first and second span gas sources <b>174</b>, <b>178</b> to pass through the first and second sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Span gases allow the calibration of the system <b>100</b> using gases having known concentration levels of constituents of interest. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art each of the span gas sources <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> may be used to introduce any of multiple span gas variations into the system <b>100</b>. The span gas sources <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> can also be used to introduce a substantially inert gas such as N<sub>2 </sub>for use in zeroing the analyzers <b>192</b>, <b>194</b>, <b>196</b> (i.e., assuring that the analyzers register zero when their respective constituents are not present in the gas flowing through the system).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the CEMS <b>100</b>, the compressed air source <b>172</b> and the span gas sources <b>174</b>, <b>178</b> are positioned in the analysis room <b>110</b> primarily as a matter of convenience. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that these sources may be placed elsewhere without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The CEMS <b>100</b> may include an automated data processing system (not shown) for use in controlling the various components of the system and for data acquisition, storage and processing. The automated data processing system may provide access to the CEMS <b>100</b> via modem or other network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that, although the system <b>100</b> is referred to as a continuous emissions monitoring system, the system <b>100</b> can be operated either continuously or at random or predetermined intervals.</p>

The method <b>300</b> begins at step <b>302</b>. At step <b>304</b> the sample gas is captured from the stack <b>102</b> by the sampling probe <b>104</b>. This may be accomplished in either an active or passive manner. At step <b>306</b>, the sample gas is cooled to a temperature above the dew point of the gas and at least a portion is introduced into the sample gas line <b>152</b>. At step <b>308</b>, particulate matter is removed from the sample gas by passing the gas through a filter <b>128</b>. NO<sub>2 </sub>in the sample gas is then converted to NO by passage of the gas through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b> at step <b>310</b>. The sample gas is kept at a temperature above the sampling gas dew point during steps <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>. At steps <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>, water in the sample gas is condensed out and removed using the refrigerated dryer <b>140</b>. At step <b>316</b>, the sample gas is passed to the analysis room <b>110</b> through the freeze-protected conduit <b>150</b>. At step <b>318</b>, at least a portion of the sample gas passed through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter is analyzed by the NO analyzer to determine the concentration of NO in the sample gas. The method <b>300</b> ends at step <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to comply with continuous emission monitoring guidelines, the analyzers of a CEMS must be regularly calibrated. With respect to NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, this may be accomplished by the CEMS <b>100</b> of the present invention by the separate introduction into the system of a zeroing gas having a substantially zero NO gas concentration and a span gas having a known concentration of NO. The zeroing gas is preferably N<sub>2 </sub>and the span gas is preferably a mixture of N<sub>2 </sub>and NO. The amount of NO in the span gas is typically on the order of the full scale measurement capability of the system <b>100</b>. The response of the NO analyzer <b>192</b> may be automatically adjusted to conform to the concentration of the span gas. Calibration may be accomplished several times per day and any calibration drift recorded and reported to the EPA.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Similar calibration procedures may be used with respect to the other analyzers in the system <b>100</b> as well. The span gas introduced through the second span gas line <b>158</b> may be used for single emission constituents in an otherwise inert gas or may include multiple emission constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although these calibration procedures provide some measure of the accuracy of the analyzers, they do not directly provide a means of assessing interference and other bias effects remaining in the system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> provides for the use of dynamic spiking of the sample gas flows to assess these effects. The basic approach is to spike the sample gas such that there is a known step function increase in the concentration level of a particular constituent. For example, without closing off the sampling probe <b>104</b>, the first span gas line <b>156</b> may be used to introduce a span gas having a known concentration level of NO into the sample gas flow at a known flow rate. This allows for a direct check on the existence and magnitude of any biases in the measurement of NO concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To maintain the accuracy of the dynamic spiking method, the flow rate of and concentration level in the span gas should be known with a high degree of precision. The flow rate of the sample gas before and after addition of the span gas should also be measured precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The dynamic spiking method may be described using the following example. A gas turbine is operating with a stack NO<sub>x </sub>concentration of 9 ppm. The sample flow is preferably dynamically spiked in such a way as to approximately double the NO<sub>x </sub>concentration. This may be accomplished in a manner that has minimal impact on the concentration of other sample gas constituents. To accomplish both objectives, a spiking span gas with approximately 90 ppm NO<sub>2 </sub>may be introduced into the sample gas flow. The balance of the spiking gas may be N<sub>2</sub>. The flow rate of the spiking gas is set to be approximately 1/10 the flow rate of the sample gas flow. This results in an NO<sub>x </sub>concentration in the mixed gas stream that is double that of the sample gas alone. This also results in a 10% dilution of the other sample gas constituents.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The mass flow meters/controllers <b>176</b>, <b>180</b> in the span gas lines <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> may be used to determine the actual flow rates of the spiking gas. The mass flow meters <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> in the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may be used to determine the actual flow rates of the sample gas plus the spiking gas. A significant feature of the system <b>100</b> is that the mass flow meters will be processing cool, dry gases. This significantly enhances the reliability of these instruments and improves the confidence level in their measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In operation, the step function addition of NO<sub>2 </sub>to the sample stream challenges all components of the sampling system. The sum of all biases introduced by losses in the filter (e.g., through absorption), the converter, the dryer or the transfer lines and any inaccuracy or bias in the NO analyzer itself can be assessed by comparing the differential between the NO<sub>x </sub>concentration of the spiked gas and the NO<sub>x </sub>concentration of the unspiked gas to the known concentration in the span gas. Importantly, this assessment is made with all of the actual sample gas constituents included in the sample gas.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A further feature of the dynamic spiking system is that the sample flow passed through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b> is piped to both the NO analyzer <b>192</b> and the O<sub>2 </sub>analyzer <b>194</b>. During dynamic spiking, the O<sub>2 </sub>concentration in the sample gas will be decreased by a known percentage. (In the example above, the O<sub>2 </sub>concentration would be reduced by 10%.) The oxygen measurement provides a direct check on proper operation of the mass flow meters/controllers used to determine the relative split of sample flow and spiking flow.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The steps in a dynamic spiking method are illustrated by the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method begins at step <b>402</b>. At steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>, a sample gas flow into the system <b>100</b> is established and the concentration of a constituent of interest is determined. These steps are carried out in substantially the same manner as previously described in the method <b>300</b> of continuously monitoring NO<sub>x </sub>emissions. If the constituent of interest is not a NO<sub>x </sub>component, however, the steps would be carried out using the second sample gas line <b>154</b> and the step of passing the sample gas through the NO<sub>2 </sub>converter <b>136</b> would be eliminated. At step <b>408</b>, flow rate of the sample gas and concentration of the key constituent, such as NO<sub>2</sub>, are measured, such as by using one of the two flow rate meters <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> and the appropriate analyzer, such as the NO analyzer <b>192</b>. Based on the measured sample gas flow rate and an approximate desired concentration level of the constituent, a spiking flow rate of a span gas with a known constituent concentration may be calculated at step <b>410</b>. Span gas at the desired flow rate is then added to the sample gas flow at step <b>412</b>. At step <b>414</b>, the flow rate of the combined sample gas and span gas is measured. The appropriate analyzer is then used to determine the concentration level of the constituent in the combined gas at step <b>416</b>. A comparison is then made at step <b>418</b> between the known concentration of the constituent in the span gas and the measured difference between the analyzer results for the sample gas alone and the sample gas plus the span gas. This comparison provides a quantitative indication of the overall system bias. The method ends at step <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As previously noted, the accuracy of the dynamic spiking method is dependent on the accuracy of the mass flow measurements. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the presence of water, O<sub>2 </sub>or CO<sub>2 </sub>in a sample gas can cause a flow rate measurement bias in flow meters calibrated using a span gas without these constituents. It will also be understood that a simple algorithm can be used to correct the mass flow rate if the relative percentages of these constituents in the sample gas are known. In the present invention, the water concentration remaining in the sample gas can be determined from the temperature of the sample gas as it leaves the refrigerated dryer <b>140</b>. The O<sub>2 </sub>and the CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations in the sample gas are determined by the O<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2 </sub>analyzers, respectively. With these concentrations known, the mass flow correction algorithm can be used to correct the mass flow values obtained from the flow rate meters <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> in the sample gas lines <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, thus enhancing the accuracy of the dynamic spiking method.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It will be understood that the above-described dynamic spiking method may be used on either leg of the system (i.e., using sample gas in sample gas line <b>152</b> or sample gas line <b>154</b>). In this manner, the performance of all analyzers in the CEMS <b>100</b> may be assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The dynamic spiking system of the present invention also provides a methodology for routinely demonstrating that the overall CEMS system <b>100</b> is in compliance with the accuracy dictates of the EPA or other such regulatory body or simply for internal purposes. Both the calibration and dynamic spiking processes of the present invention may be conducted manually or through the assistance of an automatic data processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While the foregoing description includes many details and specificities, it is to be understood that these have been included for purposes of explanation only, and are not to be interpreted as limitations of the present invention. Many modifications to the embodiments described above can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as is intended to be encompassed by the following claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
