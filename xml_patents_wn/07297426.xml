<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Applications No. 2002-171520, filed Jun. 12, 2002; No. 2002-260762, filed Sep. 6, 2002; and No. 2003-061872, filed Mar. 7, 2003, the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a direct methanol fuel cell system capable of driving electronic appliances hitherto using a battery as driving power source such as small portable appliances.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, fuel cells have high expectations as a power source for use in portable electronic appliances supporting the age of information technology, or as measures against air pollution and global warming.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Of the various fuel cells, the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) for generating power by taking out protons directly from methanol has outstanding benefits, such as no need of a reformer, and small fuel amount, and its application in portable electronic appliances is being developed. It is thus expected to be applied in many fields.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2001-93551, a container for holding a liquid fuel of a direct methanol fuel cell is detachable, or is capable of being replenished with liquid fuel, and driving for a long period is realized while reducing the size of the fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This type of direct methanol fuel cell is required to control the concentration of the methanol aqueous solution supplied as fuel, but the optimum concentration varies according to the load, which fluctuates, and the amount of the replenished methanol. The correct-supply amount in relation to an external load is not known unless actually operated for a long time, thus a practical direct methanol fuel cell capable of generating power stably for a long period has not been developed yet.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Methanol aqueous solution is supplied into the methanol supply port <b>107</b> of the anode fluid channel plate <b>106</b> by the liquid supply pump <b>111</b> from the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, and flows in the groove portion of the fluid channel plate, that is, the anode fluid channel <b>109</b>. A convex portion of the anode fluid channel plate <b>106</b> is in contact with the anode current collector <b>101</b> such as anode carbon paper. When the methanol aqueous solution flowing in the anode fluid channel <b>109</b> soaks into the anode current collector <b>101</b>, the methanol aqueous solution is supplied into the anode catalyst layer <b>102</b>. However, all of the supplied methanol aqueous solution does not soak into the anode current collector <b>101</b>, but the remaining methanol aqueous solution is guided into the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> from the methanol discharge port <b>108</b> by way of a fuel pipe <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, the air taken in from the oxidizer supply port <b>113</b> by the air supply pump <b>116</b> flows through a groove of the cathode fluid channel plate <b>112</b>, that is, the cathode fluid channel <b>115</b>, and soaks into the cathode catalyst layer <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the direct methanol fuel cell power generating device having such structure, methanol aqueous solution is supplied into the anode catalyst layer <b>102</b>, protons are generated by catalytic reaction, and the generated protons pass through the electrolyte layer <b>105</b>, and react with the oxygen supplied in the cathode catalyst layer <b>104</b> on the catalyst, thereby generating electromotive force.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an embodiment of the invention is described.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The power generating unit <b>201</b> comprises the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>, a liquid supply pump <b>111</b> which supplies methanol in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> into the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>, a motor <b>111</b><i>m </i>which drives the liquid supply pump <b>111</b>, an air supply pump <b>116</b> which supplies external air into the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>, and a motor <b>116</b><i>m </i>which drives the air supply pump. In the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, methanol aqueous solution of high concentration of predetermined concentration, for example, concentration of 98% (95% or more and less than 100%) is supplied from the fuel cartridge <b>128</b>, and a memory (EEPROM) <b>218</b> described later is fixed to the outside of this fuel cartridge. The memory stores therein various specifications such as the ID, concentration of the methanol aqueous solution contained herein, volume of the container, and size of inlet and outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An output unit <b>202</b> comprises a switch S<b>21</b> connected to an output terminal of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>, an IV measuring unit <b>206</b> that is connected between the other end of the switch and the ground and measures the current-voltage characteristic described later, a switch S<b>22</b> connected to one end of the IV measuring unit <b>206</b>, electric power output unit <b>207</b> connected to the other end of the switch S<b>22</b>, a Schottky barrier type diode D<b>21</b> having its anode connected to the other end of the same switch S<b>22</b>, a secondary battery charge controller <b>208</b> having its input terminal connected to a cathode of the diode D<b>21</b>, a Schottky barrier type diode D<b>22</b> having its anode connected to the output terminal of the secondary battery charge controller <b>208</b> and its cathode connected to the output terminal of the electric power output unit <b>207</b>, a switch S<b>23</b> having one end connected to a cathode of this diode D<b>22</b>, and a capacitor C<b>21</b> connected between the other end of the switch S<b>23</b> and the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The IV measuring unit <b>206</b> comprises a resistor R<b>21</b> connected between the switch S<b>21</b> and the switch S<b>22</b>, a resistor R<b>20</b> connected in series to the ground at the switch S<b>22</b> side, and a switch S<b>20</b>. A variable resistor can be used as the resistor <b>20</b>. An example of variable resistor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Plural resistors <b>20</b> different in value are connected parallel to the resistor <b>21</b> and in a mutually exchangeable state. Each of the switches S<b>20</b> is connected in series to each of the resistors <b>20</b>. The other end of each switch <b>20</b> is grounded. The resistor R<b>21</b> has a small resistance which detects a current of, for example, tens of milliohms, and the resistor R<b>20</b> has a resistance which is at least 10 times larger than the resistance of the resistor R<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When measuring the current-voltage characteristic, the switch S<b>22</b> is turned off, and the corresponding switch S<b>20</b> is sequentially turned on so as to change over the plural resistors R<b>20</b>. At this time, a voltage drop is measured between the resistor R<b>20</b> and resistor R<b>21</b> corresponding to the switch S<b>20</b> in ON state, or at both ends of the resistor <b>21</b>, and the current is calculated. The resistor R<b>20</b> is changed by changing over the switch S<b>20</b>, and when an electric current flows in the resistors R<b>21</b>, R<b>20</b> and switch S<b>20</b>, the output voltage of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> can be measured, and the current-voltage characteristic is measured. The output voltage of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> is measured by a voltage detector connected between the switch S<b>21</b> and the ground, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An output voltage may be also obtained by measuring the potential difference between the anode terminal and the cathode terminal of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, the power generation assist unit <b>203</b> comprises a Schottky barrier type diode D<b>24</b> having its cathode connected to the cathode of the diode D<b>21</b> and its anode connected to an external power source, a voltage adjusting unit which drives auxiliary machine <b>211</b> having its input terminal connected to the cathode of the diode, a Schottky barrier type diode D<b>25</b> having its cathode connected to the output terminal of the voltage adjusting unit for auxiliary machine <b>211</b>, a switch S<b>24</b> having its one end connected to the anode of the diode D<b>25</b> and its other end connected to the anode of the diode D<b>22</b>, a secondary battery SB<b>1</b> connected between the other end of the switch S<b>24</b> and the ground, a liquid supply pump drive unit <b>212</b> that has its input terminal connected to the output terminal of the voltage adjusting unit for auxiliary machine <b>211</b> and moves the motor <b>111</b><i>m</i>, and an air supply pump drive unit <b>213</b> that has its input terminal connected to the output terminal of the voltage adjusting unit for auxiliary machine <b>211</b> and moves the motor <b>116</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The electric power output unit <b>207</b>, liquid supply pump drive unit <b>212</b>, and air supply pump drive unit <b>213</b> comprises DC/DC converters.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The electric controller <b>204</b> comprises a voltage regulator <b>215</b> which adjusts the voltage supplied from any one of the diodes D<b>21</b>, D<b>24</b> and D<b>25</b>, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>215</b><i>a </i>driven by the voltage regulator <b>215</b>, an analog processing unit <b>216</b> which receives analog values of the current I and voltage V measured by the IV measuring unit <b>206</b> and temperature T of methanol aqueous solution, and supplies their digital values into the CPU, a memory (EEPROM) <b>217</b> which stores various data and characteristic values, and a bus <b>219</b> which exchanges signals among the memory <b>217</b>, CPU and memory (EEPROM) <b>218</b> that is attached to the fuel cartridge <b>128</b>. The memory <b>217</b> stores the amount of the methanol aqueous solution supplied from the liquid supply pump <b>111</b>, the amount of air supplied from the air supply pump <b>116</b>, temperature, and other control information. The bus <b>219</b> is I<sup>2</sup>C bus or SM bus, and parameters stored in the memories <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> are transmitted to a host computer connected to other end of the bus. The CPU and memory <b>218</b> may not be connected by wire, but signals can be transmitted by wireless mechanism such as radio wave, light or electromagnetic coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The analog processing unit <b>216</b> has a function of processing analog values of measured voltage (V), current (I) and temperature (T), and converts these analog measured values into digital values, and supplies into the CPU <b>215</b><i>a</i>. The temperature (T) inputted in the analog processing unit <b>216</b> is the temperature measured in the cell of the DMFC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the temperature of the separator at the position of half number of the number of series unit cells. Because this separator is likely to achieve the highest temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, a starting operation of the system of the embodiment is explained. Before start, all switches S<b>21</b> to S<b>24</b> are open (OFF state). When started as shown in step S<b>501</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the CPU <b>215</b><i>a </i>controls the switch S<b>21</b> and switch S<b>24</b> in step S<b>502</b>, and closes these switches (ON state). When the switch S<b>24</b> is closed, electric power is supplied from the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> into the liquid supply pump drive unit <b>212</b> and air supply pump drive unit <b>213</b> by way of the diode D<b>25</b>. As a result, the motor <b>111</b><i>m </i>and motor <b>116</b><i>m </i>start operation, and the liquid supply pump <b>111</b> and air supply pump <b>116</b> are put in operation (step S<b>503</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The liquid supply pump <b>111</b> supplies the methanol aqueous solution of predetermined concentration in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> into the methanol supply port <b>107</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>. The air supply pump <b>116</b> supplies external air into the oxidizer supply port <b>113</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>. As the methanol aqueous solution flows in the anode fluid channel <b>109</b> and air flows in the cathode fluid channel <b>115</b>, a chemical reaction takes place, and an electromotive force is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As the electromotive force increases, the CPU <b>215</b><i>a </i>detects that the output voltage of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> is heightened as the input from the analog processing unit <b>216</b>, and the IV measuring unit <b>206</b> measures the current value flowing in the resistor R<b>21</b> and the voltage generated by this current (step S<b>504</b>). At this time, by changing over the resistor to change the resistance value from large to small, the current value changes from small to large, and by measuring the voltage at this time, a current-voltage characteristic is obtained. An example of current-voltage characteristic obtained at this time is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this diagram, reference numeral <b>31</b> is a current-voltage characteristic diagram, and <b>32</b> is a curve showing the electric power. In this electric power curve, unless the operation point is within the range of the initial value to maximum value, electric power cannot be supplied stably to an external load. Therefore, this current-voltage characteristic is investigated occasionally, and the current is monitored such that the current of the output of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> may always settle within this range.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the output current of the DMFC flows higher than this range only for a moment, the output voltage of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> may not be reset, and therefore the switch S<b>22</b> is turned off to change over so as to supply the electric power to the external load from the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> by way of the diode D<b>22</b>. In a predetermined time, the output voltage of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> is recovered, and hence by measuring the current-voltage characteristic again by the IV measuring unit <b>206</b>, the switch S<b>22</b> is turned on, and supply of electric power to the external load is changed over from the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> to the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As the variable resistor contained in the IV measuring unit <b>206</b>, for example, a circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> may be used. That is, the switch S<b>25</b> is connected in series to the load (L<b>1</b>) including the resistor and inductor, and this switch S<b>25</b> is controlled by the signal of the pulse width modulation (PWM) changing in width from large to small as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The resistor R<b>21</b> is the same as the resistor R<b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Instead of the load L<b>1</b>, a load which does not contain inductance may be also used. At this time, by varying the resistance value of the load by a signal of pulse width modulation (PWM), the load can be used as a variable resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As a result, the time width Wc of the conductive state of one period is changed from small to large, and the time width Wo of cut-off state is changed from large to small, thereby increasing the average current. By measuring the voltage value when the current value is changed from small to large, a current-voltage characteristic curve is obtained. According to the IV measuring unit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, it is advantageous that the current-voltage characteristic can be obtained by a simple structure and in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, by measuring the initial current-voltage characteristic curve, when the electromotive force of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> increases, the CPU <b>215</b><i>a </i>turns on the switch S<b>22</b> (step S<b>505</b>). When the switch S<b>22</b> is turned on, electric power is supplied to the voltage adjusting unit for auxiliary machine <b>211</b>, and the motors <b>111</b><i>m </i>and <b>116</b><i>m </i>are driven by the liquid supply pump drive unit <b>212</b> and air supply pump drive unit <b>213</b>. Therefore, by the electromotive force of the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b>, the liquid supply pump <b>111</b> and air supply pump <b>116</b> are put in action (step S<b>506</b>). In the next step S<b>507</b>, the switch S<b>24</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">On the other hand, since the switch S<b>24</b> is in the OFF state, electric power is not supplied from the secondary battery SB<b>1</b>, and the secondary battery charge controller <b>208</b> is operated through the diode D<b>21</b>, and the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> is charged.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the electric power supplied from the electric power output unit <b>207</b> becomes more than a predetermined value, the switch S<b>23</b> is turned on (step S<b>508</b>), and the electric power induced in the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> is supplied to the external load, and a stationary state is established.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">While supplying electric power to the external load, if the external load suddenly becomes large, the output voltage may be lowered for a short time, but in such a case, the electric power is supplied to the external load from the continuously-charged capacitor C<b>21</b>, so that voltage fluctuations can be suppressed. If the external load stays large longer than the period estimated above, the diode D<b>22</b> is put in action to actuate the secondary battery SB<b>1</b>, so that the electric power is also supplied to the external load from this battery (S<b>509</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When aforementioned stationary state continues, the methanol aqueous solution supplied from the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> into the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> decreases. Generally, consumption of methanol is proportional to the current flowing in the small resistor R<b>21</b>, and its duration.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the remaining methanol aqueous solution is returned from the fuel pipe <b>126</b> into the methanol aqueous solution container and recycled, the consumption of methanol is suppressed, but since the methanol aqueous solution is consumed while flowing in the anode fluid channel, the methanol concentration in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> is diluted. Accordingly, the fuel cartridge <b>128</b> containing methanol aqueous solution at predetermined concentration is fitted to the fuel supply port of the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, and methanol is supplied (step S<b>510</b>). At this time, from the memory <b>218</b> fixed to the fuel cartridge <b>128</b>, various information about the fuel cartridge such as the ID, type and concentration of methanol aqueous solution, and aperture of inlet and outlet can be transmitted to the CPU by wired or wireless mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this system, while generating power, the current-voltage characteristic is measured, for example, every hour or at a specified time. That is, checking whether or not the predetermined time has passed in step S<b>511</b>, if passed, it is checked whether or not to terminate in step S<b>512</b>, and when not terminating, the current-voltage characteristic is measured again. This operation is explained. First, the switch S<b>24</b> is turned on (step S<b>513</b>), and the liquid supply pump and air supply pump are driven by the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> (step S<b>514</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In step S<b>515</b>, the switch S<b>22</b> is turned off, and the current-voltage characteristic is measured. That is, after turning on the switch S<b>20</b> of the IV measuring unit <b>206</b>, the resistor R<b>21</b> is changed over and varied, and the current-voltage characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is measured. On the other hand, electric power is supplied to the external load from the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> through the diode D<b>22</b>, and supply of electric power to the external load is not stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Since the current-voltage characteristic changes according to the concentration of methanol aqueous solution supplied in the DMFC power generating device <b>100</b> and other circumstances, the measured current-voltage characteristic is different from the current-voltage characteristic measured upon start of power generation. In this DMFC system, however, without stopping the supply in the midst of supply of electric power to the external load, the current-voltage characteristic is measured regularly, so that the true electric power that can be supplied to the external load can be always known.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The terminating operation of the DMFC system of this embodiment is explained. To terminate the system in step S<b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> is fully charged in step S<b>516</b>. In next step S<b>517</b>, methanol aqueous solution is supplied from the fuel cartridge <b>128</b> so that the methanol concentration may be the initial concentration in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>. After this process, the switch S<b>24</b> is turned off and the liquid supply pump and air supply pump are stopped, and the DMFC system of this embodiment is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In case the secondary battery SB<b>1</b> is not fully charged upon start of this DMFC system, electric power is supplied from outside through the diode D<b>24</b>, and the motors <b>111</b><i>m</i>, <b>116</b><i>m </i>are driven by the liquid supply pump drive unit <b>212</b> and air supply pump drive unit <b>213</b> by the auxiliary machine driving voltage regulator <b>211</b>, and methanol aqueous solution and air are set into the DMFC power generating device, and power is generated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cathodes of the diodes D<b>21</b>, D<b>24</b>, D<b>25</b> are connected to the voltage regulator <b>215</b>, and electric power of the CPU <b>215</b><i>a </i>is supplied from the voltage regulator <b>215</b>, and therefore the CPU <b>215</b><i>a </i>operates always from start till end of this DMFC system.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this embodiment, the fuel cartridge <b>128</b> containing methanol aqueous solution of high concentration of about 98% is connected to the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, and this concentrated methanol aqueous solution is supplied into the container. By using such a fuel cartridge containing methanol aqueous solution in high concentration, the fuel cartridge itself can be reduced in size. As the fuel cartridge, however, it is not always required to use a cartridge containing methanol aqueous solution of a constant concentration and constant amount. Various fuel cartridges may be used, such as a large-sized fuel cartridge containing a large amount of methanol or methanol aqueous solution, or a cartridge containing methanol aqueous solution in relatively low concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The concentration and amount of methanol aqueous solution are stored in the memory <b>218</b> fixed to the fuel cartridge, and sent to the CPU or host computer together with the information stored in the memory <b>217</b>, and the supply amount of methanol aqueous solution can be adjusted by the liquid supply pump <b>111</b>. Thus, by providing the fuel cartridge with the memory <b>218</b> storing the parameters of the cartridge, fuel cartridges of different amounts or type may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The information stored in the memory <b>218</b> fixed to the fuel cartridge includes a first information about the fuel cartridge and a second information about the fuel stored in the fuel cartridge. And the main purposes of the information are prevention of accidents and detection of remaining amount.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For the first information, the manufacturing date, number of times of insertion and extraction, ID, remaining amount, and failure flag are stored. The manufacturing date is to prevent liquid leakage and accidental breakage, and aged tanks can be eliminated. The number of times of insertion and extraction is to check for deterioration of fuel supply joint and to assure the reliability of electrical contact parts for communication with information stored in the memory, and control errors due to liquid leakage or wrong information can be prevented. The ID is for eliminating pirated products (illegal copies), and preventing accidents due to improper fuel. The memory of remaining amount is to prevent accidents in which power interruption of electronic components by shortage of fuel. The memory of failure flag is to detect the fuel tank in which abnormality is detected to prevent its subsequent use, there by preventing accident.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The information about the fuel stored in the memory <b>218</b> includes the remaining amount information, full tank capacity, present amount and concentration. From the memory of full tank capacity, the relative remainder or consumption can be displayed, or the maximum driving time is known when the fuel is replenished. When the present remaining amount is stored, the remaining driving time can be calculated. For example, it is known whether enough driving time is left or not for downloading a huge amount of information, or it is determined whether a spare fuel cartridge is necessary or not. It is also possible to cooperate with suspend, hibernation or resume function, and the application in action can be protected. Further, the weight of the fuel in the fuel cartridge can be stored in the memory <b>218</b>. And the number of times of replenishment can be stored when one replenishing amount from the fuel cartridge may be constant.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">By storing the methanol concentration in the memory <b>218</b>, a fuel cartridge of a different concentration can be used, and when operated in a high temperature climate, for example, a fuel of low concentration is used, or in a low temperature climate, a fuel cartridge containing methanol aqueous solution of high concentration is used, and thus the fuel cartridges can be exchanged depending on the environments.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Similarly, by providing the system with the memory <b>217</b> storing data related to various parameters, the system itself can be replaced, and a flexible system can be built up.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A specific example of information stored in the memory <b>218</b> fixed to the fuel cartridge is described in detail. The memory <b>218</b> comprises a ROM region in which the information is fixed at the time of shipping and cannot be changed, and a RAM region in which the information can be rewritten during use, and each capacity is 0.5 k bits. Items stored in the ROM region include the manufacturer's name, cartridge name, manufacturing date, maximum capacity of cartridge, fuel concentration, fuel type, maximum number of times of insertion and extraction, maximum liquid supply capacity, minimum operating temperature, maximum operating temperature, and spare items.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The manufacturer's name is, for example, the name registered in the standardization society such as ASCII, and is assigned with a memory capacity of 12 bytes for 16 characters. The cartridge name includes the type name, manufacturing type number, product type number, and lot number, and is assigned with a memory capacity of 16 bytes for 16 characters. The manufacturing date is mainly used for quality control, and a cartridge of an old manufacturing date is rejected, if installed, to prevent accident. The manufacturing date consists of 12 bits of year, 4 bits of month, and 8 bits of day, and a total of 24 bits (3 bytes) is assigned as memory capacity. For example, if the manufacturing date is Dec. 31, 2000, it is 011111010000110000011111 in binary notation, and 7d0c1f in hexadecimal notation. By assigning 3 bytes for this item, the dates can be stored to a maximum of Dec. 31, 4095.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The cartridge maximum capacity refers to the maximum capacity of the fuel to be contained in the fuel cartridge. By assigning this item with 4 bytes in the unit of microliter (μL), a capacity can be displayed in a range from 0 to 429,496,729 μL (about 429 liters). By specifying the item of fuel concentration, a fuel cartridge of a different concentration can be used. In this item, by keeping 1 byte in the unit of 0.1 mol/L, the concentration can be displayed in a range of 0 to 25.0 mol/L. By this item, since the maximum capacity of the fuel can be detected, the remaining driving time or remaining electric power can be detected by referring to the value of other item.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">By the item of fuel type, for example, specifying 0 for water and 1 for methanol, other fuel than methanol can be also distinguished. By assigning this item with 1 byte, up to 256 fuel types can be distinguished from 0 to 255.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The maximum number of times of insertion and extraction can be change depending on the structure of junction of fuel cartridge, thereby avoiding risk due to abnormally frequent insertion and extraction operations. In the unit of number of times, when this item is assigned with 2 bytes, the number of times of insertion and extraction can be predetermined from 1 to 65,535 times, and when predetermined at 65,535, for example, it is assumed to be infinite. In the case of one-time disposal fuel cartridge, this item is set at 1, and use of plural times is prohibited to assure safety. The maximum liquid supply capacity is stored in consideration of the capacity of the liquid supply mechanism having a fuel tank. Assigning this time with 2 bytes, in the unit of 10 μL/min, the maximum liquid supply capacity can be stored up to 655,350 μL/min (about 0.65 L/min). In the case of a fuel tank without liquid supply mechanism, this value is set at 0, and the type of the tank can be determined by this value.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The minimum operating temperature can be predetermined in a range of 0 to −128° C., for example, when 1 byte is assigned in the unit of degree centigrade, and liquid supply failure due to freezing of fuel in the fuel cartridge can be prevented. The maximum operating temperature can be predetermined in a range of 0 to 127° C., for example, when 1 byte is assigned in the unit of degree centigrade, and ignition or smoking of fuel in the fuel cartridge can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If a total of 64 bytes can be provided in the ROM region of the memory <b>218</b>, aside from these items, 17 bytes can be held of spare items. Among spare items, for example, one bit may be used for parity check of the information of the items, and unauthorized alteration of items can be detected. The spare item in the ROM region can be used, together with the spare item in the RAM region, as information for distinguishing the ID, pirated parts, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The RAM region in the memory <b>218</b> stores, for example, the remaining fuel capacity, number of times of insertion and extraction of fuel cartridge, duration of use, failure flag, and spare items. These items can be rewritten when the fuel cartridge is inserted in or extracted from the methanol aqueous solution container.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The remaining capacity shows the remaining capacity of fuel at the time of use, and is assigned with 4 bytes in the unit of microliters (μL), and the remaining capacity can be stored in a range of 0 to 4,294,967,295 μL (about 429 liters). In the mechanism of the fuel cell, if only the number of times of fuel supplying is counted, the control microcomputer converts the count value into the consumption of fuel, and by subtracting from the cartridge maximum capacity stored in the ROM region or the value of this item stored before use, the remaining capacity can be calculated, and this value is stored again as the value of this item. The value of the remaining capacity can be expressed also in percentage as relative capacity, by referring to the cartridge maximum capacity stored in the ROM region.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the fuel cartridge is replenished with fuel, the remaining capacity value is updated by adding the replenishing amount. By this function, an arbitrary amount of fuel can be added. When filling with fuel by a predetermined replenishing device, the remaining capacity of the device is read from the memory, and the replenishing amount and remaining capacity can be calculated and stored accurately. If replenished with fuel illegally, the memory content is not updated and the remaining capacity becomes 0, and therefore illegal use can be prevented and stable action can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The number of times of inserted and extracting the fuel cartridge is stored, and when this value reaches the maximum number of times of insertion and extraction stored in the ROM, the corresponding fuel cartridge cannot be used any longer. The number of times of insertion and extraction is counted by adding +1 by the control microcomputer every time the fuel cartridge is extracted and inserted. The unit of this time is the number of times, and by assigning with 2 bytes, the number of times of insertion and extraction can be stored in a range of 0 to 65,535 times, and the maximum value of 65,535 may be set to be infinite. When the maximum value is set to 65,535, the fuel cartridge can be recycled many times.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The operation time is the cumulative time of the fuel cartridge installed in the DMFC power generating device, and judges and displays the exchange of the fuel cartridge by the fuel microcomputer from the temperature history, state of use, manufacturing date, fuel temperature and fuel type. When this item is assigned with 4 bytes, for example, in the units of hours (h), the operation time can be stored for a maximum of 65,535 h (about 7 and a half years). The fuel cartridge may be recycled, but by determining the upper limit (maximum operation time) of the operation time and storing in the ROM region, the limit of the recycling cartridge may be determined by comparing this value with the operation time.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The failure flag item stores the history of various abnormal states. When this item is assigned with 8 bytes, a maximum of 64 bits, that is, 64 types of abnormal state can be stored. As an abnormal state, for example, if the fuel methanol is not delivered by operating the fuel cell, or an abnormal amount of fuel is delivered, it can be stored as a specific bit of a failure flag. Since the fuel stored in the fuel cartridge is usually a methanol aqueous solution of high concentration, storage of history of this failure flag is very important from the viewpoint of safety. When a capacity of 64 bytes is assured in the RAM region, the remaining 46 bytes can be used for the spare items.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In this embodiment, all items above are stored in the memory <b>218</b> fixed to the fuel cartridge <b>128</b>. However, in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, too, a memory such as an EEPROM can be fixed. Thus, when a memory is installed in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, it is also divided into the ROM region and RAM region, and all of these items, or specific items such as container manufacturing date, maximum liquid supply capacity, and operation time may be stored in the memory. By installing the memory also in the methanol aqueous solution container and storing the attributes of the container, it is easier to replace the methanol aqueous solution container itself.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this embodiment, the methanol aqueous solution not reacted in the DMFC power generating unit, and water, steam and carbon dioxide passing through the cathode passage are all returned to the methanol aqueous solution container, and methanol is supplied from the fuel cartridge. However, this is not always necessary in the invention. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a fuel cartridge <b>61</b> containing spare methanol aqueous solution and a methanol aqueous solution container <b>62</b> are integrally composed, and when supplying methanol aqueous solution into the DMFC power generating device, spare methanol aqueous solution is put into the container <b>62</b>, or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the methanol aqueous solution left over in the DMFC power generating device <b>63</b> is returned to a methanol aqueous solution container <b>64</b>, and water and steam generated by chemical reaction during power generation are condensed by a condenser <b>66</b>, and only water can be returned to the fuel cartridge <b>65</b> and methanol aqueous solution container <b>64</b>. Further, such a fuel cartridge <b>65</b> can be integrated with the methanol aqueous solution container <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the explanation of the embodiment, electric memories are used, but any other memories may be used as long as the information can be stored, and the information may be stored in a magnetic recording medium, or stored by mechanical method such as punching, notching or marking, and such mechanical memories are also included as memories in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the invention, to start the pump in the first place, a secondary battery is used, and by using the secondary battery, when electric power is supplied to the load from the power generating device, it can be charged, and the time until independent charging can be extended. However, in the invention, the battery is not limited to the secondary battery, and generally any auxiliary battery may be used until a sufficient power is generated by the power generating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Other aspects of the invention are a direct methanol fuel cell system comprising a power generating unit including an anode electrode, a cathode electrode, and an electrolyte layer provided between the anode electrode and the cathode electrode, a fuel tank for storing a fuel containing methanol to be supplied to the anode electrode, and a fuel cartridge including a spare fuel tank for storing the fuel to be replenished in the fuel tank, and a harmful substance trap member for capturing harmful substance in the gas in the fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">An embodiment of the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) system in another aspect of the invention is explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the same members as explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are identified with the same reference numerals, and a duplicate explanation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">This DMFC system further comprises a cathode recovery container <b>131</b>. This cathode recovery container <b>131</b> is connected to a cathode piping <b>132</b>, and is also connected to a methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> by way of a cathode piping <b>132</b>. The cathode piping <b>132</b> has a check valve <b>133</b> to prevent counterflow of the liquid in the cathode recovery container <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the cathode recovery container <b>131</b>, water is contained before start of power generation, and the exhaust pipe <b>127</b> is connected below the liquid level, and hence the gas exhausted from the cathode electrode is bubbled in water. From the cathode electrode, unreacted methanol, water, air, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and formic acid are discharged, and part of formaldehyde and formic acid are bubbled and dissolved in the water in the cathode recovery container <b>131</b>. The water in which the cathode product is dissolved is collected in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> from the cathode recovery container <b>131</b> by way of the piping <b>132</b>. Along with the recovery, the gas in the cathode recovery container <b>131</b> is also sent into the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> is fixed, for example, in the inner wall of the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>. The gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> is formed of porous material such as nonwoven fabric. The gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> passes only the gas collected in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A second fuel cartridge <b>136</b> includes a spare fuel tank <b>134</b> and a harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> externally attached to the spare fuel tank <b>134</b>. The second fuel cartridge <b>136</b> is detachably connected to the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>. In the spare fuel tank <b>134</b>, methanol aqueous solution is contained. The methanol concentration of the methanol aqueous solution in the spare fuel tank <b>134</b> is preferred to be higher than the methanol concentration of the methanol aqueous solution in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b>, and specifically in a range of 95% or more to less than 100%. The spare fuel tank <b>134</b> is connected to the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> by way of a liquid supply pipe <b>137</b>. When the methanol concentration of the methanol aqueous solution in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> is diluted, methanol aqueous solution is supplied from the spare fuel tank <b>134</b>, and the methanol concentration of the methanol aqueous solution in the methanol aqueous solution container <b>110</b> can be maintained at a constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> is connected to the gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> by way of an air supply pipe <b>138</b>. An example of the harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> is explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> includes a trap material container <b>140</b> (made of resin such as acrylic plate) having a gas exhaust port <b>139</b>. In the trap material container <b>140</b>, a gas pipe (gas diffusion passage) <b>142</b> having a gas inlet port <b>141</b> is provided. The gas pipe <b>142</b> is made of resin such as acrylic plate, and has a meandering shape. To prevent the gas exhausted from the gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> from being released outside through the gas exhaust port <b>139</b> directly without diffusing in the harmful substance trap material, the terminal end of the gas pipe <b>142</b> does not communicate with the gas exhaust port <b>139</b>. In the gas pipe <b>142</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, plural gas diffusion holes <b>143</b> are opened. A harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> fills up the gap between the inner wall of the trap material container <b>140</b> and the outer wall of the gas pipe <b>142</b>. The harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> contains at least one powder of active carbon and silica gel. In particular, active carbon is preferred. This is because many functional groups such as hydroxyl group and carboxyl group are present on the surface of the active carbon, and organic substances such as formaldehyde and formic acid can be trapped easily.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">By the harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> having such structure, the gas passing through the gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> is introduced into the gas pipe <b>142</b> from the gas inlet port <b>141</b> through the air supply pipe <b>138</b>, and is diffused into the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> from the gas diffusion holes <b>143</b>. Organic substances such as formaldehyde and formic acid are easily adsorbed on the active carbon of the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b>. As a result, harmful substances such as formaldehyde and formic acid can be removed from the exhaust gas. The exhaust gas being rid of harmful substances is released outside through the gas exhaust port <b>139</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">When methanol aqueous solution is used up in the spare fuel tank <b>134</b> of the second fuel cartridge <b>136</b>, it is replaced with a new fuel cartridge, and in this fuel cartridge, a sufficient amount of fuel is contained in the spare fuel tank, and the harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> is replenished with unadsorbed harmful substance trap material <b>144</b>, so that the harmful substance trap member <b>135</b> can be always maintained in the harmful substance adsorbing state by replacing the fuel cartridge. As a result, release of harmful substance to outside from the fuel cell system can be avoided, and the impact on the environment is reduced, and safety for the human body may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The replenishing amount of the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> is preferred to be set so that the trap material <b>144</b> may be break through when the methanol aqueous solution is nearly used up in the spare fuel tank <b>134</b>. As a result, the wasteful amount of the trap material <b>144</b> may be kept to a minimum, and the adsorption capacity of the trap material <b>144</b> may be maintained during the operation of the DMFC system.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a meandering pipe is used as the gas pipe <b>142</b>, but the pipe shape is not particularly limited as long as the gas diffusion speed into the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> may be enhanced. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, two or more branch pipes <b>146</b> may be connected to a main piping <b>145</b> having a gas inlet port <b>141</b>. Gas diffusion holes are preferred to be opened in the pipings <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. To prevent the gas exhausted from the gas-liquid separator <b>129</b> from releasing outside from the gas exhaust port <b>139</b> without diffusing in the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b>, the terminal ends of the pipings <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> do not communicate with the gas discharge port <b>139</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">On the outer surface of the spare fuel tank <b>134</b> of the second fuel cartridge <b>136</b> or on the outer surface of the trap material container <b>140</b> of the harmful substance trap member <b>135</b>, the memory (EEPROM) <b>218</b> can be fixed. By recording the parameters having the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b> (such as trap member replenishing amount) in the memory <b>218</b>, in addition to the parameters of the spare fuel tank <b>134</b>, replacement of fuel cartridge can be indicated at the timing of breaking through the harmful substance trap material <b>144</b>.</p>
