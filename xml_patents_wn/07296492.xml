<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to animated toys, and more particularly to a toy including a Geneva mechanism providing for intermittent reciprocal motion of moveable parts of the toy.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years animation in children's toys has become very popular. Animated toys include a system for generating motion, typically driven by small rotating motors that connect to gears, pulleys or levers. Some animation systems for animated toys include a Geneva mechanism designed to produce an intermittent motion, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,764,141; 5,310,377; and 5,405,142, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to animated toys in which parts of the toy undergo intermittent reciprocal motion. This motion is driven by one or more motors, each interconnected to a skeletal structure of the toy through various gears, pulleys, and cables. At least one of the gears pulls on one of the cables to in turn pull on the portion of the skeletal structure that is to be moved, and that gear may cooperate with other gears to have an engaged position and one or more non-rotating positions, as may be found in a Geneva gear mechanism. When the gear is in the engaged position, a motor may rotate the gear to actuate a discrete motion of a part of the toy, and when the gear is in a non-rotating position, the gear may hold that part of the toy in a fixed position, even as other gears driven by the same motor actuate other motions within the toy. Combining a series of these gears, each producing different discrete motions, creates an animated toy capable of complex movements with a lesser number of motors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This present invention will be more readily understood after a consideration of the drawings and the detailed description of the preferred embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A children's toy according to the present invention is indicated generally at <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Toy <b>10</b> may be a doll, or other figure resembling an animal or make believe creature. Toy <b>10</b> includes a body <b>12</b> and an animation mechanism <b>14</b>. Animation mechanism <b>14</b> is adapted to move various parts of body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Body <b>12</b> may include a head <b>16</b>, eyes <b>18</b>, a mouth <b>20</b>, arms <b>22</b> and legs (not shown). Animation mechanism <b>14</b> includes a skeletal structure <b>24</b>, a motor assembly <b>26</b>, pulleys <b>28</b>, and cables <b>30</b>. As discussed below animation mechanism <b>14</b> provides toy <b>10</b> with motion, such as a turning of head <b>16</b> back and forth, an opening and closing of eyes <b>18</b> or mouth <b>20</b>, and a back and forth movement of arms <b>22</b> or the legs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Motor assembly <b>26</b> includes at least one motor <b>32</b>, a gear assembly <b>34</b>, and a battery pack (not shown). Gear assembly <b>34</b> includes at least one gear system <b>36</b>, and may be adapted to attach to an output <b>38</b> of motor assembly <b>26</b> or be incorporated into motor assembly <b>26</b>. Each motor <b>32</b> of motor assembly <b>26</b> is connected to at least one gear system <b>36</b>. As motor <b>32</b> rotates, gear system <b>36</b> rotates, thereby actuating movements in toy <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Gear system <b>36</b> includes a drive gear <b>40</b> and a driven gear <b>42</b>. Motor <b>32</b> is adapted to rotate both clockwise and counterclockwise and configured to induce the same clockwise and counterclockwise rotation in drive gear <b>40</b>. Drive gear <b>40</b> is adapted to selectively impart rotation in driven gear <b>42</b>. Rotation of driven gear <b>42</b>, being connected to cable <b>30</b> of animation mechanism <b>14</b>, induces motion in a selected part of the toy's body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that motor assembly <b>26</b> and gear systems <b>36</b> are shown schematically and motor assembly <b>26</b> can include a plurality of motors <b>32</b>. Each motor <b>32</b> may be adapted to drive a plurality of stacked drive gears <b>40</b>, positioned such that drive gears <b>40</b> actuate a corresponding plurality of driven gears <b>42</b> located at discrete angular positions along the path of rotation of the stack of drive gears <b>40</b>. Each of driven gears <b>42</b> is adapted to actuate a discrete reciprocal movement within a selected part of the toy's body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When drive gear <b>40</b> sweeps through the angular location associated with a particular movement of toy <b>10</b>, drive gear <b>40</b> intermeshes with driven gear <b>42</b> causing cable <b>30</b> to move, thereby actuating motion in a part of toy <b>10</b>. These movements include, but are not limited to, rotation of the toy's head <b>16</b>, opening and closing of the toy's eyes <b>18</b>, movement of the toy's mouth <b>20</b>, back and forth motion of arms <b>22</b> and corresponding back and forth motion of the legs. While cables <b>30</b> are shown schematically linking skeletal structure <b>24</b> to gear system <b>36</b> it should be understood that any suitable linkage structure could be used including belts, chains, rods, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Gear system <b>36</b> produces an intermittent motion similar to the Geneva mechanisms that are known in the art. Gear system <b>36</b> has two configurations, an engaged configuration and a non-rotating configuration. In the engaged configuration, drive gear <b>40</b> is intermeshed with driven gear <b>42</b> and rotation of drive gear <b>40</b> causes rotation in driven gear <b>42</b>. In the non-rotating configuration drive gear <b>40</b> slidingly engages driven gear <b>42</b> such that rotation of drive gear <b>40</b>, not only does not cause rotation in driven gear <b>42</b>, but also prevents the driven gear from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present embodiment of gear system <b>36</b> drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> are made of a plastic material. It should be understood that any suitable material may be used to form the gears of gear system <b>36</b> including metal alloys, polymers, ceramics, and composites of these materials depending upon the load characteristics of the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Gear system <b>36</b> in the engaged configuration rotates in a first direction <b>50</b> and a second direction <b>52</b>. When drive gear <b>40</b> rotates in first direction <b>50</b>, driven gear <b>42</b> rotates in response causing cable <b>30</b> to move arm <b>22</b> in the direction indicated at <b>50</b>′. Correspondingly, when drive gear <b>40</b> rotates in a second direction <b>52</b>, driven gear <b>42</b> causes cable <b>30</b> to move arm <b>22</b> in the opposite direction <b>52</b>′. Thus, in the engaged configuration, gear system <b>36</b> is adapted to move a corresponding body part, in this case arm <b>22</b>, in either a first direction <b>50</b>′ or an opposed second direction <b>52</b>′. By contrast, when the gear system is in the non-rotating configuration the corresponding body part is at rest or not moving.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the non-rotating configuration, drive gear <b>40</b> slidingly contacts driven gear <b>42</b>. Thus, rotation of drive gear <b>40</b> in either direction while gear system <b>36</b> is in the non-rotating configuration induces no motion in driven gear <b>42</b>. Because driven gear <b>42</b> is not moving it does not cause motion in any of the body parts of toy <b>10</b>. Additionally, in the non-rotating configuration the driven gear is prevented from rotating by the sliding contact between drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the operation of an embodiment of gear system <b>36</b>, shown in the engaged configuration. Drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> are adapted to rotate with respect to one another in this configuration. Drive gear <b>40</b> includes a drive cam structure <b>44</b> and drive gear teeth <b>46</b>. Driven gear <b>42</b> includes a driven cam structure <b>48</b> and driven teeth <b>50</b>. Drive cam structure <b>44</b> is adapted to cooperate with driven cam structure <b>48</b> and interacts to selectively control the configuration of gear system <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Drive cam structure <b>44</b> includes a cam recess region <b>52</b>, which is adapted to cooperate with a cam lobe portion <b>54</b> of driven cam structure <b>48</b>. Drive cam structure <b>44</b> further includes extended drive teeth <b>56</b>, which are formed from a portion of the set of drive teeth <b>46</b> positioned along a portion of the nominal perimeter of drive gear <b>40</b> located within cam recess region <b>52</b>. Cam lobe portion <b>54</b> may include cam lobe teeth <b>58</b>, which are formed from a portion of the set of driven teeth <b>50</b> that extend axially further than the rest of the set of drive teeth <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> are designed to engage corresponding extended drive teeth <b>56</b>. This axially extended engagement between the extended drive teeth <b>56</b> and cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> forms additional bearing contact between drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> which helps to keep gears <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> in alignment under loading. Cam recess region <b>52</b> includes alignment guide surfaces <b>60</b>, which are adapted to interact with cam lobe portion <b>54</b> and align driven teeth <b>50</b> with drive teeth <b>46</b>. Alignment guide surfaces <b>60</b> also align extended drive teeth <b>56</b> with cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> as gear system <b>36</b> transitions between the engaged configuration and the non-rotating configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Driven cam structure <b>48</b> further includes bearing surface regions <b>62</b> and drive cam structure <b>44</b> further includes a drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> also referred to as sliding surface <b>64</b>. Driven gear <b>42</b> is prevented from rotating in either of the non-rotating configurations, when drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> contacts either of driven cam bearing surface regions <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> of gear system <b>36</b> are shown in the non-rotating configuration. Gear system <b>36</b> may have more than one non-rotating configuration. In any of the non-rotating configurations the sliding engagement of drive cam structure <b>44</b> with driven cam structure <b>48</b> prevents driven gear <b>42</b> from rotating. That is to say that drive gear <b>40</b> rotates and driven gear <b>42</b> remains stationary. Drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> and a perimeter flange <b>66</b> of drive cam bearing structure <b>44</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alignment guide surfaces <b>60</b> and the set of extended drive teeth <b>56</b>, which are longer axially than the remaining drive teeth <b>46</b>, are shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alignment guide surface <b>60</b> guides cam lobe portion <b>54</b> into notch <b>52</b>. Cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> engage extended drive teeth <b>56</b> as cam lobe portion <b>54</b> enters notch <b>52</b>. Drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> includes a surface extension region <b>68</b>, best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, which is configured to increase the available surface area for contact between drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> while gear system <b>36</b> is in a non-rotating configuration. An arcuate shaped perimeter rim <b>70</b>, shown dashed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, forms a portion of the surface extension region <b>68</b> and extends axially from the edge of drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b>, providing still more surface area to help maintain alignment in gear system <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> slides along driven cam-bearing surface region <b>62</b> at a contact area defined by the area of the overlapping surfaces. Arcuate perimeter rim <b>70</b> increases the contact area between drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> and corresponding bearing surface region <b>62</b> located on driven cam structure <b>48</b> of driven gear <b>42</b>. The increased contact area between drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> improves the alignment of the two gears and helps prevent binding. The interaction of drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> and driven cam-bearing surface regions <b>62</b> aid in maintaining alignment of drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b>, preventing driven gear <b>42</b> from rotating when drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> is in contact with either of driven cam-bearing surface regions <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As discussed above in addition to bearing surface regions <b>62</b>, drive cam structure <b>44</b> includes cam lobe portion <b>54</b> adapted to interact with cam recess region <b>52</b>. Bearing surface regions <b>62</b> interact with drive cam bearing surface <b>64</b> when gear system <b>36</b> is in any of the non-rotating configurations. As previously discussed, cam lobe portion <b>54</b> of driven cam structure <b>48</b> may include cam lobe teeth <b>58</b>. Cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> are formed from a portion of the set of driven teeth <b>50</b>, which extend axially farther than the remaining driven teeth <b>50</b> of the set, best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Drive gear <b>40</b> rotates through a maximum predetermined angular sweep before reversing direction. Drive gear <b>40</b> should not rotate beyond a maximum amount of 360 degrees, before reversing the direction of rotation. Drive gear <b>40</b> may rotate less than 360 degrees before reversing direction, as desired. The maximum amount of rotation prevents drive teeth <b>46</b> from binding against driven gear <b>42</b> and possibly damaging gear system <b>36</b> from over rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When gear system <b>36</b> is in either of the non-rotation configurations, drive gear <b>40</b> can be rotating toward engagement with driven gear <b>42</b> or away from engagement with driven gear <b>42</b>. As drive gear <b>40</b> rotates toward engagement with driven gear <b>42</b>, first, drive teeth <b>46</b> move into contact with driven teeth <b>50</b>. Then cam lobe portion <b>54</b> slides along alignment guide surface <b>60</b> aligning cam lobe teeth <b>58</b> with extended drive teeth portion <b>56</b> of cam recess notch <b>52</b>. As the drive teeth <b>46</b> engage the driven teeth <b>50</b>, and cam lobe teeth <b>54</b> engage drive teeth portion <b>56</b>, counter rotation between drive gear <b>40</b> and driven gear <b>42</b> occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Drive teeth <b>46</b> are adapted to impart a predetermined amount of angular rotation to driven gear <b>42</b>. The maximum amount of angular rotation of driven gear <b>42</b> may be 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The rotation of driven gear <b>42</b> actuates movement in a part of toy <b>10</b>, by pulling cable <b>30</b>, which is attached to a portion of skeletal structure <b>24</b>, around rotating pulley <b>28</b> to move a part of body <b>12</b>. The movement of cable <b>30</b> exerts a force on the portion of skeletal structure <b>24</b> that causes the portion of the body of toy <b>10</b> supported by that portion of skeletal structure <b>24</b> to move.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, gear system <b>36</b> can be described as twin interengaged, motion coupled, rotors <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. Twin rotors <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are operatively mounted for juxtaposed intermittent rotation. Each rotor <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> includes a toothed region <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>, which lies along an arc that is less than a full circle, and each rotor <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> includes a sliding surface region <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, which includes a portion that lies substantially outside the arc toothed region.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Rotors <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are operatively positioned relative to one another in a manner, which enables two different characters of interengaged relative rotation motion. The first character involves toothed region to toothed region driving interengagement, wherein the twin rotors counter rotate relative to one another with a first rotor driving the other rotor. The first character of interengaged relative rotation motion occurs at a predefined sweep of angular orientation between twin rotors <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second character involving sliding surface to sliding surface non-driving interengagement, wherein the first rotor rotates and the other rotor is stationary. The second character of interengaged relative rotation motion is achieved at two different angular orientation of the second or other rotor. The two angular orientations of the second rotor are spaced apart on either side of the angular sweep that is predefined for the first character of interengaged relative rotation motion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The toothed regions of the rotors include portions that extend axially across a common plane, which is spaced generally normal to the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the gear system is shown, generally indicated at <b>236</b>. Gear system <b>236</b> includes a drive gear <b>240</b> and a driven gear <b>242</b>. Drive gear <b>240</b> includes drive teeth <b>246</b> and a drive cam structure <b>244</b>. Driven gear <b>242</b> includes driven teeth <b>250</b> and a driven cam structure <b>248</b>. Drive cam structure <b>244</b> includes a cam recess region <b>252</b>, alignment guide surfaces <b>260</b>, a drive cam bearing surface <b>264</b> and a perimeter flange <b>266</b>. Driven cam structure <b>248</b> includes driven cam bearing surface regions <b>262</b>, and a cam lobe portion <b>254</b>. Driven cam bearing surfaces <b>262</b> each incorporate a guide surface notch <b>268</b>. Cam lobe portion <b>254</b> includes cam lobe teeth <b>258</b> adapted to engage corresponding drive teeth <b>246</b> of drive gear <b>240</b>. The operational characteristics of this embodiment of the present invention are similar to that previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 13</figref>, operational movement of gear structure <b>236</b> is shown. First in the engaged configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, then transitioning between the engaged configuration and one of the non-rotating configurations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and finally, in one of the non-rotating configurations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. It should be understood that rotation in the opposite direction would place gear system <b>236</b> in the other non-rotating configuration, in which driven gear <b>242</b> is substantially 180 degrees rotated from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the engaged configuration, cam lobe <b>254</b> is interacting with cam recess region <b>252</b> and cam lobe teeth <b>258</b> are intermeshing with drive teeth <b>246</b> causing driven gear <b>242</b> to counter rotate from drive gear <b>240</b> and actuating a discrete motion in a portion of toy <b>10</b> by moving cable <b>30</b> that connects to and actuates a portion of skeletal structure <b>24</b> that supports that portion of toy <b>10</b>. In this engaged configuration, a reversal of direction of drive gear <b>240</b> will change the direction of motion of the moving portion of toy <b>10</b>. Thus, the reciprocal motion is achieved by a change in the direction of rotation of drive gear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As drive gear <b>240</b> continues to rotate, alignment guide surfaces <b>260</b> engage guide surface notch <b>268</b> and driven gear <b>242</b> begins to disengage from drive gear <b>240</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this configuration, a reversal of direction of the drive gear will begin to reengage drive gear <b>240</b> and driven gear <b>242</b>. The direction of motion of the moving portion of toy <b>10</b> will reverse direction. In this transitional state the corresponding motion that is being induced in a portion of toy <b>10</b> is approaching it's final, or extreme position. By final or extreme position it is meant that the portion of toy <b>10</b> will not move farther in the direction of motion caused by the gear system <b>236</b> causing the motion. Reversing the direction of rotation of gear system <b>236</b> will cause that portion of toy <b>10</b> to begin to move in an opposed direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Finally, as drive gear bearing surface <b>264</b> engages one of driven gear bearing surface regions <b>262</b>, driven gear <b>242</b> is prevented from rotating by the sliding engagement of drive gear bearing surface <b>264</b> and driven gear bearing surface region <b>262</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In this configuration a reversal in direction of drive gear <b>240</b> will have no effect on driven gear <b>242</b> until, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, cam lobe portion <b>254</b> starts to engage aligning surface <b>260</b> and drive teeth <b>246</b> start to engage driven teeth <b>250</b> and gear system <b>236</b> begins the transition between one of the non-rotation configurations and the engaged configuration.</p>
