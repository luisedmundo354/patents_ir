<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an organic EL (electroluminescence) device, and more particularly, to a hole injection layer of an organic EL device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an organic EL (electroluminescence) device, when electric charges are injected to an organic emitting layer formed between the cathode and anode, hole and electron make a pair, and the pair of hole and electron annihilate, thereby generating light. The organic EL device has been attracted attention as the next generation display device in that it has low driving voltage and low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, the related art organic EL device and method for manufacturing the same will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the related art organic EL device. Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the anode <b>2</b> as a first electrode is formed on a transparent substrate <b>1</b>. At this time, the anode <b>2</b> is formed of ITO (indium-tin-oxide). Then, an HIL (hole injection layer) <b>3</b> is formed on the anode <b>2</b>. In this case, the HIL <b>3</b> is usually formed of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Subsequently, an HTL (hole transport layer) <b>4</b> is formed on the HIL <b>3</b>. The HTL <b>4</b> is formed of N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine(TPD) or 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl -amino]biphenyl (NPD).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, an organic emitting layer <b>5</b> is formed on the HIL <b>4</b>. At this time, a dopant may be added at needed. Then, an ETL (electron transport layer) <b>6</b> and an EIL (electron injecting layer) <b>7</b> are sequentially formed on the organic emitting layer <b>5</b>. The EIL <b>7</b> is formed of LiF or Li<sub>2</sub>O. After that, the cathode <b>8</b> as a second electrode is formed on the EIL <b>7</b> so that the manufacturing process of the organic EL device is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the related art organic EL device has the following disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The related art organic EL device has problems of low efficiency and short life span. When driving the related art organic EL device at a high voltage current, the thermal stress generates between the anode <b>2</b> and the HIL <b>3</b>. Thus, the life span of device becomes short due to the thermal stress.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, since the organic material used for the HIL <b>3</b> has great motility of the hole, a hole-electron charge balance is lost so that quantum efficiency is lowered. That is, in case of the organic EL device requiring the low voltage driving, it is necessary to improve the quantum efficiency for the increase of efficiency. In this respect, the organic material used for the related art HIL is not suitable for improving the quantum efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an organic EL device that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device to obtain great efficiency and long life span.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the meantime, the HIL <b>13</b> may be formed of any one of halide compound or oxide compound selected from 1A, 2A, 3A and 4A groups of the periodic table. At this time, the halide compound may be LiF, NaF, KF, RbF, CsF or FrF. Also, the oxide compound may be Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, BeO, MgO, CaO, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Meanwhile, the HIL <b>13</b> may be formed of at least one first-layer of an organic material, and at least one second-layer of an inorganic material. In this state, the first and second layers are alternately deposited. Also, each of the first and second layers is formed at a thickness of approx. 0.1 nm to 10 nm. Simultaneously, the HIL <b>13</b> is formed at a total thickness of approx. 0.1 nm to 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, the HIL <b>13</b> may be formed of a mixture of at least one selected from organic materials and at least one selected from inorganic materials. That is, the HIL <b>13</b> is formed in a method of mixing the organic and inorganic materials by co-deposition. In this case, the inorganic material is at 1-90% of the mixture. At this time, the HIL <b>13</b> is maintained at the total thickness of approx. 0.1 nm to 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In case of the mixture of the organic and inorganic materials, an organic material composition X value may have a gradient at a thickness direction, or an inorganic material composition Y value may have a gradient at a thickness direction. That is, the organic material composition X value obtains X=0 at an interface with the anode <b>12</b>, and obtains X=1 at an interface with an HTL (hole transport layer) <b>14</b>, thereby maintaining 1&gt;X&gt;0 between the interface with the anode <b>12</b> and the interface with the HTL <b>14</b>. Also, the inorganic material composition Y value obtains Y=0 at an interface with the anode <b>12</b>, and obtains Y=1 at an interface with the HTL <b>14</b>, thereby maintaining 1&gt;Y&gt;0 between the interface with the anode <b>12</b> and the interface with the HTL <b>14</b>. At this time, it is required to maintain the total thickness of the HIL <b>13</b> in the range of approx. 0.1 nm to 300 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the HIL <b>13</b> is formed of the mixture of the organic and inorganic materials. Thus, it is possible to decrease the thermal stress between the HIL <b>13</b> and the anode <b>12</b>, and to maintain a hole-electron charge balance according as motility of hole is decreased, thereby obtaining great efficiency and long life span in the organic EL device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the organic material of the HIL <b>13</b> is used of NPD(4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl), and the inorganic material of the HIL <b>13</b> is used of LiF. At this time, the composition ratio of NPD to LiF is 5 to 1. Also, the HIL <b>13</b> is formed at a thickness of approx. 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Subsequently, the HTL <b>14</b> is formed on the HIL <b>13</b>. The HTL <b>14</b> is formed of N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine(TPD) or 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPD). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the HTL <b>14</b> may be formed in a dual-layered structure having first and second HTLs <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Or, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the HTL <b>14</b> may be formed in a single-layered structure. If the HTL <b>14</b> has the two layers, the respective layers are formed of different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first HTL <b>14</b><i>a </i>is formed of NPD (4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl) at a thickness of approx. 35 nm. Thereon, the second HTL <b>14</b><i>b </i>is formed of NPD ((4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl) at a thickness of approx. 40 nm. After that, an organic emitting layer <b>15</b> is formed on the HTL <b>14</b> at a thickness of approx. 25 nm. In this case, a dopant may be added at needed. For green emission, Coumine derivative (C545T) is doped to Alq3(8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum) at approx. 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, an ETL (electron transport layer) <b>16</b> and an EIL (electron injecting layer) <b>17</b> are sequentially formed on the organic emitting layer <b>15</b>. The ETL is formed of Alq3(8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum) at a thickness of approx. 35 nm, and the EIL <b>17</b> is formed of LiF at a thickness of approx. 0.5 nm. At this time, the ETL <b>16</b> and EIL <b>17</b> may be omitted according to the type of device. Then, the cathode <b>18</b> as a second electrode is formed on the EIL <b>17</b>, thereby manufacturing the organic EL device. At this time, the cathode <b>18</b> is formed of aluminum Al at a thickness of approx. 200 nm.</p>
