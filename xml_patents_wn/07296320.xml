<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a device for cleaning, compounding, polishing, brushing, burnishing and buffing that uses extending material elements, and in particular, to a device that accomplishes such results using the rotary motion of a plurality of standard-sized, disposable shop towels, paper towels, or surgical towels that are readily available at commercial vendors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many devices for buffing only operate when the buffing materials are pressed against the material to be buffed, and are thus difficult to use for at least this reason. The following devices exemplify these types of buffing devices. U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,249 to Hoffman discloses a multi-purpose vibrational cleaning, scrubbing, buffing, and polishing device. U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,582 to Yamashita discloses a mop sheet holder and a corresponding mop sheet. U.S. Pat. No. 3,869,833 to Belanger discloses a rotary finishing wheel. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,517 and 6,405,403 to McKay disclose a cleaning tool with removable cleaning sheets. U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,352 to Blackman, et al., discloses a method and apparatus for cleaning, wiping, scouring, and abrading.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, conventional buffing devices may extend radially from the central axis, but the buffing sheets are typically not readily disposable or otherwise easy to obtain, and instead must be custom manufactured to fit the device. The following patents disclose these types of devices. U.S. Pat. No. 2,805,530 to Schaffner discloses a wheel-shaped, rotary finishing apparatus that may be used to buff. U.S. Pat. No. 5,560,744 to Schaffner III discloses a rotary buffing wheel in which layers of fabric attached to the wheel extend radially from the central axis of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some buffing devices, in which the buffing materials extend radially from the body, secure the buffing materials to the body, which is located on the central axis of the device, by using fastening devices, rather than friction, which for example, may unnecessarily complicate the device to make it difficult to use. Examples of these types of devices include the following. U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,687 to Dehart discloses a buff section assembly and method of making the assembly. U.S. Pat. No. 2,423,992 to Nordgren et al. discloses a rotary buffing tool in which wiping elements rotate about a rotary shank.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many embodiments of conventional buffing devices, in which the buffing fingers extend radially, position the buffing fingers between grooves specially carved in the body and located on a central axis. Drawbacks of these devices include the fact that they do not use a fastening system to retain the buffing materials, and these devices typically do not have a retaining member attached to the body to keep the buffing fingers safely in the grooves during operation. The following patents disclose one or more of these features. U.S. Pat. No. 2,440,856 to Harrison discloses a finishing device in which a finishing element extends in two directions from a rotating central mandrel. U.S. Pat. No. 2,516,870 to Harrison discloses a finishing device wherein a flexible, plurality of material extends through a central mandrel so that it extends in two directions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,146 to De Cola discloses a rotary abrasive tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned problems, as well as others, by providing an apparatus that includes a rotary, mechanical device that is easily assembled, and for which extending material (also referred to herein “extending material elements”), such as shop towels, may be quickly and easily replaced. The present invention provides a multi-purpose device to clean, buff, abrade, polish, compound, burnish, and perform similar functions by using a plurality of extending material, such as disposable shop towels, extending radially from a main body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment uses a two-portion body that provides an area for the extending material to be inserted and retained during use. The extending material, while retained, extends radially from the outer body, thereby allowing functions, such as cleaning, compounding, abrading, buffing, and polishing, of objects located peripherally to the main body. Moreover, the present invention allows the user to easily replace and/or dispose the extending material of the invention with readily available extending material, such as standard disposable shop towels, surgical towels, or paper towels. In one embodiment, the extending material is fixed to the mechanical device using friction, and therefore, in this embodiment, the extending materials do not require complex fastening features. Optionally retaining rings are used to further secure the extending material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second embodiment, the plurality of extending material, such as shop towels, are held in between two complementary portions that each include extensions and that are coupled to form the outer body. The device is connected along its central axis to a rotary machine, such as a drill, which provides the power for the rotating motion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another feature of the present invention is that it provides a cost effective method for cleaning. The plurality of extending material, such as shop towels, are ready-made and readily available at commercial centers selling cleaning supplies. The present invention does not require specialized replacement parts, which are typically high in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also provides a cleaning device that may be assembled and disassembled quickly and simply. The extending material, such as the shop towels, may be efficiently replaced as the material becomes soiled, or at the discretion of the user. Removal of the towels only requires disengaging of the two components that comprise the outer body of the invention. Alternatively, the user may manually pull one end of a shop towel to unthread and remove the towel from the fully assembled device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, which disclose multiple embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the drawings are designed for the purpose of illustration only and not as a definition of the limits of the invention. Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will also become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or upon learning by practice of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">This invention provides an apparatus for performing a number of functions, including buffing, cleaning, compounding, polishing, burnishing, and abrading, using rotary power supplied by a rotary machine. Extending members are inserted into the outer body of the invention and are retained using friction. When assembled, the plurality of extending members extend radially from the outer body of the invention. The user of the invention positions the invention such that the extending members come in contact with an intended surface. The extending members may be easily replaced and disposed of at the discretion of the user. There are numerous embodiments for this invention. The detailed description and drawings present two embodiments and several variations of these embodiments, but do not encompass all embodiments for this invention, additional variations of which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> show a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref>, the outer body of the invention is generally designated by the reference numeral <b>2</b> and the main body is generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b>. The main body <b>10</b>, which may be of any shape, such as cylindrical, spherical, or cubical, is comprised of a base <b>36</b> and a plurality of projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes three projection members: two outside projection members <b>34</b> and one middle projection member <b>32</b>. One end of the projection members can be formed with the base <b>36</b>, or they can be fixed to the base <b>36</b> by any of a number of methods, including, for example, welding or chemical bonding. In one embodiment, the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> extend in a general, first direction (“A”) from the first face <b>35</b> of the base <b>36</b>. This embodiment also includes slots <b>12</b> between projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The area and volume of each slot <b>12</b> may vary in various embodiments. In this embodiment, the slot <b>12</b> (also referred to herein as “apertures”) is formed by the space between each outside projection member <b>34</b> and the middle projection member <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, this embodiment has two such slots <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One end of the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, also known as the distal end <b>14</b>, receives a cap <b>16</b>. As shown in <b>1</b>E, the cap <b>16</b> is placed over or on top of the distal end <b>14</b> of the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The cap <b>16</b> is retained by any number of methods, such as via a retaining lip or via threads on the inner surface of the cap <b>16</b> that fit corresponding features on the distal end <b>14</b> of the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In one embodiment, each projection member <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> tapers at the distal end <b>14</b>, forming a narrowed end, which receives the cap <b>16</b>. Tapering this feature, for example, may ease assembly and disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A rotation rod <b>38</b> extends from the second face <b>37</b> of the base to a rotary machine <b>4</b>, such as a handheld drill. The rotation rod <b>38</b> may be formed or affixed to the main body <b>10</b> in a similar manner as the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment of the present invention, the rotation rod <b>38</b> can be disassembled and removed from the main body <b>10</b>, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. In this embodiment, the main body <b>10</b> has a central cavity <b>22</b>, which extends from the second face <b>37</b> of the base <b>36</b> to the first face <b>35</b> of the base <b>36</b>, and continues to extend through the middle projection member <b>32</b>. The rotation rod <b>38</b> has T-shape or any similar shape allowing the rotation rod <b>38</b> to be retained within the central cavity <b>22</b> as described further below. In one embodiment, the rotation rod <b>38</b> is comprised of two sub-parts: 1) a central rod <b>23</b> is perpendicularly formed or affixed to 2) a central anchor <b>24</b>. The rotation rod <b>38</b> and main body <b>10</b> are assembled such that the central rod <b>23</b> of the rotation rod <b>38</b> is inserted in the central cavity <b>22</b> from the first face of the base through the middle projection member <b>32</b>. The rotation rod <b>38</b> is positioned by pulling the central rod <b>23</b> to the second face <b>37</b> of the base <b>36</b> until the central anchor <b>24</b> rests against the first face <b>35</b> of the base <b>36</b>. As shown in <b>1</b>E, in one embodiment, the second face <b>37</b> of the base <b>36</b> has a receiving area <b>33</b> to fixedly position the central anchor <b>24</b>. The central anchor <b>24</b> and corresponding receiving area <b>33</b> on the base <b>36</b> may be arbitrarily held by any number of retaining features, such as adhesives or a retainer nut that abuts the second face <b>37</b> of the base <b>36</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref>, a retainer nut <b>26</b> is positioned against the second face <b>37</b> of the base <b>36</b> and is secured to the rotation rod <b>38</b> using, for example, thread features on the inner surface of the retainer nut and the exterior of the rotation rod <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A plurality of extending material <b>20</b>, such as shop towels, paper towels, or surgical towels, are inserted through the slots <b>12</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the extending material <b>20</b> is manipulated to fit through the slots <b>12</b>, such as by rolling, folding, or similar compacting methods. In one embodiment of the invention, two pieces of extending material <b>20</b>, which form a first tier, are inserted in the slots <b>12</b>, such that the surface of each extending material <b>20</b> is positioned flush against the first face <b>35</b> of the base <b>36</b> and in between two projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The extending materials <b>20</b> are positioned so as to extend beyond both sides of the slot <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates an overhead view of one relationship between the extending material <b>20</b> and the main body <b>10</b> while the present invention is in use. Additional extending material <b>20</b> may be positioned on top of the first tier until the slots <b>12</b> are filled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, in one variation of the invention, a holder ring <b>18</b>, which, for example, is of a complementary shape as the main body <b>10</b> having, for example, an inner diameter slightly larger than the main body <b>10</b>, is slidably placed over the outer circumference of the main body <b>10</b>, such that it encompasses one or more of the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> so as to secure the first tier of extending material <b>20</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, successive tiers of extending material <b>20</b> are then inserted in the slots <b>12</b> of the main body <b>10</b>, with additional holder rings <b>18</b> positioned in between each tier of extending material <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon completion of the extending material insertion, the last tier of extending material <b>20</b> rests just below the distal end <b>14</b> of projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The cap <b>16</b> is placed over the projection members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> so as to secure the extending members <b>20</b> to the main body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment of the invention, a rotary machine <b>4</b>, such as a drill, for example, is then optionally attached to the rotation rod <b>38</b> so as to provide a power source for the main body <b>10</b> of the invention to rotate the outer body <b>2</b> around its central axis (“B”).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A second embodiment of the current invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>. This embodiment of the present invention is comprised of two portions, a tool base <b>52</b> and a tool end <b>62</b>, which are coupled together to form an outer body <b>68</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the tool base <b>52</b> is comprised of a first disc <b>56</b>, which may be of any of a variety of cross-sectional shapes, and a plurality of base rods <b>50</b> extending from a first face <b>55</b> of the first disc <b>56</b>. A variation of the invention may have a rotation rod <b>54</b> extending from the second face <b>57</b> of the first disc <b>56</b>. The base rods <b>50</b> and rotation rod <b>54</b> are formed or affixed into position on the first disc <b>56</b> by any number of methods, such as welding, chemical bonding, or other securing and retaining features.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, interposed between the base rods <b>50</b> on the first face <b>55</b> of the first disc <b>56</b> are base openings <b>51</b>, such as through holes, which are of any cross-sectional shape, so as to be complementary to the shape of the end rods <b>60</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the first disc <b>56</b> includes two base openings <b>51</b>. The base openings <b>51</b> and plurality of base rods <b>50</b> are positioned in any manner, such as a symmetrical path, which may be in a circular pattern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>, about the first disc <b>56</b>. In one embodiment, the positions of the base openings <b>51</b> and plurality of base rods <b>50</b> on the first disc <b>56</b> are complementary to the position of the plurality of end rods <b>60</b> and end openings <b>61</b>, respectively, on the second disc <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the tool end <b>62</b> is comprised of a plurality of end rods <b>60</b> extending from the first face <b>67</b> to the second face <b>65</b> of the second disc <b>66</b>, which may be of any variety of cross-sectional shapes. The end rods <b>60</b> are formed or affixed to the second disc <b>66</b> using, for example, any of the methods to form or affix the base rods <b>50</b> to the first disc <b>56</b>. In one embodiment, the first face <b>67</b> of the second disc <b>66</b> also has a plurality of end openings <b>61</b>, such as through holes, interposed with the end rods <b>60</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in this embodiment, the second disc <b>66</b> has two end openings <b>61</b>, which are of any cross-sectional shape but are greater in diameter than the base rods <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the end openings <b>61</b> are positioned in between the end rods <b>60</b> in any path, including symmetrical paths, such as in a circular pattern, about the second disc <b>62</b>. In one embodiment, the positions of the end openings <b>61</b> and end rods <b>60</b> are complementary to the position of base rods <b>50</b> and base openings <b>51</b> on the first disc <b>56</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>, the outer body <b>68</b> is assembled by engaging the tool base <b>52</b> and the tool end <b>62</b>. The plurality of base rods <b>50</b> extend towards the tool end <b>62</b>, and the plurality of end rods <b>60</b> extend towards the tool base <b>52</b>. The tool end <b>62</b> and tool base <b>52</b> are arranged such that each base rod <b>50</b> and each base opening <b>51</b> align with the corresponding end opening <b>61</b> and a end rod <b>62</b>, respectively. Hence, each base rod <b>52</b> has a complementary end opening <b>61</b>, and each end rod <b>62</b> has a complementary base opening <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment of the present invention, a retaining member <b>64</b>, such as a retaining pin, retaining lock, adhesive, or other retaining feature or features, are located at the distal end <b>59</b> of the plurality of end rods <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, at least one end rod <b>60</b> contains a retainer member <b>64</b>. In one variation of this invention, the end rods <b>60</b> are slightly longer than the base rods <b>50</b>, and thus, when the invention is assembled, the end rods <b>60</b> extend through the base openings <b>51</b> to the second face <b>57</b> of the first disc <b>56</b>. The retaining member <b>64</b> on the end rods <b>60</b> prevents the tool base <b>52</b> and tool end <b>62</b> from disengaging.</p>
