<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a printed circuit board unit with a cooling device in general incorporated within an electronic apparatus such as a portable digital assistant (PDA), a notebook personal computer, and the like. In particular, the invention relates to a printed circuit board unit comprising a printed circuit board, a ventilation fan rotatable around the rotation axis intersecting the printed circuit board, and a fan housing accommodating the ventilation fan.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication P2000-77877A, a so-called fan unit includes a fan housing accommodating a ventilation fan rotating around the rotation axis. When the ventilation fan rotates, air is allowed to flow in the centrifugal direction of the rotation axis. The fan housing serves to guide the air toward the outlet. The air is discharged out of the outlet. At the same time, air surrounding the fan housing is introduced into the fan housing through the inlet. The inlet is defined to face the surface of the printed circuit board. When the air is sucked into the fan housing, air is allowed to flow along the surface of the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, a number of electronic components are mounted on the surface of the printed circuit board. The respective electronic components protrude from the surface of the printed circuit board, so that the electronic components hinder a smooth flow of the air. The turbulence in the air is supposed to constrain the ventilation fan from sucking the air into the fan housing. The suction quantity of the air may be reduced. The ventilation fan suffers from reduction in the cooling efficiency. As the printed circuit board gets thinner, the space is reduced between the fan housing and the surface of the printed circuit board. The cooling efficiency of the ventilation fan may still get deteriorated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a printed circuit board unit with a cooling device contributing to reduction in the thickness of an electronic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a printed circuit board unit with a cooling device, comprising: a printed circuit board; a ventilation fan rotating around a rotation axis intersecting the printed circuit board; a housing wall standing from a surface of the printed circuit board at a periphery of the ventilation fan; and an outlet defined in the housing wall.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The printed circuit board and the housing wall cooperate to define a space for accommodating the ventilation fan. When the ventilation fan rotates, the movement of air, namely, airflow can be generated within the space. The printed circuit board and the housing wall lead the air toward the outlet. In this manner, the printed circuit board can be utilized to form the cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, a high speed airflow can be generated within the space in the printed circuit board unit and the housing wall. The airflow efficiently absorbs the heat from the surface of the printed circuit board. The heat radiation from the printed circuit board can be promoted. In general, an electrically conductive metallic wiring pattern extends over the surface of the printed circuit board. The metallic wiring pattern usually has a superior heat conductivity as compared with the material of the printed circuit board. The metallic wiring pattern thus contributes to promotion of the heat radiation from the printed circuit board. In particular, the metallic wiring pattern inside the housing wall leads to an improved promotion of the heat radiation from the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The printed circuit board unit of the aforementioned type may further comprise: a ceiling wall connected to an upper end of the housing wall and extending along a datum plane parallel to the surface of the printed circuit board; and an inlet defined in the ceiling wall.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In general, a number of electronic components are mounted on the surface of the printed circuit board. The electronic components protrude from the surface of the printed circuit board. The electronic components is supposed to hinder a smooth flow of the air along the surface of the printed circuit board. If the inlet is defined at a position spaced from the surface of the printed circuit board in the aforementioned manner, a smooth flow of the air can be established irrespective of the existence of the electronic components. The air can smoothly be sucked into the inlet. A large quantity of the air can be sucked, so that the cooling efficiency of the cooling device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, if the printed circuit board of the aforementioned type is incorporated within an electronic apparatus, the inlet can be opposed to the inner surface of the enclosure of the electronic apparatus. Airflow can be generated along the inner surface of the enclosure in response to the suction of the air into the inlet. In general, a generally flat surface is defined on the inner surface of the enclosure. Less obstacles can be found on the inner surface of the enclosure as compared with the surface of the printed circuit board. A smooth airflow can thus be generated along the inner surface of the enclosure. The air is smoothly sucked into the inlet. Since the air is smoothly introduced into the inlet in this manner, a higher cooling efficiency can be kept even when the space is reduced between the inlet and the inner surface of the enclosure in the electronic apparatus. The thickness of the electronic apparatus can reliably be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The printed circuit board unit of the aforementioned type may further comprise an inlet defined in the printed circuit board inside the housing wall. Air can be introduced not only from the space adjacent the front side of the printed circuit board but also from the space adjacent the back side of the printed circuit board. A larger quantity of air can be sucked into the space defined by the printed circuit board and the housing wall, so that the cooling efficiency of the cooling device can further be improved. Moreover, the front and back sides of the printed circuit board can simultaneously be cooled down enough. It should be noted that the inlet in the printed circuit board may be established in place of the inlet in the ceiling wall. This structure contributes to a further reduction in the thickness of the electronic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the printed circuit board unit of the aforementioned type may further comprise: an electronic component mounted on the printed circuit board; and an electrically conductive wiring pattern extending over the surface of the printed circuit board inside the housing wall and connected to the electronic component. The ventilation fan serves to promote the heat radiation from the electrically conductive wiring pattern. The heat radiation from the printed circuit board can still be improved. Moreover, since the electrically conductive wiring pattern is allowed to receive the heat from the electronic component, the electronic component can efficiently be cooled down.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A heat radiation fin may be attached to the printed circuit board and connected to the electronic component. The heat radiation fin promotes the heat radiation from the electrically conductive wiring pattern. The heat radiation fin may be located within the outlet. Alternatively, the heat radiation fin may be located to face the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An electronic component may be mounted on the printed circuit board inside the housing wall. A high speed airflow can be generated inside the housing wall based on the rotation of the ventilation fan in the aforementioned manner. Accordingly, the electronic component can efficiently be cooled down. The electronic component may be located within the outlet, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a printed circuit board unit <b>18</b> is incorporated within the main body <b>12</b>. The printed circuit board unit <b>18</b> includes a printed circuit board <b>19</b> and a central processing unit (CPU) package <b>21</b> mounted on the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>, for example. The CPU package <b>21</b> may include a small-sized ceramic substrate <b>22</b> and a CPU chip <b>23</b> mounted on the ceramic substrate <b>22</b>, for example. Not only the CPU package <b>21</b> but also various electronic components <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b </i>are mounted on the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. An electrically conductive wiring pattern, not shown, is formed to extend over the front surface of the printed circuit board, for example. The electrically conductive wiring pattern serves to establish electric connections between the CPU package <b>21</b> and the electronic components <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b </i>as well as between the electronic components <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Within the main body <b>12</b>, a secondary battery <b>25</b> as well as a hard disk drive (HDD) <b>26</b> is connected to the printed circuit board unit <b>18</b>, for example. The secondary battery <b>25</b> and the HDD <b>26</b> may be detachably incorporated within the main body <b>12</b>.

The HDD <b>26</b> is allowed to hold application software programs to be processed at the CPU chip <b>23</b> as well as various data utilized during the execution of the application software programs.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A cooling device <b>27</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention is coupled to the CPU package <b>21</b>. The cooling device <b>27</b> includes a heat receiving plate <b>28</b>, of a higher heat conductive material, superposed on the upper surface of the CPU chip <b>23</b>. One end of a heat conductive member such as a heat pipe <b>29</b> is connected to the heat receiving plate <b>28</b>. The other end of the heat pipe <b>29</b> is connected to heat radiation fins <b>31</b> attached to the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. Heat of the CPU chip <b>23</b> is transmitted to the heat radiation fins <b>31</b> via the heat receiving plate <b>28</b> and the heat pipe <b>29</b>. The heat radiation fins <b>31</b> are allowed to protrude, out of a recess <b>32</b> defined in the printed circuit board <b>19</b>, into a space at the back of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, electronic components such as a memory module <b>35</b> including a random access memory (RAM), a PC card slot <b>36</b>, a local area network (LAN) module <b>37</b> are mounted on the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. In this manner, relatively taller electronic components are mounted on the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b> as compared with the front surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A fan unit <b>38</b> is further incorporated within the cooing device <b>27</b>. The fan unit <b>38</b> is attached to the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The fan unit <b>38</b> includes a fan housing <b>39</b> fixed to the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. A top or ceiling wall <b>41</b> is defined in the fan housing <b>39</b>. The ceiling wall <b>41</b> is allowed to extend along a datum plane parallel to the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. An inlet <b>42</b> is defined in the ceiling wall <b>41</b>. The inlet <b>42</b> serves to interconnect the space inside the fan housing <b>39</b> and the space outside the fan housing <b>39</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rotary member <b>43</b> is accommodated within the fan housing <b>39</b>. The rotary member <b>43</b> is designed to rotate around the rotation axis CR extending in a direction perpendicular to the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. Blades <b>44</b> are integrally formed on the peripheral surface of the rotary member <b>43</b>. The blades <b>44</b> may be located at equal intervals, for example. The respective blades <b>44</b> are designed to extend in the centrifugal directions from the rotary member <b>43</b>. The individual blade <b>44</b> extends in a plane intersecting, by a predetermined inclination angle α, the vertical plane VP including the rotation axis CR. When the rotary member <b>43</b> rotates, the blades <b>44</b> serve to generate airflow in the centrifugal direction from the rotation axis CR. The rotary member <b>43</b> and the blades <b>44</b> constitute a so-called fan or ventilation fan.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a housing wall <b>45</b> is defined in the fan housing <b>39</b>. The housing wall <b>45</b> is designed to stand upright from the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b> at the periphery of the blades <b>44</b>, so that the housing wall <b>45</b> mostly surrounds the ventilation fan. Specifically, the inner surface of the housing wall <b>45</b> is opposed to the outer ends of the blades <b>44</b> at positions spaced from the outer ends of the blades <b>44</b>. An outlet <b>46</b> is defined in the fan housing <b>39</b> at the break of the housing wall <b>45</b>. The outlet <b>46</b> is located to face the heat radiation fins <b>31</b>. An inlet <b>47</b> is also defined in the printed circuit board <b>19</b> inside the housing wall <b>45</b>. The inlet <b>47</b> likewise serves to interconnect the space inside the fan housing <b>39</b> and the space outside the fan housing <b>39</b> to each other, in the same manner as the aforementioned inlet <b>42</b>. Part of the printed circuit board <b>19</b> constitutes the fan housing <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rotary member <b>43</b> is mounted on a rotary shaft <b>51</b> extending in the vertical direction perpendicular to the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The rotary shaft <b>51</b> is received on a bearing <b>52</b> fixed to the ceiling wall <b>41</b> of the fan housing <b>39</b>. A thin electric motor <b>53</b> is interposed between the rotary member <b>43</b> and the bearing <b>52</b>. The electric motor <b>53</b> may include permanent magnets <b>54</b> attached to the rotary member <b>43</b>, and stationary coils <b>55</b> fixed to the bearing <b>52</b> and opposed to the permanent magnets <b>54</b>. A controller board <b>56</b> is also fixed to the ceiling wall <b>41</b> of the fan housing <b>39</b>. A controller circuit is established on the controller board <b>56</b>. The controller circuit operates to control the operation of the electric motor <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Now, when an electric power is supplied to the electric motor <b>53</b>, the rotary member <b>43</b> rotates around the rotation axis CR. The blades <b>44</b> generate airflow in the centrifugal direction of the rotation axis CR. The generated airflow is guided along the housing wall <b>45</b> to the outlet <b>46</b>. The air is discharged out of the outlet <b>46</b> in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An opening <b>58</b> is defined in an enclosure <b>57</b> of the main body <b>12</b>. The opening <b>58</b> is located to face the outlet <b>46</b> of the fan unit <b>38</b>. The air discharged out of the outlet <b>46</b> is allowed to flow through the heat radiation fins <b>31</b> and gets out of the main body <b>12</b> through the opening <b>58</b>. The air absorbs the heat from the heat radiation fins <b>31</b>. In this manner, the heat radiation from the heat radiation fins <b>31</b> is efficiently promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A high speed airflow is generated based on the rotation of the blades <b>44</b> within the inner space surrounded by the printed circuit board <b>19</b>, the housing wall <b>45</b> and the ceiling wall <b>41</b>. The airflow efficiently absorbs the heat from the surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The heat radiation from the printed circuit board <b>19</b> can be promoted. In general, an electrically conductive metallic wiring pattern extends over the surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The metallic wiring pattern usually has a superior heat conductivity as compared with the material of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The metallic wiring pattern thus contributes to promotion of the heat radiation from the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. In particular, the metallic wiring pattern inside the housing wall <b>45</b> leads to an improved promotion of the heat radiation from the printed circuit board <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the air is discharged out of the outlet <b>46</b> in the aforementioned manner, air is sucked into the fan housing <b>39</b> through the inlet <b>42</b>. Since the inlet <b>42</b> in the ceiling wall <b>41</b> is opposed to the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b>, airflow <b>61</b> can be generated along the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b> in response to the suction of the air into the inlet <b>42</b>. In general, a number of electronic components are mounted on the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The electronic components protrude from the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The electronic components thus hinder a smooth flow of the air along the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. On the other hand, a generally flat surface is defined on the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b> of the main body <b>12</b>. Less obstacles can be found on the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b>. The smooth airflow <b>61</b> can be generated along the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b> of the main body <b>12</b>. The air is smoothly sucked into the inlet <b>42</b>. A large quantity of the air can be sucked into the fan housing <b>39</b>, so that the cooling efficiency of the fan unit <b>38</b> can be improved. Since the air is smoothly introduced into the inlet <b>42</b> in this manner, a higher cooling efficiency can be kept even when the space is reduced between the ceiling wall <b>41</b> of the fan housing <b>39</b> and the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At the same time, air can be sucked from the inlet <b>47</b> in the printed circuit board <b>19</b> in the fan unit <b>38</b>. The air is introduced into the fan unit <b>38</b> not only from the space adjacent the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b> but also from the space adjacent the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. A still larger quantity of the air can be sucked into the fan housing <b>39</b>, so that the cooling efficiency of the fan unit <b>38</b> can further be improved. Moreover, the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b> can be cooled down enough even when the fan unit <b>19</b> is located on the back surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the inlet <b>47</b> is defined in the printed circuit board <b>19</b> in the aforementioned manner, the ceiling wall <b>41</b> of the fan housing <b>39</b> may completely superposed over the inner surface of the enclosure <b>57</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Air can be sucked enough into the fan housing <b>39</b> from the inlet <b>47</b> irrespective of the closure of the inlet <b>42</b>. A sufficient cooling efficiency can be maintained in the fan unit <b>38</b>. This structure is supposed to contribute to an additional reduction in the thickness of the main body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cooling device <b>62</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The cooling device <b>62</b> includes an electrically conductive wiring pattern <b>63</b> extending over the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>, and heat radiation fins <b>64</b> attached to the front surface of the printed circuit board <b>19</b>. The electrically conductive wiring pattern <b>63</b> is connected to a power consumption circuit, namely, the CPU package <b>21</b> and to the heat radiation fins <b>64</b>. Soldering may be employed to fix the heat radiation fins <b>64</b> to the electrically conductive wiring pattern <b>63</b> on the printed circuit board <b>19</b>.
