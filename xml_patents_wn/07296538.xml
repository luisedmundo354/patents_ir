<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to deer feeders, and more particularly to a deer feeder that is designed to hold a food container such as a jar of peanut butter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Game feeders are used to feed a variety of species ranging from large animals, such as deer, to fur-bearing animals. There are many disadvantages to current game feeders. In some cases the designs inherently make the feeder visible. In other cases, game feeders are difficult to set up and difficult to fill or load.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the case of deer, it is known that deer are attracted to certain containerized foods such as peanut butter. However, it is difficult to properly position peanut butter in the wild to effectively attract deer. First, it is desirable to place the food container in a proper location where deer can access the feeder. Further, it is important to station and hold the food container such that the food container does not separate from the feeder. Further, it is important to protect the food container when held such that animals, such as squirrels and the like, cannot access the food product. Therefore, there has been and continues to be a need for a deer feeder that is adaptive to hold and support an open food container such that deer can easily access the food container.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention entails a deer feeder that holds a food container, such as a jar of peanut butter in a position where food container within the food container can be easily accessed by deer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the present invention entails a method for feeding deer with food contained within the food container where the food container is held in an elevated position above the ground and opened such that a deer can gain access to food contained within the food container.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one particular embodiment, the present invention entails a deer feeder for holding a deer feeder such as a jar of peanut butter. The deer feeder includes a support that extends upwardly from the ground surface. A food container holder is mounted on the support for receiving and holding the food container. In one particular embodiment, the food container holder is angled at least slightly downwardly such that an open portion of the food container faces at least slightly downwardly to where a deer can easily gain access to the food contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one particular embodiment, the deer feeder of the present invention includes an elongated post that is designed to be extended into the ground. Secured to an upper portion of the post is a food container holder that is adapted to receive a food container such as a jar of peanut butter. When the food container is open and held within the food container holder, the contents of the food container are accessible to a deer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent and obvious from a study of the following description and the accompanying drawings which are merely illustrative of such invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With further reference to the drawings, the deer feeder of the present invention is shown therein and indicated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>. As seen in the drawings, deer feeder <b>10</b> basically comprises a support structure <b>12</b> that extends upwardly from the ground and which supports a food container holder indicated generally by the numeral <b>20</b>. As will be appreciated from subsequent portions of the disclosure, food container holder <b>20</b> is adapted to receive and hold a container of food. Once positioned within the food container holder <b>20</b>, the container of food is open about a portion thereof such that deer can access food contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Turning to a more detailed discussion of deer feeder <b>10</b>, the support structure in the case of the embodiment shown includes an elongated post <b>12</b>. Post <b>12</b> can be constructed of metal or any other suitable material. Post <b>12</b> is designed to be staked or driven into the ground G such that the post <b>12</b> extends generally vertically above the ground G. Post <b>12</b> includes a bottom portion <b>12</b>A and a top portion <b>12</b>B. Bottom portion <b>12</b>A may include a terminal end that is formed in a spike to facilitate driving the post <b>12</b> into the ground G.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Disposed about the lower portion of the deer feeder <b>10</b> is an anti-rotation member <b>14</b>. In the case of the design illustrated, the anti-rotation member <b>14</b> extends outwardly from the bottom portion <b>12</b>A of the post <b>12</b>. Anti-rotation member <b>14</b> can assume various sizes and shapes and can be positioned at numerous points along the lower portion <b>12</b>A of the post. The important point is that the anti-rotation member <b>14</b> should be positioned on the post <b>12</b> such that when the post <b>12</b> is installed in the ground G the anti-rotation member <b>14</b> will assume a position within the ground. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, when a deer feeds from the deer feeder <b>10</b> it is possible for the engagement between the deer and the deer feeder <b>10</b> to result in the post tending to rotate. The purpose of the anti-rotation member <b>14</b> is to retard or minimize this rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Secured to the top portion <b>12</b>B of the post <b>12</b> is the food container holder <b>20</b>. As discussed above, food container holder <b>20</b> is designed to receive and hold a food container. In the embodiment illustrated herein, the food container holder <b>20</b> assumes the form of a sleeve and the sleeve includes a cylindrical wall <b>22</b> and a lower open end <b>24</b> and an upper open end <b>26</b>. The area internally of the cylindrical wall <b>22</b> is open for receiving and holding a food container.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Food container holder <b>20</b> is sized to hold a food container. In the example illustrated herein, the food container is indicated generally by the numeral <b>30</b> and could be a jar of peanut butter or other container with food container therein. In any event, the food container <b>30</b> includes a bottom <b>32</b> and a surrounding sidewall structure <b>34</b>. In addition, the food container <b>30</b> would include a top (not shown). In the example illustrated herein, the top has been removed so as to leave exposed a rim <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To hold and retain the food container <b>30</b> within the food container holder <b>20</b>, there is provided one or more stops. In the case of the present embodiment, there is provided two stops, one stop disposed about one end of the food container holder <b>20</b> and another stop disposed about the other end of the food container holder. More particularly, there is provided a threaded shaft <b>40</b> that extends outwardly from the sidewall <b>22</b> of the container holder <b>20</b>. A first stop <b>42</b> includes an opening through which the threaded shaft <b>40</b> extends. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the first stop <b>42</b> includes a terminal end <b>42</b>A that is turned or hooked such that when appropriately positioned on the food container holder, the terminal end <b>42</b>A extends around the rim <b>36</b> of the food container <b>30</b>. Thus, because of the orientation of the food container holder <b>20</b>, the first stop <b>42</b> prevents the food container from falling from the holder <b>20</b>. A second stop <b>84</b> is also provided. The second stop is an L-shaped stop that includes an elongated slot <b>44</b>A provided therein. Threaded shaft <b>40</b> extends upwardly through the opening in the first stop <b>42</b> and on through the elongated slot <b>44</b>A formed in the second stop <b>44</b>. A wing nut <b>46</b> is screwed onto the terminal end of the threaded shaft <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Second stop <b>44</b> can assume various positions. In this case, second stop <b>44</b> is shown in the first position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This allows the food container <b>30</b>, such as a jar of peanut butter, to be inserted downwardly through the opening <b>26</b> formed in the holder <b>20</b>. Once the food container <b>30</b> has been inserted into the holder <b>20</b>, then the second stop <b>44</b> can be rotated from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Once in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second stop <b>44</b> can be adjusted downwardly to where the top portion of the stop engages the bottom <b>32</b> of the food container. When the food container <b>30</b> is properly inserted and held in the holder <b>20</b>, the lower terminal end <b>42</b>A of the first stop <b>42</b> will curl around the top rim <b>36</b> of the container <b>30</b>. Thus, stop <b>42</b> effectively prevents the food container <b>30</b> from sliding or otherwise moving downwardly from the holder <b>20</b>. Likewise, when the second stop is in the second position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the stop abuts against the bottom <b>32</b> of the container <b>30</b>. This will prevent the food container <b>30</b> from being pushed out the end <b>26</b> of the container by a deer engaging the container <b>30</b> or the contents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As seen in the drawings, the sleeve or holder <b>20</b> is disposed at an angle to the axis of the post <b>12</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Note that the axis of the holder <b>20</b> forms and angle, designated by A, with the axis of the post <b>12</b>. Angle A can vary. In the particular embodiment illustrated herein, angle A assumes an angle of approximately 45°. However, it is contemplated that angle A can vary, for example, between approximately 20° and 70°.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">From the foregoing discussion, it is appreciated that the deer feeder of the present invention provides a means for supporting and holding a containerized food product. The design of the deer feeder is relatively simply and cost effective and can be easily transported from one location to another location.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention may, of course, be carried out in other specific ways than those herein set forth without departing from the scope and the essential characteristics of the invention. The present embodiments are therefore to be construed in all aspects as illustrative and not restrictive and all changes coming within the meaning and equivalency range of the appended claims are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
