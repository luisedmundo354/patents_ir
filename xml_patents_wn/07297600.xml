<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of forming a fin field effect transistor on a semiconductor substrate includes forming a fin-shaped active region vertically protruding from the substrate. An oxide layer is formed on a top surface and opposing sidewalls of the fin-shaped active region. An oxidation barrier layer is formed on the opposing sidewalls of the fin-shaped active region and is planarized to a height no greater than about a height of the oxide layer to form a fin structure. The fin structure is oxidized to form a capping oxide layer on the top surface of the fin-shaped active region and to form at least one curved sidewall portion proximate the top surface of the fin-shaped active region. The oxidation barrier layer has a height sufficient to reduce oxidation on the sidewalls of the fin-shaped active region about halfway between the top surface and a base of the fin-shaped active region. Related devices are also discussed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2004-40986, filed on Jun. 4, 2004, the contents of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more specifically, to methods for forming field effect transistors (FETs) and related devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the past 30 years, developments in silicon-based integrated circuit technology, such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices including field effect transistors (FETs and/or MOSFETs), have provided greater device speed, increased integration density, and improved device functionality with reduced cost. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, MOS devices are typically formed in a substrate <b>10</b> having heavily-doped source/drain (S/D) regions <b>12</b> separated by a more lightly-doped channel region <b>18</b>. The channel region <b>18</b> may be controlled by a gate electrode <b>14</b> that is separated from the channel region by a gate dielectric <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, with increasing requirements for higher integration as well as higher performance, lower power dissipation, and greater economic efficiency, a variety of problems associated with degradation of transistor characteristics may arise. For example, as the channel length of a transistor is reduced, short-channel effects such as punch-through, drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL), sub-threshold swing, increased parasitic capacitance between a junction region and the substrate (i.e. junction capacitance), and increased leakage current may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of transistor designs have been developed which may address some of the problems faced by conventional bulk-MOS semiconductor devices. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a conventional ultra-thin body transistor. In an ultra-thin body transistor, the channel region <b>18</b> may be formed in a thin layer above an insulating region. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates a conventional double-gate transistor. In a double gate transistor, a single channel region <b>18</b> may be controlled by two gates <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>that are separated from the channel region by gate dielectrics <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. As such, both sides of the channel region may be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> may require more complex fabrication techniques, which may increase cost and decrease yield. Accordingly, such devices may be less practical in general semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, ultra-thin body transistors may be considerably more expensive to produce than conventional bulk-MOS devices. Although they may provide improved performance in some areas, ultra-thin body transistors may be susceptible to floating body and heat transfer effects, and may have current limitations imposed by the body thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, by controlling the channel from two sides, double-gate devices may exhibit improved leakage performance. However, double-gate devices may require a more complex fabrication processes, which may increase expense and lower yield. More particularly, it may be difficult to align upper gate <b>14</b><i>a </i>and lower gate <b>14</b><i>b </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) in double-gate transistor fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">FinFET transistors, in which the channel region is formed in a vertically protruding “fin” of semiconductor material, may provide leakage performance similar to or better than that of double-gate transistors, but may be less complicated and less expensive to produce. FinFET transistors (or simply FinFETs) may also support scaling to sub-50 nm channel lengths (and perhaps as low as 10 nm), which may provide additional improvements in integration density and operational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In FinFETs, the channel region may be formed in a vertically oriented fin-shaped active region protruding from the semiconductor substrate, as discussed above. The gate dielectrics may be formed on the fin, and the gate electrode may be formed around the fin. The channel region may be formed first, followed by source and drain regions. The source/drain regions may be taller than the fin. Dielectric and conductive materials may then be used to form double- and/or triple-gate devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref> are cross-sectional views of a semiconductor substrate illustrating conventional methods for forming a FinFET.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an etch mask pattern <b>13</b> is formed on a silicon substrate <b>10</b>. A portion of the silicon substrate <b>10</b> exposed by the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> is anisotropically etched to form a silicon fin <b>15</b>. An upper edge of the silicon fin <b>15</b> is formed at a sharp angle (i.e. at nearly a right angle) due to the anisotropic etching. The etch mask pattern <b>13</b> may be formed of nitride, and a thermal oxide layer may be formed between the nitride and substrate. In order to provide electrical insulation between neighboring silicon fins, a device isolation layer <b>17</b> is formed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>17</b> is removed, exposing lateral surfaces, or sidewalls, of the silicon fin <b>15</b>. The lateral surfaces of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may serve as a channel region for a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a gate insulating layer <b>19</b> is formed on the exposed sidewalls of the silicon fin <b>15</b>, and a gate electrode <b>21</b> is formed to create a double-gate FinFET. Both sidewalls of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may be controlled by the gate electrode <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to conventional methods for forming double-gate FinFETs, adhesion between the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> and the substrate <b>10</b> may be weakened when a portion of the device isolation layer <b>17</b> is removed. Since the device isolation layer <b>17</b> may also be formed of an oxide, a thermal oxide layer of the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> on a portion of silicon fin may be removed along with the portion of the device isolation layer <b>17</b>. As the width of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may be decreased to allow for higher device integration, it may be increasingly possible for the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> to be separated from the upper surface of the silicon fin <b>15</b>. If the etch mask pattern is removed, an upper surface of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may be controlled by the gate electrode <b>21</b>, and a triple-gate FinFET may be formed. Accordingly, double-gate and triple-gate FinFETs may be formed on the same wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in order to form higher-performance devices, the width of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may be decreased by performing a thermal oxidation process before forming the gate insulating layer <b>19</b>. In other words, the width of the silicon fin <b>15</b> may be reduced by forming a sacrificial oxide layer at sidewalls of the fin <b>15</b> using a thermal oxidation process, and then removing the sacrificial oxide layer. As such, the fin <b>15</b> may have a width narrower than that of the etch mask pattern <b>13</b>. Accordingly, an under-cut region may be formed under the etch mask pattern <b>13</b>, resulting in poor step coverage during subsequent processes, such as the deposition of gate electrode material. In addition, if the sacrificial oxide layer is removed, the thermal oxide layer of the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> may also be partially removed. As a result, the etch mask pattern <b>13</b> may be separated from the silicon fin <b>15</b>, and the problems described above may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Triple-gate FinFETs have been developed which may address some of these problems. In triple-gate FinFETs, an upper surface and both sidewalls of the silicon fin are controlled by a gate electrode, which may improve current driving capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A conventional method for forming a triple-gate FinFET will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3B</figref>. Triple-gate FinFETs can be formed by removing the etch mask pattern in the conventional methods for forming double-gate FinFETs described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a silicon fin <b>15</b> and a device isolation layer <b>17</b> are formed. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>17</b> and an etch mask pattern <b>13</b> are removed. As a result, both sidewalls and an upper surface of the silicon fin <b>15</b> are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a gate insulating layer <b>19</b> is formed on the exposed surfaces (i.e. both sidewalls and the upper surface) of the silicon fin <b>15</b>, and then a gate electrode <b>21</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">However, a “hump” in subthreshold current may occur during operation of such a triple-gate FinFET. In other words, if an upper edge or corner of the silicon fin is sharp, and if a gate electrode controls both the sidewalls and the upper surface of the silicon fin, an electric field may be concentrated at the sharp edge portion (i.e., at the corner where both sidewalls and the upper surface of the silicon fin meet). As such, leakage current may be present at voltages below the transistor threshold voltage.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being “on” or extending “onto” another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” or extending “directly onto” another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly connected” or “directly coupled” to another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, relative terms, such as “lower” or “bottom” and “upper” or “top,” may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the “lower” side of other elements would then be oriented on “upper” sides of the other elements. The exemplary term “lower”, can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of “lower” and “upper,” depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements would then be oriented “above” the other elements. The exemplary terms “below” or “beneath” can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an ” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term “and/or” as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in disclosing embodiments of the invention, including technical and scientific terms, have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, and are not necessarily limited to the specific definitions known at the time of the present invention being described. Accordingly, these terms can include equivalent terms that are created after such time. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Methods for forming semiconductor fins according to some embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> formed of silicon is prepared. The substrate may be selected from a variety of substrate configurations including, for example, wafers cut from Czochralski (CZ) or Float Zone (FZ) prepared single crystal bulk silicon substrates, and/or modified substrates including, for example, substrates incorporating one or more features such as epitaxial layers, buried insulating layers, and/or doped regions selected to provide desired structural and performance characteristics in the completed device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an etch mask pattern <b>103</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. A region of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> protected by the etch mask pattern <b>103</b> may correspond to a transistor active region. The etch mask pattern <b>103</b> includes a buffer layer <b>103</b><i>a</i>, such as an oxide layer, formed directly on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and a mask layer <b>103</b><i>b</i>, such as a nitride layer, formed on the buffer layer <b>103</b><i>a</i>. The etch mask pattern <b>103</b> may be formed by a conventional photolithography process and/or a patterning and etching process using dry and/or wet etching.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The region of the semiconductor <b>100</b> exposed by the etch mask pattern <b>103</b> is anisotropically etched to form a semiconductor fin <b>105</b> vertically protruding from the substrate <b>100</b> and having a first height “h<sub>1</sub>” and a first width “w<sub>1</sub>” under the etch mask pattern <b>103</b>. The fin <b>105</b> may define a fin-shaped active region for the transistor. The first width “w<sub>1</sub>” may be indicative of the length of a gate electrode to be formed on the fin <b>105</b>. To achieve higher device integration, it may be preferable for the first width “w<sub>1</sub>” of the fin <b>105</b> to be narrow. However, the first width “w<sub>1</sub>” of the fin <b>105</b> may be determined by the width of the etch mask pattern <b>103</b>, and as such, may be dependent on the photolithography process that is used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a device isolation layer <b>107</b> is formed on the fin <b>105</b> and the etch mask pattern <b>103</b>. The device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be formed of an insulating layer, such as an oxide layer. Preferably, the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be formed of an oxide layer having good gap filling characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>107</b> is removed to form a recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a</i>, thereby exposing opposing lateral surfaces or sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>. The etch mask pattern <b>103</b> is also removed to expose an upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>. In particular, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be removed by sequentially performing a planarization process and an etch-back process. In other words, the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be planarized until the etch mask pattern <b>103</b> is exposed. Then, the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be etched back to expose opposing sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>. Alternatively, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be removed by performing only the etch-back process to expose the sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>. As a further alternative, a portion of the device isolation layer <b>107</b> can be removed after removing the etch mask pattern <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a result, the sidewalls and the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> are exposed by removing the portion of the device isolation layer <b>107</b> and the etch mask pattern <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an oxide layer <b>109</b> and an oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b> are sequentially formed on the exposed surfaces of the fin <b>105</b>. The oxide layer <b>109</b> may be formed on the opposing sidewalls and the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> by a thermal oxidation process. The oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b> is then formed on the oxide layer <b>109</b> and on the recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a</i>. The oxide barrier layer <b>111</b> may be formed of a material capable of preventing oxygen from penetrating into the fin <b>105</b>, such as silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively, the oxide layer <b>109</b> may be formed by a vapor deposition method. In such a case, a vapor deposition oxide layer <b>109</b> may be formed on the recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a </i>as well as on the exposed sidewalls and upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an etch-back process is performed with respect to the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b>, such that portions of the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b> on the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> and the recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a </i>are removed. As such, a fin structure is formed having an oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>as a spacer on the oxide layer <b>109</b> at sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>. The oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>may have a height no greater than about a height of the oxide layer <b>109</b>. In other words, the oxidation barrier layer may have a height that is about the height of the fin <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a thermal oxidation process is performed on the fin structure. In particular, an upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> is oxidized to form a capping oxide layer <b>113</b>. If the fin <b>105</b> is formed of silicon, the capping oxide layer <b>113</b> may be a silicon oxide layer. Alternatively, if the fin <b>105</b> is formed of silicon-germanium, the capping oxide layer <b>113</b> may be a silicon-germanium oxide layer. The oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>remains at sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b> such that oxidation occurs only or predominantly at the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>, and such that little or no oxidation occurs at the sidewalls. In other words, the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>may have a height sufficient to reduce oxidation on the sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b> about halfway between the upper surface and the base of the fin <b>105</b>. As a result, a fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>is formed. The fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>may have a second height “h<sub>2</sub>” that is lower than the first height “h<sub>1</sub>.” In addition, a height of the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>is greater than that of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>, but is lower than that of the capping oxide layer <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>has a curved sidewall portion at an upper edge <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>, highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> by a dotted circle. The curved portion may be formed due to an upper bird's beak that occurs at the upper edge <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>. In other words, a bird's beak may be formed at the upper portion of the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a</i>, allowing oxidation to occur at the upper edge <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>. The oxidation may occur in a vertically downward direction from the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>. Since the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>protects both sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>, the oxidation occurs only or predominantly at the exposed upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>, and the upper bird's beak is formed at the exposed upper edges <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>as compared to other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, a lower bird's beak may be formed at a base <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the fin <b>105</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by increasing the duration of the thermal oxidation process. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, oxygen penetrates under the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>along a lower portion of the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>during the thermal oxidation process such that a lower bird's beak is formed at the base <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>. In other words, a junction between the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a </i>facilitates diffusion of oxygen under the barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>at the base <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>to form the lower bird's beak. As described above, the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>remains as a spacer at sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b><i>a</i>, preventing oxidation at the sidewalls. As such, if the fin <b>105</b> has substantially vertical sidewalls, the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>may have an “Ω” shape due to the upper and lower bird's beaks. In other words, oxidation occurs at the base of the fin <b>105</b> such that a width at the base of the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>is relatively narrow as compared to upper portions of the fin <b>105</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The lower bird's beak may be advantageous in that the fin <b>105</b><i>a </i>may have a good lateral profile. For example, if a relatively tall fin is formed by anisotropically etching the substrate, a lower width of the fin may be wider than an upper width of the fin. The lower bird's beak may reduce the lower width of the fin, so that the overall width of the fin may be uniform. In other words, both of the sidewalls of the fin may be substantially straight.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the methods for forming a fin described above with reference to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 9</figref>, an additional thermal oxidation process and cleaning process may be performed prior to forming the oxide layer <b>109</b>. As such, both the sidewalls and the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> may be oxidized by the additional thermal oxidation process, and as a result, the width and height of the fin <b>105</b> may be further reduced. Accordingly, the width of the fin <b>105</b> may be reduced beyond that which may be achieved by conventional photolithography techniques, which may allow for higher device integration and improved device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Also, with reference to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 9</figref>, a substrate with different physical, chemical and/or electrical characteristics as compared to bulk-silicon may be available. For example, silicon and/or silicon-germanium may be formed on a bulk-silicon substrate by an epitaxial growth method. Additionally, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, where a semiconductor layer is formed on an insulating layer, can be used. If the semiconductor fin is formed on a SOI substrate, a device isolation layer may not be required. Accordingly, a fin may be formed by etching the silicon layer of the SOI substrate until the insulating layer is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, with reference to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 9</figref>, the device isolation layer <b>107</b> may be formed after forming the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b>, which may make it easier to form an “Ω” shaped fin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref> illustrate additional methods of forming a fin according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is etched using the etch mask pattern <b>103</b> to form the fin <b>105</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the etch mask pattern <b>103</b> is removed, and an oxide layer <b>109</b> is formed on sidewalls and on an upper surface of the fin <b>105</b>, as well as on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. An oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b> is formed on the oxide layer <b>109</b>, and is then removed from the upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> and the substrate <b>100</b> by an anisotropic etching process. As a result, a fin structure having an oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>as a spacer adjacent the oxide layer <b>109</b> on sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a capping oxide layer <b>113</b> is formed on an upper surface of the fin <b>105</b> by performing a thermal oxidation process on the fin structure.

In contrast to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the fin structure is oxidized prior to the formation of a device isolation layer. Accordingly, a junction between the oxidation barrier layer <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the oxide layer <b>109</b> may facilitate the diffusion of oxygen at the base of the fin <b>105</b>, which may allow the lower bird's beak to be formed more easily. As described above, the lower bird's beak may provide a good lower lateral profile for the fin <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a device isolation layer is formed, and an etch-back process is performed to form a recessed device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a</i>. In order to protect the capping oxide layer <b>113</b> during the etch-back process, a protective layer, such as a nitride layer, may be formed on the capping oxide layer <b>113</b> before forming the device isolation layer. If a protective layer is used, the device isolation layer <b>107</b><i>a </i>may also be formed using a planarization process followed by an etch-back process. An additional thermal oxidation process and a cleaning process may also be performed to reduce the width of the fin <b>105</b>. In particular, after forming the fin <b>105</b>, the additional thermal oxidation process is used to form an oxide layer on the upper surface and sidewalls of the fin <b>105</b>.
