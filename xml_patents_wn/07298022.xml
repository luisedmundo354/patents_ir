<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A protective sheet is fixed to a jig, and regions of the protective sheet corresponding to regions where dicing-cut is to be performed are removed to form grooves. Then, a semiconductor wafer is bonded to the protective sheet at an opposite side of the jig, and the jig is detached from the protective sheet and the semiconductor wafer bonded together. After that, the semiconductor wafer is cut into semiconductor chips by dicing along the grooves of the protective sheet. Because the protective sheet is not cut by dicing, no scraps of the protective sheet is produced, thereby preventing contamination to the chips.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a method for producing a semiconductor device by dicing a semiconductor wafer covered with a protective sheet along scribe lines, a semiconductor device produced by the method, and a wafer detachment apparatus usable for the method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As disclosed in many documents such as JP-A-10-242253, JP-A-7-99172, U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,177, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,681, when a semiconductor wafer having plural movable portions is divided into plural chips, a protective sheet is attached to the semiconductor wafer to protect the movable portions. In this state, the semiconductor wafer is diced into the chips together with the protective sheet at a dicing-cut step.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the conventional method described above, however, because the protective sheet is diced together with the semiconductor wafer, scraps of the protective sheet such as adhesive organic particles are produced by cutting and attached to the chips as contaminants. The scraps may be attached to electrodes formed on each chip to adversely affect the electrodes in electrical and mechanical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in the conventional method, the protective sheet needs to be removed from the chips after the dicing-cut step is carried out. If the protective sheet is bonded to the semiconductor wafer firmly, the removal of the protective sheet is difficult and may cause damage to the chips due to the resulting stress. Therefore, the protective sheet is bonded to the semiconductor wafer with a relatively small amount of adhesion. Because of this, the protective sheet is easily separated from the semiconductor wafer during the dicing-cut step. As a result, the protective layer cannot protect the movable portions sufficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems. An object of the present invention is to prevent a semiconductor device from being contaminated by scraps of a protective sheet produced when a semiconductor wafer covered with the protective sheet is cut by dicing to form the semiconductor device. Another object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and a method for producing the semiconductor device capable of preventing separation of the protective sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present invention, in a method for producing a semiconductor device, after a protective sheet is fixed to a jig, a dicing-cut region of the protective sheet is removed. Then, a semiconductor wafer is bonded to the protective sheet, and the jig is detached from the protective sheet and the semiconductor, whereby the semiconductor wafer is exposed from the dicing-cut region of the protective sheet. Then, the semiconductor wafer is cut by dicing along the dicing-cut region to form the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the method described above, because the dicing-cut region of the protective sheet is removed and the protective sheet is not cut by dicing, any scraps of the protective sheet are not produced by dicing. As a result, the semiconductor device is not contaminated by the scraps. Because a dicing blade does not contact the protective sheet, the separation of the protective sheet is not caused by the dicing blade.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device has a semiconductor chip provided by cutting a semiconductor wafer by dicing, and a protective member disposed on the semiconductor chip. A peripheral edge portion of the protective sheet is provided at an inside of the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor chip. Because the peripheral edge portion of the protective sheet is provided at the inside of the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor chip, a dicing blade does not contact the protective member when cutting the semiconductor wafer. Therefore, generation of scraps and separation of the protective member can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors have further studied and examined the method for producing the semiconductor device, and found out that when adhesion between the protective sheet and the jig was strong, the semiconductor wafer was easily broken when the protective sheet and the semiconductor wafer were detached from the jig.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To solve the problem described above, according to the present invention, the protective sheet and the semiconductor wafer are detached from the jig by a pressure applied to the protective sheet from a side of the jig. Accordingly, the semiconductor wafer can be detached without being damaged together with the protective sheet. Workability and throughput for detaching the semiconductor wafer from the jig are also improved.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, to solve the problem describe above, according to another aspect of the present invention, a wafer detachment device is used for detaching the semiconductor wafer and the protective sheet from the jig. The wafer detachment device has the jig for fixedly holding the protective sheet, and pressurizing means for applying a pressure to the protective sheet. Accordingly, the protective sheet is detached from the jig by the pressure together with the semiconductor device readily.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are explained with reference to accompanying drawings. In the embodiments, a semiconductor wafer means a wafer before and after a dicing-cut step is carried out provided that the wafer has a contour of its initial state.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a first preferred embodiment, a method for producing a semiconductor device according to the present invention is applied to various semiconductor devices including movable portions such as a surface micro-processed type acceleration sensor, a rotation angle sensor, and a reflecting digital micro-mirror projector (DMD). The method in the first embodiment is explained referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a protective sheet <b>1</b> is prepared. The protective sheet <b>1</b> is formed from an UV-setting adhesive sheet, a base of which is made of, for example, polyolefine. The protective sheet <b>1</b> has an adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>for covering a semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>, and a surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>at an opposite side of the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Further, a jig <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is disposed on a heater block (not shown). The jig <b>4</b> has recesses <b>2</b> and holes <b>3</b> for vacuum absorption. The heater block performs the vacuum absorption in cooperation with the holes <b>3</b> of the jig <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, at a jig fixation step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is disposed on the jig <b>4</b> with the surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>contacting the jig <b>4</b> and the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>exposed upward. Then, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is dented along the recesses <b>2</b> by vacuum absorption performed through the holes <b>3</b>. Because the jig <b>4</b> is heated to a temperature in a range of 40 to 200° C., protective cap portions <b>5</b> are formed on the protective sheet <b>1</b> with shapes corresponding to the recesses <b>2</b>. The protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the jig <b>4</b> by an attraction through the holes <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At a protective sheet region removal step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the jig <b>4</b> is detached from the heater block along with the protective sheet <b>1</b> fixed to the jig <b>4</b>. The jig <b>4</b> is then disposed on a base (not shown), which can absorb under vacuum as the heater block. Then, regions of the protective sheet <b>1</b> where dicing-cut is to be performed at a dicing-cut step described below are removed by cutting, thereby forming grooves <b>6</b> at the removed regions (dicing-cut regions). As a result, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is divided into regions having sizes approximately the same as those of semiconductor chips to be formed. At this step, because the protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the jig <b>4</b> by vacuum absorption, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is not loosed into pieces after the protective sheet region removal step is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, at a wafer bonding step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> having movable portions <b>10</b> and made of, for example, silicon is bonded to the protective sheet <b>1</b>, by adhesives so that the movable portions <b>10</b> face the cap portions <b>5</b>. The protective sheet <b>1</b> may be a pressure sensitive adhesive sheet so that the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is bonded thereto. The positioning between the protective sheet <b>1</b> and the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is performed by alignment keys formed on the protective sheet <b>1</b> and the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> or by a CCD camera. A roller may be rolled on the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> by heating the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> so that the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> can be bonded to the protective sheet <b>1</b> without producing voids in the adhesives and lessening adhesion of the adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Then, a dicing sheet <b>12</b> is attached to the other surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> at an opposite side of the movable portions <b>10</b>. The dicing sheet <b>12</b> may be attached to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> before the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is bonded to the protective sheet <b>1</b>. By performing the wafer bonding step described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is attached to protective members (protective caps) <b>14</b> at one surface, and is attached to the dicing sheet <b>12</b> at the other surface. Each of the protective members <b>14</b> has a corresponding one of the cap portions <b>5</b> and a size the same as that of each semiconductor chip, and is attached to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> while being fixed to the jig <b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, although only one movable portion <b>10</b> is indicated in each chip region, several movable portions <b>10</b> are provided in each chip region usually.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Successively, at the dicing-cut step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, after the jig <b>4</b> is detached from the protective sheet <b>1</b> (protective members <b>14</b>), the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is fixed to a dicing base <b>13</b> by vacuum absorption. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a detailed structure of the dicing base <b>13</b> is omitted. Then, the dicing-cut is performed along the grooves <b>6</b> where the protective sheet <b>1</b> is removed, whereby the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is divided into the semiconductor chips. At that time, the dicing sheet <b>12</b> is not cut completely. The semiconductor chips are protected by the respective protective members <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this dicing-cut step, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is not cut. Therefore, any scraps of the protective sheet <b>1</b> are not produced to remain on the semiconductor chips, thereby preventing contamination of the chips. In addition, because a dicing blade hardly contacts the protective members <b>14</b> at the dicing-cut step, separation of the protective members <b>14</b> is not caused by the dicing blade.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Because the protective sheet <b>1</b> needs not be attached to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> so firmly, the removal of the protective members <b>14</b> is easy. At a protective member removal step, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a quartz glass jig <b>15</b> capable of performing vacuum absorption similarly to the jig <b>4</b> is disposed on the protective members <b>14</b> covering the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. Then, UV irradiation is performed through the quartz glass jig <b>15</b> so that the adhesive is hardened to have lessened adhesion, and the protective members <b>14</b> are removed by the vacuum absorption. Accordingly, the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The quartz glass jig <b>15</b> may have recesses as the jig <b>4</b> described above. Otherwise, the quartz glass jig <b>15</b> may have only holes for vacuum absorption at positions corresponding to flat faces of the protective members <b>14</b>. Each semiconductor chip (semiconductor device) <b>100</b> formed by removing the protective members <b>14</b> can be handled as an ordinal IC chips. Although the quartz glass jig <b>15</b> is used to remove the protective members <b>14</b> in the present embodiment, other materials are usable as the jig <b>15</b> provided that the materials can transmit UV. The UV irradiation may be performed using a mirror or an optical fibers provided that the entire wafer surface is irradiated with UV.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the protective sheet <b>1</b> is made of a heat-contraction type plastic film, the grooves <b>6</b> are widened due to heat contraction of the protective sheet <b>1</b> after the protective sheet region removal step is carried out. Therefore, the removed regions of the protective portions <b>1</b> can be decreased. Also, because it is difficult for the dicing blade to contact the protective sheet <b>1</b> at the dicing-cut step, the dicing-cut step can be performed more readily. Preferably, the heat-contraction type plastic film is selected from polyolefine family films such as a polyethylene film and a polypropylene film and films processed by drawing such as a polyvinyl chloride film and a polyester film.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the jig <b>4</b> by vacuum absorption. Therefore, the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be fixed to the jig <b>4</b> and be detached from the jig <b>4</b> readily without being damaged. Also, because the protective sheet <b>1</b> is not cut at the dicing-cut step, the life-time of the dicing blade is improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a second preferred embodiment, the protective members (protective caps) <b>14</b> are formed similarly to the first embodiment. Differences from the first embodiment are that the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> has pad portions <b>21</b> for being electrically connected to external circuits by wire bonding (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>), and that the protective members <b>14</b> are not removed and remain in products. Therefore, the protective members <b>14</b> need to be partially removed at portions corresponding to the pad portions <b>21</b>. The main differences from the first embodiment are described in more detail below. It should be noted that the same parts as those in the first embodiment are assigned to the same reference numerals in the second embodiment and other embodiments described below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B schematically show the method for producing the semiconductor device in the second embodiment in a stepwise manner. The steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C are performed in substantially the same manner as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>1</b>C. At a protective sheet region removal step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, regions of the protective sheet <b>1</b> where the dicing-cut is to be performed and regions of the protective sheet <b>1</b> corresponding to the pad portions <b>21</b> are removed as in the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> to form opening portions <b>23</b>. The regions corresponding to the pad portions <b>21</b> may be removed from the protective sheet <b>1</b> in a sheet state by pressing or the like before the protective sheet region removal step is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, at a wafer bonding step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is bonded to the protective sheet <b>1</b> so that the pad portions <b>21</b> are exposed to the opening portions <b>23</b>. Accordingly, both the pad portions <b>21</b> and dicing-cut portions <b>22</b> are exposed to the respective opening portions <b>23</b>. The other procedure at the wafer bonding step is substantially the same as that in the first embodiment. In the present embodiment, because the protective members <b>14</b> need not be removed, the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be bonded firmly. This is preferable to prevent the separation of the protective sheet <b>1</b>. It is not always necessary to expose the pad portions <b>21</b> entirely. The pad portions <b>21</b> may be partially exposed from respective windows for wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the dicing-cut step is carried out substantially in the same manner as in the first embodiment, thereby cutting the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> into semiconductor chips (devices) <b>200</b>. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, each semiconductor chip <b>200</b> holds each protective member <b>14</b>. After the dicing-cut step is carried out, the semiconductor chips <b>200</b> are detached from the dicing sheet <b>12</b>. Then, a wire-bonding step is performed to each semiconductor chip <b>200</b> so that wires are bonded to the pad portions <b>21</b> exposed from the opening portion <b>23</b> of the protective member <b>14</b>. The pad portions <b>21</b> are preferably cleaned before the wire-bonding step.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a semiconductor device to which the wire-bonding step is performed, as an example. A semiconductor acceleration sensor <b>31</b> formed as one of the semiconductor chips <b>200</b> is disposed on a substrate <b>30</b> (for example, ceramic substrate, printed circuit board, or lead frame) through adhesive (adhesive sheet) <b>32</b>, silver paste or the like by handling of a robot arm or the like. Next, a wire <b>33</b> made of gold, aluminum, or the like is bonded onto a pad portion <b>21</b> and a terminal <b>34</b> disposed on the substrate <b>30</b>. Thus, the wire-bonding step is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the acceleration sensor <b>31</b> (semiconductor chip <b>200</b>) from a side of the protective member <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the protective member <b>14</b> covers the acceleration sensor <b>31</b> except the dicing-cut portion <b>22</b> and the pad portions <b>21</b>. The opening portion <b>23</b> is a portion not covered with the protective member <b>14</b>. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show a case where the pad portions <b>21</b> are partially exposed from the protective member <b>14</b>, i.e., the opening portions <b>23</b> are formed to partially expose the pad portions <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, according to the present embodiment, in addition to the same effects as those in the first embodiment, the wire-bonding step can be performed without removing the protective sheet <b>1</b> (protective member <b>14</b>) from the semiconductor chip <b>200</b>. Because it is not necessary to remove the protective member <b>14</b> after the dicing-cut step, the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be bonded to the wafer firmly. As a result, the separation of the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be prevented more properly.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8F</figref> show a method for producing a semiconductor device in a stepwise manner in a third preferred embodiment. In the first and second embodiments, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is processed from one surface thereof. To the contrary, in the present embodiment, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is processed from front and back surfaces thereof. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> in the present embodiment has back surface processed portions <b>41</b> formed as opening portions by etching or the like performed from the back surface. The movable portions <b>10</b> are exposed from both front and back surfaces of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At a back side adhesive sheet bonding step, an adhesive sheet (back side protective sheet) <b>42</b> is bonded to the back surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> to protect the back surface. Further, at the wafer bonding step, the protective sheet <b>1</b>, which is processed as in the first embodiment to have the grooves <b>6</b>, is bonded to the front surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> while being fixed to the jig <b>4</b>. This state is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is detached from the jig <b>4</b>. After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is fixed to the dicing base (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>) by vacuum absorption through a dicing tape <b>12</b><i>a </i>at the side of the adhesive film <b>42</b>. Then, the dicing-cut step is carried out as in the first embodiment. The dicing tape <b>12</b><i>a </i>has the same function as that of the dicing sheet <b>12</b>, and is not cut completely.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is divided into chips. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, each chip is protected by the protective member <b>14</b> at the front surface side thereof, and by the adhesive film <b>42</b> at the back surface side thereof. Then, as in the first embodiment, the protective member <b>14</b> is removed, thereby providing a semiconductor chip (device) <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>. The semiconductor chip <b>300</b> can be handled as an ordinal IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present embodiment can be combined with the second embodiment in the formation of the protective member <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the modification. The protective member <b>14</b> protecting the front surface of the semiconductor chip <b>300</b> is formed to expose the pad portions <b>21</b> and the dicing-cut portion <b>22</b> from an opening portion <b>23</b>. Accordingly, the wire-bonding step can be performed to the semiconductor chip <b>300</b> similarly to the acceleration sensor <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, according to the present embodiment, the same effects as those in the first and second embodiments can be provided. In addition, even when the movable portions <b>10</b> are exposed from both surfaces of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>, the movable portions <b>10</b> can be protected appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At the dicing-cut step, two types of dicing blades may be used in accordance with the characteristics of the adhesive sheet <b>42</b> to lengthen the life-time of the dicing blades. Specifically, a first blade cuts the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> to some extent as indicated by arrow C<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, and then, a second blade cuts the remaining semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>, the adhesive film <b>42</b>, and the dicing tape <b>12</b><i>a </i>as indicated by arrow C<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. The second blade is thicker than the first blade and made of material different from that of the first blade. Thus, two-step cutting may be carried out. When the thickness of the protective sheet <b>1</b> (protective member <b>14</b>) is increased to, for example, 50 μm, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> can be cut from the back surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The protective member <b>14</b> has the cap portion <b>5</b> not to contact each movable portion <b>10</b> in the embodiments described above. The cap portion <b>5</b> is formed by the jig <b>4</b> having the recesses <b>2</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an adhesive <b>52</b> may be disposed on a flat protective member <b>51</b> where the movable portions <b>10</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> do not conflict. Accordingly, the protective member <b>51</b> can be prevented from contacting the movable portions <b>10</b> by the adhesive <b>52</b>. The protective member <b>51</b> is formed by disposing the adhesive <b>52</b> on the flat protective sheet <b>1</b>, and by forming the grooves <b>6</b> or the opening portions <b>23</b> in the protective sheet <b>1</b>. In this case, the jig <b>4</b> can dispense with the recesses <b>2</b>, resulting in low cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11E</figref> show a method for producing a semiconductor device in a stepwise manner in a fourth preferred embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, movable portions <b>61</b> are formed in the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> at a depth in a range of approximately 0.5 to 100 μm from a surface <b>60</b> of the wafer <b>11</b>. In the present embodiment, specifically, a depth of a recess <b>62</b> defined by each movable portion <b>61</b> and the surface <b>60</b> is set to approximately 3 μm. In this state, a protective member (protective cap) <b>63</b> may be flat. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the jig fixation step, the protective sheet region removal step, the wafer bonding step, the back side protective sheet bonding step are performed as described above, while keeping the protective film <b>1</b> flat without forming the cap portions <b>5</b>, thereby forming the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11C and 11D</figref>, the dicing-cut step and the protective member removal step are carried out as in the third embodiment, thereby forming a semiconductor chip (semiconductor device) <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>. The protective member <b>63</b> maybe formed as in the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the semiconductor chip <b>400</b> formed accordingly to have the protective member <b>63</b> exposing the pad portions <b>21</b> therefrom. The semiconductor chip <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can undergo the wire-bonding step while holding the protective member <b>63</b> as in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the movable portions <b>10</b> are exposed from both front and back surfaces of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> in the present embodiment, the movable portions <b>10</b> may be exposed only from the front surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> as in the first and second embodiments provided that the movable portions <b>10</b> are formed in the wafer at a depth in a range of approximately 0.5to 100 μm from the front surface of the wafer. Thus, according to the present embodiment, the same effects as those in the first to third embodiments can be provided by applying the flat protective sheet (protective member <b>63</b>) <b>1</b> to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> having the structure described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a fifth preferred embodiment, a semiconductor chip <b>500</b> formed by dicing a semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> has bumps exposed therefrom for being electrically connected to external portions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13E</figref> show a method for producing the semiconductor chip <b>500</b> in the fifth embodiment in a stepwise manner.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">First, at a bump formation step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, bumps <b>70</b> are formed on the front surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> to be electrically connected to the pad portions <b>21</b>. The bumps <b>70</b> are formed from, for example, eutectic solder or solder including In. Stud bumps (wire bumps) composed of gold balls, which are formed by wire bonding of gold wires, may be adopted as the bumps <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At the jig fixation step, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the jig <b>4</b>. Then, at the protective sheet region removal step, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is partially removed by excimer laser or the like to have recesses <b>71</b> at regions corresponding to movable portions <b>61</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. The recesses <b>71</b> have the same function as that of the cap portions <b>5</b> described above. If the movable portions <b>61</b> are provided in the wafer <b>11</b> at a depth in a range of approximately 0.5 to 100 μm from the wafer surface <b>60</b>, it is not always necessary to form the recesses <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At the protective sheet region removal step, the grooves <b>6</b> are further formed in the protective sheet <b>1</b> fixed to the jig <b>4</b> at regions (scribe regions) where the dicing-cut is to be performed, thereby dividing the protective sheet <b>1</b> into pieces each having a size corresponding to each semiconductor chip. At that time, regions of the protective sheet <b>1</b> corresponding to the bumps <b>70</b> are also removed to form opening portions <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, the adhesive film <b>42</b> is bonded to the back surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. At the wafer bonding step in the present embodiment, protective members <b>73</b> formed by dividing the protective sheet <b>1</b> are bonded to the front surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> to expose the bumps <b>70</b> from the opening portions <b>72</b> while being fixed to the jig <b>4</b>. As a result, the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the protective sheet <b>1</b> is detached from the jig <b>4</b>, the dicing-cut step is carried out along the grooves <b>6</b> to divide the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> into chips (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>). Accordingly, a semiconductor chip <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref> is obtained. The semiconductor chip <b>500</b> is covered with the protective member <b>73</b> having the opening portions <b>72</b>, and the bumps <b>70</b> are exposed from the opening portions <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, a substrate <b>80</b> having a conductive layer <b>81</b> thereon is prepared. The substrate <b>80</b> is preferably a ceramic, glass, glass-ceramic, or silicon substrate, or a printed circuit board. The conductive layer <b>81</b> is covered with an insulating layer <b>82</b> having opening portions so that the conductive layer <b>81</b> is partially exposed from the opening portions.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</figref>, the semiconductor chip <b>500</b> is disposed on the substrate <b>80</b> so that the bumps <b>70</b> contact the conductive layer <b>80</b> exposed from the opening portions. The bumps <b>70</b> and the conductive layer <b>81</b> are electrically connected to each other by reflow or thermo compression bonding. Thus, a face down bonding, i.e., a flip chip mounting can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the bumps <b>70</b> are made of eutectic solder, the melting point of the eutectic solder is approximately 180° C. In this case, preferably, the base constituting the protective member <b>73</b> is made of heat resistant resin such as polymide, and silicon adhesive is used as the adhesive described above. The bumps <b>70</b> can be made of solder including In, a melting point of which is lower than that of eutectic solder. The bumps <b>70</b> and the conductive layer <b>81</b> can be connected to each other in a solid phase by thermal compression bonding at a lower temperature. Otherwise, the bumps <b>70</b> may be connected by silver paste, which is generally used for fixation of chips onto a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, according to the present embodiment, scraps of the protective member <b>73</b> are hardly produced because the dicing-cut is performed along the grooves <b>6</b>. Because the protective member <b>73</b> needs not be removed from the semiconductor chip <b>500</b>, the protective member <b>73</b> can be bonded to the semiconductor chip <b>500</b> firmly. As a result, the separation of the protective member <b>73</b> is prevented. The semiconductor chip <b>500</b> can be electrically connected to the external substrate <b>80</b> by the bumps <b>70</b> exposed from the opening portions <b>72</b> while holding the protective member <b>73</b> thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At the protective sheet region removal step in the present embodiment, it is sufficient to form only the opening portions <b>72</b> corresponding to the bumps <b>70</b>. The grooves <b>6</b> may not be formed. In this case, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is cut along with the wafer <b>11</b> at the dicing-cut step. Even in this case, because the protective member needs not be removed from the semiconductor chip and the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be bonded to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> firmly, scraps and separation of the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The protective sheet <b>1</b> in the present embodiment may have the cap portions <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or be flat as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The movable portions may not be exposed from both surfaces of the semiconductor wafer, but may be exposed from only one surface of the wafer as indicated in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Incidentally, in the embodiments described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>D, the semiconductor chip <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, or <b>500</b> is covered with the protective members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>63</b>, or <b>73</b>, and a peripheral edge portion S<b>1</b> of each protective member is disposed at an inside of a peripheral edge portion S<b>2</b> of each semiconductor chip. This is because the region of the protective sheet <b>1</b> where the dicing-cut is preformed are removed at the protective sheet region removal step to form the grooves <b>6</b> or the opening portions <b>23</b>. Because the peripheral edge portion S<b>1</b> of the protective member is disposed at the inside of the peripheral edge portion S<b>2</b> of the semiconductor chip, it is difficult for the dicing blade to contact the protective member. As a result, scraps of the protective sheet are hardly produced, and the separation of the protective member does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the peripheral edge portions of the protective member and the semiconductor chip are provided at the same position, the protective member is liable to be separated from the chip when the side faces, the upper angular portions, the peripheral portion or the like of the chip are handled or pinched. As opposed to this, in the semiconductor chip <b>200</b> to <b>500</b>, because the peripheral edge portion S<b>1</b> of the protective member is disposed at the inside of the peripheral edge portion S<b>2</b> of the chip not to contact other members, the separation of the protective member hardly occurs during the handling.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14D</figref>, <b>15</b>A to <b>15</b>C, and <b>16</b>A to <b>16</b>C show a method for producing a semiconductor device in a sixth preferred embodiment in a stepwise manner. The sixth embodiment uses a semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>, both surfaces of which are processed as in the third embodiment. The semiconductor device in the present embodiment is used for a capacity detection type acceleration sensor. The semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> has back surface processed portions <b>41</b> as opening portions so that sensing portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>are exposed from front and back surfaces of the wafer <b>11</b>. Each of the sensing portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>is composed of a movable electrode and a fixed electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, an adhesive film (adhesive sheet) <b>42</b> is attached to the back surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> shows a jig <b>4</b> for forming protective cap portions <b>5</b>. The jig <b>4</b> is a disc and has several recesses <b>2</b> on one surface thereof for forming the cap portions <b>5</b>, and several holes (through holes) <b>3</b> communicating with the recesses <b>2</b> and opening at the other surface thereof for vacuum attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a vacuum chuck stage <b>600</b> is disposed in contact with the jig <b>4</b> at an opposite side of the recesses <b>2</b>. The vacuum chuck stage <b>600</b> has a pressure conduction hole <b>601</b> therein. The pressure conduction hole <b>601</b> communicates with the respective holes <b>3</b> at an end thereof and with a vacuum pump (decompressing pump) at the other end thereof. The jig <b>4</b> and the vacuum chuck stage <b>600</b> are sealed by an O-shaped ring <b>602</b>. The vacuum attraction can be performed through the pressure conduction hole <b>601</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, the jig <b>4</b> and the vacuum chuck stage <b>600</b> are heated to a temperature (for example, approximately 70° C.) capable of deforming the protective sheet <b>1</b>. After that, at the jig fixation step, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the surface of the jig <b>4</b> while the vacuum pump is operated to perform the vacuum attraction. Accordingly, as described in the first embodiment, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is deformed to have the cap portions <b>5</b> denting from a side of an adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>toward a surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>along the recesses <b>2</b> by an attraction force imparted from the holes <b>3</b>. At that time, a dicing frame <b>603</b> is disposed on an outer peripheral portion of the protective sheet <b>1</b> to keep flatness of the sheet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, at the wafer bonding step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> and the protective sheet <b>1</b> are positioned to each other substantially in the same manner as in the first embodiment so that the sensing portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>face the respective cap portions <b>5</b>. Then, the front surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> and the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the protective sheet <b>1</b> are bonded together, and then are cooled down to a room temperature while keeping its state.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">After cooled, at a reinforcement plate installation step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, a reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> larger than that of the semiconductor wafer <b>1</b> in diameter is disposed on the back surface of the adhesive film <b>42</b> as a reinforcement plate. The protective sheet <b>1</b> is bonded to the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> at the outer peripheral portion of the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>thereof, whereby the protective sheet <b>1</b> and the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> are fixed to the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b>. As a result, the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> is disposed to face the surface of the jig <b>4</b> where the recesses <b>2</b> are formed via the wafer <b>11</b> and the sheet <b>1</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the jig <b>4</b> is detached from the protective sheet <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, a pressure is applied to the protective sheet <b>1</b> via the jig <b>4</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> (pressurizing detachment step). Specifically, the connection of the end of the pressure conduction hole <b>601</b> is switched from the vacuum pump to a pressure supply apparatus not shown (for example, compressor). The switching of the connection can be performed by switching from a pipe (such as hose) system of the vacuum pump to a pipe system of the pressure supply apparatus by a switch bulb or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The pressure supply apparatus supplies gas such as compressed air or nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) into the holes <b>3</b> through the pressure conduction hole <b>601</b>, thereby performing the pressurization with a pressure of approximately 0.03 MPa. The cap portions <b>5</b> are not deformed by the degree of pressure. In this pressurized state, the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> is detached from the jig <b>4</b> together with the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> and the protective sheet <b>1</b>. At that time, because the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is supported by the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> at the back surface side thereof, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is not deformed (warped) and damaged during the detachment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> shows the state after the detachment is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, at a reinforcement plate removal step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the outer peripheral portion of the protective sheet <b>1</b> is removed by cutting, and accordingly the reinforcement wafer <b>60</b> is removed from the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. Because the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> merely contacts the adhesive film <b>42</b>, those separation can be performed readily. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, a dicing sheet <b>12</b> is attached to the back surface of the adhesive film <b>42</b>, and the dicing-cut step is carried out using a dicing blade <b>605</b>. After that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is removed, thereby dividing the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> into chips. Incidentally, the jig <b>4</b>, the reinforcement wafer (plate) <b>604</b>, the pressure conduction hole <b>601</b>, and the pressure supply apparatus (pressurizing means) cooperatively serve as a wafer detachment apparatus in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to the method in the present embodiment, after the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is bonded to the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the protective sheet <b>1</b> closely fixed to the jig <b>4</b>, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is detached from the jig together with the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. When the protective sheet <b>1</b> is detached from the jig <b>4</b>, a pressure is applied to the protective sheet <b>1</b> through the jig <b>4</b> in a direction in which the protective sheet <b>1</b> is detached.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Accordingly, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> bonded to the protective sheet <b>1</b> can be readily detached under pressure without having any damages. Thus, the wafer detachment can be performed with high workability and high throughput according to the method of the present embodiment. The reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> needs not be always adopted, but is effective to prevent the damages to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> more properly.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The jig <b>4</b> in the present embodiment has the recesses <b>2</b> and the holes <b>3</b> communicating with the recesses <b>2</b>, and the protective sheet <b>1</b> is deformed along the recesses <b>2</b> to have the cap portions <b>5</b>. The cap portions <b>5</b> protect the movable portions of the semiconductor wafer from a surface tension and a pressure of water during the dicing-cut step. On the other hand, the size of each semiconductor chip is decreased year by year, so that the number of the chips formed by one wafer is increased to, for example, 2000 to 3000.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In such a case, the large number of chips requires the same number of cap portions at least. Accordingly, the jig for forming the cap portions is required to have 2000 to 3000 recesses thereon. In this case, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is very difficult to be detached from the jig, because the protective sheet <b>1</b> is dented along the recesses. According to the present embodiment, however, the protective sheet can be readily detached even in such a case, thereby solving the problem described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The jig <b>4</b> may be flat only without having the recesses <b>2</b>, and only holes <b>3</b> may be formed in the jig <b>4</b>. In this case, the cap portions <b>5</b> are not formed to the protective sheet <b>1</b>. This change does not affect the effect of easily detaching the protective sheet <b>1</b> from the jig <b>4</b> by pressurization at all. Although both vacuum attraction and pressurization are performed through the holes <b>3</b>, the jig <b>4</b> can have other holes only for pressurization.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The method of the present embodiment described above does not include the protective sheet region removal step described in the first to fifth embodiments. However, even when the protective sheet removal step is carried out, the effect of the present embodiment can be exhibited as well. For example, the regions of the protective sheet <b>1</b> corresponding to the scribe regions may be removed between the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> and the step shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. Even when the protective sheet <b>1</b> is divided accordingly, because the protective sheet <b>1</b> is fixed to the jig <b>4</b> by vacuum absorption, the divided sheet <b>1</b> is not loosed to be separated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The reinforcement plate of the wafer detachment apparatus is not limited to the reinforcement wafer such as a silicon wafer, but may be a presser plate <b>606</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. In a modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the presser plate <b>606</b> is made of aluminum, and has a surface <b>607</b>, and protruding portions <b>608</b> protruding from the outer peripheral portion of the surface <b>607</b> toward the jig <b>4</b>. The area of the surface <b>607</b> is larger than that of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At a reinforcement plate installation step using the presser plate <b>606</b>, after the vacuum attraction is stopped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the presser plate <b>606</b> and the jig <b>4</b> are fastened together by fixation screws <b>609</b> inserted into screw holes of the presser plate <b>606</b> and the jig <b>4</b>. Accordingly, the surface <b>607</b> of the plate <b>6</b> makes a specific gap with the adhesive film <b>42</b> bonded to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. The front ends of the protruding portions <b>608</b> are supported by the surface of the jig <b>4</b> through the outer peripheral portion of the protective sheet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, at a pressurizing detachment step using the presser plate <b>606</b>, as described above, the pressure is applied to the protective sheet <b>1</b> through the jig <b>4</b> in a direction in which the protective sheet <b>1</b> is to be detached. Accordingly, the protective sheet <b>1</b> is slightly separated from the jig <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. The back surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> abuts the surface <b>607</b> of the presser plate <b>606</b> through the adhesive film <b>42</b>, and is supported by the surface <b>607</b>. Consequently, the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> can be prevented from being damaged more properly. After that, the fixation screws <b>609</b> are unfastened so that the presser plate <b>606</b> is detached from the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> is fixed to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> and the protective sheet <b>1</b> by the adhesive surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the protective sheet <b>1</b> adhering to the outer peripheral portion of the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b>. Therefore, adhesives remain on the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> after usage. When the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> is reused as a reinforcement plate, it is necessary to prevent the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> from being contaminated by the adhesives remaining on the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b>. Because the positioning between the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> and the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> is not easy, the reinforcement wafer <b>604</b> needs to be washed before being reused to prevent the contamination to the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">On the other hand, the presser plate <b>606</b> described above has the protruding portions <b>608</b> at the outer peripheral portion thereof, and the protruding portions <b>608</b> support the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b>. The positioning between the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> and the presser plate <b>606</b> can be easily carried out by utilizing the protruding portions <b>608</b> as a reference. Because no adhesive adheres to the presser plate <b>606</b>, there is no possibility to contaminate the semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> by the adhesive. The reinforcement presser plate <b>606</b> needs not be washed when reused, resulting in simplification of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes in form and detail may be made the rein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, the semiconductor device in the present invention may be composed of a semiconductor chip encapsulated with-resin. In the embodiments described above, the protective members have various structures such as a cap portion, a gap defined by adhesives, and a recess formed by excimer laser, thereby preventing contact with the movable portions of the semiconductor wafer. However, the structure of the protective member is not limited to those. In the embodiments described above, although several protective members are formed from one protective sheet fixed to the jig, the protective members may be individually formed and fixedly arranged on the jig. The embodiments described above can be combined with one another selectively and appropriately. The present invention is not limited to a semiconductor device having a movable portion, but can be applied to other semiconductor devices and methods for producing the devices by cutting a semiconductor wafer covered with a protective sheet into chips by dicing.</p>
