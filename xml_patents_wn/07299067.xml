<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY TO PREVIOUSLY FILED PROVISIONAL APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority to a previously filed Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 60/329,088, entitled “Methods and systems for providing education, instruction and/or training through an electronic network to end user computers and/or hand held devices,” which was filed on Oct. 12, 2001 and is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to methods and systems for electronically providing education, instruction and/or training to remote end-users. Furthermore, the present invention is related to electronic methods and systems for managing remote training activities, including providing accreditation support to professionals, such as, for example, attorneys, accountants, doctors, engineers, nurses, and so forth. More particularly, the present invention is related to methods and systems for carrying out at least one of: remotely providing training, remotely completing training, registering users, authenticating users, managing remote training, and certifying completion of remote training. The present invention is also related to the use of wireless electronic hand held devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), pagers, mobile phones and other data network-enabled portable wireless devices for providing and carrying out remote training.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, seemingly more than in the past, companies are discovering that the general work force is ill-equipped and ill-trained, through a lack of formal training, prior work experience, or participation in apprenticeship programs, to perform necessary job-related tasks. Companies are also discovering that ill-trained workers fall into two major categories including a first category of workers who are new to a company's industry and who have none of the necessary skills to perform tasks of interest on behalf of their companies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to accomplish the task of providing training to employees, many companies send their employees to training programs, which are generally developed and conducted by an in-house training department or may be a function under contract to an outside firm to deliver company-specific content designed to meet company-defined training objectives. A company may also send its workers to training programs, conducted by outside firms or organizations that are designed to generically train employees of a certain industry in a particular subject or task associated with their employment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regardless of who develops, designs, and/or conducts a training program, such programs typically require that an employee attend a number of training sessions at a selected training site. Unfortunately, the training site is often distant from the employee's normal workplace (particularly when the training program is conducted by an outside firm or organization not under contract to the employee's company) and the training sessions are often on days and at times that do not conveniently fit into the employee's schedule. As a result, the employee may have to travel between the training site and the workplace and may possibly have to stay overnight near the training site.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By requiring the employee to travel and to attend training sessions on inconvenient days and at inconvenient times, the employee's personal and professional lives can also be interrupted, potentially upsetting or distracting the employee and reducing his/her ability to learn new skills. Additionally, the employee's company typically incurs direct expenses related to the employee's travel and indirect expenses associated with the opportunity cost of work not being accomplished while the employee is at the training site or while the employee travels to and from the training site.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The professional ranks are also seeing a need for a more efficient means to undergo training. For example, Continuing Legal Education (“CLE”) had found its way to the Internet with well-known service providers such as LawyersLearn.com, Inc. LawyersLearn.com is currently delivering online continuing legal education to attorneys, whom are well known as a group to have limited time to attend live courses. Online CLE is a very reasonable alternative to live CLE seminars as a means for attorneys to complete their annual Minimum Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) requirements (required by most State Bars).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Training material offered by typical training programs can generally include presentations by individuals having certain relevant knowledge or expertise, “how-to” demonstrations, and “hands-on” training exercises. Such training sessions, especially if conducted without adequate company control, are often too long in duration and present too much training material, thereby causing many trainees to lose concentration and, otherwise, causing them to fail to comprehend and absorb the material. To make matters worse, it can be impossible to evaluate a trainee's comprehension and understanding of the training material provided in such training sessions without evaluation. Without feedback, it can be difficult to determine whether or not additional training is necessary and, if so, it can be difficult to conduct immediate reinforcement training. Furthermore, unless a training program is developed in-house or under contract, the content of such training sessions may include material not relevant to, or up to date with, the objectives of a company.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many companies have also attempted to overcome disadvantages associated with trainees having to travel to attend training programs by offering satellite-based instruction at the trainee's place of business. Unfortunately though, satellite-related equipment for satellite-based instruction is relatively expensive and is, therefore, often only available to a trainee in a specially equipped training room. As a result, the trainee must still leave his/her work site (i.e., desk, workstation, etc.) to perform training. Also, because a company may only have one specially equipped training room, the trainee generally must schedule use of the room or attend a scheduled satellite-based training session at time. Some companies have attempted to overcome this scheduling difficulty by recording the satellite-based training sessions on videotape for later playback. Unfortunately though, the use of videotape does not alleviate the need for a trainee to leave his/her workstation in order to travel to a specially equipped training room to view the videotape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With regard to the profession ranks, LawyersLearn.Com, Inc. is among a few CLE providers currently addressing the need for online training and education for busy legal professionals. But the legal community is not alone when it comes to training and educational needs. The medical, financial and technical professions also have a need for continuing education typically delivered through live training seminars, but which could be fulfilled through alternative, remote means.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Computers have become pervasive in all aspects of the business and educational worlds. Computers allow for the generation, storage, retrieval, and interaction with data in useful ways. For example, business uses allow for large amounts of data to be correlated together in the form of databases or spread sheets that allow a user to categorize and view relationships more rapid than was previously possible without the aid of the computer. Computers have also allowed for the dissemination of information either to limited groups or to large audiences via such communication channels as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the Internet. Within this transmission of information, multimedia presentations have expanded to broaden the information dissemination and training opportunities available over LANs, WANs, and the Internet. The Internet has also provided interactivity where an Internet user is able to browse among various web sites for information. Upon finding a site of interest to the user, that site at times is able to glean information from the user that would be helpful for the web provider in a commercial or social context.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hand held computing devices (i.e., hereinafter referred to as “hand held devices” or “handheld devices”) are becoming increasingly popular for storing and maintaining information. One of the first major advances in handheld mobile computer technology was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). A PDA allows a user to access computer related information, yet it can fit into the palm of the user's hand. Utilizing a PDA a user can organize personal affairs, write notes, calculate equations, and record contact numbers in an address book. In addition, PDA's are usually capable of interfacing with a desktop computer, typically through a wired connection. The connection allows the PDA to download information and upload information, with the desktop computer. Later developments have given the PDA wireless capabilities. Wireless capabilities allow PDAs to remotely interact with other PDA's/computers that are not physically connected to the PDA.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although PDA's may be connected to a desktop personal computer or other PDA's via infrared, direct wire, or wireless communication links, PDA's and similar hand held devices can also be linked remotely to networks such as the Internet via local wireless resources, such as RF broadcasts or through available wireless communications techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The most advanced data- and video-enabled wireless communication devices currently available in the marketplace take the form of a PDA (e.g., Palm Pilot™, Handspring Visor™, and Windows CE compatible hand held computers, such as the iPAQ™). Unlike personal computers, which are general-purpose devices geared toward refining and processing information, PDAs are designed to capture, store and display information originating from various sources. Additionally, while a certain level of skill is required to use a personal computer effectively, PDAs are designed with the novice and non-computer user in mind.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present inventor has recognized the convenience that online training and education is bringing to busy workers and professional since the advent of the Internet. The present inventor, however, has also recognized that vast improvements in wireless technology can further enhance current offerings in online education and current training applications that are primarily focused on a “connected” or “wired” world, but physically connected systems and training application will also continue to experience an explosion of growth and improvement as more people begin to fully realize to positive impact that data networks have on everyday life.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present inventor has realized that, what is needed in the training field is an interactive process that enables wireless education, instruction and/or professional development via portable, wireless handheld computer systems. The current invention enables users of hand held computers wirelessly coupled to a network (e.g., Internet) to engage in training (e.g., via a multimedia presentation), be evaluated on the understanding gained by the user after the training (e.g., interactive questioning), and allow for reporting (e.g., certification of course completion) of the results of a user's activity and evaluation to a course administrator. Training data can also be used to verify, evaluate, and enhance training, course, student and/or teacher performance and/or development. Training data can also be used for not only for professional or technical development, but could also be used as credit towards certification or even college credit. The present inventor has therefore developed new methods and systems for providing and managing the provision to and execution of training by users via handheld wireless devices as well as improvements for use of fixed, networked computers (wired devices) already deployed and familiar in the field of online education and training.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The following description is presented to enable persons skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with principles and features disclosed herein. Although preferred embodiments of the present invention are described herein, those skilled in the art can appreciate that a number of varying embodiments may be implemented in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Training Systems</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In accordance with aspects of the present invention, new methods and systems for providing training through/over networks to remote computer/handheld device users will now be described in detail. Training can be provided through networks to computers and hand held devices. Handheld devices can include PDAs, pagers, and wireless phones. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic diagram illustrating a general hardware configuration of a hand held device <b>11</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is provided. Those skilled in the art can appreciate, however, that other hardware configurations with less or more hardware and/or modules may be utilized in carrying out the methods and systems of the present invention as will be further described herein. Those skilled in the art can also appreciate that many components found in handheld computing devices are also commonly found in desktop computing systems, therefore desktop computing system should be considered to be adequately disclosed if associated with any aspect of the present invention related to wired communication and/or electronic networks.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">CPU <b>10</b> of hand held device <b>11</b> performs as a main controller operating under the control of a CPU <b>10</b>. CPU <b>10</b> may be configured, for example, as at least a 16-bit microprocessor. External pins of CPU <b>10</b> are generally coupled to at least one internal bus <b>26</b> so that it may be interconnected to respective components. A SRAM <b>24</b> can be configured as a writeable memory that does not require a refresh operation and can be generally utilized as a working area of CPU <b>10</b>. SRAM (Static RAM) is generally a form of semiconductor memory (RAM) based on a logic circuit known as a flip-flop, which retains information as long as there is enough power to run the device. Font ROM <b>22</b> can be configured as a read only memory for storing character images (e.g., font) displayable on a display <b>18</b>. Examples of types of displays that may be utilized in accordance with display <b>18</b> include a TFT active matrix display, an illuminated LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), or other small-scale displays being developed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">CPU <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiment drives a display <b>18</b>, and can utilize, among other media, font images from Font ROM <b>22</b>, and images transmitted as data through wireless unit <b>17</b> and processed by image-processing module <b>35</b>. An EPROM <b>20</b> can be configured as a read only memory that is generally erasable under certain conditions and can be utilized for permanently storing control codes for operating respective hardware components and security data, such as a serial number.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An IR controller <b>14</b> can be provided with hand held device <b>11</b> and configured as a dedicated controller for processing infrared codes transmitted/received by an IR transceiver <b>16</b> and for capturing the same as computer data. Alternatively or additionally, wireless unit <b>17</b> can generally be configured as a dedicated controller and transceiver for processing wireless data transmitted from and to a wireless remote radio frequency communications network. Note that wireless unit <b>17</b> can be implemented as a separate module or cartridge, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Wireless unit <b>17</b> can thus also b referred to in the art as a wireless “module” or “cartridge.”</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Port <b>12</b> can be connected to CPU <b>10</b> and can be temporarily attached, for example, to a docking station to transmit information to and from hand held device <b>11</b> to other devices such as personal computers or electronic kiosk devices, and so forth, and can be used in order to download training course material. Port <b>12</b> can also be configured, for example, to link with a modem, cradle or docking station, well known in the art to permit network devices, personal computers or other computing devices to communicate with a hand held device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">User controls <b>32</b> permit a user to enter data to hand held device <b>11</b> and initiate particular processing operations via CPU <b>10</b>. A user interface <b>33</b> may be linked to user controls <b>32</b> to permit a user to access and manipulate hand held device <b>11</b> for a particular purpose, such as, for example, viewing images on display <b>18</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that user interface <b>33</b> can be implemented as a touch screen user interface, as indicated by the dashed lines linking display <b>18</b> with user interface <b>33</b>. In addition, CPU <b>10</b> may cause a sound generator <b>28</b> to generate sounds of predetermined frequencies from a speaker <b>30</b>. Speaker <b>30</b> may be utilized to produce music and other audio information associated with video data transmitted to hand held device <b>11</b> from a training provider.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Those skilled in the art can appreciate that additional electronic circuits or the like other than, or in addition to, those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used to construct hand held device <b>11</b>. Such components, however, are not described in the present specification, because many aspects of them are well known in the art. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that hand held device <b>11</b> can be implemented as a specific type of a hand held device, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), paging device, WAP-enabled mobile phone, and other wireless, data-enabled hand held computing devices well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Given the teaching of various embodiments of the present invention, it should be appreciated that a hand held device <b>11</b> can be configured to permit images, similar to television broadcast images, to be displayed on display <b>18</b> for a user to view. Hand held device <b>35</b> thus includes an image-processing unit <b>35</b> for processing images transmitted as data to hand held device <b>11</b> through wireless unit <b>17</b>. A tuner unit <b>34</b>, implemented as either a single tuner or a plurality of tuners, may be linked through internal bus <b>26</b> to CPU <b>10</b>. Additionally, a security unit <b>36</b> may be utilized to process proper security codes to thereby ensure that data transferred to and from hand held device <b>11</b> may be secure and/or permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Security unit <b>36</b> may be implemented as an optional feature of hand held device <b>11</b>. Security unit <b>36</b> can also be configured with software, e.g., algorithm routines or subroutines, that are processed by CPU <b>10</b>, and which prevent wireless data from being transmitted/received from hand held device <b>11</b> beyond a particular frequency range, outside of a particular geographical area associated with a local wireless network, or absent authorization codes or unique signatures (e.g., decryption, encryption, coding, decoding, biometrics and so forth). Note that security unit <b>36</b> can be implemented as a separate security module, such as, for example, a smart card, or cartridge. An example of a module, which may be implemented in accordance with the methods and systems of the present invention, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A security module of this type may be utilized for securing data transmitted from or to a hand held device such as, for example, hand held device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Hand held device <b>11</b> can thus be configured with both wireless and wireline capabilities, depending on the needs and requirements of a manufacturer or customer. Such wireless capabilities include features such as those found in cellular telephone units, in accordance with carrying out embodiments of the present invention. Current examples of hand held devices that can be utilized in accordance with the methods and systems of the present invention include the “PalmPilot™” PDA, manufactured and sold by Palm Computing, the Handspring Visor™, Window CE™ compatible devices, RIM™ Blackberry-family paging devices, Motorola paging devices, and the Symbol™ SPT-family of PDA-type organizer devices. Such hand held devices are mentioned herein for illustrative purposes only and are not considered limiting features of the present invention. Hand held devices which may also be implemented in accordance with the methods and systems of the present invention include hand held devices, such as cellular telephones having viewable display screens for the display of data transmitted through wireless connections networks.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Those skilled in the art can appreciate that although hand held device <b>11</b> is generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, hand held device <b>11</b> can be implemented as a wireless application protocol (WAP) web-enabled cellular hand held device, such as a PDA, wireless phone, pager or a combination thereof. Hand held device <b>11</b> can also be configured with features of combination cellular telephone/PDA devices. One recent example of such a device is the Handspring™ PDA and associated cellular phone attachment module, which is manufactured and sold by Handspring™ Inc. Other such devices include the Palm-Motorola phone, which permits users to access e-mail and store calendars and contact databases.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Regardless of the type of hand held device implemented, it is anticipated that such hand held devices will be adapted to receive and process data via CPU <b>10</b> and image-processing unit <b>35</b> for ultimate display as moving images on display unit <b>18</b>, in accordance with the present invention. Image-processing unit <b>35</b> may include image-processing routines, subroutines, software modules, associated protocols (e.g., XML, HTML, XHTML, CSS WAP etc.), and so forth, in support of and/or to perform data-/image-processing operations.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a pictorial representation of a hand held device <b>56</b> adapted for receiving a module <b>50</b> (or also “cartridge”), in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. Hand held device <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is generally analogous to hand held device <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the only difference being that hand held device <b>56</b> may be adapted to receive a module/cartridge <b>50</b> that can permit it to function according to specific hardware, codes, authorizations and/or instructions contained in a memory location (e.g., a computer chip or magnetic strip) within the module <b>50</b>. Module <b>50</b> can be configured as a smart card, well known in the art. Note that as utilized herein, the term “module” may refer to a physical module, such as a cartridge. The term “module” may also refer to a software module composed of routines or subroutines that perform a particular function. Those skilled in the art can appreciate the meaning of the term module is based on the context in which the term is utilized and environment being described. Thus, module <b>50</b> as illustrated can be generally configured as a physical cartridge or smart card. The term “module” as utilized herein may also refer to a software module, depending on the context of the discussion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">To illustrate the use of a physical module, such as module <b>50</b>, assume that a user may possess several such physical modules or cartridges. One module, when inserted into hand held device <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can instruct hand held device <b>50</b> to function as a standard PDA, such as a handspring Visor™ device. Another module, when inserted into hand held device <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may instruct hand held device <b>56</b> to function as a wireless hand held device for receiving and implementing training for a user through the wireless hand held device.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Those skilled in the art can thus appreciate that hand, held device <b>56</b> can be adapted to receive and cooperate with module <b>50</b>. Additionally, hand held device <b>56</b> includes a display screen <b>52</b> that is generally analogous to display screen <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and display <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

Hand held device <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is generally analogous to hand held device <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, hand held device <b>56</b> can also implement touch screen capabilities through a touch screen user interface integrated with display screen <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Assuming module <b>50</b> is implemented as a smart card instead of a cartridge to provide receiver and/or securing capabilities (e.g., encryption, decryption, coding, decoding, biometric authentication, etc.), it is anticipated that similar features can be implemented in accordance with a smart card to insure that hand held device <b>56</b> includes touch screen user interface and video viewing capabilities. Most smart cards are generally known in the art as credit card sized plastic cards with an embedded computer chip. The chip can either be a microprocessor with internal memory or a memory chip with non-programmable logic. The chip connection can be configured via direct physical contact or remotely through a contactless electromagnetic interface.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Smart cards may be generally configured as either a contact or contactless smart card, or a combination thereof. A contact smart card requires insertion into a smart card reader (e.g., contained within hand held device <b>56</b>) with a direct connection to, for example, a conductive micromodule on the surface of the card. Such a micromodule may be generally gold plated. Transmission of commands, data, and card status takes place through such physical contact points.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A contactless card requires only close proximity to a reader. Both the reader and the card may be implemented with antenna means providing a contactless link that permits the devices to communicate with one another. Contactless cards can also maintain internal chip power or an electromagnetic signal (e.g., RF tagging technology). Two additional categories of smart cards, well known in the art, which are based on contact and contactless cards are the so-called Combi cards and Hybrid cards.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A Hybrid card generally may be equipped with two chips, each with a respective contact and contactless interface. The two chips are not connected, but for many applications, this Hybrid serves the needs of consumers and card issuers. The Combi card may be generally based on a single chip and can be generally configured with both a contact and contactless interface.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Chips utilized in such smart cards are generally based on microprocessor chips or memory chips. Smart cards based on memory chips depend on the security of the card reader for their processing and can be utilized when low to medium security requirements. A microprocessor chip can add, delete and otherwise manipulate information in its memory. Microprocessor-based memory cards typically contain microprocessor chips with 8, 16, and 32 bit architectures.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Wireless network <b>152</b> may also be implemented utilizing teaching/aspects of a CDMA network <b>162</b> or CDMA networks. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is a protocol standard based on IS-95 CDMA, also referred to frequently in the telecommunications arts as CDMA-1. IS-95 CDMA is generally configured as a digital wireless network that defines how a single channel can be segmented into multiple channels utilizing a pseudo-random signal (or code) to identify information associated with each user. Because CDMA networks spread each call over more than 4.4 trillion channels across the entire frequency band, it is much more immune to interference than most other wireless networks and generally can support more users per channel.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Currently, CDMA can support data at speeds up to 14.4 Kbps. Wireless network <b>152</b> may also be configured with a form of CDMA technology known as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA). Wideband CDMA may be also referred to as CDMA 2000 in North America.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Wireless network <b>152</b> can also be implemented utilizing teachings/aspects of paging network <b>164</b>. Such paging networks, well known in the telecommunications arts, can be implemented in accordance with the present invention to enable transmission or receipt of data over the TME/X protocol, also well known in the telecommunications arts. Such a protocol enables notification in messaging and two-way data coverage utilizing satellite technology and a network of base stations geographically located throughout a particular geographical region. Paging network <b>162</b> can be configured to process enhanced 2-way messaging applications.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Unified messaging solutions can be utilized in accordance with wireless network <b>152</b> to permit carriers and Internet service providers to manage customer e-mail, voice messages and fax images and can facilitate delivery of these communications to PDAs, telephony devices, pagers, personal computers and other capable information retrieval devices, wired or wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Current restrictions of such paging networks are not meant to limit the range or implementation of the present invention, but are described herein for illustrative purposes only. It is anticipated that such paging networks, including those based on the TME/X protocol, will be continually developed and that such new developments can be implemented in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Wireless network <b>152</b> may also be configured utilizing teachings/aspects of TDMA networks <b>166</b>. TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) is a telecommunications network utilized to separate multiple conversation transmissions over a finite frequency allocation of through-the-air bandwidth. TDMA can be utilized in accordance with the present invention to allocate a discrete amount of frequency bandwidth to each user in a TDMA network to permit many simultaneous conversations or transmission of data. Each user may be assigned a specific timeslot for transmission. A digital cellular communications system that utilizes TDMA typically assigns 10 timeslots for each frequency channel.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A hand held device operating in association with a TDMA network sends bursts or packets of information during each timeslot. The receiving equipment into the original voice or data/information components then reassembles such packets of information. Current restrictions of such TDMA networks are not meant to limit the range or implementation of the present invention, but are described herein for illustrative purposes only. It is anticipated that TDMA networks will be continually developed and that such new developments can be implemented in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Wireless network <b>152</b> may also be configured utilizing teachings/aspects of Wireless Intelligent Networks (WINs) <b>168</b>. WINs are generally known as the architecture of the wireless switched network that allows carriers to provide enhanced and customized services for mobile telephones. Intelligent wireless networks generally include the use of mobile switching centers (MSCs) having access to network servers and databases such as Home Location Registers (HLRs) and Visiting Location Registers (VLRs), for providing applications and data to networks, service providers and service subscribers (wireless device users).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Local number portability allows wireless subscribers to make and receive calls anywhere—regardless of their local calling area. Roaming subscribers are also able to receive more services, such as call waiting, three-way calling and call forwarding. A HLR is generally a database that contains semipermanent mobile subscriber (wireless device user) information for wireless carriers' entire subscriber base.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A useful aspect of WINs for the present invention is enabling the maintenance and use of customer profiles within an HLR/VLR-type database. HLR subscriber information as used in WINs includes identity, service subscription information, location information (the identity of the currently serving VLR to enable routing of communications), service restrictions and supplementary services/information. HLRs handle SS7 transactions in cooperation with Mobile Switching Centers and VLR nodes, which request information from the HLR or update the information contained within the HLR. The HLR also initiates transactions with VLRs to complete incoming calls and update subscriber data. Traditional wireless network design is generally based on the utilization of a single HLR for each wireless network, but growth considerations are prompting carriers to consider multiple HLR topologies.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The VLR may also be configured as a database that contains temporary information concerning the mobile subscribers currently located in a given MSC serving area, but whose HLR may be elsewhere. When a mobile subscriber roams away from the HLR location into a remote location, SS7 messages are used to obtain information about the subscriber from the HLR, and to create a temporary record for the subscriber in the VLR.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Signaling System No. 7 (referred to as SS7 or C7) is a global standard for telecommunications. In the past the SS7 standard has defined the procedures and protocol by which network elements in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) exchange information over a digital signaling network to effect wireless and wireline call setup, routing, control, services, enhanced features and secure communications.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Improved operating systems and protocols allow Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to provide an environment that displays user options (e.g., graphical symbols, icons or photographs) on a wireless device's screen. Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) is generally a currently available standard that performs as a universal language for data, making documents more interchangeable. XML allows information to be used in a variety of formats for different devices, including PCs, PDAs and web-enabled mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">XML enables documents to be exchanged even where the documents were created and/or are generally used by different software applications. XML may effectively enable one system to translate what another system sends. As a result of data transfer improvements, wireless device GUIs can be utilized in accordance with a hand held device and wireless network <b>152</b>, whether configured as a paging network or another network type, to render images on the hand held device that closely represent the imaging capabilities available on desktop computing devices.</p>

A server <b>183</b> can stream training programs and information from databases <b>185</b> to the end user <b>191</b>, <b>195</b>, <b>196</b>, as shown in block <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where it can be displayed to the user in a format similar to that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Still images such as the text box <b>914</b> can be provided in coordination with the streaming video portion <b>912</b> of the instructional segment. The still images can be displayed in window <b>914</b> along side streaming video shown in window <b>912</b>, using timing codes. Video controls <b>916</b> can allow the user to replay portions of the video, backtrack, pause, stop, or skip ahead as well as control the volume as needed. The timing of the video can be based on the URLs of the slides that are played, which can merely be one example of the timing that may be used. Another method to provide timing can be to cue the slides to the video, or even to be provided independently so the teacher or user can select the next slide when ready. Other navigational bars can allow a user to proceed to the NEXT screen <b>920</b> or go BACK <b>922</b> to the previous content/screen. Additional information regarding the displayed material, the example given being information on a particular professor, can be provided to the user <b>930</b> after his/her selection <b>920</b> (e.g., selection via displayed hypertext associated with the selection using a user interface). The text and graphics of this example are otherwise self-explanatory.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Still images are an option that can supplement a training session or discussion as well as streaming video by highlighting important points in the instructional segment. Such points can include dates of interests, formulas relevant to the discussion, illustrative graphics, or lists of related matters for expanding understanding of a given subject, rules of law, medical principles and other supporting examples. Thus, after selecting a title, the instructional segment streams across the communications channel from the server to the user's computer. As the program begins to stream, a slide presentation can also be presented, which can be linked to the synchronized time code of the program and video. Instructions can also be provided to the user prior to the beginning of the video. The segment can contain questions that are presented at the end of the program, as well as questions that are featured at the beginning or during a training session in order to stimulate the viewer to be aware of specific strategies, theories, and applications. It should be appreciated that all instruction and supporting material can be provided in the form of a compressed data filed to the hand held device, rather than as streaming data segments requiring an active connection to a remote server. Such self-contained instruction delivery and use is generally only limited by the amount of memory available at the hand held device. Improvements in the hand held device and wireless communication fields should be anticipated, and will continue to enhance remote training systems and methods—in particular those where hand held devices are used.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Recording/Certifying/Reporting</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As mentioned above, methods and systems for certifying successful instruction and training completed through a hand held device can be carried out by sending course/training completion results to training authorities and/or course participants. Certification can be provided via electronic means that can include e-mail receipt and/or automatic generation of paper-based communication (e.g., letter/certificate). Administrative reports can be generated based upon a user's accessing the instructional segments in accordance with the present invention. Reports can be used to provide feedback to instructional leaders or administrators that, in an example of a teacher participating in a teacher development and enhancement program, includes the identity of the faculty member accessing the interactive training segment module, the duration of each faculty members time on line, and the results of the comprehension test/activity at the end of each segment or module. The information can further include access dates and times, IP addresses of devices used by trainees, assignment completion, status and exam/assignment verification. Administrators at all levels can use this data to verify, evaluate, and enhance staff development throughout their organizations. For example, in the case where a teacher is providing instructional materials on-line for students, the teacher can receive evaluation reports that can include useful evaluation information. For example, a teacher would eventually like to know how long each student spent on-line viewing the instructional material and how long each individual student took to answer the comprehension exam at the end of the segment. This would allow the teacher to gauge which subjects and concepts the class as a whole is struggling with as well as what subjects each student comprehends or information can allow a teacher to customize feed back to students, which can help students understand instructional content lecture materials for subsequent material that may follow.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The feedback of the evaluation of the user's performance in answering the questions can be given via a direct email to a valid email addressed provided by the user or posted back to the user's personal access point entered via the password and login portion of the site. Of course, the results can be printed and mailed to the user as an option to provide the user with a validated hard copy. Once an instructional segment is completed, the user can be allowed to select another title to review or elect to log out of the system, thereby completing the instructional session. Furthermore, if a user fails to undertake training in a timely manner, reminders can be sent to the user via email, voice messaging, or a letter, to remind the user to complete the programs within the allotted time prescribed.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Security and Authentication</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a system for authentication of a trainee is illustrated. A training Provider that can identify and/or authenticate authorized users of: access to provider systems; access to ongoing training; and the provision of completed training. Authorized users gain access to the system via a hand held device <b>1025</b>, and data is transmitted and received at the server <b>1005</b> through an electronic network <b>1010</b>. Authentication of training can be by username and password procedures known in the art. Training/trainee authentication can also be by use of biometric authentication means, such as a digital file <b>1030</b> taken at the handheld device <b>1025</b> via a biometric measuring device <b>1020</b> (e.g., fingerprint reader). With biometrics systems, a digital file <b>1030</b> representing the user biometric can be matched with a biometric template file <b>1015</b> stored at, or accessible by, the server <b>1005</b>. If the files match, the user is authenticated. Authentication can be used for authorizing all transactions, such as course ordering, and completed course submission.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A biometric identification mechanism <b>1020</b> eliminates the weakest link caused by the human factor. Biometric identification mechanisms, or biometric devices, utilize a scientific technique to identify a user based on compared measurements of unique personal characteristics. Biometric identification mechanisms include two basic categories of biometric measurements. The first category involves measuring a unique characteristic found on a user's body. This may include, but is not limited to, finger and hand geometry, retina and facial images, weight, DNA data and breath. The second category involves measuring a user's behavioral characteristics. This may include, but is not limited to, voice, typing stroke and signature. In general, anything that can be measured on a user that is unique can be used as a biometric measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">While anything that can be measured on a user that is unique can be used as a biometric measurement, the best biometric measurements to use for authentication purposes depend on the consistency over time of the biometric measured. For example, user weight is a biometric measurement. Because weight is a biometric measurement that fluctuates frequently for many people, it is not a desirable biometric measurement to use for authentication purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The general process of using biometric identification mechanisms as an authentication mechanism is as follows. The user is prompted for a particular biometric measurement that is used by a biometric device to generate a value. The value gets stored in a template as stored biometric data. When the user wants to gain access to a resource that is protected by the biometric device, the user is prompted for live biometric data. The live biometric data is matched with the stored biometric data. In reality, the live biometric data and the stored biometric data will never be exactly the same. Therefore, a user must come within some tolerance to pass the biometric device and gain access to the protected resources. As mentioned above, the biometric device utilizes a scientific technique to identify a user based on biometric measurements. The tolerance is typically predetermined by the vendor for the particular biometric device used.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">A specific example of how biometric identification works can be illustrated by a typical fingerprint device. A fingerprint device measures the geometry of a fingerprint. First, a user is prompted for multiple samples of a fingerprint. For each sample, a number of characteristics or measurements are identified. Then, for all of the multiple samples, a number of common characteristics or measurements are identified. The common characteristics or measurements are processed through a unique algorithm that generates a unique template to store the biometric data. When a “live” fingerprint is presented for identification, it is processed through the same algorithm. If the output from the “live” process matches the stored biometric data within a certain tolerance, the user is considered to be authenticated and gains access to whichever resource the fingerprint device is protecting.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A specific example of how biometric identification works when behavioral measurements are involved can be illustrated by a typical signature device. Here, a user is prompted for multiple samples of a signature. For each sample, characteristics or measurements are identified. The characteristics or measurements include the pressure, sequence of events, direction, relative vectors and speed. One example of the sequence of events is to identify that when the user signed his or her signature, that “t” was crossed before “I” dotted. An example of direction is that the user crossed a “t” from right to left. Relative vectors may include the information that “F” is 2.1 the height of “e.” Finally, speed recorded is the time it took the user to sign a signature from start to finish.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As with fingerprint devices, common characteristics or measurements are identified for the multiple samples. These common characteristics or measurements are processed through a unique algorithm that generates a unique template to store the biometric data. When a “live” signature is presented for identification, it is processed through the algorithm. If the output from the “live” process matches the stored biometric data within a certain predetermined tolerance, the user is considered to be authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The use of biometric identification mechanisms as a means for authentication eliminates the forgetful user or unauthorized user access problems can occur through the use of passwords, tokens or smart cards. Because biometric measurements involve either a unique characteristic found on a user's body (e.g., fingerprint) or a user's behavioral characteristics (e.g., signature), it is impossible for users to forget or lose the mechanism of authenticating themselves. Now, it is impossible for User B to “steal” the mechanism of authenticating User A to the enterprise. Likewise, the practices of users sharing passwords and “buddy punching” are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">While the use of biometric devices can conclusively authenticate a user, the inventor of the present invention recognize that methods and systems are needed that utilizes biometric devices to provide effective authentication to training and education organizations engaged in training over a networked environment while not decreasing the productivity a network provides to service providers (enterprise) and customers (end users/trainees).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the present invention overcomes limitations that are typically encountered in online/remote training systems. With the present invention, user authentication protection is used in a networked training environment. The present invention can allow for the following benefits: (1) flexibility to use the right biometric measurement for a training environment; (2) allows trainee/user mobility; (3) flexibility in the degree of authentication required to protect the integrity of educational/training resources; (4) allows remote enrollment of trainees/users; (5) allows remote refreshing of trainee/user biometric templates; and (6) ensures the integrity of training materials (e.g., courses) and test results submitted for courses taken by trainees using remote computers over communication networks.</p>

Also explained to the user is that a course may be re-started if the user must log-out of the system, but does not want to lose his or her efforts. A user must log into the system when a course is initially started. Logging in to the system can require that a user have a registered LOGIN Name and password. A LOGON Name is generally accompanied by providing the account name used to gain access to a computer system. It can also be the act of entering into a computer system when the user computer is automatically recognized (e.g., via cookies, IP address).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">A password is a code used by an authorized user to gain access to a locked computer system or program. Good passwords contain both alpha and numeric characters. Passwords are usually case (upper or lower) sensitive. Either or both the LOGON Name and Password can be replaced by biometric authentication technology (is described in detail above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). But if a course is terminated without completion, the cookies on the users computer will remember where the user was in the course and allow the user to re-enter or rejoin <b>1802</b> the training.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the user is provided with a bio <b>3201</b> on the instructor. The User can also select an audio interview (audio file) of Mr. Moore by selecting the Audio Interview button <b>3202</b>. Optionally, additional photographs can be provided. The user can exit the biography page by clicking on the “Close Window” button <b>3204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As can be seen from the foregoing discussion, training for all fields and professions has found it way through networks. Although most training has previously focused on a “wired” or physically “connected” environment, the following discussion illustrates how the present inventor has taken the online training environment to a level of mobility not presently enjoyed by users of electronic training environments.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Wireless Training</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The previous discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–32</figref> has shown how a connected or “wired” presence can enhance the life of a legal professional required to engage in continuing legal education. The present inventor has now taken training as exemplified through the previously described multimedia examples into a format that can be provided to and utilized by a mobile trainee through a system that can utilize wireless communications and technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, a screen shot for LawyersLearn.com's downloadable software channel for a service provider well known in the art as “AvantGo” is illustrated. Although AvantGO™ can be used for what will be described in the following textual description, it should be appreciated that a direct connection to a private enterprise server can also be used to obtain training capabilities in accordance with the overall teachings herein. AvantGo is but one convenient means to use the present invention and is well known by mainstream hand held device users. AvantGo is a trade name of AvantGo, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">A user that wishes to utilize wireless training will typically download software needed to enable their handheld device to communicate with the training provider enterprise's equipment at a webpage similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. The user click/selects downloadable software <b>3301</b> at or through the service provider website. Once the software is downloaded, the user can select courses from the training provider. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> two courses are shown to be available to the user, “Evidence/Hearsay 101” <b>3302</b> and “Ethics of Corporate Representation” <b>3303</b>. The user selects the hypertext for the course of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">A handheld device user can be required to log into the enterprise server in order to retrieve the course. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the user is asked for a Username <b>3401</b> and Password <b>3402</b>. Once Submitted <b>3403</b>, the user is taken to a training course download page. The web page shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is again associated with AvantGO, but it should be appreciated that proprietary systems can be provided for user access as described and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10–32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates that a user has been identified <b>3502</b> “Welcome lortiz” and is being provided with the option to synchronize his handheld with the website server to obtain new materials or refresh old materials/channels <b>3501</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, it can be seen the user “lortiz” has selected CLE2GO entitled “Evidence” for downloading to the handheld device. The user selects the “download button” <b>3302</b> to carry out the order.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Once the download of the course is completed, the user can be shown another screen, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, where the order for “Evidence” <b>3601</b> is confirmed. With AvantGo, the user is also able to manage other content <b>3602</b> taken into the handheld device. The user can check an item that the user wishes to delete, and can then cause the selection to be deleted <b>3603</b>. It should be appreciated that a similar content management method can be used for a proprietary training enterprise system to manage the addition and deletion of courses and associated training content. It should also be appreciated that courses can be downloaded to a handheld device directly from a wireless network connection using a micro browser, or downloading can be carried out using a synchronization routine and cradle tied to a PC. Such methods and hardware have been well described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Once a user has downloaded a course, the user can begin a course. The user or “trainee” can select the course from a dedicated training file stored in the handheld (e.g., “LawyersLearn.com CLE2GO”). The training course is selected by using the handheld GUI, typically a touch sensitive screen.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Once the user selects the course on the handheld wireless device, the user may be greeted by text such as: “You are about to participate in the latest technological advancement in Continuing Legal Education. This course, designed for palm-style applications and computers, has been created specifically with the hectic schedule of today's practicing attorneys in mind. Now CLE requirements can, be achieved virtually anywhere and at any time. Once you have completed the course, re-sync you palm-style device and your course information and post-test will be transferred to our database automatically. You will receive a course completion certificate via email within 48 hours. Thank you again for allowing us to be your source for CLE!”</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">A course can proceed similarly to the detailed description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15–26</figref>. The electronic handheld course can provide the user with automatic breaks at the 25%, 50% and 75% levels of completion for a one-hour course. When provided a break, the user may be greeted by text like the following: “‘You Deserve a Break’. You have completed [25%/50%/75%] of the course. Stand up! Stretch you legs, and grab something cold to drink before we move on. When you're ready to continue, click on the “next” button. If you wish to log off and complete the course at a more convenient tie, no problem! The training software makes it a snap. If you close your program down and log off, once you re-enter you will automatically be returned to this page where you can click the “next” link below to continue your course.”</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">During a wireless handheld course, the user can be provided with scenarios (e.g., text, or streaming video vignettes). Streaming video can utilize the support of an active connection to the server in order to retrieve video files, assuming the handheld device lack sufficient memory. The user can be asked questions during and after the course. During the course, a judge can provides a ruling (correct/incorrect) for the answer provided by the user. The judge can also provide support for the ruling (e.g., legal rules, case law, reference manuals, etc.). For legal CLE as an example, the judge can provide rules of law, provides another scenario, asks questions of the user, provides additional ruling, and/or provides further rational through case law.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">At completion of the handheld wireless course the user may be present with the following text: “You are almost finished. There are two more things we request that you do in order to help us evaluate the course and to make sure you receive credit for you participation. First is a quick post test consisting of 10 questions. Even though you will not be passed or failed based on your answers, give this a good shot. Keep in mind that a simple “true”/“False” answer may not cover the actual depth of the subject matter in all situations, based upon the course materials each question has a logical and legal basis. Finally, in order to receive credit, please fill out and submit the Evaluation and Certificate of Attendance also on this page.”</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The user can proceed by selecting the &lt;NEXT&gt; button on the screen. The user is then presented with post test questions. The questions can be provided as true/false, multiple choice, or write in answers. If True/False or multiple guess applies, then the user may select the appropriate radial dial button or hypertext associated with the perceived right answer. Course evaluations can be provided where the user can select a range (e.g., drop down buttons rating from 1–7, 7 being the highest). The Evaluation can also seek write-in comments.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Additional information can be requested at the end of a course for a user to get certified, or for a certificate to be completed for the user. The user can be asked for information as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Certificate of Attendance
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0187">Last Name: ______</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0188">First name: ______</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0189">BPR or Professional License #: ______</li>

    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0194">[] You have my permission to share my above comments (in whole or in part) with others.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0195">The user can then submit the information, post test and/or evaluation by selecting a button, for example “[SUBMIT POST TEST].”</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0196">The post test can be submitted immediately where a wireless connection is used, during the next wireless communication session, or during the next synchronization with a PC if the handheld device does not have wireless communication capabilities. Once the training provider receives the course completion information, recording, certification and/or reporting activities, among other processing, can be carried out.</p>
