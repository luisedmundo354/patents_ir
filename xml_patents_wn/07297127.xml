<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to a head and cervical immobilization device. More particularly, the invention is a cervical immobilization device that can be erected from a flat condition to an operable condition to minimize movement of the head of an injured patient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is essential to immobilize the head and cervical portions of patients or accident victims, who have suffered cervical injuries, to prevent further injury during their transport to a medical facility. Several varieties of head and cervical immobilization devices have been used in the emergency medical industry for many years. Some of these devices are designed to fold flat during storage and can be erected when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One type of head immobilization device includes a rigid structural portion that does not require the use of a rigid backboard to transport a patient safely. Examples of this type of device are disclosed generally in U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,748 to Winner, U.S. Pat. No. 4,211,218 to Kendrick, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,999 to Nesbit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another type of head immobilization device is designed to be attached to a rigid backboard. Examples of this type of device are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,711 to Williams discloses a head immobilizer and method for immobilizing. The device of this patent includes flexible members that are bent independently to wrap around the sides of the head of a patient. The members are secured to a base for locking the position of the members. The head supporting members are attached to the base by a hook and loop fastening means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 4,964,418 to Wilson discloses a collapsible cervical immobilization device. This device has a pair of collapsible members with fold lines to enable the members to conform to a patient's head. Rigid support members are then attached to a base by a hook and loop fastening means to restrain the patient's head and neck.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,944,016 to Ferko discloses an adjustable collapsible head immobilizer. This device also has a pair of inner panels that are hinged to a base and conformed to a patient's head. The outer panels have slide tabs that engage a locking mechanism on the base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The devices of the background art can be effective in immobilizing a patient's head and neck during transport to a medical facility. However, these devices have certain limitations, and there is a continuing need in the industry for improved head immobilization devices. For example, the industry lacks a head immobilization device that can be positioned under a patient's head and smoothly erected and locked into an operable position with minimal manipulation of the device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention is a cervical immobilization device comprising a base having two opposite ends, a front edge, and a rear edge. The invention includes a cervical immobilizing member coupled to the base. The cervical immobilizing member includes a center portion and at least one movable arm or, desirably, at least two movable arms. Each of the movable arms is foldable between a first position and a second upright or folded position for engaging a patient's head. Each of the movable arms has a pivotal coupling between an inner edge of the arm and the center portion. Each of the movable arms has an outer edge facing outward toward a respective one of the opposite ends of the base. Desirable embodiments of the invention have at least two opposite movable arms for engaging the patient's head when in the second upright position. A reversible actuating device is coupled to each movable arm of the immobilizing member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The reversible actuating device slides the outer ends of the arms to the second folded position. The reversible actuating device permits at least one of the outer ends of the cervical immobilizing member to slide between the first position toward the center portion and the second upright position for supporting the patient's head. The center portion in desirable embodiments of the invention is a flat panel attached to the base with the arms coupled to the center panel by fold lines. The arms can be moved between the flat or nonoperable first position and the operable second position and back again. The arms can be held in the operable position by friction or by an optional lock. A lock can be permanent, such as certain adhesives, or can be temporary.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The invention is directed to a cervical immobilization device that can be folded from a generally flat position for storage to a folded upright position for engaging the sides of the head of a patient. The head immobilization device of the invention is suitable for use in combination with a rigid backboard and can be attached to the rigid backboard by an adhesive or other affixing means.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Desirable embodiments of the cervical immobilization device include a separate panel to provide a base. The invention can be made from a single panel wherein at least one head-engaging arm folds and unfolds within a frame. The frame provides a base for affixation to a backboard.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The invention includes a foldable cervical immobilizing member with a reversible actuator or “reversible actuating device.” The reversible actuating device is used to fold at least one head-engaging arm. The reversible actuating device permits the head engaging arms to be returned to a flat or storage condition. Desirable embodiments of the reversible actuating device are used to fold and unfold at least one head-engaging arm.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reversible actuating device can be formed in a variety of shapes and from a variety of materials. Certain embodiments of the reversible actuating device place at least one head-engaging arm in an operable position. Other embodiments of the cervical actuating device place at least one head-engaging arm in an operable position and in a nonoperable position. Either embodiment of the reversible actuating device can be used with a lock. The lock can fix the head-engaging arms permanently or temporarily in one or both positions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The reversible actuating device can be made from more than one piece. For example the reversible actuating device can include at least two flexible members. Such an embodiment can use a separate flexible member to fold and/or unfold a separate arm or portion of an arm. The multiple pieces can be of the same or different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments of the reversible actuating device include string and cord. String and cord are flimsy and can be pulled by a user into an operable position to fold at least one arm. The string or cord is reversed or returned to its nonoperable position when a user flattens the arms into a storage position. The flattening of the arms pulls the string or cord back to its nonoperable position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Other embodiments of the reversible actuating device are made from rigid flat or cord-shaped materials including polymer materials, fibrous materials, leather, and metals. Rigid embodiments of the reversible actuating device can be used to fold and unfold at least one arm. For example, a metal wire can be used as a reversible actuating device such that when the wire is pulled at least one arm is folded, and when the wire is pushed at least one arm is returned to a flat or nonoperable position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternative embodiments of the reversible actuating device can be made of a plurality of parts and/or a plurality of materials. One example is the use of a stiff polymer or metal rod attached to flexible member such as a string or a cord. The rod can be rotated to wind the string or cord and fold the arms. Another example is a rack and pinion combination wherein the parts are made of stiff polymer, metal, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The reversible actuating device of the preferred embodiment is desirably used with at least two head-engaging arms and moves these arms between a collapsed, generally flat position and an upright, head-engaging position to support both sides of the patient's head. This embodiment of the reversible actuating device can fold the arms in a substantially symmetrical manner to the upright position to reduce or eliminate twisting of the head and to support each side of the head uniformly. The reversible actuating device is desirably coupled to each of the head-engaging arms so as to fold each of the arms at the same time. This embodiment of the reversible actuating device applies a uniform pressure in opposite directions on each side of the head and prevents twisting of the neck or lateral movement of the head that might occur if the arms were folded one at a time. The reversible actuating device desirably locks the movable arms in the folded position for transport of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The lock for the arms is optional and can include many embodiments. The lock can be permanent or temporary. The lock can be coupled to the arms in order to prevent their movement in relation to the base. The lock can include as an element or operate with the reversible actuating device. For example, a post and hole mechanism, a ratchet and pawl mechanism, a clamp, a screw mechanism, a button-like device, and/or an equivalent locking means can engage or operate with the reversible actuating device to lock the movement of at least one arm.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The cervical immobilization device can be made from various materials having sufficient strength to support the head of a patient. Desirable embodiments are radiotransparent and can be made from a polymer material of varying grades, strengths, and thicknesses depending upon the intended use. Polymer materials can include sheet plastics, injection molded plastics, and/or thermoformed or rotation molded plastics. Durable polymers are desirable if the device is intended for multiple reuse and sterilization is required between uses. The illustrated and preferred embodiment of the device is made of a suitable cardboard material that is treated with a water repellant coating. A cardboard device has the benefit of being sufficiently inexpensive so as to render the device disposable if it becomes contaminated by body fluids or other matter. Alternative embodiments can be made from combinations of materials including sheet metal, canvass or other fabrics, polymers, and cardboard or other paper products.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The cervical immobilization device is placed under the head of a patient with the center portion positioned directly below the patient's head. The center portion is desirably a panel or a padded material of a dimension to accommodate the head of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref> illustrate a first embodiment of the assembled cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> and blank <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the device <b>10</b> includes a first base panel <b>12</b> and a top panel <b>14</b>. The top panel <b>14</b> includes two opposing arms <b>16</b> that can be folded from a flat position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to a folded upright position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A reversible actuating device <b>20</b> is attached to each of the arms <b>16</b> so that the arms <b>16</b> can be folded to an upright position substantially simultaneously and symmetrically. Folding the arms <b>16</b> symmetrically enables the arms to engage both sides of the patient's head simultaneously to minimize movement of the head and spine during stabilization of an injured patient. In further embodiments, the reversible actuating device is able to move the arms to an upright position one at a time. For this purpose, more than one reversible actuating device can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> of the invention is generally made from a suitable sheet material that has sufficient strength to support a patient's head and that can be folded along fold lines or score lines to allow for simple construction. In embodiments of the invention, the head immobilization device is made of corrugated cardboard, although other inexpensive sheet materials such as plastic can be used. In further embodiments, the device can be made from separate components that are coupled together.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> is made, in desirable embodiments of the invention, from the unitary cut blank <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The combination of the operable elements provides a “cervical mobilizing member.” The cervical immobilizing member in this invention can vary widely and provides at least one operable or “movable” arm with or without center panel. A single fold line, for example, can provide a center portion and a pivotal coupling. The ends and edges of the components can be nonlinear.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first panel <b>24</b> has a substantially rectangular shape with outer ends <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. The first panel <b>24</b> is defined by a center panel <b>34</b> and first and second flaps <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The first flap <b>36</b> is coupled to a side edge of the center panel <b>34</b> by a fold line <b>40</b>. Alternative embodiments can have a single fold line for the center portion or panel but desirably include a pad inserted to receive the patient's head. The first flap <b>36</b> includes an intermediate fold line <b>41</b> extending parallel to the first fold line <b>40</b> to divide the flap <b>36</b> into an inner panel <b>42</b> and an outer panel <b>44</b>. Alternative embodiments can use an inner panel of a flexible material, such as canvas or polymer, and an outer panel of a rigid material, such as stiff polymer or metal. A fold line <b>46</b> spaced from the end <b>30</b> of the first flap <b>36</b> forms an end portion <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The outer panel <b>44</b> includes cut lines <b>50</b> to define a tab <b>52</b>. The tab <b>52</b> includes a neck portion <b>54</b> coupled to the outer panel <b>44</b> along the fold line <b>46</b>. A head portion <b>56</b> is coupled to the neck portion <b>54</b> by a fold line <b>58</b>. A second fold line <b>60</b> spaced from the fold line <b>58</b> is also provided on the neck portion <b>54</b> for folding the head portion with respect to the neck portion <b>54</b> as discussed below in greater detail. In desirable embodiments, the head portion <b>56</b> has a width greater than the width of the neck portion <b>54</b>. An aperture <b>61</b> is provided in the head portion <b>56</b>, and an aperture <b>62</b> is provided in the neck portion <b>54</b> as shown. The second flap <b>38</b> is substantially the same as the first flap <b>36</b> so that identical elements are shown with the same reference number for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The center panel <b>34</b> has a first side edge <b>64</b> with a coupling tab <b>66</b> coupled to the center panel along a fold line <b>68</b>. A second fold line <b>70</b> defines an intermediate portion <b>71</b> and a head portion <b>72</b>. The head portion <b>72</b> includes end notches <b>74</b> for engaging a slot.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The center panel <b>34</b> includes a second edge <b>76</b> attached to a coupling panel <b>78</b> along a fold line <b>80</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the coupling panel <b>78</b> has a length substantially equal to the length of the center panel <b>34</b>. The second panel <b>26</b> is coupled to the coupling panel <b>78</b> along a fold line <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The second panel <b>26</b> has a length and width substantially equal to the length and width of the first panel and includes two substantially T-shaped slots <b>84</b>. Each slot <b>84</b> has a longitudinal dimension extending parallel to a longitudinal dimension of the second panel <b>26</b>. The slot <b>84</b> has a width at least equal to the width of the neck portion <b>54</b> of the tab <b>52</b> and less than the width of the head portion <b>56</b>. At the outermost end of the slot <b>84</b>, leg portions <b>85</b> defining the T-shape are provided to define a width at least equal to the width of the head portion <b>56</b>. In a further embodiment, a single slot can be formed having a length to accommodate each of the tabs <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A second connecting panel <b>86</b> is coupled to the second panel <b>26</b> by a fold line <b>88</b> and is positioned opposite the coupling panel <b>78</b>. The connecting panel <b>86</b> includes a longitudinal slot <b>90</b> dimensioned to receive the coupling tab <b>66</b> when the blank <b>22</b> is folded to form the cervical immobilization device <b>10</b>. The third panel <b>28</b> is coupled to the connecting panel <b>86</b> along a fold line <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The third panel <b>28</b> has a longitudinal dimension substantially equal to the longitudinal dimension of the first and second panels. Side edges <b>94</b> of the third panel <b>28</b> extend perpendicular to a rear edge <b>95</b> and have a dimension substantially equal to the width of the second panel <b>26</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the front edges <b>96</b> are angled with respect to the side edges <b>94</b> to converge at a leading edge <b>98</b>. Two longitudinal slots <b>100</b> are cut in the third panel <b>28</b> and have a length substantially equal to the slots <b>84</b>. The slots <b>100</b> have a width at least as wide as the width of the head <b>56</b> of tab <b>52</b> so that the head <b>56</b> can slide freely along the length of the slot <b>100</b>. Alternatively, a single slot can be formed to receive the head <b>56</b> of each tab <b>52</b>. An aperture <b>102</b> is cut in the third panel <b>28</b> proximate the leading edge <b>98</b>. A slit <b>104</b> extends from the aperture <b>102</b> toward the leading edge <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an end panel <b>106</b> that is coupled to the leading edge <b>98</b> of the third panel <b>28</b> along a fold line <b>108</b>. The end panel <b>106</b> has a width substantially equal to the length of the leading edge <b>98</b> and parallel sides <b>110</b> extending perpendicular to the edge <b>98</b>. An elongated slot <b>112</b> extends from an outer end <b>114</b> parallel to the sides <b>110</b> and is generally aligned with the aperture <b>102</b>. The slot <b>112</b> includes side edges <b>116</b> that are substantially straight and terminate in a curved, convex portion <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that the cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> is assembled by folding the first panel <b>24</b> along fold lines <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> onto the second panel <b>26</b> in the direction of arrow <b>120</b> and the tab <b>66</b> is inserted into the slot <b>90</b>. The second panel <b>26</b> is folded along fold lines <b>88</b> and <b>92</b> onto the third panel <b>28</b> in the direction of arrow <b>122</b>. The end panel <b>106</b> is folded along fold line <b>108</b> onto the third panel <b>28</b> and secured in place by a suitable adhesive or fastener. The second panel <b>26</b> is secured to the end panel <b>106</b> by an adhesive. For purposes of illustration, the tabs <b>52</b> are shown folded upward from the plane of the first panel <b>24</b>. During assembly of the cervical immobilization device <b>10</b>, the tabs <b>52</b> are folded downward and inserted through the slots <b>84</b> so that the head portion <b>56</b> is on the opposite side of the second panel <b>26</b> from the first panel <b>24</b>. The slots <b>84</b> and <b>100</b> are superimposed so that the head <b>56</b> of tab <b>52</b> is able to slide.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that the assembled cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> includes the base <b>12</b> formed by the second panel <b>26</b> and a top panel <b>14</b> formed by the first panel <b>24</b>. The flaps <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> of the blank <b>22</b> form the folding arms <b>16</b>. The tab <b>52</b> is folded along the fold lines <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> so that the tab <b>52</b> couples the arms <b>16</b> to the base <b>12</b> in a sliding manner. In this embodiment, the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> is a flexible cord or string. Each end of the cord passes through the apertures <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> of a respective tab <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The end panel <b>106</b> forms a guide on the third panel <b>28</b> for the cord or reversible actuating device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate that the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> passes between the arms <b>16</b> and the base <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> passes around the convex portions <b>118</b> of the end panel <b>106</b> and along the open slot <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the end of the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> passing downward through the aperture <b>102</b> in the third panel <b>28</b> to form a loop <b>124</b>. The remaining portion of the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> that is not passed through the aperture <b>102</b> is pulled through the loop <b>124</b> to form a second loop <b>126</b>. A fastener <b>127</b> can be attached to the cord to secure the two sections of the cord together.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> is desirably used in combination with a rigid backboard (not shown). A double-faced adhesive strip <b>128</b> is provided for this use on the bottom face of the third panel <b>28</b> along each edge as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. A release layer <b>130</b> having a tab <b>132</b> extending outward from the top edge of the device covers the adhesive strip <b>128</b>. The cervical immobilization device <b>10</b> is positioned on a rigid board or other substrate, and the release layer <b>130</b> is pulled to separate the release layer from the adhesive strip and expose the adhesive, whereby the device can be attached to the board.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Desirable embodiments of the release layer <b>130</b> are of a length that is longer than the length of the adhesive strip <b>128</b>. The tab <b>132</b> can be folded along a fold line <b>133</b>, generally at about a 45 degree angle, to extend perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension of the adhesive strip. The release sheet is removed by pulling in a direction generally perpendicular to the adhesive strip. Pulling the release sheet peels the release sheet from the adhesive strip.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> when it is pulled in the direction of arrow <b>129</b> to apply a tension to the ends of the cord coupled to the tabs <b>52</b>. Pulling on the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> in a desirable embodiment applies a simultaneous and symmetrical force to the tabs <b>52</b>. This force also pulls the outer ends of the arms <b>16</b> inward toward the center panel <b>32</b> in the direction of arrows <b>131</b>. As the outer ends of the arms <b>16</b> are drawn toward the center panel <b>34</b>, the arms <b>16</b> fold along the fold lines <b>40</b> and <b>46</b>, whereby the arms <b>16</b> assume a folded, upright, substantially inverted V-shaped configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The inner panels <b>42</b> preferably, simultaneously contact the opposite sides of the patient's head with substantially uniform pressure and tension to eliminate or reduce movement of the patient's head during the folding of the arms <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Alternatively, the reversible actuating device <b>20</b> can be arranged to apply a nonuniform force against each side of the patient's head as needed and to move the arms separately from the flat position to the folded upright position. For example, the cord attached to each tab can be pulled separately to raise separately the respective arm to the folded position. In still further embodiments, at least two separate reversible actuating devices can be included to move selectively a respective number of arms to the upright position at a desired time. One such alternative embodiment (not shown) has four arms wherein two arms are used to support each side of the patient's head.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Once the arms <b>16</b> are folded to the desired upright position, the position of the arms is locked by pulling on the cord or reversible actuating device <b>20</b> to tighten the first loop <b>124</b> around the cord and to pull the cord or reversible actuating device <b>20</b> into the slit <b>104</b>. The slit <b>104</b> is sufficiently thin to grip the cord or reversible actuating device <b>20</b> by friction. The loop arrangement of the cord or reversible actuating device <b>20</b> enables the cord to be cinched and held in a fixed position and to provide infinite adjustment of the position of the arms <b>16</b> with respect to the base <b>12</b>. The inner panels <b>42</b> are desirably able to bend slightly to conform to the shape of the patient's head as the cord is pulled and supports the user's head by preventing movement and preventing further injury. A plurality of fold lines (not shown) can be provided on the inner panels <b>42</b> to allow the inner panels to fold and conform to the patient's head.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">An alternative embodiment of the cervical immobilization device (not shown) can use a rack and pinion and/or tooth and gear configuration to guide the two-directional movement of a reversible actuating device. Such a structure requires a rigid and resilient construction. Such a structure can be more expensive, but the movement of the parts is precise and smooth. Suitable locks or lock means can be use with these embodiments of the reversible actuating device.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Several embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various other modifications and embodiments can be constructed without departing from the various features of the invention. For example, the reversible actuating device in each of the illustrated embodiments is a flexible member that is pulled away from the device to pull the outer ends of the support arms of the device toward the patient's head to a locked position. In further embodiments, the reversible actuating device can be an assembly of flexible or rigid components or levers that can be either pushed or pulled to draw the arms from the flat position to the upright position for engaging the patient's head. In a further embodiment, the reversible actuating device can include a pair of rigid levers extending from the outer ends of the arms and coupled together by a pivot mechanism at the center of the device. An arm or lever can be attached to the pivot device that can be pulled or pushed causing a scissor-like action of the rigid members to pull the outer ends of the flaps toward the center of the device. In a similar manner, the locking device can be other arrangements for fixing the position of the arms in the folded position during use.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The invention is a cervical immobilization device that collapses into a flat condition for storage and smoothly and folds into an operable condition wherein cervical immobilization members become upright and engage the sides of a patient's head. Desirable embodiments of the invention can be economically manufactured from inexpensive materials, rendering the device disposable if contaminated by a patient's body fluids. The device can be attached to a rigid backboard. Desirable embodiments of the invention have an reversible actuating device that enables head-engaging arms to engage simultaneously and symmetrically a patient's head when folded into an operating position so as to eliminate or reduce movement of the patient's head. The preferred reversible actuating device can be operated by the user with one hand to engage symmetrically both sides of the patient's head to prevent twisting of the head and to support the patient's head during transport.</p>
