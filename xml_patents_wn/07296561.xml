<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosures of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-377517, filed Dec. 27, 2004, and Japanese Laid Open Patent No. 2003-336520, filed May 20, 2002 and published Nov. 28, 2003, including their specifications, drawings and claims, are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Described herein is an engine control apparatus, and in particular, an apparatus for control of an engine during deceleration.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A turbo-supercharger driven by a turbine provided in the path of engine exhaust is known to improving the output of an engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The efficiency of the compressor of such a turbo-supercharger can be, as is commonly known, indicated by parameters comprising the pressure ratio of the top and bottom flow of the compressor, and the gas flow rate that passes the compressor. When the pressure ratio deviates from the appropriate pressure ratio range (normal operation range) that corresponds to the gas flow rate, and enters an abnormal operation range, undesirable phenomena, such as surging, choking or over-speeding of the turbine, are experienced, whereby the operating condition of the compressor should be established so as not to enter the abnormal operation range.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, when sudden deceleration is effected by releasing the accelerator pedal during high-speed steady driving, the fuel injection rate is decreased, thereby causing a rapid reduction in the exhaust flow rate. During this time, the operating condition of the compressor sometimes may enter the abnormal operation range, thereby generating surging.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, an EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) device for introducing only part of the exhaust into the inlet path according to the driving conditions, is known, in which a pipe connecting between the exhaust path and an inlet path (EGR pipe) and an EGR valve that controls the flow rate of the EGR pipe are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such an EGR device, the exhaust is introduced to the inlet path due to the differential pressure between the exhaust path and the inlet path, and then the aperture (open degree) of the EGR valve is adjusted so that the amount of EGR increases when the driving conditions shift to the low load side. However, when a vehicle speed is reduced in the normal driving condition so that the fuel is reduced by releasing the accelerator pedal, the exhaust pressure decreases, and therefore, the EGR gas may backflow via the EGR pipe into the turbine so that it may cause a surge noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present engine control apparatus of a vehicle having an EGR pipe and a post-exhaust process apparatus prevents such surging during deceleration that accompanies a reduction of the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present engine control apparatus comprises a turbo-supercharger driven by the exhaust energy of the engine, an EGR path connecting the exhaust path and the inlet path of the engine, an EGR valve for adjusting the cross-section of the duct of the EGR path, a means for detecting deceleration of the vehicle, and a fuel cutoff control unit for detecting deceleration of the vehicle, and the fuel cutoff control is activated to reduce the rate of the fuel injection, the EGR valve is closed during the period of vehicle deceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The EGR valve is closed during the deceleration period to prevent a backflow of the EGR gas in the EGR path due to the sudden reduction of the exhaust pressure caused by the fuel cutoff control during the deceleration period, or to prevent the flow of new intake air from the inlet path to the exhaust path via the EGR path when the exhaust pressure falls below the intake air pressure. Surging and surging noise during the deceleration period can thus be prevented.</p>

A description of the detailed control method is omitted because it is not directly related to the present control apparatus. In addition, when a predetermined condition is fulfilled during deceleration due to release of the acceleration pedal, a fuel cutoff control is exercised, that is, the fuel injection rate is reduced.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the NO<sub>x </sub>trapped during normal operation (lean combustion) reaches the limit of the tolerance level, and when it enters the area where the predetermined exhaust temperature can be secured, the engine controller <b>31</b> controls the air excess coefficient to create a rich combustion (rich spike), in order to reduce and purify the trapped No<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, the NO<sub>x </sub>trap catalyzer <b>29</b> is contaminated by SOX (sulfur oxides) contained in the exhaust at a minute level.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, the variable nozzle <b>24</b> is controlled so that it opens upon commencement of fuel cutoff control. The efficiency of the compressor <b>23</b> of the variable capacity turbo-supercharger <b>21</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> with the adjusted flow rate Q* (intake air rate that passes through the compressor) as the x-axis, and the pressure ratio (pressure ratio of the top and bottom flow of the compressor) as the y-axis. As is publicly known, if the compressor <b>23</b> compressing intake air is operated in the area outside (abnormal operation range) of the shaded portion (normal operation range) undesirable phenomena such as surging, choking, and over-speeding of turbine <b>22</b>, are experienced, and therefore the operating condition of the compressor <b>23</b> should be established so that it does not enter the abnormal operation range. For example, during the rapid deceleration that accompanies fuel cutoff control, the rotational speed of the turbine <b>22</b>, or more particularly, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>23</b>, rapidly decreases and the adjusted flow rate Q* is reduced. In addition, the rate of reduction of the pressure ratio is moderate compared to the adjusted flow rate Q*. Therefore, the operational points move towards the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and sometimes jump into the abnormal operational range. In order to prevent this, in general, the aperture of the variable nozzle <b>24</b> is reduced in size so that it maintains the rotational speed of the compressor <b>23</b> even if the exhaust flow rate is reduced. However, when the inlet throttle valve <b>6</b> is closed, if the rotational speed of the compressor <b>23</b> is maintained, the pressure downstream of the compressor <b>23</b> may increase; in other words, the pressure ratio increases and sometimes jumps into the abnormal operational range.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Therefore, in the present embodiment, the generation of surging can be prevented by enlarging the aperture of the variable nozzle <b>24</b> upon commencement of fuel cutoff control, thereby reducing the rotational speed of the compressor <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The inlet throttle valve <b>18</b> is kept closed even after the differential pressure inverse period (t<b>0</b> to t<b>3</b>) and until fuel cutoff control is completed, and the EGR valve <b>6</b> is opened and variable nozzle <b>24</b> is closed upon completion of the differential pressure inverse period. This prevents generation of surging due to a rapid increase in the intake air pressure when the inlet throttle valve <b>18</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The present control apparatus can be applied to a diesel engine with a post-exhaust processor.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">While the present control apparatus has been described in connection with an embodiment thereof, this is by way of illustration and not of limitation, and the appended claims should be construed as broadly as the prior art will permit.</p>
