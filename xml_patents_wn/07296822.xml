<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus including an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device for helping to protect a vehicle occupant upon the occurrence of an event such as a vehicle collision and/or a vehicle rollover.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to inflate an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device to help protect a vehicle occupant upon the occurrence of an event such as a vehicle collision or rollover. One particular type of inflatable vehicle occupant protection device is an inflatable driver or passenger air bag that is inflatable between the occupant and an instrument panel and/or steering wheel of the vehicle. Another type of inflatable vehicle occupant protection device is an inflatable side curtain that inflates away from the vehicle roof to a position between the vehicle occupant and a side structure of the vehicle. Other known types of inflatable vehicle occupant protection devices include seat-mounted side impact air bags, inflatable knee bolsters, and inflatable seat belts. The known inflatable vehicle occupant protection devices are inflated from a deflated condition by inflation fluid provided by an inflator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to an apparatus for helping to protect an occupant of a vehicle that has a roof and a windshield. The apparatus includes an inflatable windshield curtain inflatable away from the vehicle roof to a position between the windshield and a vehicle occupant. An inflation fluid source is actuatable to provide inflation fluid for inflating the windshield curtain. The windshield curtain includes overlying panels interconnected to define an inflatable volume of the windshield curtain. The windshield curtain includes a pleated portion wherein at least one of the panels has portions folded over to form at least one pleat in the panel. The windshield curtain includes connections that interconnect overlying folded portions of the one panel along the pleat. Portions of the pleat between the connections are unfoldable to allow expansion of the pleated portion upon inflation of the windshield curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention also relates to an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device comprising a first panel of a material having a predetermined pattern (i.e., size and shape) and a second panel of material having a pleated condition in which portions of the second panel are folded over to form pleats. The second panel, when folded in the pleated condition, has a pattern about the same as the predetermined pattern of the first panel. The protection device also includes means for interconnecting the first and second panels along a perimeter of the panels to define an inflatable volume of the protection device. The interconnecting means also interconnects overlying ones of the folded over portions of the second panel that form the pleats.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention also relates to an apparatus including an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device inflatable between a part of a vehicle and a vehicle occupant. The apparatus also includes an inflation fluid source actuatable to provide inflation fluid for inflating the inflatable vehicle occupant protection device. The inflatable vehicle occupant protection device includes overlying panels interconnected to help define an inflatable volume of the inflatable vehicle occupant protection device. At least one of the overlying panels includes at least one pleat comprising folded over portions of the one panel. The folded over portions are interconnected at opposite ends of the pleat.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention further relates to a method for constructing an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device. The method includes the steps of providing a first panel of a material having a predetermined pattern and providing a second panel of material having a predetermined pattern larger than the first panel. The method also includes the step of folding pleats in the second panel such that the pattern of the second panel is about the same as the pattern of the first panel. The method also includes the step of placing the folded second panel in an overlying relationship with the first panel and interconnecting the panels along their perimeters to define an inflatable volume of the inflatable vehicle occupant protection device. The method includes the further step of interconnecting overlying portions of the second panel folded over to form the pleats.</p>

Also, in this description of the present invention, when reference is made to a lateral direction in or across the vehicle <b>12</b>, it is meant to describe the direction measured generally perpendicular to the central axis <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This lateral direction may also be described as the direction measured generally along the width of the vehicle, perpendicular to the direction of straight forward vehicle travel, or horizontally as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>, as representative of a first embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus <b>10</b> helps to protect an occupant of a vehicle <b>12</b>. The vehicle <b>12</b> includes side structure <b>16</b> that extends longitudinally along the length of the vehicle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, it will be appreciated that the vehicle <b>12</b> includes a side structure <b>16</b> that extends along a driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle and a side structure that extends along a passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. Each of the side structures <b>16</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> and passenger side <b>22</b> includes an A pillar <b>30</b>, a B pillar <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–3</figref>), and side windows <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, the vehicle <b>12</b> also includes a roof <b>40</b> that extends laterally across the vehicle <b>12</b> from the side structure <b>16</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> to the side structure on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle. The roof <b>40</b> also extends longitudinally along the length of the vehicle <b>12</b> from the A pillar <b>30</b> past the B pillar <b>32</b>. The roof <b>40</b> includes roof rails <b>42</b> that extend along the intersection of the side structure <b>16</b> and the roof on the driver side <b>20</b> and passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the first embodiment, the vehicle <b>12</b> includes a driver side front impact air bag <b>44</b> mounted to a steering wheel <b>46</b> of the vehicle on the driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle. The front impact air bag <b>44</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in an inflated and deployed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–5</figref>, the vehicle <b>12</b> further includes a windshield <b>50</b>. The windshield <b>50</b> extends laterally across the vehicle <b>12</b> from the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> to the A pillar on the passenger side <b>22</b>. The windshield <b>50</b> covers a windshield opening <b>68</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The windshield opening <b>68</b> is defined at an upper extent by the forward edge <b>62</b> of the vehicle roof <b>40</b> and at a lower extent generally by the instrument panel <b>64</b> and/or hood <b>60</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The windshield opening <b>68</b> is defined at lateral extents by the A pillars <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> and passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The windshield <b>50</b> has a first edge portion <b>52</b> that extends along the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> from a position adjacent or near the intersection of the A pillar and the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent or near the intersection of the A pillar and the instrument panel <b>64</b> and/or hood <b>60</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The windshield <b>50</b> also has a second edge portion <b>54</b> opposite the first edge portion <b>52</b>. The second edge portion <b>54</b> extends along the A pillar <b>30</b> on the passenger side <b>22</b> from a position adjacent or near the intersection of the A pillar and the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent or near the intersection of the A pillar and the instrument panel <b>64</b> and/or hood <b>60</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The windshield <b>50</b> extends from the roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent or near the instrument panel <b>64</b> and/or hood <b>60</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The windshield <b>50</b> has an upper edge <b>56</b> and an opposite lower edge <b>58</b> that extend laterally in the vehicle <b>12</b> between the first and second edge portions <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. The upper edge <b>56</b> extends laterally across the vehicle <b>12</b> along the forward edge <b>62</b> of the vehicle roof <b>40</b> from the A pillar on the driver side <b>20</b> to the A pillar on the passenger side <b>22</b>. The lower edge <b>58</b> extends laterally across the vehicle <b>12</b> from the A pillar on the driver side <b>20</b> to the A pillar on the passenger side <b>22</b>. The lower edge <b>58</b> extends adjacent or near the instrument panel <b>64</b> and/or hood <b>60</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The apparatus <b>10</b> includes an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device in the form of an inflatable windshield curtain <b>14</b> that is mounted adjacent the forward edge <b>62</b> of the vehicle roof <b>40</b>. An inflator <b>70</b> is connected in fluid communication with the windshield curtain <b>14</b> through a fill tube <b>72</b>. The inflator <b>70</b> is actuatable to provide inflation fluid for inflating the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fill tube <b>72</b> has a first portion <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for receiving fluid from the inflator <b>70</b>. The fill tube <b>72</b> has a second portion <b>76</b> disposed in the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. The second portion <b>76</b> of the fill tube <b>72</b> has a plurality of openings (not shown) that provide fluid communication between the fill tube <b>72</b> and the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the fill tube <b>72</b> could, however, be omitted, in which case the inflator <b>70</b> may be connected in fluid communication with the windshield curtain <b>14</b> directly or via a manifold (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The inflator <b>70</b> contains a stored quantity of pressurized inflation fluid (not shown) in the form of a gas for inflating the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. The inflator <b>70</b> alternatively could contain a combination of pressurized inflation fluid and ignitable material for heating the inflation fluid, or could be a pyrotechnic inflator that uses the combustion of gas-generating material to generate inflation fluid. As a further alternative, the inflator <b>70</b> could be of any suitable type or construction for supplying a medium for inflating the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–7</figref>, the inflator <b>70</b> is positioned adjacent the roof rail <b>42</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The fill tube <b>72</b> thus extends from the inflator <b>70</b> along a portion of the roof rail <b>42</b> and into the windshield curtain <b>14</b> along the intersection of the forward edge <b>62</b> of the vehicle roof and the upper edge <b>56</b> of the windshield <b>50</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that the inflator <b>70</b> may have alternative positions in the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the inflator <b>70</b> may be positioned adjacent the roof rail <b>42</b> on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. This is illustrated at <b>70</b><i>a</i>. As another example, the inflator could be positioned in or on the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> or passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>, as indicated at <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c</i>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As a further example, the inflator could be positioned centrally on the roof <b>40</b>, as indicated at <b>70</b><i>d</i>, in which case the inflator may have a T-shaped connection with the fill tube <b>72</b>. This central location may also be advantageous in a configuration of the apparatus in which the fill tube <b>72</b> is omitted and the inflator <b>70</b> is connected to the windshield curtain <b>14</b> directly or via a manifold. Yet another example (not shown) is to position the inflator <b>70</b> within the instrument panel <b>64</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The apparatus <b>10</b> has a stored condition in which the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is stored in a deflated condition. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>. When the apparatus <b>10</b> is in the stored condition, the deflated windshield curtain <b>14</b> has an elongated configuration and extends along the forward edge <b>62</b> of the vehicle roof <b>40</b> adjacent or near the upper edge <b>56</b> of the windshield <b>50</b>. In the stored condition, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> extends from the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> to the A pillar on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is placed in the deflated and stored condition by rolling the curtain in a direction indicated by the curved arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This is referred to herein as an “outboard roll” of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. According to this outboard roll, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is placed in the stored condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by initially rolling the lower edge <b>102</b> of the curtain in a direction outboard of the vehicle <b>12</b> toward the windshield <b>50</b> and continuing to roll the curtain in this direction. Alternative methods, however, may be used to place the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in the stored position. For example, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be folded in a back-and-forth manner sometimes referred to as a “fan fold” or “Z fold.” As another example, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be folded over and then rolled into the stored position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is in the deflated and stored condition, the curtain is positioned between the vehicle roof <b>40</b> and a headliner <b>92</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The headliner <b>92</b> may be partially supported or covered by a vehicle trim piece <b>94</b>. The trim piece <b>94</b> may, for example, extend along the intersection of the vehicle roof <b>40</b> and the windshield <b>50</b>. The apparatus <b>10</b> may also include a housing (not shown) that houses the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in the stored condition between the roof <b>40</b> and the headliner <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> comprises first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> that are arranged in an overlying manner. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may be interconnected to form a perimeter connection <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>) that extends along a perimeter <b>88</b> of the panels. The first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may also be interconnected to form connections <b>90</b> within the perimeter <b>88</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. The perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the connections <b>90</b> may help define inflatable chambers of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> may be interconnected in a variety of manners. For example, in a woven construction, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be formed by weaving the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> simultaneously and interweaving the panels to form the perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the connections <b>90</b> as single layers of fabric. This can be accomplished by using, for example, a Jacquard or Dobby weaving machine.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, means such as stitching, dielectric sealing, ultrasonic bonding, heat sealing, and adhesives may be used to interconnect the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> in order to form the perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the connections <b>90</b>. In these alternative constructions, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be formed by interconnecting two separate fabric pieces together along the perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the connections <b>90</b>. As a further alternative, a single piece of fabric may be folded over to form the overlying first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. In this alternative, the fold would form part of the perimeter connection <b>86</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The windshield curtain <b>14</b> may have a variety of material constructions. For example, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be constructed of a woven fabric, such as nylon, that is coated with a gas impermeable material, such as urethane or silicone. The windshield curtain <b>14</b> thus may have a substantially gas-tight construction. Other materials, such as elastomers, plastic films, or combinations thereof, may also be used to construct the windshield curtain <b>14</b>, in which case the curtain may have a non-woven construction. The materials used to construct the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may also be single or multi-layered materials.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, the perimeter connection <b>86</b>, and the connections <b>90</b> may be coated using a laminate film, slurry, and/or a spray coating, such as silicone, urethane, or other suitable material, in order to achieve a substantially gas-tight construction. This helps to prevent gas from permeating directly through the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, or through the perimeter connection <b>86</b> or connections <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The perimeter <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is defined by upper and lower edges <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, respectively, of the curtain and first and second end portions <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, respectively, of the curtain that are spaced apart horizontally along the upper and lower edges. The perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the connections <b>90</b> help define an inflatable volume <b>110</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. The first end portion <b>104</b> includes a first edge <b>112</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> that extends between the upper edge <b>100</b> and the lower edge <b>102</b> of the curtain. The second end portion <b>106</b> includes a second edge <b>114</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> that extends between the upper edge <b>100</b> and the lower edge <b>102</b> of the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inflatable volume <b>110</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may have a variety of configurations defined by the shape of the perimeter connection <b>86</b> and the arrangement of the connections <b>90</b> within the perimeter connection. One such configuration is illustrated in the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–7</figref>. Those skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the configuration of the inflatable volume <b>110</b> could vary without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The windshield curtain <b>14</b> is adapted to receive one or more fastening devices <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), such as clamps or brackets, for helping to connect the windshield curtain to the vehicle <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <b>10</b> includes three fastening devices <b>120</b> for connecting the windshield curtain <b>14</b> and the fill tube <b>72</b> to the vehicle roof <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–7</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> also includes a pair of slider mechanisms <b>122</b> for helping to guide and position the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in the vehicle <b>12</b> upon inflation and deployment of the curtain. A slider mechanism <b>122</b> is provided on the A pillar <b>30</b> on both the driver side <b>20</b> and passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The first and second edges <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> are connected to the slider mechanisms <b>122</b> on their respective A pillars <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the slider mechanism <b>122</b> on the A pillar <b>30</b> of the driver side <b>20</b> has a shortened length to correspond with the length of the first edge <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative means may be provided for helping to guide and position the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in the vehicle <b>12</b>. For example, tethers (elastic or inelastic), piston/cylinder devices, devices actuatable to cause rotation of a member such as a spool to wind up a flexible member, or any other suitable device, could help guide and position the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in the vehicle <b>12</b>. Also, it will be appreciated that the slider mechanisms <b>122</b> could be eliminated and the windshield curtain <b>14</b> could be connected directly to the A pillars <b>30</b> by suitable means, such as fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> has a driver side portion <b>130</b> and a passenger side portion <b>132</b>. The driver side portion <b>130</b> extends across the windshield <b>50</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> from the driver side A pillar <b>30</b> to a vehicle centerline <b>134</b>. The passenger side portion <b>132</b> extends across the windshield <b>50</b> on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> from the passenger side A pillar <b>30</b> to the vehicle centerline <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are illustrated schematically in a condition prior to being interconnected to form the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> and each of the panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> has a width identified at “W” and a length identified at “L.” The width W of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> extends laterally across the vehicle <b>12</b> when the curtain is installed in the vehicle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The length L of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> extends perpendicular to the width W of the curtain. When the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is installed in the vehicle <b>12</b>, length L of the curtain extends along the windshield <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first panel <b>80</b> has a driver side portion <b>140</b> and a passenger side portion <b>142</b>. The second panel <b>82</b> has a driver side portion <b>144</b> and a passenger side portion <b>146</b>. When the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are interconnected, the driver side portions <b>140</b> and <b>144</b> combine to help define the driver side portion <b>130</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> and the passenger side portions <b>142</b> and <b>146</b> combine to help define the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the present invention, at least one of the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> has a pleated construction. The pleats are provided in an area or region of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> where it is desired to provide an increase in the inflated depth of the curtain, as described in further detail below. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–8</figref>, this region of increased inflated depth lies in the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> has a length L that is greater than the length L of the passenger side portion <b>142</b> of the first panel <b>80</b>. The passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> is folded or otherwise arranged to form pleats. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, pleats <b>150</b> are formed in the passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> by folding the second panel along fold lines <b>152</b>. More specifically, the pleats <b>150</b> are formed in a region of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> identified at <b>156</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the region <b>156</b> comprises a lower region of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this description, a “pleat” is meant to describe a portion of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in which a curtain panel is folded over or doubled onto itself. This is detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the pleat <b>150</b> includes three overlying portions of the second panel <b>82</b>. The panel <b>82</b> is folded along a first fold line <b>200</b> to form a first portion <b>202</b> that overlies a second portion <b>204</b>. The panel <b>82</b> is also folded along a second fold line <b>206</b> to form a third portion <b>208</b> that overlies the first portion <b>202</b> opposite the second portion <b>204</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9C</figref>, stitching <b>154</b> connects the portions <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>208</b> of the pleats <b>150</b> at opposite ends of the pleat.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A–9C</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is formed from separate, overlying first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> has a predetermined pattern, i.e., size and shape. The pattern of the passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> is selected so that the second panel and the first panel <b>80</b> have similar or identical patterns after the pleats have been formed in the second panel. More specifically, the passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> has a length L that is greater than the length L of the passenger side portion <b>142</b> of the first panel <b>80</b>. The pleats <b>150</b> are folded perpendicular to the length L. The pleats <b>150</b> thus reduce the length L of the passenger side portion <b>146</b> to be about the same as the length L of the unfolded passenger side portion <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Once the pleats <b>150</b> are formed, the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are positioned overlying each other and are stitched together. The stitching <b>154</b> interconnects the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> and also extends through the pleats <b>150</b> to interconnect the overlying pleated portions of the second panel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stitching <b>154</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> forms the perimeter connection <b>86</b> and also secures and maintains the pleats <b>150</b> in the second panel <b>82</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that the stitching used to secure the pleats <b>150</b> may be separate from the stitching used to form the perimeter connection <b>86</b>. It will be further appreciated that, in the alternative constructions of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> discussed above, e.g., a woven construction or a folded-over panel construction, separate stitching may be used to maintain the pleats <b>150</b>. In fact, the pleats <b>150</b> may be maintained by any suitable means, such as an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the first and second panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are shown spaced from each other. Also, the folded portions of the passenger side portion <b>146</b> of the second panel <b>82</b> are shown spaced from each other. This is for the purpose of providing clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. It should be recognized that the panels <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> and the pleats <b>150</b> may be pressed flat against each other so that the windshield curtain may be folded and/or rolled into the stored condition (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The vehicle <b>12</b> includes a sensor mechanism <b>200</b> (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) for sensing an event for which inflation of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is desired, such as a vehicle collision and/or a vehicle rollover. Upon sensing the occurrence of the event for which inflation of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is desired, the sensor mechanism <b>200</b> provides an electrical signal over lead wires <b>202</b> to the inflator <b>70</b>. The electrical signal causes the inflator <b>70</b> to be actuated in a known manner. The inflator <b>70</b> discharges fluid under pressure into the fill tube <b>72</b>. The fill tube <b>72</b> directs the fluid into the inflatable volume <b>110</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The windshield curtain <b>14</b> inflates under the pressure of the inflation fluid from the inflator <b>70</b>. The windshield curtain <b>14</b> inflates and deploys away from the roof <b>40</b> and along the windshield <b>50</b> in a generally downward and forward direction as indicated generally by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–4</figref> into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2–4</figref> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2–4</figref>, the windshield curtain <b>14</b> when inflated, extends laterally across the vehicle from the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> to the A pillar on the passenger side <b>22</b>. The first edge <b>112</b> may overlie the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The second edge <b>114</b> may overlie the A pillar <b>30</b> on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The upper edge <b>100</b> is positioned adjacent the forward edge <b>62</b> of the roof <b>40</b> and the upper edge <b>56</b> of the windshield <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, when the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is in the inflated position, the driver side portion <b>130</b> extends laterally in the vehicle <b>12</b> from the A pillar <b>30</b> on the driver side <b>20</b> to about the center line <b>134</b> of the vehicle. The driver side portion <b>130</b> extends vertically in the vehicle <b>12</b> from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position spaced above the instrument panel <b>64</b>, in the area of an upper extent of the steering wheel <b>46</b> and driver side air bag <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is in the inflated position, the passenger side portion <b>132</b> extends laterally in the vehicle <b>12</b> from the A pillar <b>30</b> on the passenger side <b>22</b> to about the center line <b>134</b> of the vehicle. The passenger side portion <b>132</b> extends vertically in the vehicle <b>12</b> from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent the instrument panel <b>64</b>. The passenger side portion <b>132</b> extends below an upper surface <b>160</b> of the instrument panel <b>64</b> and adjacent a front surface <b>162</b> of the instrument panel.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the instrument panel <b>64</b> has a distinct upper surface <b>160</b> that extends generally horizontally in the vehicle <b>12</b> and a distinct front surface <b>162</b> that extends generally vertically in the vehicle and intersects the upper surface. Those skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the instrument panel <b>64</b> may have a variety of alternative constructions in which the upper surface <b>160</b> and front surface <b>162</b> are not as distinct and/or do not extend in the respective horizontal and vertical directions in the vehicle <b>12</b>. The instrument panel <b>64</b> could, for example, have a curved or contoured configuration free from distinct upper and front surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This being the case, it will be appreciated that the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>, when inflated, extends along the windshield <b>50</b> from the roof <b>40</b> to the instrument panel <b>64</b>, and then extends along the contour of the instrument panel <b>64</b>. The passenger side portion <b>132</b> may thus be positioned between the instrument panel <b>64</b> and an occupant in the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The configuration or arrangement of the pleats <b>150</b> of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be adjusted or altered in response to varying configurations or contours of the instrument panel <b>64</b> so that the curtain follows the contour of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is in the inflated condition, the driver side portion <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>) extends from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent the upper portion of the steering wheel <b>46</b>. The driver side portion <b>130</b>, when in the inflated condition, also extends adjacent the driver side air bag <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the driver side portion <b>130</b>, when in the inflated condition, may touch the driver side air bag.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The driver side portion <b>130</b>, when inflated, is positioned between a vehicle occupant and the windshield <b>50</b> and windshield opening <b>68</b>. The driver side air bag <b>44</b>, when inflated, is positioned between the steering wheel <b>46</b> and the vehicle occupant. The driver side portion <b>130</b> and driver side air bag <b>44</b>, when inflated, combine to form an inflated wall that provides vehicle occupant protection from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> down to and covering the steering wheel <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is in the inflated condition, the passenger side portion <b>132</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) extends from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> to a position adjacent the front surface <b>162</b> and below the upper surface <b>160</b> of the instrument panel <b>64</b>. The passenger side portion <b>132</b>, when inflated, is thus positioned between a vehicle occupant and the windshield <b>50</b> and windshield opening <b>68</b> as well as the instrument panel <b>64</b>. The passenger side portion <b>132</b> provides an inflated area of protection that extends on the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> from the vehicle roof <b>40</b> down to adjacent the front surface <b>162</b> and below the upper surface <b>160</b> of the instrument panel <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the windshield curtain <b>14</b> inflates to the inflated condition, the pleats <b>150</b> unfold to allow for the expansion of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the curtain. The stitching <b>154</b> maintains the interconnection of the overlying portions (see <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>208</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>) of the panel <b>82</b> at opposite end portions of the pleats <b>150</b>. The portions of the pleats <b>150</b> positioned between these opposite end portions unfold while the end portions remain in the connected and folded condition described above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The degree to which the windshield curtain <b>14</b> expands in the area of the pleats <b>150</b> may be determined by adjusting the number of pleats, the width of the pleats, the length of the pleats, and the location at which the folded over portions of the pleats are interconnected. Adjusting the number and/or width of the pleats <b>150</b> helps determine the amount of the panel (e.g., length) that is folded up into the pleats and thereby helps determine the inflated depth (as defined below) of the pleated portion. Adjusting the width of the pleats <b>150</b> and the locations at which the folded over portions of the pleats are interconnected helps define the bounds or extent of the pleated portion of the curtain <b>14</b>. The bounds or extent of the pleated portion of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> may be measured or defined in terms of a height and width of the pleated portion. The height of the pleated portion may be measured vertically as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the width of the pleated portion may be measured horizontally as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The pleats <b>150</b>, when unfolded, allow the passenger side portion <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> to inflate to an increased depth in comparison with other portions of the curtain. The depth of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> is measured in the direction of the dimension labeled “D” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the region <b>156</b> of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> inflates to an increased depth as compared to other portions of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The increased depth of the passenger side portion <b>132</b> allows the windshield curtain <b>14</b>, while inflated, to extend from adjacent the windshield <b>50</b>, along the upper surface <b>160</b>, and adjacent the front surface <b>162</b> of the instrument panel <b>64</b>. This allows the windshield curtain to be positioned between an occupant of the passenger side <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>12</b> and the windshield <b>50</b> and also between the occupant and the instrument panel <b>64</b>. Because of the increased depth of the passenger side <b>132</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>, the windshield <b>50</b> and the instrument panel <b>64</b> may form a reaction surface for helping to support the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the first embodiment of the present invention, the pleats <b>150</b> are formed in the second panel <b>82</b> of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>. This is because the apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment includes slider mechanisms <b>122</b> for guiding and positioning the windshield curtain <b>14</b> to the inflated position. The slider mechanisms <b>122</b> guide and support the first panel <b>80</b> to a position extending along the windshield <b>50</b> when the curtain <b>14</b> is inflated (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). This being the case, the pleats <b>150</b> are provided in the second panel <b>82</b> to provide for expansion away from the windshield <b>50</b> to increase the depth D of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the pleats <b>150</b> have been illustrated as being formed in the second panel <b>82</b>. Those skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the pleats <b>150</b> may be formed in the first panel <b>80</b>, in the second panel <b>82</b>, or in both the first and second panels. For example, in an embodiment where the slider mechanisms <b>122</b> are omitted, the pleats <b>150</b> may be formed in the first panel <b>80</b>, in the second panel <b>82</b>, or in both the first and second panels. In this instance, the pleats <b>150</b> in the first panel <b>80</b> and/or the second panel <b>82</b> would expand to increase the depth of the windshield curtain <b>14</b> in order to fill the desired space.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The windshield curtain <b>14</b>, when inflated, helps to protect a vehicle occupant upon the occurrence of an event (e.g., vehicle collision or rollover) for which inflation of the windshield curtain is desired. The connections <b>90</b> help to limit the thickness of the inflated windshield curtain <b>14</b> and help to reduce the overall volume of the curtain. The pleats <b>150</b> allow the windshield curtain <b>14</b> to have an expanded depth in desired areas. The inflated chambers of the windshield curtain <b>14</b>, while inflated, help to absorb the energy of impacts with the windshield curtain and help to distribute the impact energy over a large area of the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Alternative embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A–10D</figref>. The alternative embodiments of the invention are similar to the first embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–9B</figref>. Accordingly, numerals similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1–9B</figref> will be utilized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A–10D</figref>. The suffix letter “a” will be associated with the numerals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> to avoid confusion.

The windshield curtain <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment (FIGS. <b>1</b>–<b>9</b>B), except that the windshield curtain of the second embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) includes pleats <b>150</b><i>a </i>on the driver side <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the passenger side <b>132</b><i>a </i>of the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The pleats <b>150</b><i>a </i>on the driver side <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the windshield curtain <b>14</b><i>a </i>may provide an increased depth so that the curtain may better occupy or fill space on the driver side of the vehicle. For example, the increased depth may better occupy or fill space between the steering wheel and the windshield or space between the steering wheel and an occupant of the vehicle. Because the pleats <b>150</b><i>a </i>better occupy or fill these spaces, the windshield curtain <b>14</b><i>a </i>may provide an improved reaction surface for absorbing impacts with the curtain.
