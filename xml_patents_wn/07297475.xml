<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a medicament injection kit for injecting a therapeutic medicament into a tissue in a living body. More specifically, the present invention relates to a medicament injection kit for injecting a therapeutic medicament, which is used for introducing a gene into a tissue in a living body without using viral vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since around 1990, in the United States, there has been proposed the gene therapy for treating diseases such as cancer by introducing a gene into cells in a living body. In the gene therapy, it is most important to efficiently introduce the intended gene into the target cells. The methods for introducing a gene into cells are generally classified into two types: the type in which viral vectors are used (see, for example, Heikkila P. et al., (England), Gene Therapy, 1996, Vol. 3, pp. 21-27), and the type in which viral vectors are not used (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,355 and 5,334,761).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The method using viral vectors has been used most widely until recently, because the method has been considered to be the most effective from the viewpoints of high introduction efficiency. In the efficiency of introduction of a gene into cells, the method using viral vectors is much higher than the other methods in which viral vectors are not used; thus, the method using viral vectors has been the most excellent in efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical one of the methods not using viral vectors is the liposome method, in which a chemically synthesized lipid is used. This method is high in safety, and has been developed to be very high in introduction efficiency ex vivo, particularly. Agents used in the liposome method can be synthesized inexpensively, and it is considered to be excellent introduction means suited to mass preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides, only in the case of a muscle, there has also been practiced a method of plasmid direct injection. This method has been reported to be clinically effective for angiogenesis in the heart, particularly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the gene introduction method using viral vectors involves a problem as to safety, and may be attended by a severe side effect; therefore, a new protocol for this method is not approved at present. On the other hand, the gene introduction methods not using a viral vectors are unsatisfactory in introduction efficiency in vivo, give small gene expression amounts in cells and are limited in therapeutic effect, though the method are very high transfection efficiency ex vivo. Particularly, the method using a naked plasmid is low in the efficiency of introduction into cells and is considered to be difficult to put into practical use, though the method is extremely high in safety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Now, the present invention will be described more in detail below, referring to the drawing. The drawing is for the purpose of exemplification only, and the invention is not limited to the form shown in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The medicament injection kit according to the present invention includes a catheter for artery which is used for occluding an artery in a target tissue, and a catheter for vein which is used for occluding a vein in the target tissue. The catheter for artery and the catheter for vein are each provided with blood vessel occluding means capable of indwelling in a blood vessel. Here, the blood vessel occluding means is means for internally occluding a blood vessel when set to indwell at a desired site in the blood vessel. Such blood vessel occluding means is preferably a balloon, since it is widely used for the purpose of occluding a blood vessel, does not damage the site at which it indwells, and can be easily removed by deflation after use.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The catheters and the balloons can be selected from wide ranges of known ones; desired ones may be selected according to the sites in the target tissues and the diameters of the blood vessels to be occluded.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The medicament injection kit according to the present invention includes means for injecting a therapeutic medicament (medicament injecting means) which is capable of being connected to at least one of the catheter for artery and the catheter for vein. The medicament injecting means can load the therapeutic medicament, and, when connected to the catheter for artery or the catheter for vein, it can inject the loaded therapeutic medicament into an artery or vein through a lumen of the catheter in a desired amount and at a desired injection rate. Specific examples of the medicament injecting means include a syringe. The medicament injecting means may comprise, and preferably includes, means for controlling the injection amount and the injection rate of the therapeutic medicament. Examples of the control means include a syringe pump. The syringe and the syringe pump can be selected from wide ranges of known ones; desired ones may be appropriately selected according to the amount and the injection rate of the therapeutic medicament.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The medicament injection kit according to the present invention includes means for pressurizing the inside of a blood vessel (pressurizing means) which is capable of being connected to at least one of the catheter for artery and the catheter for vein. The pressurizing means is for pressurizing the inside of a blood vessel by injecting a liquid into the blood vessel, and is similar to the medicament injecting means on a function basis. Preferably, the medicament injecting means and the pressurizing means are composed as a single means. Specifically, it is preferable that the blood in the target tissue is substantially replaced with the therapeutic medicament by the medicament injecting means, thereafter the bloodstream in the target tissue is blocked, and, in this condition, the therapeutic medicament is further injected, to thereby internally pressurize the target tissue. This ensures that the kit is simple in configuration, and only a small number of steps are required in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, one example of the method of using the medicament injection kit according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual drawing for illustrating the method of using the medicament injection kit of the present invention, where a kidney (left kidney) is adopted as a target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first, one of the artery and the vein in the target tissue is occluded by using the catheter and causing the blood vessel occluding means to indwell at a desired position in the artery or vein. For this purpose, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an artery balloon catheter <b>3</b> is inserted into a renal artery <b>11</b> of the kidney <b>1</b>, and a vein balloon catheter <b>4</b> is inserted into a renal vein <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Subsequently, one of a balloon <b>31</b> of the artery balloon catheter <b>3</b> and a balloon <b>41</b> of the vein balloon catheter <b>4</b> is inflated by an ordinary method, to occlude the renal artery <b>11</b> or the renal vein <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the balloon <b>41</b> of the vein balloon catheter <b>4</b> is inflated to occlude the renal vein <b>12</b>. The one of the vein and the artery which is to be occluded first is selected according to the side on which the therapeutic medicament is to be injected. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into the renal vein <b>12</b>, and, therefore, the renal vein <b>12</b> is occluded first. On the other hand, in the case where the target tissue is a muscle, a research of a therapeutic medicament injection without blocking the bloodstream, has reported that it is preferable to inject the medicament from the artery side. In such a case, it is considered to the preferable to occlude the artery first.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, means for injecting the therapeutic medicament (hereinafter referred to the “medicament injecting means”) <b>5</b> is connected to the vein balloon catheter <b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the medicament injecting means <b>5</b> is a syringe. After the renal vein <b>12</b> is occluded by the balloon <b>41</b>, a plunger <b>51</b> of the medicament injecting means <b>5</b> is operated, whereby a therapeutic medicament in an outer tube <b>50</b> is injected through a lumen of the vein balloon catheter <b>4</b> into the renal vein <b>12</b>. Since the renal vein <b>12</b> is occluded by the balloon <b>41</b>, the therapeutic medicament is fed through the renal vein <b>12</b> into the kidney <b>1</b>, and then into the renal artery <b>11</b>. In this manner, the blood in the target tissue, or in the kidney <b>1</b>, is substantially replaced with the therapeutic medicament.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the blood in the kidney <b>1</b> is replaced with the therapeutic medicament, the balloon <b>31</b> of the artery balloon catheter <b>3</b> is inflated to occlude the renal artery, whereby the bloodstream in the target tissue (the kidney <b>1</b>) is blocked. At this point, the inside of the target tissue (the kidney <b>1</b>) has been substantially filled with the therapeutic medicament. In the method according to the present invention, from this condition, a suitable amount of the therapeutic medicament is further injected, to thereby internally pressurize the target tissue (the kidney <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Here, the amount of the therapeutic medicament injected for the purpose of pressurizing the target tissue is a volume for sufficiently pressurizing the target tissue, and, based on the volume of the target tissue, the amount is preferably 10 to 150% based on the volume, more preferably 20 to 100% based on the volume, and further preferably 40 to 80% based on the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be noted that the above-mentioned pressurizing is achieved when the target tissue is filled with the therapeutic medicament and then pressurized internally and sufficiently. For example, there may be adopted a method in which, after the blood in the target tissue is replaced with the therapeutic medicament and the bloodstream in the target tissue is blocked, a liquid compatible with the living body, for example, physiological saline or the like is injected into the target tissue by use of the medicament injecting means <b>5</b> or other similar means, to thereby internally pressurize the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Here, the operation of injecting the therapeutic medicament for replacing the blood in the target tissue with the therapeutic medicament and the subsequent operation of injecting the therapeutic medicament or other liquid for the purpose of pressuring the target tissue may be utterly independent operations. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there may be adopted a method in which, after the therapeutic medicament is injected from the medicament injecting means <b>5</b> connected to the vein balloon catheter <b>4</b> to thereby replace the blood in the target tissue with the therapeutic medicament and the balloon <b>31</b> of the artery balloon catheter <b>3</b> is inflated to block the bloodstream in the target tissue, means similar to the medicament injecting means <b>5</b> is connected to the artery balloon catheter <b>3</b>, and a liquid compatible with the living body is injected into the renal artery <b>11</b> by use of the means to thereby pressurize the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After the condition where the target tissue is thus pressurized is maintained for a desired period of time, the balloons <b>31</b> and <b>41</b> are deflated, to thereby restart the bloodstream in the target tissue. The period of time under the condition of pressurization of the target tissue is in such a range that the effect of the therapeutic medicament is sufficient and that the tissue is not damaged due to the blocking of the bloodstream. The period of time differs depending on the kind of the target tissue and the range of the target tissue (in the case where the target tissue is an organ such as kidney, whether the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into the whole part of the organ or to be injected into a part of the organ). The period of time is normally up to 2 min, preferably up to 1 min, and more preferably up to 30 sec.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, it is preferable to carry out the pressurization of the target tissue in a short time. Specifically, the above-mentioned injection of the therapeutic medicament into the target tissue is preferably carried out in 1 min, more preferably in 30 sec. Where the pressurization is carried out in a short time, the effect of pressurizing the target tissue is better as compared with the case of injecting the liquid over a long period of time, even if the amount of the liquid injected is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The therapeutic medicament injected into a target tissue by the medicament injection kit according to the present invention includes a wide variety of medicaments injected for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes, and is selected according to a patient. Specific examples of the medicament include antibiotics, vitamin agents (comprehensive vitamin agent), amino acids, anti-thrombus agents such as heparin, insulin, antitumor agents, analogetic, cardiac, phloboclysis anesthetic, anti-parkinsonism agent, ulcer curing agents, adrenocortical hormone agents, arrhythmia curing agents, correcting electrolytes, virucides, immunoenhancers, gene-therapeutic agents, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Among the above examples, preferred are gene-therapeutic medicaments, specifically those gene-therapeutic medicaments which are used for introducing a gene into a target tissue without use of viral vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specific examples of such a gene-therapeutic medicaments include nucleic acid, polynucleotide, genes including plasmids, analog thereof, complexes of a synthetic vector such as liposome and polymer with a gene, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method of introducing a gene into cells by use of such a gene-therapeutic medicament without using viral vectors is safe because it does not use viral vectors, but is low in introduction efficiency in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the medicament injection kit according to the present invention is used, by replacing the blood in a target tissue with a therapeutic medicament, then blocking the bloodstream in the target tissue and internally pressurizing the target tissue under this condition, it is possible to improve the transfection efficiency in introducing a gene into cells in the target tissue by use of the above-mentioned gene-therapeutic medicament.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Among the above-mentioned gene-therapeutic medicaments, preferred are plasmids coding a desired gene in a mammal expression vector. With a desired structural gene coded in a plasmid, expression of a desired protein in the cells in the target tissue can be achieved without using a vector such as virus and liposome. Preferred examples of the expression vector include pSVL expression vector (Pharmacia Y.K), pSG expression vector (JP 7-304796 A and JP 8-23982 A), pKCR expression vector (K. O'Hare, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78, 1527, 1981), pCAGGS expression vector (H. Niwa, et al., Gene, 108, 193, 1991), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Examples of the structural gene to be used include gene of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) which has angiogenesis activity and is considered to be effective for treatment of arteriosclerosis, gene of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), gene of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), etc. Arteriosclerosis causes stenosis of peripheral vessels and, when gravy, needs B-K amputation. Such a patient can be treated by a method, through muscular injection, with a mammal cell expression plasmid coding the angiogenesis activity as above-mentioned, that produces the proteins having the angiogenesis activity in the muscular cells, thereby promoting the collateral vessel growth (bypasses). Similarly, myocardial infarction can be treated by injecting into cardiac muscles with a mammal cell expression vector coding a gene of angiogenesis activity factor so as thereby to promote the collateral vessel growth (bypasses).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other structural genes can also be used, examples of which include gene of dystrophin which is mutated in muscular dystrophy, gene of erythropoietin which is a cytokine acting on erythroid cells and is useful for treating anemia of chronic renal faluer, gene of blood coagulation factor VIII/IX which is effective for treatment of hemophiliac, gene of insulin which is effective for treatment of insulin-dependent diabetic, and gene of decolin for inhibiting the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) which is considered to promote fiberization in a variety of fibrosis. Besides, reporter genes such as β-galactosidase, luciferases, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, etc. can also be used. Further, when genes of constitutive proteins of infectious phathogenic microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria are used as the structural genes, they can be used as DNA vaccines. Antisenses can also be used; for example, Duchenne type muscular dystrophy due to deletion of exon can be treated by use of antisense with a splicing acceleration alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Incidentally, the target tissue, into which a therapeutic medicament is to be injected by use of the medicament injection kit according to the present invention is not limited to the kidney shown in the drawing, and can be selected from a wide variety of tissues in the living body. Examples of the target tissue include not only organs such as kidney, heart, lever, brain, etc. but also muscular tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Here, the artery and vein to be occluded can be appropriately selected according to the kind of the target tissue and the range of the target tissue (where the target tissue is an organ such as kidney, whether the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into the whole part of the organ or to be injected into a part of the organ).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For instance, where the target tissue is an organ such as the kidney (left kidney) <b>1</b> as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and where the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into the whole part of the organ, the artery (renal artery) <b>11</b> and the vein (renal vein) <b>12</b> which feed all the area of the organ are occluded. In the case of injecting the therapeutic medicament only into a specified site in an organ, an artery and a vein to be occluded are selected in relation to the specified site.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Depending on the organ, there may be a plurality of sets of artery and vein which constitute the interstitial area. For example, in the case of the heart, there are two arteries (right coronary artery and left coronary artery). Therefore, in case the target tissue is a heart and the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into the whole part of the heart, both the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery are occluded. On the other hand, in case the therapeutic medicament is to be injected into a feeding area of only one of the two coronary arteries, only the coronary artery is occluded.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the medicament injection kit according to the present invention is used, the blood in the target tissue is substantially replaced with the therapeutic medicament, then the bloodstream in the target tissue is blocked, and, under this condition, the target tissue is internally pressurized; therefore, it is possible to effectively inject the therapeutic medicament into the target tissue. Particularly, where the therapeutic medicament is a gene-therapeutic medicament used for the purpose of introducing a desired gene into cells in a target tissue without use of viral vectors, the gene can be introduced into the cells safely and at a high transfection efficiency. More particularly, by use of the medicament injection kit of the present invention, plasmids which are widely known to be low in the efficiency of introduction into cells in vivo can be introduced into the cells at a very high transfection efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the case of using the medicament injection kit according to the present invention, the bloodstream in the target tissue is blocked not by invasive means such as surgery but by use of the catheters which are via-lumen means; therefore, the blocking of the bloodstream can be achieved with low invasiveness.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Now, the present invention will be further described referring to Examples, which are not limitative of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Plasmid</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Plasmid pCAGGS-Luc was used as a gene. This plasmid is coding luciferase, which is a reporter gene, incorporated on the downstream side of an enhancer of cytomegalovirus and chicken β-actin/rabbit β-globin. In injection, the plasmid was used in the form of a gene preparation produced by dissolving 10 mg of the plasmid in 30 ml of Ringer's solution (physiological saline).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Animals</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Beagles (weight: 10 kg) were purchased from Nihon Ikagaku Doubutsu Shizai Kenkyuujo Inc.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Injection Method</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Under X-ray observation, a balloon catheter (artery catheter) was inserted into the renal artery via the crural artery, and the balloon was set to indwell in the renal artery. Similarly, a balloon catheter (vein catheter) was inserted into the renal vein via the crural vein, and the balloon was set to indwell in the renal vein.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the balloon of the vein catheter was inflated to occlude the renal vein, 10 ml of the gene preparation was injected through the lumen of the vein catheter, to substantially replace the blood in the kidney with the gene preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Immediately thereafter, the balloon of the artery catheter was inflated to occlude the renal artery, thereby blocking the bloodstream into the kidney, and an additional 20 ml of the gene preparation was injected through the lumen of the vein catheter, to pressurize the inside of the blood vessels in the kidney. The volume of the kidney as the target tissue in this example was about 40 ml, and, therefore, the gene preparation in an amount of 50% based on the volume of the kidney was injected for the purpose of pressurization.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This condition was maintained for 30 sec, then the balloons of the artery catheter and the vein catheter were deflated, to restart the bloodstream in the kidney, and the artery catheter and the vein catheter were pulled out of the kidney.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Expression Protein Detection Method</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After 48 hr from the injection, the beagle was anatomized, and the kidney was taken out. After the kidney was minced to an appropriate size, the minced piece was immersed in a Picagene cell extract (a product by Toyo Ink MFG. CO., LTD.), and a tissue extract was prepared by use of Polytron. The luciferase content in the tissue extract was measured by Picagene Luciferase Assay System (a product by Toyo Ink MFG. CO., LTD.). The result was given in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, measurement of the amount of luciferase was conducted in the same manner as above, for the case where the gene preparation was injected by occluding neither the renal artery nor the renal vein (Comparative Example 1) and for the case where the gene preparation was injected by occluding only the renal vein with the balloon (Comparative Example 2). The results are given in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in Table 1, in Comparative Example 1 where the gene preparation was injected through the renal vein without blocking the bloodstream, expression of luciferase in the kidney was not observed at all. Besides, in Comparative Example 2 where the gene preparation was injected by occluding only the renal vein, expression of luciferase in the kidney was observed, but the expression amount was very small.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in Table 2, the concentration of erythropoietin in the blood in Comparative Example 3 where the gene preparation was injected through the renal vein without blocking the bloodstream is comparable to that in Comparative Example 4 where the gene preparation was not injected at all. From this it is clearly seen that little expression of the gene was achieved in Comparative Example 3. In contrast to this, in Example 2 where both the renal artery and the renal vein were occluded after the injection of the gene preparation and then the additional amount of the gene preparation was injected to pressurize the inside of the blood vessels in the kidney, the concentration of erythropoietin in the blood was increased remarkably.</p>
