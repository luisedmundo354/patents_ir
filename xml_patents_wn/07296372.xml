<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Retail businesses typically use a wide variety of display systems and articles to draw consumer attention to the products being sold. The display systems help the consumer envision how the product will look when worn, used, assembled, etc. Conventional display systems often incorporate the product itself to help the consumer envision use or wear of the product. For example, in the clothing sector, clothing is typically displayed on a three-dimensional mannequin in order to generally demonstrate the fit and cut of the clothing. Such display systems highlight particular products to possible consumers to increase the probability that a particular consumer will purchase the product.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment of a two-dimensional retail display article <b>10</b>, according to the present invention, is generally illustrated in the various views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. Retail display article <b>10</b> provides a relatively inexpensive and lightweight manner of depicting products, such as clothing, to a consumer. Display article <b>10</b> exhibits clothing products in a manner illustrating overall fit of the product similar to conventional three-dimensional mannequins. However, display article <b>10</b> is relatively inexpensive, lightweight, and sturdy as compared to the conventional three-dimensional mannequin. Moreover, a method of constructing retail display articles <b>10</b> provides for flexibility in the presentation of the product to suit various design considerations and to align with general principles of overall store aesthetics.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Retail display article <b>10</b> includes a back panel <b>12</b>, and a photograph <b>14</b>. Photograph <b>14</b> depicts one or more products or goods being sold by a retail or other commercial establishment. Photograph <b>14</b> is applied to back panel <b>12</b> to provide a rigid retail display article <b>10</b> for placement within the retail establishment. Accordingly, retail display article <b>10</b> is prepared for display in a retail establishment to assist a consumer in locating a product in visualizing the product during use, and to generally enhance display of the product for sale.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Back panel <b>12</b> is a generally rigid material for receiving photograph <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, back panel <b>12</b> is formed of a two-dimensional material such as foam core, paperboard, cardboard, plastic, etc. providing overall rigidity to display article <b>10</b>. Accordingly, back panel <b>12</b> includes a front, generally planar surface <b>20</b> and a back surface <b>22</b> opposite front surface <b>20</b>. A thickness is defined between surfaces <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> sufficient to provide overall rigidity of display article <b>10</b> to decrease folding or wilting of display article <b>10</b> when hung in a retail environment. In one embodiment, back panel <b>12</b> is a ¼ inch piece of foam core.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Photograph <b>14</b> is two-dimensional and generally planar and, accordingly, defines a front surface <b>26</b> and a back surface <b>28</b> opposite front surface <b>26</b>. Photograph <b>14</b> depicts a subject <b>30</b> including a product <b>32</b> offered for sale by the retail establishment. With this in mind, photograph <b>14</b> is an example of means for depicting a product. In one embodiment, subject <b>30</b> includes a model <b>34</b> wearing or holding product <b>32</b>. More specifically, in one embodiment, in which product <b>32</b> is clothing and model <b>34</b> is wearing clothing <b>32</b>, photograph <b>14</b> is digitally edited to decrease the appearance of distractions that take away from product <b>32</b>. In particular, model <b>34</b> includes skin or flesh <b>36</b> exposed at various spots around clothing <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, skin <b>36</b> is digitally altered to present a more neutralized and smooth appearance to imitate the general appearance of a conventional three-dimensional mannequin, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Back surface <b>28</b> of edited photograph <b>14</b> is secured to front surface <b>20</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, photograph <b>14</b> is mounted to back panel <b>12</b> with an adhesive, tape, or other securing product. Accordingly, back panel <b>12</b> is an example of means for strengthening photograph <b>14</b>. Photograph <b>14</b> and back panel <b>12</b> are simultaneously cut into the desired end shape of display article <b>10</b>. In one example, photograph <b>14</b> and back panel <b>12</b> are cut about a perimeter <b>38</b> of subject <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A mounting bracket or device <b>40</b> is secured to back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. Mounting bracket <b>40</b> is die-cut from cardboard, foam core, or other two-dimensional and generally rigid material. In one embodiment, mounting bracket <b>40</b> is die-cut from a 24 point chip board material. Mounting bracket <b>40</b> defines a first, generally planar surface <b>42</b> and a second surface <b>44</b> opposite first surface <b>42</b>. Mounting bracket <b>40</b> defines a mounting portion <b>46</b> and a hanger interface portion <b>48</b> extending from mounting portion <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, mounting portion <b>46</b> is generally rectangular and configured to be secured directly to back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. Hanger interface portion <b>48</b> defines two protrusions or humps <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> laterally spaced from each other and each extending from mounting portion <b>46</b> to generally define mounting bracket <b>40</b> as an M-shaped bracket. In one embodiment, each protrusion <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> extends from mounting portion <b>46</b> in a generally perpendicular and upward manner. Apertures <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> are, respectively, defined near the top of each protrusion <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, i.e. opposite mounting portion <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, mounting bracket <b>40</b> includes a perforated line or demarcation <b>58</b> extending laterally on mounting bracket <b>40</b> between mounting portion <b>46</b> and hanger interface portion <b>48</b>. Accordingly, mounting bracket <b>40</b> is mounted to back panel <b>12</b> by securing second surface <b>44</b> of mounting tab <b>46</b> to back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, mounting bracket <b>40</b> is secured to back panel <b>12</b> via double stick tape or other adhesive capable of securing mounting bracket <b>40</b> to back panel <b>12</b>. Hanger interface portion <b>48</b> with protrusions <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> is able to bend or slightly rotate about perforated line <b>58</b> to alter the otherwise generally planar cross-section of mounting bracket <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One embodiment of a process of constructing retail display article <b>10</b>, according to the present invention, is generally illustrated at <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At <b>72</b>, photograph <b>14</b> is shot or captured to depict subject <b>30</b>, which as described above, includes product <b>32</b> being offered for sale. In one example in which photograph <b>14</b> includes model <b>34</b> wearing clothing product <b>32</b> offered for sale, photograph <b>14</b> is shot or captured during a photograph session capturing model <b>34</b> and clothing product <b>32</b> for use in a catalog or online catalog display relating to the retail establishment. During shooting of photograph <b>14</b> at <b>72</b>, model <b>34</b> preferably poses in multiple mannequin-like poses selected to enhance display clothing product <b>32</b> one of which will be selected for end-use as part of display article <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At <b>74</b>, photograph <b>14</b> is digitally edited to draw attention to clothing product <b>32</b> or to at least to reduce characteristics of photograph <b>14</b> that distract from clothing product <b>32</b>. More specifically, in one embodiment, photograph <b>14</b> is altered such that the general appearance of altered model <b>34</b> imitates the general appearance of a mannequin. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one embodiment, editing photograph <b>74</b> includes isolating flesh components at <b>76</b>. Isolating flesh components includes digitally editing photograph <b>14</b> to select and isolate portions of subject <b>30</b> in which flesh or skin <b>36</b> of model <b>34</b> is showing, i.e. flesh <b>36</b> is not covered by clothing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Following isolation of the flesh components, then at <b>78</b> the color of the isolated flesh components is altered. In one embodiment, flesh components are altered by selecting a neutral color, such as white, beige, or black to serve as the flesh color. By adjusting the color of the flesh to be white, beige, or black, the flesh <b>36</b> of model <b>34</b> appears similar to a three-dimensional modern mannequin. In other embodiments, flesh <b>36</b> is digitally altered to be any solid color or pattern designed to align with an overall aesthetic plan of the retail establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At <b>80</b>, a digital filter is applied to the flesh components. The digital filter allows imperfections in flesh <b>36</b> of model <b>34</b>, such as age spots, hair, etc., to be removed from or have their severity decreased on flesh <b>36</b> to provide a more smooth and overall consistent complexion to the flesh components. In one embodiment, at least some of the moles, excess wrinkles, skin folds, and hair is removed from model <b>34</b>. The degree to which the digital filter is applied to photograph <b>14</b> is subjective and to be determined by the designer based upon the overall desired effect of display article <b>10</b>. In particular, although in one embodiment, all hair and body imperfections or individualized demarcations may be removed from flesh <b>36</b> of model <b>34</b>, in other embodiments, a lesser percentage of the imperfections, demarcations, hair, etc. are removed from model <b>34</b> in order to continue to provide a three-dimensional look to model <b>34</b>. In one embodiment about 25-50% of skin creases appearing in the flesh components are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At <b>82</b>, a head of model <b>34</b> is replaced with a neck cap <b>84</b>. The head of model <b>34</b> is first deleted; more particularly, the head and at least a portion of a neck <b>86</b> of model <b>34</b> are deleted. A neck cap <b>84</b> is placed on top of the neck in place of the deleted head and neck portion. With this in mind, neck cap <b>84</b> simply caps off or tops a top or mid portion of model neck <b>86</b> to provide a clean line similar to that of a conventional mannequin without a head. Preferably, neck cap <b>84</b> is designed to further a three-dimensional visual illusion. By removing the head of model <b>34</b> in photograph <b>14</b>, model <b>34</b> is less defined as an individual and, thereby, is less distracting to customers to maintain the focus of photograph <b>14</b> on clothing <b>32</b> being offered for sale.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At <b>88</b>, other appendages or portions of model <b>34</b> that are not desired to be included in display article <b>10</b> are digitally deleted. In particular, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower portion of legs <b>90</b> of model <b>34</b> are removed. In other instances, legs and arms, arms, portions of the torso, or other portions of body <b>92</b> can be removed as desired. Notably, the steps of editing photograph <b>74</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represent merely one example of order and inclusion. In one embodiment, only one of the editing photographs steps <b>76</b>-<b>82</b> and <b>88</b> are performed on photograph <b>14</b>. A predominant number of editing steps taking place on photograph <b>14</b> are applied to flesh <b>36</b> or other components of subject <b>30</b> not including clothing or product <b>32</b>. Accordingly, clothing or product <b>32</b> is shown in a relatively realistic manner similar to as it would appear during actual use or wear by a consumer. With this in mind, each step <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> performed while maintaining a sufficient portion of shading of subject <b>30</b> that indicates dimension and/or maintaining clothing or product <b>32</b> with a dimensional appearance similar to that originally photographed is an example means for providing display article <b>10</b> with a three-dimensional appearance. Moreover, editing photograph <b>14</b> at each of steps <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, and <b>88</b> creates features of subject <b>30</b> to imitate the general appearance of a mannequin displaying clothing or product <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, once photograph <b>14</b> has been edited to a degree satisfying the designer of display article <b>10</b>, then at <b>100</b> edited photograph <b>14</b> is printed on a print media, such as paper, cardstock, velum, transparency, etc. In a preferred embodiment, photograph <b>14</b> is printed on lithograph paper. At <b>102</b>, printed photograph <b>14</b> is mounted to back panel <b>12</b>. More specifically, back surface <b>28</b> of photograph <b>14</b> is secured to front surface <b>20</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, photograph <b>14</b> is mounted to back panel <b>12</b> via adhesive, tape, glue, or other securing product. Preferably, the securing product used to secure photograph <b>14</b> to back panel <b>12</b> secures photograph <b>14</b> in a smooth and flat manner on back panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At <b>104</b>, photograph <b>14</b> and back panel <b>12</b> are simultaneously cut about perimeter <b>38</b> of subject <b>30</b>. In particular, back panel <b>12</b> and photograph <b>14</b> are cut about subject perimeter <b>38</b> extending about model <b>34</b> and clothing <b>32</b> to remove any unnecessary or undesired background from the photograph <b>14</b>. Photograph <b>14</b> and back panel <b>12</b> are cut about the outer perimeter of model <b>34</b> and clothing product <b>32</b>. Cutting about subject perimeter <b>38</b> includes cutting out interior background portions from photograph <b>14</b>, such as background portions framed between a bent arm and model torso as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one example, back panel <b>12</b> and photograph <b>14</b> are cut in a die cut process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, die cutting of photograph <b>14</b> and back panel <b>12</b> includes creating a pillowed edge at <b>106</b>. More specifically, a pillowed edge is created about subject perimeter <b>38</b> by slightly flattening and rolling the front edges of the display article <b>10</b>, including the front edges of back panel <b>12</b> and photograph <b>14</b>, towards back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the pillowed edge presents the front edges of display article <b>10</b> transitioning backwards in a relatively smooth manner. By creating the rolled or pillowed edge about perimeter <b>38</b> of display article <b>10</b>, the three-dimensional appearance of display article <b>10</b> is further enhanced and a smooth edge is presented.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At <b>108</b>, mounting bracket <b>40</b> is applied to display article <b>10</b>. As described briefly above, mounting portion <b>46</b> of mounting bracket <b>40</b> is secured to back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b> with double-stick tape or other adhesive. Positioning of mounting bracket <b>40</b> upon back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b> is determined based on design configurations and is at least partially dependent upon the position in which display article <b>10</b> will be orientated during display and hanging within the retail establishment. For example, the orientation of mounting bracket <b>40</b> with respect to photograph <b>14</b> is dependent upon whether or not the display article <b>10</b> will be oriented to show photograph <b>14</b> in a reclined or lay-down position versus a stand-up or sitting position. In addition, mounting bracket <b>40</b> may be positioned higher or lower on display article <b>10</b> such that upon hanging within the retail establishment, the display article <b>10</b> will be hung at a desired elevation level. Once mounting portion <b>46</b> is secured to back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>, hanger interface portion <b>48</b> can be rotated or bent about perforated line <b>58</b> to space hanger interface portion <b>48</b> from back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With this in mind, at <b>110</b>, display article <b>10</b> is hung or placed within the retail establishment. Referring to the front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and related side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, display article <b>10</b> is hung with a hanger <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, hanger <b>112</b> includes a first member <b>114</b> and a second member <b>116</b>. Each of first member <b>114</b> and second member <b>116</b> defines an elongated portion <b>118</b>, a bottom hook <b>120</b>, and top hook <b>122</b>. Elongated portion <b>118</b> includes a first or bottom end <b>124</b> and a second or top end <b>126</b> opposite first end <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Bottom hook <b>120</b> is coupled to first end <b>124</b> and top hook <b>122</b> is coupled to second end <b>126</b> of elongated portion <b>118</b>. Each hook <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> curves from or extends from elongated portion <b>118</b> in similar directions to form first member <b>114</b> or second member <b>116</b> as a C-shaped member. Alternatively, each hook <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> curves from or extends from elongated portion <b>118</b> in opposite directions to form first and second members <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> as S-shaped or inverted S-shaped members. In one embodiment, elongated portion <b>118</b> is formed of steel, such as a powder-coated steel rod. Hooks <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> are integrally formed with elongated portion <b>118</b>. Alternatively, at least one of hooks <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> is formed of acrylic, such as clear acrylic, coupled to elongated member <b>118</b>. First and second members <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> hang independently from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to more easily couple hanger <b>112</b> to display article <b>10</b>, hanger interface portion <b>48</b> of mounting bracket <b>40</b> is rotated or bent about perforated line <b>58</b> to space protrusions <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> from back surface <b>22</b> of back panel <b>12</b>. Bottom hook <b>120</b> of first member <b>114</b> is placed through aperture <b>54</b> of mounting bracket <b>40</b> to receive first protrusion <b>50</b>. Similarly, bottom hook <b>120</b> of second member <b>116</b> is placed through aperture <b>56</b> to receive second protrusion <b>52</b> of mounting bracket <b>40</b>. With this in mind, hanger <b>112</b> is selectively coupled with display article <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, by lifting hanger <b>112</b>, display article <b>10</b> is similarly lifted and maneuvered. In one embodiment, to hang display article <b>10</b>, hanger <b>112</b> is positioned to interface with one of a plurality of support rods <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>136</b> extending horizontally above a display area. More specifically, top hooks <b>122</b> of first member <b>114</b> and second member <b>116</b> are each placed around and receive one of the support rods, in this case, support rod <b>130</b>. Support rods <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>136</b> are often already mounted within the retail establishment for receipt of various displays including display article <b>10</b>. For instance, one example arrangement of support rods is described in U.S. Design Pat. No. D457,919 to Whittier et al., which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, support rods <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>136</b> extend generally parallel to one another. Once hanger <b>112</b> is received by support rod <b>130</b>, display article <b>10</b> is hung from support rod <b>130</b> in a position for display. Accordingly, hanger <b>112</b> alone or with mounting bracket <b>40</b> are example means for collectively hanging back panel <b>12</b> and photograph <b>14</b></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, hanging retail display <b>10</b> includes hanging a second display article <b>140</b>, which is similar to display article <b>10</b> described above, to define an overall product display <b>142</b> pleasing to the eye of the consumer. In one embodiment, second display article <b>140</b> is hung adjacent to display article <b>10</b>. Second display article <b>140</b> is hung on support rod <b>132</b> positioned slightly in front of or, as in this case, behind horizontal support rod <b>130</b> on which display article <b>10</b> is hung. Accordingly, second display article <b>140</b> is positioned slightly behind first display article <b>10</b>. By positioning display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> on two different but parallel support rods <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> and by horizontally overlapping display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b>, the three-dimensional illusion of overall product display <b>142</b> is further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hanging multiple display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> includes vertically positioning each of a plurality of display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> with respect to one another to present a pleasing appearance to the consumer. In one embodiment, at least one body part common in each of models <b>34</b> depicted in display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> are aligned. More specifically, in one embodiment, at least one of shoulders, neck, waist, knees, feet, etc. are aligned on display article <b>10</b> and display article <b>140</b> when display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> are hung as part of collective product display <b>142</b>. Alternatively, display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> are intentionally misaligned to achieve a desired aesthetic effect. In one embodiment, the desired alignment of display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> is achieved by altering the positioning of the respective mounting bracket <b>40</b> on back panel <b>12</b> of each of display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b>. In this embodiment, different articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> can be hung at differing elevations while using hangers <b>112</b> all having members <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> with identical lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, consider hanging display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> so an elbow of model <b>34</b> of display article <b>10</b> aligns with shoulders of model <b>34</b> of display article <b>140</b>. To achieve such an alignment, a first mounting bracket <b>40</b> is positioned higher on display article <b>10</b> relative to the position of a second mounting bracket <b>40</b> on display article <b>140</b>. Accordingly, even when hanger members <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> used for display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> all have the same length, each display article <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> can be hung at a different elevation based upon the placement of the respective mounting bracket <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the length of hanger members <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> varies.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hanging display articles at <b>110</b> further includes positioning display articles <b>10</b> within the retail establishment relatively near or in proximate position to the actual goods <b>144</b> or <b>146</b> being sold to the consumer. For example, in one embodiment in which the actual goods <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> are each a different shirt available for purchase by consumers, product <b>32</b> depicted by photograph <b>14</b> of each display article <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> is shirts <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>, respectively. With this in mind, display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> are positioned relatively near to or in proximity with the display of actual goods <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. Accordingly, a consumer drawn to a particular area due to display articles <b>10</b> and <b>140</b> can easily find and access the actual corresponding shirts <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> for purchase.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a retail display article <b>160</b> is similar in all respects to retail display article <b>10</b> described above except for those differences specifically enumerated herein. In particular, retail display article <b>160</b> not only depicts a subject <b>162</b>, which includes a model <b>164</b> and a product <b>166</b> similar to model <b>34</b> and product <b>32</b>, but also includes fixtures <b>168</b>. More specifically, retail display article <b>160</b> includes fixtures <b>168</b> such as a horizontal shelf <b>170</b> and at least one rack <b>172</b>. In one embodiment, a first subject <b>162</b> including a clothing product <b>166</b> is positioned to lay, sit or stand upon fixture shelf <b>170</b>. In addition, each of the plurality of racks <b>172</b> is shown to sit upon fixture shelf <b>170</b> to illustrate a bust-like representation <b>176</b> or <b>178</b> of products <b>174</b> similar to product <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each bust <b>176</b> or <b>178</b> is formed by photography as described with respect to photograph <b>14</b>. However, the hands and legs of the respective model <b>164</b> are deleted when the photo is edited at <b>74</b>. Accordingly, instead of appearing similar to a full three-dimensional mannequin, each of busts <b>176</b> and <b>178</b> appears as a three-dimensional mannequin bust placed upon one of racks <b>172</b>. In construction, models to be altered to become subject <b>164</b>, bust <b>176</b>, or bust <b>178</b> are photographed either together or separately and placed for use in single display article <b>160</b> with digitally editing. Accordingly, another aesthetically pleasing method of display of product representations can be formed by retail display article <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Different combinations of fixtures <b>168</b>, models <b>34</b> or <b>164</b>, and products <b>32</b>, <b>166</b>, and <b>174</b> can be grouped in any particular collection to define a different retail display article. Depending upon the size of the retail display article <b>160</b>, retail display article <b>160</b> includes one or more mounting brackets <b>40</b> and requires one or more hangers <b>112</b>. In particular, with respect to retail display article <b>160</b>, a plurality of mounting brackets (not shown) each similar to mounting bracket <b>40</b> and a plurality of hangers <b>180</b> each similar to hanger <b>112</b> described above, hang retail display article <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in one embodiment, a retail display article, such as retail display article <b>160</b> may be hung in front of or beside graphical or textual indicia <b>182</b> further identifying the product for sale. Graphical or textual indicia <b>182</b> may be related to a trademark, brand name, product identifier, slogan, product type or other textual or graphical reference further drawing consumer attention to a product and/or enticing a consumer to purchase the related product displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Mannequin-like display articles according the present invention present an economical yet aesthetically pleasing way to display product representations allowing a consumer to further visualize the appearance of the product during use or wear. By presenting the product in a visual manner imitating a three-dimensional display, the product can more accurately be represented to the consumer. In addition, by providing an economical way of producing the retail display articles, the retail display articles can easily be removed and replaced without the retail establishment incurring burdensome costs. Furthermore, due to the lightweight nature of the display articles, the display articles are easily hung or mounted for display in a variety of positions otherwise relatively cumbersome to produce with conventional mannequins or display fixtures. Therefore, the display articles described herein provide an aesthetically pleasing display further enhancing a consumer's shopping experience within the retail establishment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Yet another embodiment of a retail display system <b>200</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref>. Retail display <b>200</b> includes a plurality of two-dimensional display panels or articles, such as <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>, hung in front of a wall <b>202</b> of the retail establishment. Each panel <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> is formed by a back panel <b>210</b> and a photograph or other representation <b>212</b> mounted onto back panel <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, back panel <b>210</b> is formed of any material similar to back panel <b>12</b> of retail display article <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Photograph or representation <b>212</b> includes a product offered for sale, or other graphical or textural indicia relating to the sale of product at the retail establishment. For example, retail display article <b>204</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes photograph <b>212</b> of a model <b>214</b> wearing a product <b>216</b>, in this case, sunglasses, and a background <b>218</b> behind model <b>214</b>. Photograph <b>212</b> can be a photograph directly captured during a photo session. Alternatively, photo <b>212</b> is digitally edited and altered to arrive at the desired visual effect. In one embodiment, model <b>214</b> and product <b>216</b> are digitally cut from their original photograph background and placed upon a digitally created, altered, or enhanced background <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Retail display article <b>206</b> displays a product <b>220</b> offered for sale by the retail establishment as well as indicia <b>222</b> and a background <b>224</b>. In one embodiment, product <b>220</b> is identical to or related to product <b>216</b> illustrated in retail display article <b>204</b>. Indicia <b>222</b> may be graphical or textural and relates to one of a trademark, brand name, product identifier, slogan, product type, or other textural or graphical reference further drawing consumer attention to retail display system <b>200</b>. Background <b>224</b> may be a background photographed during a photo session or a background added during digital enhancement or editing of photograph <b>212</b> of panel <b>206</b>. In one embodiment, both background <b>224</b> and indicia <b>222</b> are added during the digital enhancement and editing process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The attributes of separate retail display articles <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> can be interchangeably intertwined or intermixed to define the images displayed in a cohesive manner corresponding with an overall scheme or look for retail display system <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, in order to link the look of retail display articles <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> together, the respective backgrounds <b>218</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> are similar or part of a collective pattern to collectively link the images displayed by the retail display articles <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each retail display article <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> includes a pair of mounting brackets <b>230</b> mounted to back panel <b>210</b> opposite photograph <b>212</b>. Mounting brackets <b>230</b> are similar to mounting brackets <b>40</b> described above, however, in one embodiment, mounting brackets <b>230</b> include a single protrusion or hump <b>231</b> extending from a mounting portion <b>46</b>. Each mounting portion <b>46</b> again includes an aperture for receiving a hanger member <b>232</b>. In one embodiment, each hanger member <b>232</b> is similar to first and second members <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of hanger <b>112</b> described above. Accordingly, each retail display article <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> is hung upon a support rod <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, or <b>136</b> by a hanger <b>234</b> including two hanger members <b>232</b>. In particular, in one embodiment, retail display article <b>204</b> is hung by a hanger <b>234</b> from support rod <b>134</b> and retail display article <b>206</b> is hung by a hanger <b>234</b> from support rod <b>136</b> which is positioned between support rod <b>134</b> and retail establishment wall <b>202</b>. Accordingly, retail display articles <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are not longitudinally aligned with one another but rather extend parallel with one another. Accordingly, retail display articles <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> are hung in a three-dimensional fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In order to further the three-dimensional appearance of retail display system <b>200</b>, triangle spacers <b>240</b> are integrated within system <b>200</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, each triangular spacer <b>240</b> is formed from a two-dimensional piece of material, such as foam core, paperboard, cardboard, plastic, etc. with sufficient overall rigidity to facilitate spacing of a retail display article <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, or <b>208</b> from retail establishment wall <b>202</b>. More specifically, triangular spacer <b>240</b> is die-cut from the two-dimensional material. In a specific embodiment, triangular spacer <b>240</b> includes a first panel <b>242</b>, a second panel <b>244</b>, and third panel <b>246</b>. Second panel <b>244</b> extends from first panel <b>242</b> towards second panel <b>246</b>. Third panel <b>246</b> extends from second panel <b>244</b> opposite first panel <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First panel <b>242</b> is differentiated from second panel <b>244</b> by a line of perforation or demarcation <b>248</b> extending there between. Similarly, a perforated line or line of demarcation <b>250</b> extends between second panel <b>244</b> and third panel <b>246</b>. At least one tab <b>252</b> extends from third panel <b>246</b> opposite the extension of second panel <b>244</b>. A flange <b>254</b> extends along an entire length of first panel <b>242</b> opposite second panel <b>244</b>. Flange <b>254</b> is separated from first panel <b>242</b> by a line of demarcation or perforation <b>256</b>. At least one slot <b>258</b> is formed along perforated line <b>256</b> and is sized to receive the at least one tab <b>252</b>. Accordingly, upon folding triangular spacer <b>240</b> along each of the perforated lines <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, and <b>256</b> and placing each of the at least on tabs <b>252</b> within the respective at least one slot <b>258</b>, the once two-dimensional triangular spacer <b>240</b> becomes a three-dimensional triangular pacer <b>240</b>. With this in mind, although three-dimensional during use, triangular spacer <b>240</b> can be stored and shipped in a flat manner before use or unfolded to be stored and shipped in a flat manner after use.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, triangular spacer <b>240</b> is coupled with retail display article <b>204</b>. In particular, a first triangular spacer <b>240</b> is coupled with a left end <b>260</b> of retail display article <b>204</b> by coupling third panel <b>246</b> of triangular spacer <b>240</b> to back panel <b>210</b> opposite photograph <b>212</b>. In one embodiment, third panel <b>246</b> of triangular spacer <b>240</b> is coupled with back panel <b>210</b> with double-stick adhesive tape or other adhesive known in the art. A second triangular spacer <b>240</b> is coupled with the right end <b>262</b> of retail display article <b>204</b> in a similar but opposing manner. With this in mind, first panel <b>242</b> of second triangular spacer <b>240</b> is coupled with back panel <b>210</b> near right end <b>262</b> of retail display article <b>204</b>. Accordingly, second panel <b>244</b> of the respective triangular spacer <b>240</b> is visible when viewed from a side of retail display article <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, second panel <b>244</b> of triangular spacer <b>240</b> includes a photograph or printing of a background <b>264</b> similar to or continuing a similar pattern as shown by backgrounds <b>218</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> of retail display articles <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b>. Accordingly, when viewed from multiple angles, retail display system <b>200</b> presents a continuous and cohesive background pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, retail display articles, such as retail display article <b>206</b> hung on support rod <b>136</b> closest to retail establishment wall <b>202</b>, do not include a triangular spacer <b>240</b>. In other embodiments in which retail display articles are hung from rods <b>130</b> or <b>132</b>, which are further away from retail establishment wall <b>202</b>, similar but larger triangular spacers <b>240</b> are incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a preferred embodiment, each triangular spacer <b>240</b> is sized such that triangular spacer <b>240</b> extends from retail display article <b>204</b> to interface with a front surface <b>270</b> of retail establishment wall <b>202</b>. More specifically, second panel <b>244</b> of triangular spacer <b>240</b> has a width between first panel <b>242</b> and third panel <b>246</b> equal to the distance between back panel <b>210</b> of retail display article <b>212</b> and front surface <b>270</b> of retail establishment wall <b>202</b>. In this manner, an illusion is presented to consumers and passersby that retail display article <b>204</b> actually extends from wall <b>202</b>.
