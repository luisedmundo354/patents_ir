<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to testing samples for contamination from, e.g., transition and/or heavy metals. More particularly this invention relates to a technique (method and apparatus) for using monochromatic x-ray fluorescence for detecting metals such as arsenic and lead in samples such as drinking water.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Arsenic is known to be associated with both cancer and non-cancer health problems. This has recently been the focus of public attention due to the almost epidemic health problems of millions of people in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, caused by As-contaminated groundwater (Kinniburgh, D. G. and Smedley, P. L., “Arsenic Contamination of Groundwater in Bangladesh, Vol. 2: Final Report,” BGS Technical Report WC/00/19, British Geological Survey, Keyworth, 2001; http://bgs.ac.uk/arsenic/bangladesh/reports.htm; Kinniburgh, D. G., Smedley, P. L., Davies, J., Milne, C. J., Gaus, I., Trafford, J. M., Burden, S., Ihtishamul Huq, S. M., Ahmad, N., and Ahmak, K. N., “The scale and causes of the groundwater arsenic problem in Bangladesh,” in Arsenic in Ground Water, Welch and Stollenwerk, eds, Kluwer, Boston, 2003 p 211—incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Chronic exposure to As via drinking water causes skin, lung, bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer (National Research Council 1999; “Arsenic in Drinking Water” Washington, D.C., National Academy Press—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Recent evidence suggests that increased chronic exposure to As might also be associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To protect people against the effects of long-term exposure to As, the World Health Organization has set a provisional guideline concentration for drinking water of 10 ug/L (ppb) (WHO, “Guidelines for drinking water quality” 2nd Ed, Volume I Recommendations: World Health Organization, 1993, p 188—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The US EPA has proposed lowering the maximum contaminant level for As in drinking water from 50 ug/L to 10 ug/L (ppb). High concentrations of As tend to be found more in ground water than in surface water. Since more groundwater sources are used for public drinking water supplies or private wells, the As contamination in drinking water has become a serious worldwide issue. Ground water with a serious contaminant level of As can be found in many countries, including Bangladesh, Western India, Taiwan, Mongolia, Vietnam, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and the United States (Matschullat, J., “Arsenic in the geosphere—a review”, Sci. Total, Environ., 249, 297-312, 2000—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the United States, half the population relies on ground water for drinking. There are many areas with a widespread high As concentration in ground water (Welch, A. H., Helsel, D. R., Focazio, M. J., and Watkins, S. A., “Arsenic in ground water supplies of the United States”, in Chappell, W. R., Abernathy, C. O. and Calderon, R. L., eds., Arsenic Exposure and Health Effects, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1999, p. 416, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Arsenic concentrations up to 12 ppm (12,000 ppb) have been measured in ground water from a sandstone aquifer in the Fox River Valley in eastern Wisconsin. About 21% of private water supply wells in Outagamie and Winnebago counties in Wisconsin exceed 10 ppb and 4% of the wells exceed 50 ppb. In southeastern Michigan, about 70% of ground water samples taken from more than 100 wells, have an arsenic content of more than 10 ppb, with measured levels up to 220 ppb. In the Albuquerque Basin of central new Mexico, where more than 700,000 residents rely almost exclusively on ground water for drinking water supplies, the arsenic concentration in ground water underlying the basin has been detected in excess of 600 ppb, and concentrations exceeding 20 ppb are present across larger areas (Welch, A. H., Westjohn, D. B., Helsel, D. R., and Wanty, R. B., “Arsenic in ground water of the United States: Occurrence and geochemistry”, Ground Water, 38 (no. 4), 589-604, 2000—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reliable measurement of metal traces at the few ppb level is a challenging task. There are primarily two categories of methods for ultra-trace analysis; namely atomic absorption/emission spectroscopy (AAS, or AES) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) based methods. In the AAS methods, a small sample (uL level) is placed into a high temperature graphite furnace where it is heated to the gas phase in the presence of a carrier gas. The attenuation of light of selected wavelengths is then measured to determine the amount of As. This is a very sensitive method and the detection limits are in the sub ppb range. However, the dynamic range of the technique is limited to 1-50 ppb and high concentration samples need to be diluted. Other disadvantages of AAS include high power consumption (˜6 kW) and requirement of inert ambient gas for the furnace. ICP based methods, including atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), are powerful ultra-trace elemental analysis methods. The detection limit can go down to the part per trillion (ppt) range and these techniques have a very large dynamic range. However, ICP based methods are even more sophisticated than AAS methods. They require high vacuum, high power (˜6 kW), and plasma gas. Due to their degree of sophistication and requirement of extensive facilities, AAS and ICP methods are laboratory based methods and have great difficulty being used for field or on-line applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other trace analysis techniques include electrochemical methods, such as potentiometric stripping analysis (PSA). These methods are based on electrochemical processes between electrodes and electrolyte solutions. In PSA measurements a reference is needed, as well as sophisticated sample preparation. They typically show poor reproducibility and are sensitive to the detailed chemical makeup of the sample. Consequently, electrochemical methods are not extensively used for laboratory analysis. Repeatability and reproducibility of these methods are major issues and make them difficult for field and on-line applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided by the present invention, which includes an x-ray fluorescence technique (system, method) for detecting the level of arsenic in a sample of water or body fluid.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) is a direct elemental-analysis technique requiring little or no sample preparation. It has proven to be one of the most reliable and robust analytical methods for many industrial applications. In fact, there are several types of portable or handheld XRF instruments for field applications. However, for measurement of As in ground water there are two major issues for the current portable XRF methods. The first one is sensitivity; the best sensitivity of portable XRF devices is only about 10 ppm. Even with a state of the art XRF system in the laboratory, equipped with high power (4 kw) x-ray tube and wavelength dispersive system, the detection limit for As in water would be barely 10 ppb. The second issue is that many portable XRF devices are based on radioactive sources. Radioactive sources themselves are a concern for environmental safety. Recently, handheld XRF devices with miniature x-ray tubes have been developed, but the sensitivities for these instruments are in the high (&gt;100) ppm level.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this invention, a novel x-ray fluorescence (XRF) method, Wavelength Dispersive Monochromatic XRF analysis based on doubly curved crystal (DCC) x-ray optics, measures As at low ppb or sub ppb levels for both field testing and on-line applications. The detection limits are drastically improved by combining the advantages of both monochromatic excitation and wavelength dispersive spectrometry. Monochromatic excitation using a low power tube and an efficient and compact Arsenic WD spectrometer is only made possible by the use of efficient x-ray optics.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The WD-MXRF method/system <b>10</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention for measuring As and Pb is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Three advanced monochromating (e.g., doubly curved crystal—DCC) optics <b>24</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>44</b> are disclosed for this WD-MXRF method. The first DCC <b>24</b>, the excitation DCC, is used to form an intense monochromatic beam, a Mo Kα beam, from an exemplary low power Mo anode x-ray source <b>22</b> for exciting As and Pb atoms in the sample <b>12</b>. For liquid samples, a standard plastic XRF cup with a mylar film can be used. Monochromatic excitation eliminates the dominating bremsstrahlung background present in conventional XRF instruments with polychromatic excitation. This improves the signal to background ratio (S/B) by more than two orders of magnitude. This improvement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the comparison of energy dispersive spectra between the monochromatic <b>50</b> and polychromatic <b>52</b> excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second DCC <b>34</b> with an exemplary energy bandwidth of about 20 eV is designed for collecting (e.g., from a first energy band where both As and Pb are expected to fluoresce) 10.54 keV photons to an x-ray counter, where the intensity of the As Kα line (10.543 keV) plus the Pb Lα<sub>1 </sub>line (10.549 keV) are determined. Therefore both As Kα characteristic photons and Pb Lα photons are collected by this DCC. The third DCC <b>44</b> (bandwidth about 20 eV), is designed to select (e.g., from a second energy band where only Pb is expected to fluoresce) 12.61 keV photons, where the intensity of the Pb Lβ<sub>1 </sub>line with no As interference, is measured. The intensity ratio of Pb Lα<sub>1 </sub>to Pb Lβ<sub>1 </sub>is a fundamental constant, 2.0, so both the As and Pb concentration can be determined from the intensities using fundamental parameters. The lead contamination in ground water is usually insignificant so the correction to the measured Arsenic Kα line will not usually be important. On the other hand, this analyzer can be used to measure the presence of Pb which is an important toxic contaminant if present.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an optional feature, a small PIN energy dispersive (ED) solid state detector <b>14</b> can be added for multi-element analysis at low ppm and sub ppm levels.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, if pre-testing results in a-priori information indicating the level of lead or other element in the first energy band, if any, then the analyzer can operate with one detection path only, on the first energy band to detect Arsenic—knowing a-priori that there is no interfering element present, or that a known level of an interfering element is present.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Though DCC excitation is disclosed here, any type of monochromators can be used. Exemplary doubly curved crystal optics are disclosed in X-Ray Optical Systems, Inc.

Singly curved crystals, multi-layer optics and pin-hole or slot collimating optics may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The optics may provide beam gain, as well as general beam control. Also, monochromating optical elements may be desirable in the excitation and/or emission paths for narrowing the radiation bands depending on the sample's characteristics—along with polycapillary optics for beam focusing—such as monocapillary optics (see, e.g., X-Ray Optical Systems, Inc.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">There are several important aspects of the exemplary optical configuration of system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, all three DCCs have novel geometries that can provide more than 100× intensity improvement compared to conventional singly curved crystal WD analyzers, and 3× to <b>10</b>× improvement compared to a doubly curved Johann type geometry (“Doubly curved crystal (DCC) X-ray optics and applications”, Powder Diffraction 17 (2), pp 99-103—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">They may have a potential 360° revolving structure to achieve a large collection solid angle. Their detailed geometries are described elsewhere herein. A large collection angle is the key to achieving high instrument sensitivity and makes the use of a low-power x-ray tube possible. Also the excitation DCC not only provides an intense monochromatic beam (&gt;10<sup>9</sup>photons/s), but also focuses x-rays down to ˜200 μm spot onto the sample. This allows the fluorescent x-ray signal to emanate from a small spot so that the collection DCC optics can be used efficiently. These aspects of the x-ray optical system provide the physical basis for sub ppb detection limits even with the use of a low-power x-ray source, as indicated by preliminary data discussed below. It is important to note that although disclosed in the present case for water samples, this analyzing system can be used for other solid or liquid samples as well. This is because no sample preparation is necessary except for possible pulverization of non-homogeneous samples. This can be crucial in the field study of both sources and the consequences of ground water contamination. Furthermore, the focused excitation beam means that a straightforward sample scanning system could allow mapping of As (or Pb) distributions in non-homogeneous samples with spatial resolution of 200-300 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other important aspects of the WD-MXRF system are as follows. First, there is no sample preparation, making it a direct measurement. Second, the detection of As and Pb is not interfered with by the presence of other elements present at high concentration levels because of the narrow energy window of the collection DCC optics. These two important benefits are the basis for achieving excellent repeatability and reproducibility. All other ultra-trace techniques, such as ICP or AAS/AES methods, require extensive sample preparation and are sensitive to interference, especially for “dirty samples” with high concentration levels of other elements. Third, the proposed system can have a linear response from &lt;1 ppb to &gt;1000 ppm at a single setting, providing more than 6 decades of dynamic range. With lower power settings and self-absorption corrections, the concentration can even go up to percentage levels. Finally, this is a compact WD-MXRF analyzer with low power (&lt;100 W total) and no moving parts. This difference compared to conventional high power WDXRF systems, make it suitable for in-field and on-line applications. The detailed configurations for in-field testing and on-line measurements are described elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Application:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The capability of field testing with no sample preparation is invaluable for many environmental applications. The As/Pb analyzer can have a great impact to address the global As issue in drinking water. It can generate large economic as well as health benefits, if most of the analysis can be done in the field or in local laboratories to which water samples from private wells can be taken. It can also provide a monitoring tool for water suppliers for quality control. Also the As/Pb analyzer is much less expensive than the cost of purchasing and operating ICP and AAS instruments (estimated at about ⅕- 1/10 of ICP-MS instruments). Furthermore, the instrument can be operated in relatively uncontrolled conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) by minimally trained personnel, as already demonstrated by existing sulfur analysis instruments. Also, the WD-MXRF technique can be applied to other environmental applications. As noted previously, samples can be measured directly and can be virtually any solid or liquid. Different collection DCCs can also be configured to detect other environmentally important elements, such as Hg, Cd and Cr. A modular design approach could allow easy switching of DCC optics for different applications. These applications might include soil, plant, and food contamination analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, the WD-MXRF technique also has great potential for clinical applications. Trace metals in blood, urine, and body fluids are of great concern for human health. Detecting trace metals, such as Pb, Hg, As, Tl, and Se, by current techniques is expensive and time-consuming. A simple bench-top analyzer in a clinic or hospital could be a great benefit and cost effective and could address many issues confronted by current analytical techniques.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advanced Doubly Curved Crystal (DCC) Optics</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Doubly curved crystal optics were known to be useful for focusing and monochromatizing x-rays from small x-ray sources for decades. But their application was been hindered due to the great difficulty in controlled fabrication. Advanced DCC optics, which can provide a 5 to 50× improvement compared to the early DCC geometry, have been invented and successfully fabricated. These geometries include fully revolving DCC optics, asymmetrically cut DCC optics, and logarithmic DCC optics, as disclosed in the above-incorporated U.S patents and patent applications.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Applications of Doubly Curved Crystal Optics</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The availability of DCC optics has opened the door for conceiving many novel x-ray techniques for a variety of applications. Several new methods based on DCC optics have newly been proposed: X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) using DCC for oxidation state analysis, focused beam total-reflection XRF (TXRF) for extreme ultra-trace analysis, and fixed channel WDXRF using monochromatic excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Sulfur Analyzer for Petroleum Industry</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Based on related WD-MXRF concepts, a sulfur analyzer has been successfully developed by XOS using doubly curved crystal optics. Sulfur in fuel is a serious environmental concern and the sulfur concentration in diesel fuel will be regulated down to 15 ppm by 2006. There is a great need in the petroleum industry for a reliable on-line or in-the-field method to measure sulfur. With extensive R&amp;D effort, detection limits of 200 ppb have been achieved (http://www.xos.com/sulfuranalyzer.htm). And the WD-XRF method was demonstrated to be the most reproducible of currently available techniques. It should be noted that the low energy of sulfur Kα x rays make the measurement of sulfur much more difficult and less sensitive than for As or other heavy metal contaminants. Indeed, direct scaling of the sulfur measurements to account for window absorption, collection efficiency, and detection and fluorescence yield factors allow a reliable estimation of sub ppb measurements for As.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Detection Limits of ICP Based Methods</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Ure, A. M., “Methods of analysis for heavy metals in soils”, in Heavy Metals in Soils, B. J. Alloway, ed. (Blackie, Glasgow, 1990) pp. 40-80—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Bortoli, P., Gerotto, M., Marchiori, M., Palonta, R., Troncon, A., “Applications of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to the early detection of potentially toxic elements”, Michrochem J., 46, 159-166 (1992)—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) techniques are the most widely used ultra-trace methods for laboratory based environmental analysis. It is not suggested that these techniques will be replaced by WD-XRF instruments. In general ICP-MS has higher sensitivity and also can give isotopic ratio information. The detection limits for As using ICP-MS can be as low as 0.01 ppb (Slavin, “Comparison of Atomic-Spectroscopic Analytical Techniques”, Spectroscopy, 6, pp 16-21). ICP-AES typically has poorer detecting limits than ICP-MS and its detection limits for As are at sub ppb level. ICP based methods are well established laboratory techniques, but these methods can not be used for field and on-line application due to their high degree of operation sophistication and extensive facilities required as well as cost and size.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0061">Predicted Detection Limit for As</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Based on the data from the sulfur analyzer, the detection capability for an As analyzer using the WD-MXRF technique can be predicted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">For As detection, a monochromatic Mo Kα beam will be used for As excitation. A Mo DCC for focusing Mo Kα x-rays and an As DCC for collecting As Kα photons will replace the Cr DCC and the S DCC. There are several differences between two systems. 1) The collection solid angle of the Mo DCC and As DCC will be smaller if the same design parameters are used, e.g, the same revolving angle. This is due to the fact that the collection solid angle is proportional to sin(Bragg angle) (Chen, Z. W. and Wittry D. W., “Microanalysis by Monochromatic Microprobe X-ray Fluorescence—Physical Basis, Properties and Future Prospects”, J. Appl. Phys., 84 (2), 1064 (1998)—incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Therefore, full revolving (360°) DCC optics (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be needed to gain back the loss. With a large aperture DCC geometry, the collection solid angle can even be improved for the Mo excitation optic compared to the Cr DCC. Also the optical efficiency of the sulfur analyzer is low. Reflectivity of 15% can be achieved for a Mo DCC. For simplicity, we assume that the overall x-ray optical system of the As detection system can give approximately a factor of 2× improvement compared to the sulfur system. 2) The flux of the Mo Kα per unit solid angle from the tube will be lower compared to the same Cr Kα for the same setting (50 kv 1.5 mA) due to a decreased production yield of Mo Kα photons per electron on the anode (Green and Cosslett, “Measurement of K, L and M shell X-ray production efficiencies”, Brit. J. Appl. Phys. (J. Phys. D), ser. 2, vol 1. p 425-436—incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). It is approximately a factor of 3 less. There was significant absorption loss of sulfur Kα signals in the beam path, including windows and air gap between the sample and the chamber. For the As system, there is no need for vacuum and the loss for As Kα x-rays in air can be assumed as 10% (for 300 mm air path). The window loss for As Kα will be insignificant.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Also the fundamental parameters related to x-ray fluorescence for As and S are different. These include the difference of photoelectric cross section and fluorescence yield as also listed in Table II. The fluorescence intensity is proportional to photoelectric cross section and fluorescence yield. The fluorescence yield for As K shell is about 8× higher than the S K shell. Finally the matrix effects are different. From the mass absorption coefficients, the escape depth and penetration depth for both systems can be calculated. For the sulfur system, the escaped depth of S Kα signal is about 0.075 mm (1/e distance) in fuel and the penetration depth of the Cr beam is about 1 mm. For the As system, the escape depth of As Kα in water is 2.3 mm and the penetration depth for Mo Kα is 10 mm. Since the signal is coming from a fraction of the excitation volume for both systems, the fluorescence intensity will be proportional to the escape depth.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Therefore, the sensitivity for an As analyzer is about 71×0.8 cps/ppm, or 0.057 cps/ppb. To calculate the detection limits, an estimate for the background level for the As system is needed. As shown above, the background level of a sulfur analyzer was dominated by the S impurity in the Be window and the mylar film. For the As analyzer, there will be no Be window and the As trace in mylar film is much lower. It will be reasonable to assume that a background level of 0.03 cps is possible. For conservative reasons, we assume that the As analyzer will have a background level of 0.08 cps and sensitivity of about 0.05 cps/ppb. Then the minimum detection limits for As in water is by equation 1: (set Wi=10 ppb, S=0.5 cps).</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The predicted minimum detection limit for As in water vs. measurement time t (in seconds) plotted is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For 300 s measurement time, MDL=1 ppb. For 1000 s measurement time, MDL=0.5 ppb. This predicted minimum detection limit is excellent and it will meet the requirement for As measurement in drinking water. To achieve this MDL, we need to have a system with sensitivity better than 0.05 cps/ppb and a background level less than 0.05 cps. There are two keys for achieving these specifications: 1) an improvement factor of 2× for the optical system design and 2) to minimize the background of the As analyzer.</p>

In this geometry, multiple crystals curved to a radius of 2R (R is the radius of the focal circle) in the plane of the focal circle are tangential to the focal circle. The angle between the diffraction planes of each crystal and its surface is dependent on its location on the focal circle. For instance, the diffraction planes of the center crystal are parallel to its surface, which is the typical Johann geometry. The diffraction planes of crystal c<b>2</b> have the inclined angle of γ relative to its surface. Each crystal is also curved in the transverse direction and they have rotation symmetry along line SF and the included rotation angle is φ. The collection angle in the plane focal circle is β.

<p id="p-0078" num="0078">For excitation of As, Mo Kα x-rays is an obvious choice since Mo anode tubes are standard. Mo Kα photons are close to the absorption edge of As K shell excitation energy, but not too close to have Compton scattering background under the As peak. Either Si(<b>220</b>) and InSb(<b>220</b>) is proposed as a crystal diffraction plane for Mo Kα x-rays. Compared to Si(<b>220</b>) crystal, the reflectivity of InSb is higher since it has high atomic scattering factor due to its high atomic number. But the InSb is more brittle than Si.</p>
