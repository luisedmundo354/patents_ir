<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to network communications, and more specifically, but not exclusively, to providing notifications to a plurality of devices by sending a notification to a first device and using each subsequent device in a sequence of devices to send a further notification to another device in the sequence.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Networked computing devices are typically configured to communicate with other devices to obtain or provide information and/or services. Typically, a client application may run on a local device and request information or a service from another device, such as a server. In some cases, the server may provide a notification indicating that information may be available for the local device from the server. For example, email notification daemons may be employed to asynchronously notify a mail client running on the local device of the arrival of email that may be subsequently retrieved from a mail server.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More recently, mobile devices, such as mobile telephones, pagers, mobile personal data assistants (PDAs), or other wireless and handheld devices, have employed messaging technologies such as Multi-media Messaging Service (MMS), Short Messaging Service (SMS), Instant Messaging (IM), and the like, to request and receive information or services over a network. Such messaging technologies may also be used to provide an alert regarding an occurrence of an event.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Messages are often employed to communicate notifications to mobile devices. However, it can be expensive to communicate large numbers of messages to mobile devices in part because each message may be separately charged to a data provider. Therefore, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which are shown exemplary embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those having skill in the art to practice the invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The phrase “in one embodiment” as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, though it may. The phrase “in another embodiment” as used herein does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment, although it may. As used herein, the term “or” is an inclusive “or” operator, and is equivalent to the term “and/or,” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term “based on” is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, throughout the specification, the meaning of “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references. The meaning of “in” includes “in” and “on.”</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Briefly stated, the present invention is directed toward enabling a server to activate a plurality of devices by sending a notification to a first device and employing subsequent devices to send further notifications to other devices in a sequence, or chain, of devices. In one embodiment, the devices are arranged as peer devices to each other device in the sequence such that each device is enabled to relay messages between each other device. In one embodiment, the devices are mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the notification indicates that information, such as an application update is available for download, a message is available for access, or the like. Notification may also include, for example, event-based notifications, application wakeup messages, update or data availability messages, or the like. In general, a notification may alert a device, or a client application running on the device, of an occurrence of an event associated with the availability of information, enabling the device to initiate a data connection to the server to download the information. For example, a device may be notified of the availability of email, an instant message, a news report, sports score, stock price, weather forecast, updated personalized data for synchronization to the device such as a change to an address book, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sequence of devices may be determined by the server. In one embodiment, the sequence is dynamically determined. That is, an ordering of devices may be selected dynamically based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, a characteristic of a device, a capacity of a device, an ordering that is directed towards minimizing a number of messages that may be sent from the server, or the like. Moreover, the sequence may be dynamically updated by the server to manage such issues as broken links in the chain that may arise due to a variety of reasons, including when a device is inaccessible, fails to send a notification to a next device, or the like. In addition, in one embodiment, the sequence need not be completely determined prior to sending a notification to a device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, in one embodiment, the first device and a next device in the sequence may be initially determined. Subsequent devices in the sequence may be determined after the notification process begins. Thus, in one embodiment, selection of a next device in the sequence may be made concurrently with, or prior to, sending of a notification to a device in the sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the first device in the sequence may be notified by the server to initiate the notification sequence. The first device may then provide a notification to a next device in the sequence, which may then provide a notification to a subsequent device in the sequence, and so forth. In one embodiment, a last device in the sequence may send a message to the server indicating completion of the notification sequence. By employing the present invention, a plurality of devices may receive a notification, with the server merely providing the first notification. This approach may reduce the number of notifications sent by the server, and thereby may reduce costs to a data provider, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A device in the sequence of devices may receive an instruction that directs the device to send a notification to another device. In one embodiment, the instruction may be provided to the device along with data that the device may download from the server. In another embodiment, the instruction to send a notification to another device may be included along with the notification received by the device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the notifications may be sent using SMS's hidden message mechanism. Such hidden message mechanisms enable a computing device to send a message virtually without a user of the computing device being aware that the message is being sent. Thus, the sending of the message may be considered to be hidden from the user of the sending device. In one embodiment, the hidden message may be sent without a user input, an indication to the user via a user interface, or the like. In another embodiment, a receipt of a hidden message may also be hidden from the user of the receiving device. That is, the receipt of the hidden message may not be displayed on a user interface. Thus, in one embodiment, a computing device may receive a notification and send a notification to another device virtually hidden from a user of the computing device. However, in one embodiment, the user may still be provided an indication of a presence of downloaded information, such as an email message, update to an application, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention is not limited, however, to SMS hidden message mechanism, and other hidden or automated message mechanisms may also be employed. For example, IM messages, MMS messages, or the like, may also be used, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With respect to embodiments that employ SMS capabilities for mobile devices, the invention may provide advantages due to pricing practices for SMS messaging. Mobile phone contracts may include a substantial periodic allowance of free SMS messages. Moreover, inexpensive bundles of SMS messages (typically in the hundreds or thousands) may be available for purchase from network operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), or the like. Economies may thus be achieved by enabling mobile device users to pay for one another's notifications at their own cost; a cost may be lower than the cost of sending each message from the notification server to a device, whether the data provider bears that cost or passes it on to the device users. A device user is effectively able to “trade in” messages by allowing notifications to be sent from the user's mobile device to other devices in return for notifications being sent to the user, most likely from another user's mobile device. It is contemplated that in embodiments of the invention the use of a peer device to relay a notification to another peer device may be in accordance with an explicit grant of permission by the user of the device to the central data provider.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Generalized Operation</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The operation of certain aspects of embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a logical flow diagram generally showing an overview of one embodiment of a process for providing notifications to a plurality of peer devices. Process <b>400</b> may be performed, for example, by notification server <b>102</b> and/or data server <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Process <b>400</b> is entered when it is determined that one or more notifications are to be sent to a sequence of peer devices (the notification sequence). When it is so determined, process <b>400</b> begins, following a start block, at block <b>402</b>, where a notification is provided to the initial peer device in a sequence of peer devices. In one embodiment, the notification is provided as a hidden SMS message to the initial peer device.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Processing flows next to block <b>404</b>, where a notification is forwarded to each subsequent peer in the notification sequence. Each notification for subsequent peer devices may be provided by the previous peer device in the notification sequence. In one embodiment, a subsequent notification may be included with the data provided to a peer device that connects to data server <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An instruction may also be included that instructs the peer device to send a notification to a next peer device in the notification sequence. In one embodiment, the notification may be sent as a hidden SMS message.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, while an initial peer device and a second peer device in the notification sequence may be determined initially, a remainder of the notification sequence may be determined concurrently to providing of notifications, or even in a serial manner. In another embodiment, a portion of a sequence, or the entirety of a sequence, may be determined prior to the sending of the notification to the initial device in the sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Process <b>400</b> flows next to block <b>406</b>, where data associated with a corresponding notification may be provided to each peer device within the notification sequence. Process <b>400</b> then returns to a calling process to perform other actions.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> illustrate a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process for providing a notification to peer devices in a sequence of peer devices.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Process <b>500</b> begins, after a start block, at block <b>502</b>, where a data server receives or otherwise determines that there is information for access by a plurality of peer devices. In one embodiment, at least one of the plurality of peer devices is a mobile device. In one embodiment, the information for access is at least one of an application, an update to at least a portion of an application, a message such as an email message or the like, a content item, data, or the like. In one embodiment, the data server may determine that there is a plurality of information that is available for access by the plurality of peer devices. Thus, for example, the data server may determine that an update to at least a portion of an application is available, and an email message is available, or that several updates to applications may be available, or any of a variety of other combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In any event, process <b>500</b> next flows to block <b>504</b>, where a list of the plurality of peer devices may determined that are to receive a notification. In one embodiment, the data server may determine the list of peer devices. In one embodiment, information associated with one or more items available for access also may be provided to a notification server. The notification server may then determine the plurality of peer devices to send the notifications, based, at least in part, on the available information.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Process <b>500</b> moves next to decision block <b>506</b>, where a determination is made whether to send a notification to the plurality of peer devices. Such determination may be based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, whether a threshold number of items are available for access by the plurality of peer devices. The determination may also be based, at least in part, on whether a determined time period has elapsed since receiving the information associated with the one or more items available for access. In still another embodiment, it may be determined that the information available for access includes a high priority item, such as a security update to an application, an urgent email message, or the like. In any event, if it is determined that a notification is to be sent, processing flows to block <b>510</b>; otherwise, processing may loop back to decision block <b>506</b>, until it is determined that a notification is to be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At block <b>510</b>, an available peer device is determined from the plurality of peer devices for which an initial notification is to be sent. Determination of the first peer device to receive the initial notification may be based on a variety of criteria. For example, the first peer device may be based on a cost factor, a distance factor, a contractual agreement, a characteristic of the peer device, a number of items available for access, an availability of the peer device, or the like</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, a determination may also be made of a notification sequence for at least a portion of the plurality of peer devices. Such notification sequence may be ordered in such a way as to minimize the number of messages that are sent from the data server. For example, the notification sequence may be based on such criteria as geographic location of the peer devices, wireless networks on which peer devices may be communicating, a user preference regarding how frequently notifications may be provided, a usage limit applicable to the peer devices, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Process <b>500</b> next moves to block <b>512</b>, where a notification is sent to the selected initial peer device. In one embodiment, the notification is sent using an SMS hidden message mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Processing next continues to block <b>530</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), where the initial peer device establishes a network connection and downloads the available information. In one embodiment, the initial peer device establishes the network connection with data server <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one embodiment, the establishment of the network connection, and/or the downloading of the available information may be performed virtually hidden from the user of the peer device.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, the available information includes an instruction to the initial peer device to provide a notification to a next peer device in the notification sequence. Again, the instruction may further indicate that the notification is to be sent as a hidden message, using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. In addition, the instruction may include a phone number of the next peer device for transmitting the SMS message or the like. However, the invention is not so limited, and other device identifiers may also be employed, including a Mobile Identification Number (MIN), an electronic serial number (ESN), a network address, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Processing next steps to block <b>532</b>, where the notification is provided to the next peer device in the notification sequence in accordance with the provided instruction. As described above, the notification may be provided as a hidden message. Furthermore, in one embodiment, additional information may also be provided to the next peer device that includes at least a portion of the notification sequence. That is, the next peer device may receive, either along with the notification or the downloaded information from block <b>532</b>, information that may instruct the next peer device to instruct yet another peer device in the notification sequence to send a notification, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Processing then advances to decision block <b>536</b>, where it is determined whether this peer device is the final peer device in the notification sequence. If this peer device is not the final peer device, processing loops back to block <b>532</b>; otherwise, processing flows to block <b>538</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At block <b>538</b>, the final peer device may have received an instruction directing it to provide a message to a server such as notification server <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that confirms completion of the notification sequence. In one embodiment, the confirmation message may be sent using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. Upon completion of block <b>538</b>, processing may then return to a calling process to perform other actions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although not illustrated in the above process flow, a peer device may be inaccessible for any of a variety of reasons, including, out-of-range, turned-off, an error, or similar failure that may result in its inability to receive and/or to send a notification. However, such situations may be detected using various mechanisms, including, for example, sending a message to the notification server if a peer device does not respond within a period of time, or the like. In any event, if it is determined that a peer device is non-responsive, the notification sequence may be dynamically revised. Such revisions may include dropping the non-responsive peer device, moving the non-responsive peer device into a different ordered position in the notification sequence, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a time flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a process for notifying each peer device in a notification sequence of data retrievable from a data server. In the embodiment, address information for notifying subsequent peer devices in the notification sequence may be included in the notification itself rather than in the data that is downloaded in response to the notification. For example, in one embodiment, the initial notification might include the address and ordering of each peer device in the notification sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Time flow diagram <b>600</b> shows notification server <b>602</b>, data server <b>604</b>, and a sequence of peer devices <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, and <b>614</b>. The vertical arrows extending from each device represent a flow of time, while horizontal arrows represent a flow of data from one device to another. An initial notification <b>620</b> may be sent by notification server <b>602</b> to peer device <b>610</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After sending notification <b>624</b> to peer device <b>614</b>, peer device <b>612</b> may send data request <b>634</b> to data server <b>604</b> and receives data download <b>636</b>. Lastly, peer device <b>614</b> may send data request <b>638</b> to data server <b>604</b> and receive data download <b>640</b>. Since peer device <b>614</b> is the final device in the notification sequence, it may not provide a notification to another peer device. However, in one embodiment, the final peer device in the notification sequence may provide a confirmation message to notification server <b>602</b>, to indicate that the notification sequence is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a time flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of a process for notifying each device in a determined sequence of peer devices of data retrievable from a data server, in which an instruction to notify a subsequent peer device may be included in the content that is downloaded by a peer device in response to a notification, rather than being included in the notification itself.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In time flow diagram <b>650</b>, notification server <b>652</b> may send notification <b>670</b> to peer device <b>660</b>, the initial peer device in the notification sequence. Peer device <b>660</b> then may send data request <b>680</b> to data server <b>654</b> and receive data download <b>682</b>. Data download <b>682</b> may include an instruction to notify peer device <b>662</b>, the next peer device in the notification sequence. Accordingly, peer device <b>660</b> may send notification <b>672</b> to peer device <b>662</b>. Peer device <b>662</b> may then send data request <b>684</b> to data server <b>654</b> and receives data download <b>686</b>. In accordance with instructions in the downloaded data, peer device <b>662</b> may send notification <b>674</b> to peer device <b>664</b>, the final peer device in the notification sequence.
