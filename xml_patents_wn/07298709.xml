<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a network transfer communication device which transfers electronic information in communication network, a communication system which comprises such device, a method of electronic information transfer communication and a program for transferring electronic information.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Today, electronic communication is becoming indispensable at every business opportunity. This kind of communication is processed in network set up over every business area. And, electronic information arrives at each site in the network. That is, a business person can get such electronic information at his or her office.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides, such electronic information can be transferred to any site including the client's office connecting with the business person. By the way, such electronic information is embodied in electronic mail. And, it is processed in mutual communication network (the internet) under TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet protocol) circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this mutual communication network for electronic mail communication under these circumstances, there is what is called an internet service provider (ISP). ISP gives ID (connection identification) and password to each user. These are necessary for access to ISP. And, it also gives mail address and mail password. These are necessary for electronic mail communication.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this electronic mail communication, ISP receives electronic mails in its database (D/B). And, ISP transfers electronic mails to the specific user. There are two methods for this transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One is a method of transfer to a mobile terminal which installed a mailer application program which is able to process internet access. In this occasion, the user has set up destination mail address registration in advance, to get the transfer service which is provided by ISP.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The other is a method of transfer to a communication terminal borrowed at the client's office. In this occasion, the user usually has not set up destination mail address registration in advance. So, the user connects the borrowed communication terminal to ISP. And, the user takes in the electronic mail addressed to the user, to read the contents of the mail.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the conventional arts mentioned above have defects hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">First, the number of destination (mail address) which is able to set up registration is limited in the transfer service. This hinders the user from utilizing this service.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, it is necessary for the user to set up the mail address and password of individual or corporation in the mailer application program installed in the communication terminal when the user borrows it at the client's office. In this occasion, the user may be afraid that the mail address or password leaks out owing to the setting. Because, the electronic mail information is likely to be read by someone whom the user never knows.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore the present invention aimed at providing a network transfer communication device and a communication system which are capable of eliminating both of transfer destination registration limitation and transfer information leak. And, it also aimed at providing a method and a program which are capable of achieving this object.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the present invention aimed at enabling the user to use facsimile when there is no communication device which is able to make electronic information communication at the client's office.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an network transfer communication device which transfers electronic information from the first communication device to the second communication device, wherein comprising next means. These means can be embodied in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the operation of the first embodiment will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(1) The Operation Relating to the Mail Server <b>4</b></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the mail server access unit <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user sets plural mail server information (account, mail address, password and so on) in the areas <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>28</b>-n shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>). This information has been given by the provider (mail server <b>4</b>; c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4)</figref>. And, it is inputted with input device <b>33</b> (c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The password cannot be read except the user. Moreover, the user takes mail check ON/OFF information and mail address (sender mail address in the arrived electronic mail) from the destination information abstracter <b>30</b> (rule <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> of transfer request electronic mail shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>c</i>)). And, the user puts them in the areas <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>28</b>-n shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) of the mail server access unit <b>28</b>. These operations are processed with the input device <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to this mail check ON/OFF information of rule <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> of transfer request electronic mail, the server access unit <b>28</b> periodically inquires of the mail server <b>4</b> the arrival of electronic mails. If the mail server <b>4</b> is holding the electronic mails which has arrived from the source specified by the information, destination information abstracter <b>30</b> informs transfer controller <b>29</b> of it.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(2) The Overall Operation</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the overall operation will be described</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an electronic mail is sent from the communication terminal <b>3</b> of the sender. This mail has been given the address of the communication terminal <b>7</b> which the user usually use. This mail arrives at the mail server <b>4</b> via the communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the ordinary occasion, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>does not play any role. In this occasion, the mail server informs the communication terminal <b>7</b> of the arrival of mail. Or the user at the communication terminal <b>7</b> voluntarily inquires of the mail server <b>4</b> whether any mail has arrived or not. Thus, the user notices the arrival of mail and transfers the mail to the communication terminal <b>7</b> so as to read the mail.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the special occasion when the user is out, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>plays a very important role. In this occasion, the user sends an electronic mail of demanding to transfer the mail arrived at the mail server <b>4</b>. Acceding to this demand, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>brings the mail from the mail server <b>4</b> with the confirmation of the mail address of the user. And, the mail is transferred to the communication terminal <b>5</b> of outside use so as to be read by the user who is out.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(3) Hereafter, the electronic mail transferring operation of the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>will be described with the reference of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, at step S<b>1</b>, an electronic mail has been given the address of the communication terminal <b>7</b> which the user usually use. This mail is sent from the communication terminal <b>3</b> of the sender to the mail server <b>4</b> (c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). When this mail arrived and received (step SA), it is held by the database of the mail server <b>4</b> (step SB).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the set up information is sent by the user from the communication terminal <b>5</b> of outside to the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>(step Sa). When this set up information arrived and received (step S<b>100</b>), it is memorized in the area <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> of the mail server access unit <b>28</b> (step S<b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">As for an example of this set up information, the mail server name of the mail server <b>4</b> is “POP3@ghijk.co.jp”, the account is “yu-abcdef” and password is “123456” set in advance (step Sa).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">And, when the user demands to transfer electronic mails which are given the same mail address “yu-abcdef@ghijk.co.jp”, the user compiles such an electronic mail as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the communication terminal <b>5</b> has the mail address “yabcde@rst.com”, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b><i>a </i>has the mail address “yu-abcdef@ghijk.co.jp”, and the terminal <b>3</b> of the original sender has the mail address “yuiabcdef@rst.co.jp”. And, the mail check is ON to validate mail transfer.
<br/>
The communication terminal <b>5</b> sends this transfer request mail to the network transfer communication terminal <b>6</b><i>a </i>(step Sb). And, the network transfer communication terminal <b>6</b><i>a </i>receives this mail (step S<b>102</b>). After this step, destination information abstracter <b>30</b> researches the subject part of this mail (step S<b>103</b>). That is, it compares the subject with the mail address registered in the mail server access unit <b>28</b>. When it was recognized that the same address as that registered in the mail server access unit <b>28</b> was written in the subject field of the mail, the destination information abstracter <b>30</b> registers the transfer propriety in the mail check area <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> of the mail server access unit <b>28</b>, and in the transfer propriety memory <b>29</b>-<b>3</b> (step S<b>104</b>).
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At next steps S<b>105</b> and S<b>106</b>, each ON/OFF in the mail check area <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>28</b>-n of the mail server access unit <b>28</b> will be researched. When plural destination mail addresses are registered for the source (step S<b>105</b>), it inquires whether all destination information registers are OFF or not (step S<b>106</b>). When all destination information registers are not OFF, it registers the original sender mail address included in the text of the electronic mail (c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), in the mail address register area <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> (step S<b>107</b>). And, further, it registers the mail address of transfer request PC (c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the destination address memory <b>29</b>-<b>2</b> of the transfer controller <b>29</b> (step S<b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After those registrations in the mail server access unit <b>28</b> and the transfer controller <b>29</b> have been processed by the destination information abstracter <b>30</b>, the next step S<b>109</b> is processed. If either mail check of the mail server access unit <b>28</b> is ON, the mail server access unit <b>28</b> checks the mail server <b>4</b> periodically (for example, each 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour). By this checking process, it detects and holds electronic mails arrived from the registered mail address (step S<b>109</b>). And, the transfer controller <b>29</b> compiles an electronic mail for transfer (step S<b>110</b>). This mail is compiled from the information memorized in the source server information memory <b>29</b>-<b>1</b> or destination address memory <b>29</b>-<b>2</b>. The network interface <b>27</b> sends this electronic mail by SMTP to the communication terminal <b>5</b> used outside. And, the communication terminal <b>5</b> displays this electronic mail for the user to read it (step Sc).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When there are not plural destination mail addresses registered at step S<b>105</b>, in other words, when there is single destination mail address registered and the mail check of this destination is ON, the network transfer communication terminal <b>6</b>A proceeds to the step S<b>107</b> and succeeding steps. And, it registers the mail address of the sender and processes succeeding steps.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although, the mail address of the source is included in the subject field and the mail address of the sender is included in the text according to the transfer request electronic mail of this embodiment, the invention is not to be limited to this. The mail address of the source can be included in the text and the mail address of the sender can be included in the subject field. Further, these addresses can be included in any field of the mail format.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, electronic mails of transfer request are sent by the user from the communication terminal <b>5</b> to the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A. By this mail, the electronic mail addressed to the user arrived at the mail server <b>4</b> are transferred to the communication terminal <b>5</b>. In this transfer process, it has become needless to utilize the transfer service of ISP. Therefore, the total of transfer destinations (mail addresses) is not limited. And, the important point is that it has become needless to set the transfer information of the electronic mail addressed to the user in the borrowed communication device at client's office. So, the password or electronic mail's content does not leak out. And, electronic mails are never read by strangers.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other words, the communication terminal <b>5</b> informs the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A of the information for getting access to the mail server <b>4</b> via electronic mail or facsimile. The communication terminal <b>5</b> itself never possesses the setting information for getting access to the mail server <b>4</b>. Only the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A posses this information. And the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A gets access to the mail server <b>4</b> so as to receive the electronic mail. In this receiving process, the access to the mail server <b>4</b> is processed according to the setting information informed from the communication terminal <b>5</b> via electronic mail or facsimile. After this receiving process, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A transfers the received electronic mail to the communication terminal <b>5</b> according to the transfer request information informed from the communication terminal <b>5</b>. Thus, the communication terminal <b>5</b> itself does not need to get access to the mail server <b>4</b>. Therefore, the communication terminal <b>5</b> itself does not need to register the setting information for receiving the electronic mail from the mail server <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, it has become to be able to transfer only mails which the user wants. So, the communication time has shortened. This would be convenient if the communication terminal <b>5</b> borrowed from clients is being connected by dialing, because the communication cost can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">The Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The overall configuration of this second embodiment is same as that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, the internal configuration of the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to the second embodiment will be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B has the same configuration as the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. And, further it comprises a information recognizer <b>34</b> of facsimile and a transfer controller <b>35</b> of facsimile. The information recognizer <b>34</b> abstracts the destination telephone number and the mail address of the original sender from the electronic mail transfer request document received via facsimile. The transfer controller <b>35</b> transforms the electronic mail detected by the information recognizer <b>34</b> into facsimile data. And, it sends the data via facsimile.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&lt;Operation&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, the operation of the second embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, the user makes use of a facsimile borrowed at the client's office. And, the user receives the electronic mail addressed to the user via facsimile to read the mail.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As going back to the first embodiment here, the electronic mail transfer request from outside is sent by the mailer application program in the communication terminal <b>5</b> borrowed from the client. In this sending process, practically a specific electronic mail is transferred to the mail account which belongs to the communication terminal <b>5</b> used by the client.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the other hand, in the electronic mail transfer via facsimile, the user sends an electronic mail transfer request via facsimile to the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B. And, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B transforms the electronic mail into facsimile data. After these processes, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B sends the data via facsimile to the telephone number assigned in the client's office where the user sends transfer request.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereinafter, the electronic mail transfer operation by this facsimile communication will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an electronic mail transfer request document of facsimile data arrives at the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B from the facsimile device not shown in the drawings. In the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B, the facsimile data (image data) is received by NCU <b>21</b> via the analog fixed communication network <b>1</b><i>a</i>. And, it is processed by MODEM <b>22</b> and ENCDEC <b>23</b> to memorize in the image memory <b>24</b>. In this process, the image data is not printed out by the printer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">And, in the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B, the information recognizer <b>34</b> takes in the facsimile data of the electronic mail transfer request document out of the image memory <b>24</b> under the control of CPU <b>31</b>. And, it abstracts the destination (client's office) telephone number and the mail address of the original sender. There are four methods of abstraction which are described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, the information recognizer <b>34</b> abstracts the telephone number from TSI/CSI (transmitting subscriber identification/called subscriber identification) signal in facsimile transmission procedure (for example, G3 standardized format of ITU-T (international Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector)/T.30 Recommendation).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Second, for example, destination telephone number, mail address of the original sender and so on are put in the available area in G3 standardized format of ITU-T/T.30 Recommendation so as to send via facsimile. And, from this signal, the information recognizer <b>34</b> abstracts destination telephone number, mail address of the original sender and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, facsimile transmission is not only processed under G3 standard of T.30 Recommendation. But it is also processed under G4 standard and so on. Third, the destination telephone number, mail address of the original sender and so on are written in the facsimile document. The information recognizer <b>34</b> abstracts destination telephone number, mail address of the original sender and so on by the character recognition method known well.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Fourth, a mail transfer request rule is established in advance. And, the information recognizer <b>34</b> recognizes the dual tone (two different frequency signal assigned to each DTMF/key) signal in push-button telephone formula of facsimile or telephone not described in the drawings, so as to abstract destination telephone number, mail address of the original sender and so on. The information recognizer <b>34</b> searches mail addresses registered in the mail server access unit <b>28</b> when it recognized mail transfer request data of facsimile document for access to the mail server <b>4</b>. When it recognized the mail address registered, the information recognizer <b>34</b> registers mail server name, account of the mail server, password, mail check ON/OFF and specific mail address for transfer in the mail server access unit <b>28</b> (area <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>28</b>-n) as well as the first embodiment. However, it uses the method either of the four methods mentioned above instead of the method of the first embodiment. And, the destination of this embodiment is telephone number which the user uses at the client's office. The information recognizer <b>34</b> registers the telephone number of facsimile in the transfer controller <b>35</b>. By these processes, the registration in the mail server access unit <b>28</b> and the transfer controller <b>35</b> is finished. The mail check process about the mail server <b>4</b> which mail check is set ON is same as the first embodiment. Moreover, specific mail address for transfer can be omitted. In this occasion, all the mail addressed to the user are transferred. This is same as the first embodiment, too. That is, the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>B checks the mail server <b>4</b> by the mail server access unit <b>28</b> periodically (for example, every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour). When the mail server access unit <b>28</b> detected an electronic mail which has given the mail address of the user, the transfer controller <b>35</b> transforms this electronic mail into facsimile data.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">This facsimile data is sent via facsimile to the destination facsimile telephone number registered by the mail transfer request document. This facsimile transmission is processed by the transmission procedure T.30 of ITU-T standard G3 formula known well. That is, this procedure comprises handshaking with transmission character by training signal. Further description is omitted, because the art is known well.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&lt;Additional Remarks&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As additionally remarked, when electronic mails are sent via facsimile, it is possible to adopt the formula of transforming only text file into facsimile data for transfer. In this occasion, only character codes are transferred. What is called control codes (line changing or character end mark/character code can be ASCII or Unicode and so on) is not sent. Moreover, it is possible to transform only appended file of format known well into facsimile data for transfer. Such files are compressed image data of stills (for example, JPEG (joint photographic experts group) by ITU-T standardization), image file (for example, TIFF: tagged image file format) and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, in the second embodiment, even if the user could not borrow the communication device which can process electronic mail communication, he or she is able to receive and read the electronic mails at the client's office. Because the electronic mails can be transferred from ISP via facsimile in facsimile transmission procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the network transfer communication devices <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B in the first and second embodiments, comprise to be separated from the mail server <b>4</b> connected to the communication network. But, it is possible to combine the network transfer communication device <b>6</b>A or <b>6</b>B with the mail server <b>4</b> at the same site.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present invention can be embodied in the communication system and communication device which are able to receive mails without mail server <b>4</b>.</p>
