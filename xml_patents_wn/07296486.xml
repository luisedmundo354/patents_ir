<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/124,505, filed on May 6, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,231,837.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of controllers. More specifically, the present invention discloses a hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter. In contemplated embodiments, the hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter may be used as part of an angular movement detector and a system of deploying such angular movement detectors useful in controlling movement of an articulated arm. In claimed embodiments, the angular movement detector comprises a hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter which uses an eccentrically rotating main shaft to rotate a drive shaft to which the main shaft is loosely connected to further rotate a socket housing about a constant central axis. A trigger mounted in the socket housing generates a detectable field.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In existing manipulator or robotic arm designs, the angular displacement of one or more joints is monitored with a resolver, potentiometer, or other rotation sensor. These require some sort of mechanical connection, typically a shaft, between the moveable portion of the joint and the sensor. Sensors are typically held stationary by the non-moveable portion of the joint. In a subsea environment, mechanical connection, e.g. a shaft, must be equipped with a mechanical connection seal to prevent seawater intrusion into the sensor. This mechanical connection seal is prone to failure, thus resulting in the subsequent failure of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, existing solutions require discrete wiring for each sensor installed. Arms with large numbers of joint sensors require considerable wiring that can be difficult to install and maintain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, existing sensor types often require that some sort of host controller read analog values that are produced by the sensor, e.g. a resolver or potentiometer. This requires that the controller provide processing power to read, filter, and scale the readings of each of the sensors which have had to transmit analog signals over long, noise-prone conductors.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In exemplary embodiments described herein below, the inventions comprise one or more angular movement detectors <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) capable of resolution of angular movement of two members rotatably joined and moveable within at least two planes. Position sensing system <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) comprises two or more such angular movement detectors <b>10</b> and communications network <b>100</b> with which sensors <b>12</b> are operatively in communication. Redundant system <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) provides additional features to system <b>1</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, in typical embodiments, each angular movement detector <b>10</b> is adapted to be housed within) but isolated from manipulator joint <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Angular movement detector <b>10</b> is mechanically decoupled from the rotation of joint <b>50</b> with respect to trigger <b>54</b>, e.g. field generator <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), to which sensor <b>12</b>, housed either within or proximate angular movement detector <b>10</b>, is sensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, angular movement detector <b>10</b> is useful for an articulated arm control network, e.g. network <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or network <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and comprises sensor <b>12</b> adapted to be disposed within or proximate joint <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of articulated member <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). and trigger <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) disposed proximate to sensor <b>12</b>. Sensor <b>12</b> can sense changes in or caused by trigger <b>54</b>. Electronics <b>14</b> may be present and in communication with sensor <b>12</b>, e.g. to further condition or otherwise adapt signals from sensor <b>12</b> and to interface with articulated arm control network <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>. For example, electronics <b>14</b> may comprise a suitable analog-to-digital converter.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Sensor <b>12</b> and/or trigger <b>54</b> as well as electronics <b>14</b> may be mounted on one or more carrier plates <b>16</b>.</p>

This signal may be translated into a digital representation and communicated via communications network <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to controller <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) which may then interpret the digital representation to resolve angular movement of joint <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in or about which hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter <b>300</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a further embodiment, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</figref>, angular movement of a first moving component (e.g., <b>50</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) with respect to a second component (e.g., <b>50</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) where these components <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>are rotatably joined at joint <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to effect motion in at least two planes, may be determined by eccentrically rotating main shaft <b>320</b> about central longitudinal axis <b>317</b> of central channel <b>316</b> of motor body <b>301</b> in which main shaft <b>320</b> is at least partially disposed and, accordingly, eccentrically rotating drive shaft <b>330</b>, to which main shaft <b>320</b> is loosely connected, by the rotation of main shaft <b>320</b>. The rotation of drive shaft <b>330</b> causes rotation of socket housing <b>312</b> about a constant central axis, e.g. central longitudinal axis <b>317</b>, where drive shaft <b>330</b> is disposed within motor body <b>301</b> and loosely connected to socket housing <b>312</b>. Rotating magnet <b>54</b> mounted in an internal chamber of socket housing <b>312</b> generates magnetic field which is detected by sensor <b>12</b> located within the generated magnetic field. The detected generated magnetic field is translated into digital data representative of the generated magnetic field, e.g. by sensor <b>12</b> or electronics <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) associated with sensor <b>12</b>, which are then communicated to controller <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).

<claim-text>15. A method for determining angular movement of a first movable component with respect to a second component, the components rotatably joined at a joint to effect motion in at least two planes, comprising:
<claim-text>a. eccentrically rotating a main shaft about a central longitudinal axis of a central channel of a motor body in which the main shaft is at least partially disposed;</claim-text>
<claim-text>b. eccentrically rotating a drive shaft to which the main shaft is loosely connected by the rotation of the main shaft, the drive shaft rotation causing rotation of a socket housing about a constant central axis, the drive shaft disposed within the motor body and loosely connected to the socket housing;</claim-text>
<claim-text>c. generating a magnetic field by rotating a magnet mounted in an internal chamber of the socket housing;</claim-text>
<claim-text>d. detecting the generated magnetic field by a sensor located within the magnetic field;</claim-text>
<claim-text>e. translating the detected generated magnetic field into digital data representative of the generated magnetic field;</claim-text>
<claim-text>f. communicating the digital data to a controller; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>g. using the communicated digital data to effect a decision by the controller regarding further movement of the first movable component with respect to the second component.</claim-text>
