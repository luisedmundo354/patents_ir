<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a dual-injector fuel injection engine in which fuel is injected into a combustion chamber and intake passage from respective injectors.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, in a conventional automobile engine, one fuel injector is provided to each cylinder. In an engine of this type, an injector which injects fuel directly into a combustion chamber and an injector which injects fuel into an intake passage may be provided in order to improve the output and fuel cost, as disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-315733 (to be merely referred to as reference 1 hereinafter) or 2002-48035 (to be merely referred to as reference 2 hereinafter).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the engine described in reference 1, an in-cylinder injector which injects fuel into the combustion chamber is attached to that lower end of a cylinder head which is close to a cylinder block. An injector which injects fuel (light oil) into an intake passage is attached to that side of the cylinder head which is opposite to the in-cylinder injector across an intake port.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The engine described in reference 2 is a multi-cylinder engine. An in-cylinder injector is arranged at the lower end of a cylinder head. An intake pipe injector which injects fuel into an intake passage is arranged in an intake manifold attached to the cylinder head.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The intake manifold extends upward from a side portion of the cylinder head and then to the other side of the cylinder head across a portion above the cylinder head. In the intake manifold, a surge tank is arranged above the cylinder head, and a throttle valve is arranged in the vicinity of the upstream of the surge tank. A supercharger is connected to the upstream of the throttle valve through an intake pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The two types of injectors shown in reference 2 are attached such that delivery pipes are fitted in their ends opposite to the fuel injection ports, and the fuel is supplied from the delivery pipes. Of the two types of injectors, the intake pipe injector is attached to the outer side of that curved portion of the intake manifold which is curved beside the cylinder head and extends vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An engine as described in reference 1 or 2 in which each cylinder is provided with two injectors has a larger number of injectors than in a general engine. Accordingly, the number of assembling steps increases to make the assembly cumbersome. More specifically, when actually manufacturing an engine of this type, operation of attaching the intake pipe injector and its delivery pipe to the engine and operation of attaching the intake manifold to the cylinder head are performed almost simultaneously in a narrow area. Hence, until one of the two operations ends, the other operation must wait. The intake manifold must be attached and detached in maintenance of the intake pipe injector. The problem of overlapping operations thus occurs not only in the manufacture of the engine but also in the maintenance as well.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in reference 2, often, the intake pipe injector and its delivery pipe are connected to each other by fitting the intake pipe injector in the delivery pipe, and they are sealed by a seal member such as an O-ring. If the intake pipe injector and its delivery pipe are aligned incompletely, fuel may leak from the sealed portion partly because the fuel is pressurized excessively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an engine in which each cylinder is provided with two injectors should be assembled easily and appropriately without requiring overlapping operations, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When an intake pipe injector is to be mounted in an engine of this type readily, the intake pipe injector should not extend outside the intake manifold to make the engine bulky, as in the engine shown in reference 2.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and has as its object to provide a dual-injector fuel injection engine in which, while two types of injectors can be mounted in the engine in a compact manner, the intake pipe injector and a delivery pipe can be mounted and maintained easily with high mounting accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a dual-injector fuel injection engine comprising a cylinder block formed with a plurality of cylinder holes, a cylinder head attached on the cylinder block, an intake port formed in the cylinder head to extend from a combustion chamber obliquely upward with respect to an axis of each cylinder and serving as an intake passage for each cylinder, an intake manifold connected to the intake port at a downstream end thereof and including an intake passage branch for each cylinder, a surge tank provided upstream of the intake manifold and shared by a plurality of cylinders, an in-cylinder injector provided to each cylinder to inject feel directly into the combustion chamber, an intake pipe injector provided to each cylinder to inject the fuel into the intake port, a first delivery pipe connected to all in-cylinder injectors to supply the fuel thereto, and a second delivery pipe connected to all intake pipe injectors to supply the fuel thereto, wherein the in-cylinder injector is positioned below the intake port, when seen from an axial direction of a crank shaft, and attached to the cylinder head, and the intake pipe injector and the second delivery pipe are supported above the intake port, when seen from the axial direction of the crank shaft, by the intake manifold to be close to the intake port.</p>

The rotational direction refers to the direction in which the intake pipe injector <b>56</b> rotates about the center line extending in the longitudinal direction of the intake pipe injector <b>56</b> as the center. The alignment means aligns the intake pipe injector <b>56</b> in the rotational direction with respect to the low-pressure delivery pipe <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The intake pipe injector <b>56</b>, without being mounted with the low-pressure delivery pipe <b>57</b>, is attached to the flange <b>55</b>.

The distal end of the air inlet pipe <b>86</b> is located above the first cylinder row <b>2</b>, and provided with a throttle valve <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Intake air passing through the throttle valve <b>87</b> passes through the intake passage comprising the interior of the air inlet pipe <b>86</b>, the interior of the surge tank <b>84</b>, the interior of the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b>, the intake passages <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, and the intake port <b>11</b> and flows into the combustion chamber <b>16</b>. The intake port <b>11</b> is not provided with a swirl control valve to generate a swirl in the combustion chamber, a tumble control valve to generate a tumble in the combustion chamber, or a member corresponding to any such valve. Namely, the intake port <b>11</b> constitutes a so-called high-flow-rate intake port. The swirl described above refers to the circulating flow of intake air about the axis of the cylinder as the center. The tumble described above refers to the circulating flow of intake air which circulates about the center line in a direction intersecting the axis of the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> having the arrangement as described above, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> of the respective cylinders and the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> to be connected to the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are supported by one sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>. Thus, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be mounted in the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> so as to form one assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the operation of mounting the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be performed prior to mounting the intake manifold <b>21</b> to the engine <b>1</b>. The intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be removed from the engine <b>1</b> by removing the intake manifold <b>21</b> from the engine <b>1</b>. Thus, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be maintained easily.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The in-cylinder injectors <b>15</b> and intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> according to this embodiment are located to be divided into the downstream side and upstream side of the intake air and arranged to be distributed into the lower side and upper side across the intake passage. Therefore, in this engine <b>1</b>, the two types of injectors <b>15</b> and <b>56</b>, or the delivery pipes <b>36</b> and <b>57</b> do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> are supported by the intake manifold <b>21</b>. Accordingly, inspection on fuel leakage from the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be performed prior to mounting the intake manifold <b>21</b> on the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b>. Therefore, any other member does not interfere with the above inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> are supported by the intake manifold <b>21</b>, as described above. Accordingly, the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be aligned with the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> highly accurately. Therefore, the fitting portions of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and the connection members <b>64</b> of the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be aligned highly accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the intake manifold <b>21</b> is divided into the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> and main intake manifold <b>52</b>, and the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> are attached to the relatively small sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>. Therefore, handlings such as conveyance of the assembly constituted by the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>, intake pipe injectors <b>56</b>, and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b>, and attaching and detaching of the assembly on and from the engine <b>1</b> can be performed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the attaching seats <b>59</b> of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are arranged at positions close to the mating surface <b>60</b> of the cylinder head <b>6</b> and sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>. Accordingly, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be attached to the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> to be as low as possible. In spite that the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> of the main intake manifold <b>52</b> is arranged above the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b>, the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> can be arranged at a low position. As a result, when mounting the engine <b>1</b> in the front engine room of an automobile, a sufficiently large gap can be reserved between an engine hood (not shown) and the engine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this engine, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are disposed in the space S<b>2</b>, surrounded by the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> of the main intake manifold <b>52</b>, the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>, and the members of the cylinder head <b>6</b>, to be away from these members. When setting the attaching angles of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b>, since the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> will not interfere with the respective surrounding members, the degrees of freedom in design of the attaching angles increase. As a result, the fuel injecting directions of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be set toward the valve bodies <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the intake valves <b>13</b>, as shown in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiments the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b>, in an attaching state of being fitted on the upper ends of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b>, are located to be lower than the mating surface <b>67</b> of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> and main intake manifold <b>52</b>. Therefore, with this engine <b>1</b>, the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> can be arranged at a low position while avoiding interference between the pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> of the main intake manifold <b>52</b> and the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> according to this embodiment are supported by the attaching seats <b>76</b> arranged on the flange <b>55</b> at the lower end of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> through the insulators <b>65</b>. Therefore, the sufficiently long insulators <b>65</b> can be mounted by using the space between the flange <b>55</b> and the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> which are upwardly away from the connection flange <b>55</b> by an amount corresponding to the length of each intake pipe injector <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the fuel injecting portions <b>58</b> of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> project closer toward the cylinder head <b>6</b> than the mating surface <b>60</b> of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> and cylinder head <b>6</b>. Therefore, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be positioned at low positions, and the distance between the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and the valve bodies <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the intake valves <b>13</b> can be made short. In the engine <b>1</b>, since the fuel injecting portions <b>58</b> project downward to be lower than the mating surface <b>60</b>, when compared to a case wherein the fuel injecting portions <b>58</b> are located above the mating surface <b>60</b>, the attaching seats <b>59</b> of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> can be formed thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> of the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, its one side having the intake passages <b>53</b> on the side of the first cylinder row <b>2</b> and its other side having the intake passages <b>54</b> on the side of the second cylinder row <b>3</b> are formed integrally. Hence, the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> can support all the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> of the V-type multi-cylinder engine <b>1</b>. Therefore, with the engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the plurality of intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be mounted easily.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the intake port <b>11</b> and the intake passage branch of each cylinder of the intake manifold <b>21</b> are located inside the two cylinder rows which line up to form the V shape when seen from the axial direction of the crank shaft <b>27</b>. The in-cylinder injectors <b>15</b> are arranged in the inner space sandwiched by the intake ports <b>11</b> of the respective cylinder rows. Therefore, the in-cylinder injectors <b>15</b> can be mounted by using the space formed between the two cylinder rows while avoiding interference with other members.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, in this engine <b>1</b>, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are arranged in the space S<b>2</b> sandwiched by the intake passage branches of the respective cylinders of the intake manifold <b>21</b> and the upper portions of the cylinder heads <b>6</b>. Also, the upstream portion (main intake manifold <b>52</b>) of the intake manifold <b>21</b> of the engine <b>1</b> is arranged to extend across above the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> of the second cylinder row <b>3</b>. Therefore, with this engine <b>1</b>, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be mounted by effectively using the dead space S<b>2</b> which is surrounded and formed by the upper portions of the cylinder heads <b>6</b>, the intake passage branches of the respective cylinders of the intake manifold <b>21</b> extending upward from the cylinder heads <b>6</b>, and the upstream portion of the intake manifold <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, with the engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the two types of injectors <b>15</b> and <b>56</b>, the high-pressure delivery pipes <b>36</b>, and low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> can be arranged in a compact manner between the first and second cylinder rows <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. As the main intake manifold <b>52</b> can be set close to the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b>, the entire engine <b>1</b> car be formed to have a relatively small height. The effect of forming the engine <b>1</b> compact while suppressing its height is obtained as a result of effectively using the space formed in the V-type engine. This effect can similarly be obtained if the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are directly attached to the cylinder heads <b>6</b> in the space S<b>2</b> or if the surge tank <b>84</b> of the intake cam shaft <b>23</b> covers the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> from above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> are connected to those portions of the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> which are close to the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>.

Therefore, the fuel injecting directions of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> can be set toward the valve bodies of the intake valves <b>13</b>. Also, the area of that portion of the intake passage where the injected fuel attaches can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, as the connectors <b>72</b> of the intake pipe injectors <b>56</b> oppose the recesses <b>71</b> of the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b>, the connectors <b>72</b> can be arranged beside the low-pressure delivery pipes <b>57</b> so as not to largely project upward.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>95</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an in-line multi-cylinder engine having only one cylinder row. This engine <b>95</b> has almost the same structure as that of the V-type multi-cylinder engine <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> except that the number of cylinder rows is different. Thus, a sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> of an intake manifold <b>21</b> employed in the dual-injector fuel injection engine <b>95</b> of this embodiment is formed of only one side of the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b> shown in the first embodiment so as to be connected to intake ports <b>11</b> of one cylinder row. A main intake manifold <b>52</b> has a pipe-shaped portion <b>83</b> to be connected to the sub-intake manifold <b>51</b>, and is provided with a surge tank <b>84</b> to be located above one cylinder row.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Even when the engine has a different shape in this manner, the same effect as that of the first embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, according to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors of the respective cylinders and the second delivery pipe to be connected to the intake pipe injectors can be mounted in the intake manifold so as to form one assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, according to the present invention, as the operation of mounting the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipe can be performed prior to mounting the intake manifold to the engine, the assembly operation can be facilitated. According to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipe can be removed from the engine by removing the intake manifold from the engine. Thus, the intake pipe injector can be maintained easily.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The in-cylinder injectors and intake pipe injectors of the dual-injector fuel injection engine according to the present invention are located to be divided into the downstream side and upstream side of the intake ports and arranged to be distributed into the lower side and upper side across the intake port. Therefore, in this engine, the two types of injectors or delivery pipes do not interfere with each other. Thus, the two types of injectors and delivery pipes can be arranged in a narrow space, thus making the entire engine compact.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Therefore, according to the present invention, while the two types of injectors are mounted in the engine in a compact manner, the intake pipe injectors and delivery pipes can be mounted and maintained easily.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, in the dual-injector fuel injection engine according to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipes are supported by the intake manifold. Therefore, in this dual-injector fuel injection engine, inspection on fuel leakage from the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipes can be performed prior to mounting the intake manifold on the engine. Namely, the engine does not interfere with the above inspection, so that the inspection can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the engine according to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors and the second delivery pipes are supported by one intake manifold, as described above. Accordingly, the second delivery pipes can be aligned with the intake pipe injectors highly accurately. Therefore, according to the present invention, the fitting portions of the intake pipe injectors and the second delivery pipes can be aligned highly accurately, so fuel leakage from the fitting portion can be prevented reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors and the second delivery pipes are attached to the downstream portion of the intake manifold which is a relatively small component. Therefore, the assembly constituted by these members can be handled easily. Consequently, according to the present invention, attaching, maintenance, and fuel leakage inspection of the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipes can be further facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors can be attached to the intake manifold to be as low as possible. Hence, when the upstream portion of the intake manifold is to be arranged above the intake pipe injection injectors, the upstream portion can be positioned low.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As a result, in an automobile mounted with the engine according to the present invention, a sufficiently large gap can be reserved between an engine hood (bonnet) and the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the upstream portion of the intake manifold is to be arranged above the intake pipe injectors, the intake pipe injectors can be disposed in a space surrounded by the upstream and downstream portion of the intake manifold and the cylinder head to be away from these members. With this arrangement, when setting the attaching angles of the intake pipe injectors, the degrees of freedom in design increase. As a result, the fuel injecting directions of the intake pipe injectors can be set toward the valve bodies (canopies) of the intake valves.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to the present invention, when the upstream portion of the intake manifold is to be arranged above the intake pipe injectors, it can be arranged at a low position while avoiding interference between the upstream portion and the second delivery pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As a result, in an automobile mounted with the engine according to the present invention, a sufficiently large gap can be reserved between an engine hood and the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the present invention, a long heat-insulating member can be used by using the space between the attaching seats and the low-pressure delivery pipes which are upwardly away from the attaching seats of the intake manifold by an amount corresponding to the length of each intake pipe injector. As a result, heat insulation of the portions where the second delivery pipes are attached to the cylinder head can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors can be positioned at relatively low positions, and the distance between the intake pipe injectors and the valve bodies (valve faces) of the intake valves can be made short. Therefore, according to the present invention, the fuel injection ports of the intake pipe injectors can be formed to be directed toward the valve bodies of the intake valves. As a result, the area of that portion of the wall surface of the intake passage where the fuel injected from the injectors attaches can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also, when compared to a case wherein the fuel injecting portions of the intake pipe injectors are located on a side closer to the surge tank than the mating surface of the intake manifold and cylinder head, the attaching seats formed in the intake manifold for the intake pipe injectors can be formed thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to the present invention, all the intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipes of the V-type multi-cylinder engine can be supported by one component.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Therefore, according to the present invention, the plurality of intake pipe injectors and second delivery pipes can be mounted in the V-type multi-cylinder engine easily. In addition, the plurality of intake pipe injectors can be removed from the engine at once to perform maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to the present invention, the two types of injectors and the first and second delivery pipes can be arranged in a compact manner between the two cylinder rows of the V-type engine. In addition, according to the present invention, as the upstream portion of the intake manifold can be set close to the intake pipe injectors, a V-type engine having a relatively small height can he provided.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors can be arranged close to the intake manifold so as to extend along the intake passage. Hence, according to the present invention, the intake pipe injectors can inject the fuel toward the valve bodies (canopies) of the intake valves. Also, the area of that portion of the wall surface of the intake passage where the fuel attaches can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to the present invention, the connectors of the intake pipe injectors can be arranged beside the second delivery pipes so as not to largely project upward. Hence, according to the present invention, the upstream portion of the intake manifold can be arranged at a low position above the second delivery pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to the present invention, the attaching bolts to attach the second delivery pipes to the intake manifold and the attaching bolts to attach the intake to the cylinder head can be arranged in the dead space formed between the second delivery pipes and the side wall surface of the cylinder head. Thus, according to the present invention, when compared to a case wherein these bolts are located outside the second delivery pipes, the engine can be downsized in the widthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Therefore, according to the present invention, a dual-injector fuel injection engine which has a relatively small height and a small width as a whole can be formed compact.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to the present invention, the pulsation dampers can be attached to the lower portions of the second delivery pipes in a compact manner. Thus, according to the present invention, when the upstream portion of the intake manifold is to be arranged above the second delivery pipes, the position in the direction of height of the upstream portion is not limited by the pulsation dampers.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to the present invention, the attaching seats which serve to attach the intake pipe injectors in the intake manifold can be made compact, so as to prevent the intake passage from being narrowed by the attaching seats. Hence, according to the present invention, the intake manifold can be formed such that the resistance occurring when the intake air flows through the intake passage of the intake manifold is decreased as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention can be used as an engine for a vehicle such as an automobile.</p>
