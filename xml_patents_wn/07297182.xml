No. 11/366,274, filed Mar. 2, 2006 entitled Dual Flow Wet Electrostatic Precipitator that claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/657,901 filed Mar. 2, 2005.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention pertains to a Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP) apparatus and method for removing particulate matter and environmentally hazardous gases produced from the combustion of biomass and biomass supplemented fuel sources. The invention also pertains to an apparatus having the capacity to continuously self-clean collected biomass derived particulate matter, while also scrubbing acid gases derived from biomass oxidation, and act as an electrode ozone generator or alternatively as a non-thermal plasma generator for biomass derived nitrous oxidation conversion in a single unitary device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There have been continuing attempts to improve techniques for removing fine particulates from biomass fuel oxidation-exhaust gas streams. The conventional method in biomass combustion has been to use boilers in conjunction with dry electrostatic precipitators to collect fly ash. The fly ash has often been comprised of partially combusted organic matter mixed in with the inorganic constituents. These semi-organic particles have traditionally precipitated on collecting surfaces in dry precipitators forming potential fire and maintenance hazards. Among the recent improvements is the utilization of condensing wet electrostatic precipitators wherein the particulates carried by an incoming gas stream are entrained in condensate formed on walls of the precipitator and are flushed from the walls for collection. Also known is a down-flow type of WESP in which the water droplets move concurrently with the gas and provide a cleaning action when deposited together with particles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite such improvements, however, there remains a need for an improved apparatus and methods for eliminating all or substantially all of a particulate matter from a gas stream. Furthermore, a need exists for removing particulate matter and environmentally hazardous gases produced from the combustion of biomass and biomass supplemented fuel sources. This invention seeks to provide such an apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional systems utilize three separate and distinct pieces of equipment in order to treat effluent gases from the oxidation of biomass derived fuels. These three pieces of equipment are an electrostatic precipitator, an acid gas scrubber, and a selective catalytic reduction reactor. In the conventional system, the electrostatic precipitator is used to remove, via electrostatic collection, biomass particulate matter resulting from the combustion of biomass. An acid gas scrubber located either upstream or downstream of the electrostatic precipitator is used to chemically introduce to the gasses strong reducing agents capable of chemically neutralizing the acid gas emissions that originate from the combustion of biomass. A selective catalytic reduction reactor is then required to treat the nitrogen oxide emissions originating from the combustion of biomass. This treatment of the nitrogen oxide emissions is done through the introduction of a strong reducing agent such as ammonia into the gas stream.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These three separate pieces of equipment have various physical interconnections and multiple control connections that increase the cost and complexity of installation and operation. For this reason, a single apparatus that could perform the functions the three conventional pieces of equipment would be an important improvement in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides an apparatus for removing particulate matter and toxic gases from a gas stream containing particular matter. The apparatus is comprised of: a mist-producing device that mixes a gas stream entering the apparatus with liquid droplets; a Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP) section that includes ionizing electrodes that electrically charge the particulate matter and the intermixed liquid droplets and collecting surfaces that are under the influence of an electrical field and therefore attract and remove electrically-charged particulate matter and intermixed liquid droplets from the gas stream; and a scrubbing section that is in flow communication with the WESP.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, involves an apparatus <b>10</b> comprised of an inlet transition <b>12</b> that includes a gas distribution perforated plate <b>14</b> and a fine liquid mist nozzle <b>16</b> located downstream of, and proximal to the inlet <b>12</b>. A support structure <b>18</b> for ionizing electrodes is positioned downstream of the distribution plate <b>14</b>. Support insulators <b>20</b> isolate negative ionizing electrodes from positive tubes while ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>, having a charging stage with sharp corona generating points <b>26</b> and a smooth repelling stage <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, extend from the support structure <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The ionizing electrodes <b>22</b> are preferably located centrally in the spaces defined by collecting surfaces <b>30</b> (“collectors”). These collecting surfaces <b>30</b> can be created by tubular or flat plate structures. Located below the collectors <b>30</b>, and preferably in the bottom of a housing <b>32</b> is a sump for the down-flow section for collecting liquid. A drain nozzle <b>34</b> is also located in the vicinity of the sump.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the sump in the bottom of the housing <b>32</b> is separated by a dividing wall <b>36</b>, in order to create a separate sump for the up-flow section and a recycle pump <b>38</b>. Above the sump for the up-flow section are washing spray nozzles <b>40</b>, which are followed by gas distribution plates <b>42</b>, which are followed by ionizing electrodes <b>48</b> which include ionizing points <b>50</b> and a repelling stage <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Juxtaposed around the ionizing electrodes <b>48</b> are up-flow WESP collectors <b>44</b>. These collectors <b>44</b> may be of a hexagonal shape. The ionizing electrodes <b>48</b> of the up-flow section can be supported by the frame <b>54</b> and insulators <b>56</b>. Wash nozzles <b>58</b> are preferably located above the frame <b>54</b>. An outlet transition <b>60</b> is located downstream of the wash nozzles <b>58</b>. High voltage power is supplied by a power supply <b>62</b>. Moreover, one of the WESP units can be turned on or off, as required, using a high voltage switch <b>64</b>. This high voltage switch <b>64</b> also incorporates high voltage diodes which prevent the sparking in the down-flow section from influencing the operation of the up-flow section. In the event the inlet gas contains high concentrations of submicron particles (i.e., more than 0.2 gr/acf for particles below 0.5 micron) that can create so-called corona current suppression, each section of the WESP will be powered by separate power supplies <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When in operation, an incoming gas stream “A” laden with solid particulates and acidic gases enters the inlet transition <b>12</b> that incorporates perforated plates <b>14</b> for gas distribution and the mist nozzle <b>16</b> that sprays a fine liquid mist onto the gas. Upon entering the down-flow WESP section, the solid particles along with the liquid droplets are charged in an ionizing stage, where the sharp points <b>26</b> create the flow of the negative ions. Under the influence of the electrical field, the charged particles and droplets migrate together towards the collecting surfaces <b>30</b>. The collection process is most effective in the repelling stage, where the high voltage field is uniform between the collecting walls <b>30</b> and repeller <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">During the operation, most of the sparking and arcing caused by the charged particles passing through the electrical field take place between the sharp points <b>26</b> of the ionizing electrodes <b>22</b> and the walls of the collector <b>30</b>, with practically no sparking taking place in the space between the smooth repeller <b>28</b> and the collector walls <b>30</b>. This minimizes the production of small droplets, thereby reducing the amount of extra energy required to capture them in the up-flow section of the apparatus <b>10</b>. It has been found that the greatest amount of ionizing current produced by the given length of the electrode takes place when the distance between two of the sharp points <b>26</b> is approximately half the distance from the end of the point to the closest collection wall. Furthermore, it has been found that the most efficient collection takes place when the diameter of the repeller <b>28</b> is ⅓ of the diameter of the collecting tube.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mixture of collected particles and water droplets moves substantially continuously downwards under the forces of gravity until they collect in the sump where they are drained out through the drain nozzle <b>34</b>. In still another embodiment of the invention, the down-flow WESP section may have only an ionizing stage while the up-flow WESP section has only a collecting stage on their respective electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>48</b> in order to maximize the potential of each section. It has been found that the best charging occurs when high pulsed voltage is passed through the sharp points <b>26</b> of the ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>. Likewise, the best collection occurs when a uniformed electrical field of smooth voltage passes through the repeller <b>28</b>. Therefore, in order to have an ionizing only stage in the down-flow WESP section, the section is supplied with a high pulsed voltage while a uniformed smooth voltage is supplied to the up-flow WESP section so as to allow for collection only in that section.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">During the operation, the gas A changes direction by about 90° at the bottom of the down-flow WESP section of the apparatus <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This change of direction helps to separate big water droplets (e.g., more than 100 microns) from the gas stream A by allowing the big droplets to drop from the down-flow WESP collector. Furthermore, the gas, along with the solid particles and smaller droplets that penetrated the down-flow WESP section, again change direction by about 90° above the sump, moves through the scrubbing section <b>24</b> and enters into the up-flow WESP section of the apparatus <b>10</b>. As a result of this flow pattern, the gas flow A makes a total change of direction of about 180° degrees above the common sump. In order to provide an even gas flow velocity in the cross section of the up-flow WESP section, following the 90° turn above the sump, the gas A enters additional scrubbing and gas distribution sections that have several perforated plates <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The moving gas A enters the gas scrubbing section <b>24</b> which is comprised of scrubbing elements, spray nozzles, a separate recycle liquid loop, and a gas entering distribution section <b>42</b>, where the liquid from the sprays <b>40</b> and turbulent gas flow creates a small pressure drop and, as a result, better gas velocity distribution in addition to the acidic gas scrubbing action, particularly when sprays <b>40</b> and <b>24</b> contain an alkali solution.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The particles and liquid droplets that still remain in the gas flow enter the up-flow WESP section and, preferably charged by the corona, discharge between the ionizing points <b>50</b> and walls of the collector <b>44</b>. When charged particles and droplets enter the space between the collector <b>44</b> and repeller <b>52</b>, high efficiency collection takes place. Furthermore, since there are more fine liquid droplets than particles in this section the continuous self-cleaning action also takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the space between the down-flow and up-flow WESP sections of housing <b>32</b> of the apparatus <b>10</b> may comprise additional gas scrubbing devices, such as packing, venturi, spray, rod decks and other with a separate recycle loop to remove various acid gases from a gas stream A. Scrubber designs depend on the specific inlet gas conditions including the types of acidic gases, their concentrations, and the required removal efficiency. In a case in which the inlet gas contains solids particles only, the scrubbing section is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is preferable that all, or substantially all, of the particulate matter and water droplets that exit the down-flow WESP section are charged and are removed by the grounded scrubbing section <b>24</b> and by the up-flow WESP section. In this regard, most of the solid particles are removed from the gas flow A in the down-flow WESP section. The mixture of the gas with the fine liquid droplets (generated in the WESP by sparking and arcing), along with fine scrubbing liquid droplets that have originated along the gas path in the apparatus <b>10</b>, enters the up-flow WESP section for final removal of submicron particles that have penetrated the down-flow WESP section and acid gas scrubbing section <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since there may be more liquid droplets than solids on a mass basis in the up-flow WESP section, the problem of contamination is overcome in addition to the complete and final mist elimination. Moreover, the fine droplets (e.g., of a size of less than about 10 microns, 5 microns, or even less than about 1 micron) which are generated by down-flow WESP section have the same or substantially the same diameter as solids particles and will be removed by the up-flow WESP section in the same or substantially the same part or portion of the collector area. This effect provides the continuous WESP washing and minimizes the sedimentation of solid particles on the upper dry surface of WESP collector as it takes place in the conventional up-flow WESP.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, down-flow and up-flow sections of the WESP are preferably located in a common housing <b>32</b>, have a common sump, and/or can share a common high voltage power supply <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each WESP section may also use separate power supplies <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that are adjusted accordingly to maximize the charging in the down-flow section and collection in the up-flow section.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, if the level of so-called Corona Current Suppression has begun to influence WESP efficiency, each of the WESP section is equipped with its own power supply <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which will be selected according to the required operating voltage and current, in a manner known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In still another embodiment of the invention, each of the WESP sections can be constructed as tubular or plate type and a liquid delivery method on the collecting surface <b>30</b> can be either as a fog from the spray nozzles <b>16</b> or as a liquid film with constant liquid delivery rate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the down-flow section of the WESP is a wet non-thermal plasma generator that is connected to a high voltage power supply that provides fast rising and short duration pulsed voltage with characteristics defined in a manner known to those of skill in the art. Non-thermal plasma, in this regard, can convert, for example, nitrous oxide (NO) into a soluble compound like nitrous dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) that will be scrubbed in the following scrubbing section, or can convert the elemental mercury to mercury oxide solids which can be removed by up-flow WESP. In this manner, the apparatus <b>10</b> can function as a multi-pollutant control system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention provides for extremely reliable and highly efficient wet particulate removal, while eliminating problems associated with conventional apparatuses, such as, for example, the presence of contaminated fine mist (e.g., droplets smaller than 15 microns in diameter) that are mainly responsible for the penetration from the conventional mist eliminator that follows the gas flow exiting the down-flow WESP section, and the need for periodic shut-downs for cleaning the conventional up-flow WESP section due to the contamination of the dry top of the collector resulting from large droplets which are bigger than particles not reaching the top.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the invention also involves an apparatus <b>10</b> for removing particulate matter and scrubbing toxic gases from a gas stream A, the apparatus <b>10</b> is comprised of a gas inlet <b>12</b> for a down-flow section of a WESP, at least one mist-producing device <b>16</b> located within the gas inlet <b>12</b>, a gas distribution plate <b>14</b> downstream of the at least one mist-producing device <b>16</b>, a plurality of ionizing electrodes <b>22</b> located in a collection section <b>30</b> positioned downstream of the at least one mist-producing device <b>16</b>, a repelling section <b>28</b> located on each of the plurality of ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>, a sump located downstream of the collection section <b>30</b>, a plurality of spray nozzles <b>40</b> located downstream of the sump in an up-flow section of a WESP, a gas distribution plate <b>42</b> downstream of the plurality of spray nozzles <b>40</b>, a plurality of collecting surfaces <b>44</b> downstream of the gas distribution plate <b>42</b>, an ionizing electrode <b>48</b> located within each of the plurality of collecting surfaces <b>44</b>, at least one wash nozzle <b>58</b> positioned downstream of the ionizing electrodes <b>48</b>, a gas outlet <b>60</b> downstream of the at least one wash nozzle <b>58</b>, and a power source <b>62</b> electrically connected to the apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment of the invention, a scrubbing section <b>24</b> is located in the sump upstream of the plurality of spray nozzles <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invention also involves a method for removing particulate matter and toxic gases from a gas stream, the method is comprised of: (1) introducing a contaminated gas stream into a housing; (2) spraying a fine liquid mist into the contaminated gas stream; (3) electrically charging particulates and droplets in the gas stream by passing the gas stream by at least one ionizing electrode; (4) collecting the electrically charged particulates and droplets on a collecting surface; (5) draining the collected electrically charged particulates and droplets into a sump; (6) flowing the gas stream upward; (7) spraying a fine liquid mist into the contaminated gas stream; (8) electrically charging particulates and droplets in the gas stream by passing the gas stream by at least one ionizing electrode; and (9) collecting charged particles and droplets on the collecting surfaces and discharging the gas stream through an outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment of the method, the gas stream is chemically scrubbed prior to flowing upward from the sump. In a specific version of this embodiment, the chemical scrubbing is accomplished using an alkaline solution.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In still another embodiment, the invention involves an air purification system for removing particulate matter and environmentally hazardous gases resulting from the combustion of biomass and biomass supplemented fuel sources. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the air purification system is comprised of an apparatus <b>110</b> having an inlet transition <b>112</b> that includes a liquid mist nozzle <b>114</b> located downstream of, and proximal to the inlet <b>112</b>. A perforated distribution plate <b>116</b> is located downstream of the mist nozzle <b>114</b>. In a particular embodiment of the invention, an ozone induction zone is located downstream of the distribution plate <b>116</b>. A support structure <b>118</b> for ionizing electrodes is positioned downstream of the distribution plate <b>116</b>. Support insulators <b>120</b> isolate negative ionizing electrodes <b>122</b> from positively charged tubes. The ionizing electrodes <b>122</b> include a charging stage with sharp corona generating points <b>126</b> and a smooth repelling stage <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ionizing electrodes <b>122</b> are preferably located centrally in the spaces defined by the collecting surfaces <b>130</b> (collectors). These collector surfaces <b>130</b> can by created by either tubular or flat plates structures. Located below the collectors <b>130</b>, and preferably in the bottom of a housing <b>132</b> is a sump <b>133</b> for collecting any liquids from the WESP and a chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b>. A liquid circulation pump <b>138</b> is connected to the chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the sump <b>32</b>, <b>132</b> is separated by a dividing wall <b>36</b>, <b>136</b> to segregate liquids draining from the WESP section and from the chemical scrubbing section <b>24</b>, <b>124</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an alternate arrangement in which two physically separate sumps <b>133</b>, <b>135</b> handle the liquid collection from the WESP and the chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the chemical scrubbing section <b>24</b> can be located between two separate WESP sections having collectors <b>30</b> and <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b> may also be downstream of a single WESP collection system. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b> may be downstream of the inlet flange <b>112</b> but upstream of a single WESP collecting section <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The chemical scrubbing section <b>124</b> is comprised of scrubbing elements (not shown), spray nozzles <b>137</b>, and a recirculating liquid pump <b>138</b>. Acidic gas scrubbing results in this section <b>124</b> when spray nozzles <b>137</b> contain an alkali solution.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, a WESP section with ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>122</b> is positioned downstream of the chemical scrubbing section <b>24</b>, <b>124</b>. The ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>122</b> may be of the up-flow type depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. These up-flow collectors <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> may be of a hexagonal shape. In the event the inlet gas contains high concentrations of submicron particles (i.e., more than 0.2 gr/acf for particles below 0.5 microns) two separate power supplies <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B will be supplied for each WESP section, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For lower concentrations a high voltage switch <b>64</b> will be supplied allowing one high voltage source <b>62</b> to supply both WESP collection sections <b>30</b>, <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When in operation, an incoming gas stream “A” laden with solid particulates, acidic gases, and NO<sub>x </sub>from a biomass oxidation off-gas enter the inlet transition <b>112</b>. A mist nozzle <b>116</b> sprays the gas stream A with a fine liquid mist. In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, a perforated distribution plate/ozone introduction zone <b>14</b>, <b>114</b> is used to distribute flow and reduce NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The gas stream A enters the WESP section in either a down-flow, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, or a counter-flow manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Once in the WESP section, the solid particles along with the liquid droplets are charged in an ionizing stage where the sharp points <b>26</b> of the ionizing electrodes <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, create the flow of the negative ions. Under the influence of the created electric field, the charge particles and droplets migrate toward the collectors <b>30</b>,<b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain embodiments of the invention, the WESP ionizing collectors <b>130</b> act as a wet non-thermal plasma generator connected to the high voltage power supply <b>162</b>. When acting as a non-thermal plasma generator, the collectors <b>130</b> aid in the conversion of compounds such as nitrous oxide (NO) into a soluble compound such as nitrous dioxide NO<sub>2</sub>) that is then scrubbed in the acid gas removal section <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The acid gas removal section <b>124</b> is comprised of additional gas scrubbing devices, such as packing, venturi, spray, rod decks, and other chemical introduction systems that are used to remove various acid gases from the gas stream A. The design of this section depends on the specific conditions of the inlet gas including the types of acid gases, their concentrations, and required removal efficiencies. Where the particulate concentration is low, the gas scrubber <b>124</b> can be located upstream of the WESP collectors <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When in operation, the chemicals utilized for acid gas neutralization are injected into the suction of recycle pump <b>138</b> and enter the scrubbing process through the acid gas solution scrubbing nozzles <b>137</b>. In still other embodiments of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a second WESP section is located downstream of the acid gas removal section. This allows for added NO<sub>x </sub>removal and greater particulate removal efficiency in cases involving high particulate gases. In these embodiments, the second downstream collection section is kept in a state of saturation through the use of outlet mist nozzles <b>158</b>. In all embodiments of the invention, the treated gas stream “A” exits the inventive apparatus <b>110</b> via an outlet transition that is designed to minimize the possibility of downstream liquid carry-over.</p>
