<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of liquid supplements and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for metering liquid nutritional supplements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to maintain optimum health, many people are encouraged to take nutritional supplements, such as vitamin and mineral supplements. These supplements are typically in solid form, such as pills, tablets, or capsules, which result in various problems. One of these problems is that solid form supplements are oftentimes hard to chew and/or swallow. In addition, solid form supplements are often bitter tasting and many times a consumer has to take more than one pill, tablet, or capsule, which makes them even harder to swallow. More importantly, consumers sometimes forget how many dosages they are supposed to consume and how often they are supposed to take them. This may lead to either under-dosage or over-dosage of the supplement.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Supplements less often come in liquid form; however, these liquid supplements may also lead to under-dosage or over-dosage because a consumer typically has to use a utensil, such as a tablespoon or teaspoon, to take the supplement. Not only does this result in either under-dosage or over-dosage, but can lead to spillage and waste of the supplement. Dosage cups may be used to take the liquid supplement; however, existing dosage cups may not be readily attainable. For example, a consumer may misplace it, it may be in the dishwasher, or a child may have hidden it.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dosage cup that is removably fixed to the cap of a container has, in the past, had internal structures that may contain too much bacteria and are hard to keep clean and sterile. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,761, a dosage cup is removably fixed to a cap of a container by numerous ribs that fit within grooves on the outside of the cap so that the dosage cup and cap can be removed from the container together. Additional internal structures on the inside of the dosage cup are provided to regulate axial travel of the dosage cup. A similar dosage cup is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,273,247. However, the dosage cup shown therein has a cup collar with retaining lugs to secure the dosage cup to the cap and additional axial ribs for additional stiffening for the cup collar.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method and apparatus for metering a liquid nutritional supplement is disclosed and provides a liquid dispenser having a body that contains a predetermined number of single dosages of the liquid nutritional supplement, a cap, such as a child-resistant cap, coupled to a neck portion of the body, and a dosage cup coupled to the cap. The dosage cup has at least four axial shoulders on an inside surface thereof that each has an engaging surface adapted to engage axial ridges of the cap. The dosage cup is coupled to the cap such that a force that is greater, by a predetermined amount, than the weight of the dosage cup is required to remove the dosage cup from the cap, and providing the dosage cup with an indicator adapted to indicate one of the single dosages of the liquid nutritional supplement to be consumed by a user for a predetermined time period.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another embodiment of the invention, a method for metering a liquid nutritional supplement includes providing a plurality of containers, wherein each container has a peel-away lid and contains a single dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement, and coupling the containers together in such a manner that all of the containers combined equal a required total dosage over a predetermined time period.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention provide a number of technical advantages. Embodiments of the invention may include all, some, or none of these advantages. One technical advantage is that a consumption of liquid nutritional supplements, such as dietary supplements, vitamin supplements, joint care supplements, etc., may be metered with accuracy. This allows a consumer to feel confident that he or she is receiving the correct dosage of liquid nutritional supplement for each required time period. Another technical advantage of one embodiment of the present invention is that a liquid dispenser containing the liquid nutritional supplement may be used that has a simplified dosage cup attached to a child-resistant cap. This relieves a user of having to use a separate dosage cup or other measuring device, such as a tablespoon. The simple dosage cup has very little structure on an inside thereof, which makes it much easier to keep clean and sterile. Additionally, reduced structure on the inside facilitates easy removal from the child-resistant cap while still providing enough grip on the cap to keep it secure during storage and/or transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other technical advantages are readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Example embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> of the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart demonstrating an example method of metering a liquid nutritional supplement in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> begins at step <b>100</b> where a liquid dispenser <b>200</b> is provided. Liquid dispenser <b>200</b> includes a body <b>202</b> having a neck portion <b>204</b>, a child-resistant cap <b>206</b> coupled to neck portion <b>204</b>, and a dosage cup <b>208</b> coupled to child-resistant cap <b>206</b>. Body <b>202</b> contains the liquid nutritional supplement to be consumed by a user. In the illustrated embodiment, body <b>202</b> contains an integral number of single dosages of the liquid nutritional supplement.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method continues at step <b>102</b> where child-resistant cap <b>206</b> is provided with a plurality of axial ridges <b>216</b> and a plurality of associated valleys <b>217</b> around an outside perimeter thereof. At step <b>104</b>, dosage cup <b>208</b> is provided with at least four axial shoulders <b>210</b> on an inside surface thereof. Each axial shoulder <b>210</b> has an engaging surface <b>211</b> that is adapted to engage the axial ridges <b>216</b> of child-resistant cap <b>206</b>. At step <b>106</b>, axial shoulders <b>210</b> engage axial ridges <b>216</b> of child-resistant cap <b>206</b>. Hence, dosage cup <b>208</b> is coupled to child-resistant cap <b>206</b>, as denoted by step <b>108</b>, such that a force that is greater, by a predetermined amount, than the weight of dosage cup <b>208</b> is required to remove dosage cup <b>208</b> from child-resistant cap <b>206</b>. The weight of dosage cup <b>208</b> is defined by the mass of dosage cup <b>208</b> times the acceleration of gravity. One technical advantage of the present invention is that dosage cup <b>208</b> is easily removable from child-resistant cap <b>206</b> without having to exert a great force on dosage cup <b>208</b> and without having to use the bulky and complicated systems used on previous liquid dispensers. The interaction of dosage cup <b>208</b> and child-resistant cap <b>206</b> is described in further detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">At step <b>110</b>, body <b>202</b> is provided with a pair of opposed indentations <b>212</b> adjacent neck portion <b>204</b> so that the user may easily handle the liquid dispenser. Opposed indentations <b>212</b> are described in more detail below. Dosage cup <b>208</b> is provided, at step <b>112</b>, with at least one indicator adapted to indicate one of the single dosages of a liquid nutritional supplement to be consumed by the user over a predetermined time period. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an indicator may be, for example, a one fluid ounce indicator <b>218</b> or a one-half fluid ounce indicator <b>220</b> as shown. This ends one example method of metering a liquid nutritional supplement for a user in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Another example method of metering a liquid nutritional supplement is described further below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Before the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, however, liquid dispenser <b>200</b> is described in more detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are perspective and exploded views, respectively, of an example liquid dispenser <b>200</b> for use in one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, liquid dispenser <b>200</b> generally includes body <b>202</b>, cap <b>206</b>, and dosage cup <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Body <b>202</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> to have a generally rectangular barrel shape with indentations <b>212</b> formed in an upper portion of body <b>202</b> adjacent neck portion <b>204</b>. Body <b>202</b> may have other shapes or configurations suitable for containing a liquid nutritional supplement therein. The liquid nutritional supplement contained within body <b>202</b> may be any suitable liquid nutritional supplement, such as a dietary supplement, a vitamin supplement, a joint care supplement, a calcium supplement, a vitamin E supplement, or other suitable supplements. As an example, the joint care supplement may consist of glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, and collagen. Body <b>202</b>, in one embodiment, is formed from a polymer, such as HDPE; however, body <b>202</b> may be formed from other suitable materials. An interior volume of body <b>202</b> may be any volume suitable to hold a predetermined number of single dosages of liquid nutritional supplement. As described above, in one embodiment, body <b>202</b> contains an integral number of single dosages of liquid nutritional supplement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Indentations <b>212</b> may have any suitable size, shape, and contour. Generally, indentations <b>212</b> are designed in such a manner that one of the indentations fits the general shape of a user's thumb and the other fits the general shape of a user's forefinger. There may be any number of indentations formed in body <b>202</b>. Indentations <b>212</b> facilitate the easy handling of liquid dispenser <b>200</b> during transportation or use, especially when dispensing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Neck portion <b>204</b> may have any suitable configuration and typically includes at least one thread <b>214</b> formed thereon. Thread <b>214</b> is adapted to accept internal threads of cap <b>206</b> (not explicitly shown) to securely couple cap <b>206</b> to body <b>202</b>. Neck portion <b>204</b> may have any suitable length and any suitable diameter. Neck portion <b>204</b> is typically formed integral with body <b>202</b>; however, neck portion <b>204</b> may be coupled to body <b>202</b> in other suitable manners. Neck portion <b>204</b> is typically formed from the same material as body <b>202</b>, which may be a polymer or other suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Cap <b>206</b> is adapted to couple to neck portion <b>214</b>. Any suitable cap may be utilized for liquid dispenser <b>200</b>; however, in the illustrated embodiment, cap <b>206</b> is a child-resistant cap. Child-resistant caps function to prevent a child or mentally challenged person to remove the cap and have access to the contents of the liquid dispenser. In the context of the present invention, a child-resistant cap is a cap in which it takes more than just a twisting action to remove the cap from the bottle. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, cap <b>206</b> is adapted to work in conjunction with thread <b>214</b> on neck portion <b>204</b> such that a user has to push down on cap <b>206</b> to rotatably remove cap <b>206</b>. Accordingly, a user pushes down on cap <b>206</b> and then rotates it so that it may be removed from neck portion <b>204</b>. Other suitable child-resistant caps are contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, cap <b>206</b> has a plurality of axial ridges <b>216</b> and a plurality of associated valleys <b>217</b> on an outside perimeter thereof. Cap <b>206</b>, however, may have other suitable outside surfaces, such as a knurled surface, a smooth surface, or other suitable surfaces. Cap <b>206</b> is formed from any suitable material, such as a polymer or other suitable material, and may have any suitable size and configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Dosage cup <b>208</b> is coupled to cap <b>206</b> such that a user has to exert a force on dosage cup <b>208</b> that is greater, by a predetermined amount, than the weight of dosage cup <b>208</b> to remove dosage cup <b>208</b> from cap <b>206</b>. Dosage cup <b>208</b>, in one embodiment, is formed from a polymer, such as polypropylene; however, dosage cup <b>208</b> may be formed from other suitable materials. In addition, dosage cup <b>208</b> may be transparent, translucent, or non-transparent. Dosage cup <b>208</b> may also have any suitable configuration. In one embodiment, the shape and configuration of the wall of dosage cup <b>208</b> is such that it conforms to the general shape of an upper portion of body <b>202</b> so that a smooth and attractive appearance may be achieved. Although not explicitly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a shrinkwrap may be coupled to an outside surface of liquid dispenser <b>200</b> for packaging, shipping, and displaying purposes. In addition, the shrinkwrap ensures that dosage cup <b>208</b> stays coupled to cap <b>206</b> during movement of liquid dispenser <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Dosage cup <b>208</b>, as described above, includes at least four axial shoulders <b>210</b> that facilitate the coupling of dosage cup <b>208</b> to cap <b>206</b>. The interaction of dosage cup <b>208</b> and cap <b>206</b> is described in detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. Also described above, dosage cup <b>208</b> also has one or more indicators <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> to indicate a single dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement inside body <b>202</b>. As described above, indicator <b>218</b> is a one fluid ounce indicator and indicator <b>220</b> is a one-half fluid ounce indicator. Other suitable indicators may be utilized and these indicators may have any suitable markings to insure that the correct dosage is obtained. One technical advantage of the present invention is that body <b>202</b> has an integral number of single dosages of the liquid nutritional supplement contained therein and dosage cup has an indicator <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> that indicates a single dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement within body <b>202</b>. To illustrate the technical advantage, if body <b>202</b> contains sixteen ounces of a liquid nutritional supplement and indicator <b>218</b> is a one fluid ounce indicator, then the user is ensured that, if they are required to take one dosage per day, the contents of body <b>202</b> will be finished in sixteen days because each day the user will be using dosage cup <b>208</b> and associated indicator <b>218</b> to take one fluid ounce of the liquid nutritional supplement inside body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a top portion of liquid dispenser <b>200</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of cap <b>206</b> and dosage cup <b>208</b> illustrating the interaction of body <b>202</b>, cap <b>206</b>, and dosage cup <b>208</b> in more detail. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, shoulders <b>210</b>, via engaging surfaces <b>211</b>, engage axial ridges <b>216</b> on cap <b>206</b> to couple dosage cup <b>208</b> to cap <b>206</b>. As described above, dosage cup <b>208</b> couples to cap <b>206</b> in such a manner that the user only has to exert a force on dosage cup <b>208</b> that is greater, by a predetermined amount, than the weight of dosage cup <b>208</b> to remove dosage cup <b>208</b> from cap <b>206</b>. This is facilitated by having engaging surfaces <b>211</b> of dosage cup <b>208</b> coincide with a circle having a diameter that is slightly less than the outside diameter of axial ridges <b>216</b> of cap <b>206</b>. In other words, the distance between diametrically opposed points on engaging surfaces <b>211</b> of axial shoulders <b>210</b> is slightly less than the diameter of the outside surfaces of axial ridges <b>216</b> when dosage cup <b>208</b> is coupled to cap <b>206</b>. This type of force fit allows a user to easily remove dosage cup <b>208</b> when a dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement inside body <b>202</b> is required to be consumed, while still providing enough grip on between engaging surfaces <b>211</b> and axial ridges <b>216</b> to keep it secure during storage and/or transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, an adequate grip is obtained by substantially matching a taper of engaging surfaces <b>211</b> with a taper of axial ridges <b>216</b>. Substantially matching the tapers allows more surface area of engaging surfaces <b>211</b> to contact axial ridges <b>216</b> to provide more frictional force. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, engaging surfaces <b>211</b> start proximate a base <b>303</b> of dosage cup <b>208</b> and taper toward the wall of dosage cup <b>208</b>. In one embodiment, the degree of taper (as denoted by alpha <b>305</b>) is one degree; however, other suitable tapers may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, dosage cup <b>208</b> has a length that extends all the way down to a top portion <b>300</b> of body <b>202</b>. Dosage cup <b>208</b>, however, may have other suitable lengths. In addition, the outside surface of dosage cup <b>208</b> generally conforms to an outside surface <b>302</b> of body <b>202</b> so that a shrink wrap may be applied to liquid dispenser <b>200</b>. In a particular embodiment, the outside surface of the wall of dosage cup <b>208</b> includes a taper to substantially match a taper of top portion <b>300</b> of body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">One technical advantage of the present invention is that dosage cup <b>208</b> is devoid of any projections on an inside surface thereof other than axial shoulders <b>210</b>. This makes it much easier for a user to keep dosage cup <b>208</b> clean and sterile, thereby reducing any deleterious effects of a dirty dosage cup <b>208</b> and combating the benefits of the liquid nutritional supplement contained therein. In addition, a dosage cup <b>208</b> having such little structure on an inside surface thereof makes it easier to manufacture in a more cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart demonstrating an example method of metering a liquid nutritional supplement in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>400</b>, a plurality of containers are provided, wherein each container contains a single dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement. At step <b>402</b>, the containers are coupled together in such a manner that all of the containers combined equal a required total dosage over a predetermined time period for a user. For example, there may be seven containers coupled together, one container for each day of the week. Any suitable containers may be utilized. Two such examples of containers utilized in the method outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by coupling a plurality of pouches <b>500</b> together, in which each pouch <b>500</b> contains a single dosage of a liquid nutritional supplement. As described above, this liquid nutritional supplement may be any suitable liquid nutritional supplement, such as a dietary supplement, a vitamin supplement, a joint care supplement, a calcium supplement, or a vitamin E supplement. Each pouch <b>500</b> has a body section <b>502</b> and a top portion <b>504</b> with a perforation <b>506</b> disposed therebetween. Body portion <b>502</b> contains the single dosage of the liquid nutritional supplement. The liquid nutritional supplement is accessed by a user tearing off top portion <b>504</b> via perforation <b>506</b>. A hole formed in top portion <b>504</b> may be used to store pouch <b>500</b> for easy access. Pouch <b>500</b> may be formed from any suitable material and may be formed in any suitable configuration. Although shown as being coupled along the sides of the pouches, pouches <b>500</b> may be coupled together in any suitable manner. Seven pouches are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which indicates one single dosage for each day of a week. The present invention, however, contemplates any number of pouches <b>500</b> being coupled together. For example, there may be fourteen pouches <b>500</b> coupled together for a two-week supply of single dosages or there may be thirty pouches <b>500</b> coupled together for a one month supply of single dosages. A chip board may be used to couple pouches <b>500</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another example of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by coupling a plurality of containers <b>600</b> having peel away lids <b>604</b> together, in which each container <b>600</b> contains a single dosage of a liquid nutritional supplement. The liquid nutritional supplement contained in containers <b>600</b> may be any suitable liquid nutritional supplement, such as those described above. The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; however, the type of container is different in that containers <b>600</b> resemble a “coffee creamer.” Each container <b>600</b> includes a body portion <b>602</b> having peel away lid <b>604</b> coupled thereto.
