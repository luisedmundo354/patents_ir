<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A processor mounted to a circuit board is provided with regulated voltage through lower-inductance circuit board traces by mounting a voltage regulator module for the processor, on the side of the circuit opposite to the processor. Current from the voltage regulator is provided to the processor by way of one or more conductors between the regulator and processor that extend through the circuit board from one side to the other. Inductance attributable to lead length is reduced by locating the voltage regulator close to its load. Circuit board space on the processor side of the circuit board is increased by moving the voltage regulator to the opposite side.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to delivering power to computer processors, and more particularly to apparatus and methods for delivering power to micro and other processors to the base, and preferably the center of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The computer industry has seen a remarkable advancement over the years. Every few years, semiconductor companies are developing faster and more powerful chips, or processors, for use in desktop and notebook computers, as well as work stations. These more powerful processors have to operate at reduced voltages and higher currents. The need for supplying power to these processors presents design problems, especially in view of the high power requirements for processors, which may run as high as from about 200 amps to about 700 amps. One solution is to provide power supplies and/or conductive paths on the base or motherboard to which the processor is mounted. This is undesirable because the higher processor currents require the incorporation of large and thick copper traces in order to minimize voltage drop. This increases the cost of the motherboard. The traces must also be designed so as to provide very low loop inductance in order to stabilize voltage level in a few clock cycles when the processor emerges from a “sleep” state and enters a “computing” state. The use of additional copper and the need for specific circuit board design serves to increase the cost and complexity of using the base board to supply power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A need therefore exists for a different way to provide power to these new processors which does not complicate the construction of the motherboard.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A general object of the present invention is to provide a means for improved power delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a power delivery system for a processor in which power is delivered to center area of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of the present invention is to provide a power delivery system for a processor in which the system includes a voltage regulator module (“VRM”) positioned beneath the motherboard, i.e., on the side of the motherboard that is opposite the processor, the VRM having means for conducting power directly to the center of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a VRM having a body portion with an opening for receiving the processor, the VRM housing a plurality of conductive traces to define a series of redundant power paths disposed around the processor perimeter, the VRM body portion including a first substrate and a second substrate spaced apart therefrom, the second substrate having a plurality of contacts that extend into the processor socket.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a processor power socket that includes a socket for attaching to the motherboard, a VRM with a first substrate for receiving a processor thereon, the first substrate having a plurality of power paths disposed therein for providing redundant power paths to the processor, the first substrate including a plurality of contacts, such as a pin, ball grid or land grid array, formed thereon so that the second substrate is not needed in the circuit path between the processor and the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A yet further object of the present invention is to provide a VRM that has an opening with a plurality of leads disposed thereon around the opening, the opening receiving a processor an the leads extending from the top of the VRM into the top of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a power delivery assembly for a processor for use with a motherboard which includes a socket for receiving a substrate therein, another substrate for receiving the processor and the substrate, and a VRM for attaching to the bottom of the motherboard, the VRM including a decoupling power socket having a plurality of conductive power lugs, or blades, that extend upwardly from the VRM through the motherboard, the socket and the two substrates to the center of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An additional object of the present invention is to provide a power delivery system as set forth above that utilizes only a single substrate to which the processor is mounted and which is received within the processor socket, the power contacts from the decoupling power socket extending through the motherboard, the socket and the first substrate to the center of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objects; features with advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical pinout arrangement <b>20</b> as is found in an array-type processor package. This package would typically include a socket surrounding the pin arrangement <b>20</b> and a plurality of conductive contacts <b>21</b>-<b>23</b> located therein. Each of these contacts has two opposing ends, with one set of ends, that visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and being the top ends that protrude into the socket for contact to opposing traces, leads, balls, etc. On the bottom of the chip package, the other set of end that extend out from the socket. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pinout locations include signal locations <b>21</b>, power locations <b>22</b> and ground, or power return, locations <b>23</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are a number of pins that are associated with the power aspect. The use of the present invention permits the elimination of a significant number of the power pins in such an array so that they may be freed for use with other signal aspects of the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a known power delivery system to a pin grid array (“PGA”) in which a voltage regulator module (“VRM”) <b>25</b> in mounted on a circuit board <b>26</b> and which is connected to one or more conductive traces <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>that are interconnected to the VRM and which typically will serve as “power out” and “power return” paths which are respectively indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the (+) and (−) designations. A socket <b>28</b> having a plurality of LGA contacts <b>29</b> may be mounted to the circuit board <b>26</b>. A processor <b>30</b> includes a semiconductor die <b>31</b> mounted to a package <b>32</b> and may include contacts such as BGA contacts <b>33</b> disposed thereon that serve to connect the package <b>32</b> to a substrate, shown as a circuit board <b>36</b> which in turn has a series of conductive pins <b>36</b> thereon, typically arranged in the pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In such a prior art system, the VRM <b>25</b> takes up valuable space on the circuit board <b>26</b> and the use of conductive traces <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>within the circuit board <b>256</b> can increase the cost of the overall system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded diagrammatic view of one general concept, or embodiment, of a power delivery system <b>100</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In this system, the semiconductor die <b>101</b> is mounted to a processor package <b>102</b> that in turn is mounted to a circuit board, or substrate, <b>103</b> which is received within a socket <b>104</b> that is mounted to a motherboard <b>105</b>. The VRM <b>106</b> is mounted beneath the motherboard <b>105</b> and uses one or more conductors <b>107</b> to convey power from the VRM to the processor <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> through the intervening sockets with circuit boards. In this manner, the VRM is removed from the area surrounding the circuit board to free up space on the upper surface of the board. The location of the VRM beneath the board shortens the current path to the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate two contact arrangements that may be used in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The arrangement includes traditional galvanic, i.e., “copper” contacts <b>110</b> for signal transmission and preferably two galvanic power contacts <b>111</b> i.e., power out and return that are separated by an intervening insulator <b>112</b>. This arrangement will typically extend through the motherboard <b>105</b>, socket <b>104</b> and substrate <b>103</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an arrangement that uses capacitively coupled contacts <b>114</b> that do not rely upon metal-to-metal contact, but which rely upon capacitance between the processor contacts <b>109</b> and conductive lands or pads (not shown) that are disposed on the underside of the substrate <b>103</b> on the motherboard <b>105</b>. A more detailed description of this type of capacitive coupling arrangement may be found in applicant's copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/548,940, filed Apr. 13, 2001 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,972, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The use of two single and relatively large power contacts advantageously reduces the number of power and ground pins required on the processor base, thereby freeing more space for use as signal pins, and increasing the density of the processor's signal applications.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be noted that the systems of the present invention provide desirable low inductance power paths to the processor rather than the high inductance paths of the prior art as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that utilize the substrate. With the use of one or two power controls, or legs such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, the number of power pins may be reduced from the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that more signal pins may be utilized on the processor and in the socket.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates another embodiment of a power delivery system <b>140</b> of the invention. A processor socket <b>141</b> is mounted to the motherboard <b>142</b> and in designed to receive a processor package therein. The processor <b>143</b> is mounted to a first substrate <b>144</b> that has suitable conductive contacts associated therewith, such as a BGA <b>145</b>. This assembly of the processor and first substrate is received within a recess, or opening, <b>146</b> of a VRM <b>147</b>. The VRM <b>147</b> has a series of leads <b>148</b> that may be contacted to a second, pinned substrate <b>149</b>. The leads <b>148</b> are connected to traces <b>150</b> disposed in or on the second substrate <b>149</b> which lead to a center lead, or leads <b>151</b> that extend up through the first substrate <b>144</b> into contact with the processor <b>143</b>. These leads <b>151</b> may be galvanic or capacitive leads. Power is supplied to the processor <b>143</b> by these leads <b>151</b> from the VRM <b>147</b>, thereby increasing the number of pins <b>154</b> on the substrate <b>149</b> that may be used as signal pins for mating with the socket <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a power delivery system <b>160</b> of the invention. This system differs from the system <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in that the leads <b>151</b> of the VRM <b>147</b> mate with leads in the first substrate. In other words the first substrate <b>144</b> and the VRM (<b>147</b>) cooperate to provide power rather than the VRM and first and second substrates of the system <b>140</b>. In both systems, the leads are provided in a redundant manner and their paths are preferably distributed around the processor <b>143</b>. In this system <b>160</b>, the second substrate <b>149</b> and the BGA (<b>145</b>) are removed from the power transmission path. The VRM and the substrates may be interfittingly formed together as a power “socket”.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a power delivery system <b>170</b> where the VRM <b>147</b> is provided with leads <b>171</b> that extend from it to the processor <b>143</b>, and preferably along the top surface thereof, as illustrated. In this type of system, the two substrates <b>144</b>, <b>149</b> and the BGA <b>145</b> are removed from the power delivery path.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another power delivery system <b>180</b> in which the VRM <b>147</b> is mounted beneath the motherboard <b>142</b>. The VRM may include a power decoupling socket <b>181</b> of the types that are disclosed in applicant's copending patent application Ser. No. 10/255,376 filed Sep. 26, 2002, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this system, the power leads <b>151</b> take the form of large lugs <b>182</b> which may, as illustrated in the insert view <b>143</b><i>a</i>, be formed as part of the processor package itself with the lugs <b>182</b> and surrounding pins depending downwardly therefrom which are received in respective openings in the motherboard {grave over ( )}<b>42</b> and the socket <b>141</b>. Although the socket <b>141</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is depicted as a PGA, it may include an LGA or other style of socket. The processor package may, as shown at <b>143</b><i>a</i>, include two substrates <b>144</b> and <b>149</b>, or it may include as shown in insert view <b>143</b><i>b</i>, only a single substrate <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates another power delivery system <b>190</b> in which the VRM is remotely located away from the socket <b>141</b> and preferably on the motherboard <b>142</b>. The power decoupling socket <b>181</b> is located beneath the motherboard and may receive its power from a lead, or cable <b>192</b>, that leads to the VRM. The processor <b>143</b> may have the power lugs <b>182</b> formed with it as shown in <b>143</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This illustrates a dual power supply configuration where power is supplied to the processor from both the top and the bottom of the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another arrangement <b>200</b> for use with power delivery systems of the invention. In this arrangement, an LGA packaged processor <b>202</b> may be packaged in an LGA substrate <b>204</b> with LGA pads formed on its bottom surface and a select number of power pins <b>205</b> formed thereon. A second intervening substrate <b>206</b> with conductive lands <b>208</b> may have a general opening <b>209</b> formed in its center that accommodates the passage of the power pins <b>205</b> therethrough. A series of posts <b>210</b> maybe provided that extend through the second substrate <b>206</b> via openings <b>211</b> therein and may be used to clamp the entire assembly together. These posts <b>210</b> fit through openings <b>211</b> and extend up from a LGA backing board <b>215</b>. These posts <b>210</b> may be used to clamp the LGA package into the assembly as well as conduct current from a VRM (not shown). The LGA backing plate may have a sandwich-style construction with interleaved layers of conductive material (copper) and dielectric material with a series of center contacts <b>216</b> illustrated as conductive posts with center holes <b>217</b> that receive and engage the power pins <b>205</b>. These center posts <b>216</b> are in turn connected to power out and return sources.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment of the invention in the form of a power delivery system assembly <b>300</b> that provides a regulated voltage to a integrated circuit package at reduced inductance along the power supply traces between a voltage regulator (“VRM”) and an installed integrated circuit, or processor that is mounted to a motherboard. The power delivery system assembly <b>300</b> illustrated includes an integrated circuit connector of die <b>302</b>; a substrate <b>308</b>; and, a VRM <b>310</b>. Electrical contacts on the bottom of the substrate <b>308</b> allow circuitry mounted on the substrate <b>308</b> (e.g., an integrated circuit within the connector <b>302</b> and the VRM) to be electrically connected to other circuitry (not shown) on a circuit board <b>320</b> to which the assembly <b>300</b> can be mounted. The VRM is shown mounted above the processor and it conveys power to the processor by way of contacts <b>330</b> that extend from the VRM to conductive traces on the substrate <b>308</b>, which traces lead to the bottom of the processor connector <b>302</b> to define a first path for power transmission, P<b>1</b> that is shown in bold in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the first integrated circuit connector, or die <b>302</b>, has a base, or lower face <b>304</b>, that is adjacent to or which “faces” an upper or “first” side <b>306</b> of the underlying substrate <b>308</b>. The substrate <b>308</b> is preferably made of an electrically non-conductive material such as, but not limited to, glass or phenolic resin, ceramic, et al. As is well-known in the art, the substrate <b>308</b> can include one or more conductive traces, i.e., metallic strips or bands, which are attached to a surface of the substrate <b>308</b> or which run along the interior of the substrate <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Inasmuch as integrated circuits may be fabricated with their power connections located on the package bottom, the integrated circuit connector <b>302</b> includes at least one electrical contact <b>312</b> that is electrically coupled to an electrical conductor <b>314</b> that extends through the substrate <b>308</b> to its lower face or surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the contacts are shown in touching or intimate contact. It will be understood, however, that such contact may be effected by capacitive coupling as is shown and described in the aforementioned application Ser. No. 09/548,940 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,972. A second electrical contact <b>316</b> on the integrated circuit connector <b>308</b> is electrically coupled to a second electrical conductor <b>318</b> through the substrate <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electrical conductors <b>314</b> and <b>318</b> may also extend through the substrate <b>308</b> from the top surface to the bottom surface thereof so that they can be electrically connected to complementary conductors on a circuit board <b>320</b> via a second connector <b>322</b> that is sized and configured to accept electrical contacts that are on the second or lower face of the substrate <b>308</b> but which are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Such a second connector <b>322</b> preferably takes the form of a processor socket that is mounted to the motherboard <b>320</b> and connected to various circuits thereon. In a preferred embodiment, the first connector <b>302</b> includes at least one filter capacitor (not shown) that may be embedded with the connector as described in the aforementioned copending patent application Ser. No. 10/255,376, and is electrically connected across the conductors <b>314</b> and <b>318</b>, by way of conductive traces or the like, so as to provide smoothing of the voltage variations that occur when an integrated circuit within the connector transitions between a low-power operation mode (e.g., a “sleep” or “stand-by” state) to an active or high-power consumption mode state. Such a filter capacitor can be readily molded into or mounted into the connector <b>302</b> to provide additional power supply filtering where it is most effective, i.e., near to the load represented by an integrated circuit, such as a processor, in the socket <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A second connector <b>322</b> mounted on the circuit board <b>320</b> can also include at least one internal capacitor <b>324</b>, the function of which is to provide power supply filtering for the voltage regulator module <b>310</b> that is mounted to the first or upper face of the substrate. The internal capacitor <b>324</b> provides filtering by virtue of its connection across the electrical traces or conductors that extend from the voltage regulator module <b>310</b> to the conductors <b>312</b> and <b>316</b> that extend through the substrate <b>308</b>. Alternatively, the capacitor <b>324</b> may be located on the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The capacitor located within the connector <b>302</b> and which is electrically connected across the output terminals of the voltage regulator module <b>310</b> and other capacitors across the power supply leads from a voltage regulator module provide enhanced power supply filtering and power storage. As is well-known in the electrical arts, increased filter capacitance provides more stable output voltages. Two capacitors will usually enable the provision of increased capacitance over that of a single capacitor to thereby provide enhanced filtering of power supply current and with minimal distributed inductance by being electrically close to the voltage regulator module as well as providing a parallel current path that has lower inductance, whereby the power supply voltage to an integrated circuit such as a processor, when mounted in the connector <b>302</b> will be provided with a more well-regulated supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the substrate <b>308</b> can be mechanically and electrically mounted to a connector <b>322</b> that is attached to a circuit board <b>320</b>. The connector <b>322</b> includes electrical signal paths that includes electrical contacts (not shown) on its upper surface that receive and mate with corresponding contacts on the lower or bottom surface of the substrate <b>308</b>. The electrical contacts on the connector <b>322</b> and the substrate <b>308</b> enable circuitry mounted on the substrate <b>308</b>, such as an integrated circuit, or chip in the connector <b>302</b>, to be electrically connected to other circuitry (not shown) on the circuit board <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The circuit board <b>320</b> includes at least two conductors, shown as power lugs or plated through-hole via <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>. The power lugs/vias <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> extend completely through the circuit board <b>320</b> from the upper surface <b>321</b> to the lower surface <b>323</b> thereof where another filter capacitor <b>344</b> may be coupled across the power lugs/vias <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>. These power lugs may be connected to the chip connector contacts <b>312</b>, <b>316</b> or to the conductors <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> in the substrate, as well as connect directly to the chip through the connector <b>302</b>. The invention contemplates the use of at least one capacitor <b>324</b> or both capacitors <b>344</b> to assist in the provision of power to the processor. Where one capacitor is used, it is preferred to use it in the location of capacitor <b>324</b>, close to the bottom of the processor in order to provide a low inductance power path. However, when two such capacitors <b>324</b>, <b>344</b>, are used, they are connected together in parallel as illustrated so as to take advantage of the reduced inductance that comes from a parallel connection.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">By using the structure depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a voltage regulator module <b>310</b> can be physically positioned close to an electronic device that requires regulated power, thereby minimizing distributed inductance associated with longer circuit board traces. In addition to providing regulated power and reduced inductance, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides increased capacitance and therefore greater filtering of the output voltage from the VRM, further improving the stability of the voltage output from the VRM. The VRM providers power to the filtering and storage capacitors and charges them so that they may be discharged, or drawn upon by the processor, during certain operations of the processor, such as start up and others. The connection of the capacitors <b>324</b>, <b>244</b> provides a second power path P<b>2</b> along which power may be transmitted to the processor, and this second power path is arranged in parallel to the first power path P<b>1</b> so that they provide a low inductance source of power. They also cooperate with the VRM to significantly reduce the lag time the processor incurs when drawing power.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a preferred embodiment, the contacts to the integrated circuit are through the underside or base of the device. Accordingly, the connector <b>302</b> includes electrical contacts that provide such power to the underside or base-located power terminals of an integrated circuit. Also, in the preferred embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit thereof. The present examples and embodiments, therefore, are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein.</p>
