<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods are disclosed herein to provide radio frequency identification (RFID) communication techniques for RFID devices. For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a RFID communication system includes a transmission system that provides a radio frequency signal to an RFID device and a detector circuit that detects a response to the radio frequency signal from the RFID device. A controller determines whether the RFID device is operational based on whether the response was detected by the detector circuit. The RFID communication system may be implemented within a handheld device, a manufacturing test system, or any device requiring RFID communication functionality, such as a printer or an applicator for RFID devices.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to radio frequency identification (RFID) applications and, more particularly, to techniques for communicating with RFID devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The use of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (e.g., RFID tags, RFID labels, RFID chips, RFID straps, or RFID inlays) is growing rapidly, with RFID devices utilized in a wide variety of applications. However, one challenge associated with RFID devices is the manufacture and testing of the RFID devices in a high-volume and/or cost-effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the RFID devices may be manufactured or otherwise closely positioned on a roll or sheet of material (e.g., a carrier web or roll format). A conventional method of testing RFID devices during the manufacturing process involves bi-directional communication with each of the RFID devices at one or more defined frequencies and radio frequency power levels. However, the bi-directional communication technique of activating and reading the complete response from the RFID device is time consuming and requires a specialized RFID reader that is expensive and may not be optimized for rapid testing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, because the RFID reader is expensive, the number of RFID readers is typically limited and utilized sparingly to serially test the RFID devices, with each of the RFID devices sequentially positioned into test position or the RFID reader sequentially moved from one RFID device to the next in a designated test area. Thus, the testing process may be limited in terms of the number of RFID devices that can be tested in a cost effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, any device that incorporates an RFID reader, such as for example a printer that prints on RFID labels, may have a significant increase in price due to the cost of the RFID reader. Consequently, conventional RFID communication techniques may be limited in terms of cost and/or in the number of RFID devices that can be tested. As a result, there is a need for improved communication techniques for RFID devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems and methods are disclosed herein to provide radio frequency identification (RFID) communication techniques for RFID devices. For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a communication system is disclosed that can communicate with an RFID device and program and/or determine if it is defective based upon whether the RFID device responds when expected. As an example, by not receiving and decoding the complete response, the time required to communicate with the RFID device is decreased, which may reduce test time and test equipment costs and allow cost-effective programming and/or testing (e.g., high-speed parallel testing) of a large number of RFID devices. Furthermore, the RFID communication techniques disclosed herein allow the manufacture of RFID communication devices, which may be formed as discrete devices (e.g., a portable, handheld device) or incorporated into devices (e.g., a printer for RFID labels) to provide cost-effective RFID communication functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a RFID communication system includes a transmission system for providing a radio frequency signal to an RFID device; a detector circuit, coupled to the transmission system, adapted to detect a response to the radio frequency signal from the RFID device; and a controller, coupled to the detector circuit, adapted to determine whether the RFID device is operational based on whether the response was detected by the detector circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a RFID communication system includes means for providing a radio frequency signal to at least one RFID device; means for detecting if the at least one RFID device responds to the radio frequency signal; and means for determining if the at least one RFID device is operational and/or programmed based on whether the at least one RFID device responds.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method of performing RFID device communication includes providing a radio frequency signal to at least one RFID device; detecting if the at least one RFID device begins to respond to the radio frequency signal; and determining if the at least one RFID device is operational and/or programmed based upon whether the at least one RFID device begins to respond to the radio frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The scope of the invention is defined by the claims, which are incorporated into this section by reference. A more complete understanding of embodiments of the present invention will be afforded to those skilled in the art, as well as a realization of additional advantages thereof, by a consideration of the following detailed description of one or more embodiments.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating a radio frequency identification (RFID) communication system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RFID communication system <b>100</b> includes a radio frequency (RF) transmitter <b>102</b>, a signal path <b>104</b>, an RF detector <b>106</b>, and a coupler <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">RF transmitter <b>102</b> represents any type of RF transmitter, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, which can provide an RF signal to an RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., an RFID tag, an RFID label, an RFID chip, an RFID strap, or an RFID inlay). RF transmitter <b>102</b> may include an RF source, which can be modulated to provide a command to RFID device <b>110</b>, and an RF switch.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The RF signal from RF transmitter <b>102</b> may be provided to RFID device <b>110</b>, for example, via signal path <b>104</b> and coupler <b>108</b> (e.g., two proximity coupler plates separately referenced as couplers <b>108</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>108</b>(<b>2</b>)). As an example, signal path <b>104</b> may represent two differential signal paths to provide coupler <b>108</b> (e.g., a proximity coupler) with the RF signal (e.g., a differential RF voltage drive of 0 and 180 degrees onto a proximity coupler).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Coupler <b>108</b> communicates with RFID device <b>110</b>, for example, via short-range coupling (e.g., near field coupling techniques) as would be understood by one skilled in the art. Consequently, only RFID device <b>110</b> responds to the RF signal, while any other RFID devices in close proximity to RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., such as other RFID devices on the roll) do not respond to the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, RFID device <b>110</b> may include an element <b>112</b>, which, depending upon the type of the RFID device, may represent an antenna or a strap/interposer or other conducting portion of RFID device <b>110</b>. Thus, coupler <b>108</b> may communicate with RFID device <b>110</b> via short-range coupling through element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Coupler <b>108</b> may communicate, for example, to RFID device <b>110</b> through a gap in a metal shield through which the short-range coupling occurs, with the metal shield preventing the other RFID devices near RFID device <b>110</b> from receiving the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>110</b>. Strips of metal to “short” the electric field, dielectric materials to de-tune or change the frequency, and high-permeability materials to interact magnetically and de-tune or change the frequency may also be employed, as would be understood by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various conventional short-range coupling techniques are known and may be utilized to provide the RF signal from RF transmitter <b>102</b> to RFID device <b>110</b>, as would be known by one skilled in the art. Additionally, communication between RF transmitter <b>102</b> and RFID device <b>110</b> via coupler <b>108</b> may be implemented as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/367,515, filed Feb. 13, 2003, and entitled “RFID Device Tester and Method” and/or as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/882,947, filed Jul. 1, 2004, and entitled “RFID Device Preparation System and Method,” which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an RFID communication system <b>200</b> for providing near field coupling is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RFID communication system <b>200</b> includes RF transmitter <b>102</b>, RF detector <b>106</b>, RFID device <b>110</b>, and a coupler <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Coupler <b>202</b> may represent one or more pairs of couplers (e.g., coupler <b>108</b> or a number of couplers <b>108</b>) to couple via an electric field with RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., capacitively couple to element <b>112</b> of RFID device <b>110</b>). Alternatively, or in addition, coupler <b>202</b> may represent a coil (e.g., single-turn coil or multi-turn coil) to couple via a magnetic field with RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., inductively couple to element <b>112</b> of RFID device <b>110</b>). Thus, coupler <b>202</b> may couple to RFID device <b>110</b> via an electric field, a magnetic field, or some combination of electric and magnetic fields (electromagnetic field), with coupler <b>202</b> providing the appropriate structure (e.g., parallel plates, single or multi-turn coils, transmission lines, or other types of structures). Furthermore, the signal frequency provided to RFID device <b>110</b> may be at a frequency different from the natural resonant frequency of RFID device <b>110</b>, as discussed further in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/367,515 and 10/882,947.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternatively, coupler <b>108</b> may provide short-range coupling by making a direct connection with one or more conducting contact points of RFID device <b>110</b>, as would be understood by one skilled in the art. For example, coupler <b>108</b> may make a direct connection with the antenna, the strap/interposer (e.g., conducting leads of the RFID device), or chip pads of RFID device <b>110</b>, depending upon the type of RFID device being utilized. Thus, coupler <b>108</b> may provide short-range coupling in the near field via electric and/or magnetic fields or by direct connection with RFID device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RFID communication system <b>100</b> may also include a controller <b>114</b>, which may represent for example a processor-based system such as a computer system or other type of decision-making circuit such as a logic block, a programmable logic device, or an application specific integrated circuit. Controller <b>114</b> receives the results from RF detector <b>106</b> regarding each RFID device (e.g., RFID device <b>110</b>) that is being tested or is otherwise being communicated with via coupler <b>108</b>. Controller <b>114</b> may also control RF transmitter <b>102</b> to control the operation of RFID test system <b>100</b> and generate commands for RFID device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">RFID communication system <b>100</b> may also include a controller <b>122</b> that communicates with controller <b>114</b> (e.g., via a wireless or a wired interface). Controller <b>122</b> may represent an external device (e.g., a processor-based system or other controller-type device or decision-making circuit) that provides information to controller <b>114</b> and/or controls certain functions of RFID communication system <b>100</b>. It should be understood that controller <b>114</b> and controller <b>122</b> may be combined and implemented within or external to RFID communication system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, controller <b>114</b> and controller <b>122</b> may be implemented in hardware and/or in software to provide the controller functions for communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">RF detector <b>106</b> monitors signal path <b>104</b> and detects when RFID device <b>110</b> provides a response to the RF signal received from RF transmitter <b>102</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RF transmitter <b>102</b> provides a modulated RF signal (e.g., a command signal) to RFID device <b>110</b>, which prompts RFID device <b>110</b> to provide a response that is detected by RF detector <b>106</b>. As discussed in further detail herein, RF detector <b>106</b> does not have to be implemented to receive and decode the complete response from RFID device <b>110</b>, but rather simply detect that RFID device <b>110</b> responded to the RF signal from RF transmitter <b>102</b>. If RFID device <b>110</b> responds or does not respond, then RFID device <b>110</b> passes the test or does not pass the test, respectively (e.g., response corresponds to satisfactory operation while no response corresponds to unsatisfactory operation).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In general, depending upon the type of RFID device being tested, RFID device <b>110</b> responds when sufficient energy is available to be rectified by RFID device <b>110</b> to serve as its power supply (e.g., a passive RFID device, although the techniques discussed herein are also applicable to active RFID devices) and an appropriate command is provided to RFID device <b>110</b>. RFID device <b>110</b> responds, for example, by changing its input impedance using a data sequence, which in the far field results in a backscatter-modulated signal to be radiated while in the near field results in a change in the load presented to the source providing the RF signal to RFID device <b>110</b>. The source (e.g., RF transmitter <b>102</b> or a driver circuit which may be included within an RF transmitter), depending upon its characteristics, may experience a change in the output voltage level or a change in the current drawn from it due to the changing load.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, RFID device <b>110</b> may be tested by applying an appropriately modulated RF signal, which results in a response if RFID device <b>110</b> is operational (e.g., a “good” RFID device). By simply detecting that RFID device <b>110</b> has responded, rather than reading the entire response (i.e., determining the data provided by RFID device <b>110</b>) of RFID device <b>110</b>, RF detector <b>106</b> may be implemented in a simple and inexpensive manner as compared to conventional test techniques utilizing expensive RFID readers (e.g., with complex receiver circuitry). Consequently, RFID device communication (e.g., testing) may be implemented as disclosed herein in a more cost effective manner and possibly in a faster and higher-volume manufacturing level.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, RF detector <b>106</b> detects the disturbance of the voltage level due to RFID device <b>110</b> responding (e.g., a digital ‘good’/‘bad’ RFID device test). Thus, if RF detector <b>106</b> detects a response (e.g., a change in the digital state) from RFID device <b>110</b>, then RFID device <b>110</b> is considered operational and passes the test. If RF detector <b>106</b> does not detect a response from RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., no change in the digital state during the period a response should occur, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), then RFID device <b>110</b> is considered defective and fails the test (e.g., failed to respond under the defined test conditions).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As an example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary waveform <b>116</b> represents the RF signal (e.g., modulated with a command) provided by RF transmitter <b>102</b> to RFID device <b>110</b> and detected by RF detector <b>106</b>. An exemplary waveform <b>118</b> represents the RF signal (e.g., a continuous RF signal level) provided by RF transmitter <b>102</b> to RFID device <b>110</b>, during which RFID device <b>110</b> is expected to respond (e.g., as commanded). An exemplary waveform <b>120</b> represents the response provided by RFID device <b>110</b> and detected by RF detector <b>106</b>, with the response indicating RFID device <b>110</b> is operational (e.g., response from RFID device <b>110</b> during period defined by waveform <b>118</b> and provided via coupler <b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If RFID device <b>110</b> is not operational, then waveform <b>120</b> would be similar to waveform <b>118</b> (e.g., no response from RFID device <b>110</b>). Furthermore, as explained herein, RF detector <b>106</b> does not have to retrieve the data in waveform <b>120</b> from RFID device <b>110</b>, but rather simply detect a response (e.g., one or more voltage fluctuations) during the expected time period to determine that RFID device <b>110</b> is operational and responding to commands.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">RF detector <b>106</b>, for example, may be implemented as any type of conventional RF detector (e.g., a diode-based detector or an integrated circuit RF detector), as would be understood by one skilled in the art. In general, RF detector <b>106</b> provides a baseband voltage, which represents the amplitude of the RF signal rectified and integrated over time to remove voltage changes at the RF frequency and recover voltage changes due to the baseband signal modulation. The baseband voltage, for example, may be provided to a voltage comparator circuit, which will provide a digital signal (e.g., representing changes in the baseband signal).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an exemplary implementation, referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a block diagram of an RF detector circuit <b>300</b> is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RF detector circuit <b>300</b> includes RF detector <b>106</b>, a capacitor <b>302</b> (AC coupling capacitor), a capacitor <b>304</b> (bypass capacitor), and a voltage comparator <b>306</b>. RF detector <b>106</b>, for example, may be a diode-based detector or an integrated circuit RF detector, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, to convert the RF frequency (e.g., from RF transmitter <b>102</b> or RFID device <b>110</b>) into a filtered voltage to recover the baseband modulation. The filtered voltage may be received by voltage comparator <b>306</b> to provide a digital signal representative of the baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, when RFID device <b>110</b> modulates its impedance, the signal level on coupler <b>108</b> will change, which is detected by RF detector <b>106</b> and provided to voltage comparator <b>306</b> via capacitor <b>302</b>. Voltage comparator <b>306</b> converts a small AC voltage (e.g., a few mV) into a logic level signal at its output to indicate that a changing RF signal is detected by RF detector <b>106</b>. Voltage comparator <b>306</b> may have its input terminals biased to the same voltage level (e.g., Vref) and may have a certain level of hysteresis to prevent the output from changing due to noise.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus, when the RF signal level is constant or changing slowly, the digital output from voltage comparator <b>306</b> will remain in a constant state. However, the digital output from voltage comparator <b>306</b> will change states, for example, to track the baseband modulation provided to RFID device <b>110</b> or provided by RFID device <b>110</b> (e.g., in response to a command).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RFID communication system <b>100</b> illustrates an approach for RFID device communication, for example, that provides parallel testing of a large number of RFID devices simultaneously at a relatively low cost and at a high efficiency. Consequently, utilizing the techniques disclosed herein may prevent the RFID device testing from becoming a limiting factor in terms of production speed or manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating an RFID communication system <b>400</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RFID communication system <b>400</b> illustrates the techniques for testing a number of RFID devices <b>110</b>, which are separately referenced as RFID devices <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>110</b>(<i>n</i>), where “n” may represent any number of separate test stations for testing RFID devices <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">RFID communication system <b>400</b> may utilize one or more of the techniques disclosed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> to provide a number of the parallel test stations. For example, RFID communication system <b>400</b> includes RF transmitter <b>102</b>, which provides the RF signal to RFID devices <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>110</b>(<i>n</i>) via corresponding signal paths <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>104</b>(<i>n</i>) and couplers <b>108</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>108</b>(<i>n</i>). By examining the test results provided by RF detectors <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>106</b>(<i>n</i>) (e.g., output signals labeled A, B, C, . . . , through n), it can be determined whether corresponding RFID devices <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>110</b>(<i>n</i>) pass or fail their tests. Thus, RFID communication system <b>400</b> may be implemented to test a large number of RFID devices simultaneously, which would allow a test system to meet the demands of high-speed manufacturing requirements (e.g., high-speed RFID inlay production technology).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As manufacturing speeds increase, additional time may be needed to deliver a sufficient amount of energy to the RFID devices (e.g., to energize or activate) before commencing communication. This can be achieved, for example in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, by energizing the RFID devices prior to reaching the test positions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating an RFID communication system <b>500</b>, which illustrates techniques that may be applied to RFID communication systems <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>), in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RFID communication system <b>500</b> includes a transmission line <b>502</b> (e.g., a pair of transmission lines) that is driven with a differential, continuous RF signal to energize the RFID devices near (e.g., traveling along) transmission line <b>502</b> prior to being tested.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As an example, RFID device <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) is shown receiving energy from transmission line <b>502</b> prior to being tested, while RFID device <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) is shown being tested and communicating via coupler <b>108</b> (as discussed herein, for example, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). RFID device <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) received energy from transmission line <b>502</b> prior to reaching the test position over coupler <b>108</b>, and therefore, may require less time prior to communicating with coupler <b>108</b> or less time within range of coupler <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In general, the communication techniques and protocols (e.g., commands, frequencies, power levels, and/or modulation scheme) depends upon the type of RFID device and/or the protocol that the RFID device is designed to accommodate. Furthermore, the techniques disclosed herein may be applied to short-range communication or long-range communication. In general, an antenna of the RFID device may be viewed as having a near field region and a far field region. The near field region refers to a reactive near field (e.g., approximately R≦λ/2π) and a radiating near field (e.g., approximately R&lt;2D<sup>2</sup>/λ), while the far field region refers to a radiating far-field component (e.g., approximately R&gt;2D<sup>2</sup>/λ), where R is the distance from the antenna and D is the largest dimension of the antenna. Thus, short-range communication may generally involve the reactive near field, radiating near field, radiating far field, and/or a direct electrical connection, while long-range communication may generally involve the radiating far field.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">One factor that may also influence the type of communication (e.g., testing) performed is the regulatory environment in the country (e.g., communication data rate, bandwidth, or power levels permitted for radio frequencies). For example, North America may permit RFID reader to RFID device data rates of approximately 140.35 kbps, while Europe may permit RFID reader to RFID device data rates of approximately 30 kbps for radiating systems. However, these limitations may not apply if near-field coupler techniques are utilized, for example, because the radiated energy may fall below the levels at which the regulatory rules are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As an example of an exemplary application (e.g., in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), an RFID device test may be performed to verify general operation (e.g., an expected response to a command), which may include a write test to verify receipt and operation of various components of the RFID device (e.g., memory). As a specific implementation example, based on the electronic product code (EPC) Class 1 data specification and employing the XRA00 RFID chip from STMicroelectronics, a SCROLLALLID command sent to the RFID chip (e.g., represented by RFID device <b>110</b>) will result in the RFID chip responding with its entire identification (ID) code (e.g., an 8-bit preamble, a 16-bit cyclic redundancy checksum, and a 96-bit ID).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As noted above, to determine that the RFID chip is operational (depending upon the test objectives), it may not be necessary to receive the entire response from the RFID chip. For example, to determine whether the RFID chip is operational (e.g., the RFID chip is good or bad), the test may be completed and the RFID chip moved beyond the range of the test station (e.g., beyond the range of coupler <b>108</b>) after one or more bits have been received (e.g., one or more bits of the preamble detected). Thus, the test may be completed faster relative to conventional test techniques by determining whether the RFID chip is operational before the complete response has been received from the RFID chip.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A write test may also be performed, for example, on the RFID chip to determine whether various circuits are operational, such as the memory. By utilizing the techniques disclosed herein, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, the write test may be performed quickly for one or more of the RFID chips in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, as a specific implementation example (e.g., in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>4</b>), the RFID chips may be programmed (by couplers <b>108</b> or prior to arriving at the test station of couplers <b>108</b>) by providing an ERASEID command to erase the entire memory array of the RFID chips (e.g., setting all bits to zero). The RFID chips may then be provided with a PROGRAMED command to program (e.g., simultaneously) the RFID chips with a defined ID (e.g., 96 bits all equal to one). The PROGRAMED, for example, may be provided to controller <b>114</b> from controller <b>122</b> or generated by controller <b>114</b>. A SCROLLID command may then be sent with its masking selective ID set to the defined ID (e.g., to all ones) so that only the RFID chips that have successfully been programmed with the defined ID will respond (e.g., by modulating the RF carrier as discussed above). As disclosed herein, the entire response does not need to be detected, only that the RFID chip responds or starts to respond as expected. Therefore, the write test can be performed quickly and in a parallel fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As another example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the RFID chips may be programmed utilizing transmission line <b>502</b> and/or a far field RFID programmer (e.g., RFID reader/writer) to provide a rapid technique for programming a valid identification into a large number of un-initialized RFID devices (e.g., RFID devices <b>110</b>). This may provide certain advantages as RFID commands and processes may be more time efficient for RFID devices that have a valid identification rather than no identification or an invalid identification.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, parallel programming techniques to program a large number of RFID devices <b>110</b> simultaneously may provide a more time-efficient process as typical programming times for individual RFID devices may range, for example, from 0.1 to 1 second. The parallel programming, for example, may be performed with individual couplers (e.g., coupler <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>), which may also verify the programming by confirming a response to the programmed identification, or with transmission lines (e.g., transmission line <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). For example, one transmission line may program a large number of the RFID devices (e.g., seventy or more simultaneously) and subsequent couplers may test the RFID devices to verify a response to the programmed identification (e.g., 10 ms or less verification check).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RFID communication system <b>100</b> may be implemented within a communication system (e.g., a manufacturing test environment), incorporated within a device requiring RFID communication functionality (e.g., a printer printing on RFID labels and programming and/or testing the RFID devices), or as a discrete device (e.g., a portable, handheld RFID communication device). As an example, referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a portable RFID communication system <b>700</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. RFID communication system <b>700</b> represents an exemplary implementation of a portable, handheld device for providing RFID communication, which may include programming and/or testing the RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">RFID communication system <b>700</b> provides a compact housing, for example, for RFID communication system <b>100</b>. A user would hold RFID communication system <b>700</b> by a handle <b>706</b> (e.g., containing a rechargeable battery <b>708</b>) and employ a switch <b>702</b> when desired to communicate with an RFID device via coupler <b>108</b> (e.g., switch <b>702</b> controls transmission of the RF signal). A display <b>704</b> with user selectable functions may be provided as an interface for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As another example, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a low cost module may be provided as a discrete RFID communication device (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or for incorporation into printers, applicators, and any other type of device requiring RFID communication functionality (e.g., test and/or programming capability). The module may be provided at a lower cost as compared to conventional RFID readers to test and/or program RFID devices, because the receiver circuitry within the module is simplified to merely determine that the RFID device is responding to a command (rather than retrieving the data provided in the response as performed with conventional RFID readers). Thus, the module (e.g., RFID reader module) may be viewed as interacting with the RFID devices rather than reading them and, thus, may be referred to as a Tag Interaction Device (TID) or Tag Checker (TC), with tag referring generally to any type of RFID device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The module may utilize the techniques disclosed herein, for example, to detect via a coupler the RFID device's response to a command. If a desired application (e.g., a printer or an applicator) does not require the retrieval of the data provided by the RFID device in its response, but merely verify that the RFID device responded (e.g., indication of proper operation), the module may be utilized to provide this RFID communication functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, a printer for RFID devices may program an RFID device with an EPC code during the printing process (e.g., prior to printing on the RFID label). Typically, the RFID device is first erased and then a new EPC code (e.g., a 96-bit EPC) is programmed into the RFID device. In general, these commands do not require that the information be read back from the RFID device. Rather, to verify that the correct EPC code has been programmed into the RFID device, the module (i.e., TID) simply commands the RFID device with the matching EPC code it just programmed to respond back (e.g., and detect that the RFID device responded at an expected time). If the RFID device responds, then the RFID device must have been programmed successfully and, if the RFID device does not respond, then this implies that the RFID device was not programmed successfully (e.g., the RFID device is defective).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As a specific implementation example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a microcontroller with a UHF transmitter may be utilized to provide the basic functionality of RFID communication system <b>100</b>. For example, Microchip Technology Inc. provides a microcontroller (e.g., rfPIC12F675H) having flash memory, internal RAM, a UHF ASK/FSK transmitter (AM modulated 850 MHz to 930 MHz PLL transmitter), A/D converter, and an analog comparator. The microcontroller may be mounted to coupler <b>108</b>, for example, to provide a compact package for incorporation into a handheld device (e.g., as discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or within a printer or other device requiring RFID functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The microcontroller may detect the response of an RFID device (e.g., RFID device <b>110</b>) by detecting the load modulation caused by the RFID device via RF detector <b>106</b> coupled to the microcontroller. Alternatively, rather than utilize RF detector <b>106</b>, the current drawn by (or voltage of) the RF amplifier within the microcontroller that drives coupler <b>108</b> may be monitored (e.g., by the A/D converter or analog comparator within the microcontroller) to detect the load modulation caused by the RFID device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a flowchart <b>600</b> providing exemplary operations for an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In general, flowchart <b>600</b> provides general operations that may be performed by an RFID communication system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. One or more of the general operations may be optional or performed in a different order, depending upon the test objectives or desired application.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the RFID device may be read (block <b>602</b>) if information is desired from the RFID device, such as its identification when preprogrammed. For example, an RFID reader may be employed to read the identification code of a preprogrammed RFID device or controller <b>122</b> (e.g., a host communication system) may provide the identification code of the RFID device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The RFID device may be provided with energy (e.g., to power up) and programmed with a different identification and/or commanded to respond (block <b>604</b>). The RFID device is monitored (block <b>606</b>) after receiving the programming or command, for example, to detect the start or some portion of a response from the RFID device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In general, systems and methods are disclosed herein to provide RFID communication techniques. For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an RFID device may be tested by providing a defined level of energy and a command, with the RFID device's response detected. It is not necessary to receive the complete reply of the RFID device, but simply that the RFID device has responded.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This technique allows considerable simplification of test systems, which may reduce costs and reduce the time required for testing. For example, rather than requiring an RFID reader to communicate with every RFID device in a test position, either sequentially by scanning a reader through many tags or in parallel by using multiple readers, a common data command may be provided to a large number of RFID devices simultaneously. A simple circuit may then detect the fact that the RFID device has either responded or not (e.g., not receive the entire reply data), which determines whether the RFID device is judged to be good or bad.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, the technique may be applied to programming tests. For example, a common program command may be issued to a number of the RFID devices (e.g., inserting the same ID into their memory). A command is then provided to the RFID devices with the same ID to respond. Because only the RFID devices that have been successfully written to respond, a simultaneous write test has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The techniques disclosed herein may be applied to a wide range of applications, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For example, the techniques may be employed to provide a discrete device, such as a handheld RFID communication device, or may be implemented within a manufacturing test system or a device requiring RFID functionality (e.g., a printer or an applicator).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Embodiments described above illustrate but do not limit the invention. It should also be understood that numerous modifications and variations are possible in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is defined only by the following claims.</p>
