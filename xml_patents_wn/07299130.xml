<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the present invention relate to unmanned vehicles. In particular, aspects of the invention provide unmanned vehicles that autonomously track vehicles and/or other unmanned vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to protect both material and human assets, it is important to be cognizant of potential hostile activity that may endanger the assets. There are numerous scenarios that may encounter hostile activity, including troop movement and ship maneuvers. Effective surveillance provides information (e.g., images) of potential hostile activity near the protected assets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surveillance may be provided by an aircraft or by a satellite that executes a single pass over a large region and is typically restricted in the time of surveillance coverage. Subsequent observations may be limited to the next pass by a satellite or aircraft. The area of interest (e.g., corresponding to troop movement) may be a small subset of the region of surveillance and may consequently require arduous analysis of all of the collected data. Moreover, the corresponding position of the protected assets is typically dynamic, in which movements are often irregular in direction and speed. Thus, effective surveillance requires to be equally dynamic and to be synchronized with the movements of the protected assets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is an important need to protect assets by providing surveillance that tracks the protected assets over the entire time of interest. Moreover, a method and apparatus providing the surveillance should minimize danger to any personnel supporting the surveillance activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention includes methods and apparatuses for providing surveillance of a convoy, which comprises at least one ground vehicle. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operates as a satellite vehicle and obtains images around the convoy's position to provide information about potential hostile activity. The unmanned aerial vehicle maintains a generally curvilinear, at least in part, or looping path around the convoy as instructed by one of the convoy vehicles. Path planner algorithm software is executed by the controlling convoy vehicle, in which position and velocity information regarding the unmanned aerial vehicle and the convoy are processed to determine values of control variables. The determined values are sent to the unmanned aerial vehicle over a wireless communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With another aspect of the invention, a controller determines a new roll angle and a new altitude from position information of a surveillance vehicle and a convoy in order to maintain the surveillance vehicle in a desired path. The controller sends roll angle commands and altitude commands to the surveillance vehicle in order to maintain the desired path.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With another aspect of the invention, a surveillance vehicle, which is following a path with respect to a convoy, and a convoy vehicle send position and velocity information to a control center (central controller), which has a fixed ground position. The central controller sends instructions to the surveillance vehicle so that the surveillance vehicle maintains its path with respect to the convoy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With another aspect of the invention, the path of the surveillance vehicle is changed in order to provide evasive measures to avoid an attack on the surveillance vehicle by an adversary. Different types of paths may be utilized. For example, the surveillance vehicle may typically follow a circular path around the convoy but may revert to a zig-zag path if the controller determines that there may be a potential attack on the surveillance vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With another aspect of the invention, a convoy may comprise at least one ground vehicle or at least one ship or other water vehicle. One or more aerial vehicles may serve as a surveillance vehicle for the at least one ground vehicle or the at least one water vehicle. Also, another ship or a submarine may function as the surveillance vehicle for protecting the at least one water vehicle.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">System Overview</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <b>10</b> flying in front of a vehicle <b>12</b>. Vehicle <b>12</b> may monitor the position of UAV <b>10</b> and communicate with the flight control system of UAV <b>10</b> to cause UAV <b>10</b> to constantly remain in front of vehicle <b>12</b> and provide overhead surveillance. The embodiment may also cause UAV <b>10</b> to maintain a path around vehicle <b>12</b> so that images may be obtained in front of, behind, and on the flanks of vehicle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, UAV <b>10</b> includes a global positioning system (GPS) receiver and transmits current coordinates to vehicle <b>12</b>. Vehicle <b>12</b> may also include a GPS receiver and may use information received from both GPS receivers to calculate the trajectory of UAV <b>10</b>. This information may then be used to calculate one or more way points to keep UAV <b>10</b> on a desired path. As described herein, a convoy may comprise at least one vehicle, e.g., vehicle <b>12</b>. One or more of the vehicles in the convoy may control UAV <b>10</b>. Vehicle <b>12</b> may transmit those way points to the flight control system of UAV <b>10</b>. This allows UAV <b>10</b> to autonomously follow vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one implementation, UAV <b>10</b> remains at a constant velocity regardless of the velocity of vehicle <b>12</b>. If UAV <b>10</b> is traveling faster than vehicle <b>12</b>, then UAV <b>10</b> would fly in a pre-described pattern such that the total linear distance covered by UAV <b>10</b> is equal to the distance covered by vehicle <b>12</b>. If vehicle <b>12</b> stops, then UAV <b>10</b> would travel, at least in part, in an orbit pattern, such as a generally circular or elliptical pattern or other closed-loop pattern. In another implementation, the direction that vehicle <b>12</b> points based on its last calculated trajectory is used to steer UAV <b>10</b> to fly its orbit over a certain location. UAV <b>10</b> may also be programmed to change flight speeds to match the speed of vehicle <b>12</b> and/or to fly other types of routines such as a spiral formation or a zig-zag formation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">UAV <b>10</b> may include a camera for recording images and may transmit those images to vehicle <b>12</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that UAV <b>10</b> may include one or more of a variety of sensors and or sensor modules. Exemplary sensors include infrared cameras, radar devices, acoustic sensors, heat sensors and other conventional sensors used by military planes and aerial vehicles. In one particular implementation, UAV <b>10</b> is equipped with one or more smoke grenades or markers that may be released to identify potential ambush sites or other sites of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">UAV <b>10</b> may be constructed of a modular design to facilitate changing modules such as motor modules, sensor modules and computer modules.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">UAV <b>10</b> may also include a variety of different munitions, such as air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, bombs and rockets. Communications equipment, radar jammers, etc. may also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that a UAV <b>20</b> may be used to provide overhead surveillance for a boat <b>22</b>. UAVs may be used to provide overhead surveillance to nonmilitary boats and vehicles. For example, a UAV may fly 10-20 miles in front of an oil tanker and provide situational awareness to the oil tanker's crew.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other embodiments include using UAVs to provide support for ATVs, motorcycles, full size supply convoys, Bradley fighting vehicles and other armored vehicles and tanks. The disclosed UAVs may used to support police department and fire department activities. The disclosed UAVs may also be used to support manned helicopters and airplanes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one alternative embodiment of the invention, UAVs may use vision based navigation. For example, a UAV may include a thermal camera and be programmed to track an infrared strobe attached to a vehicle or a thermal image. This embodiment allows a UAV to autonomously follow a moving target based on vision. Of course, following may include flying in a predetermined formation as described herein. Moreover, other embodiments may use electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths other than those corresponding to infrared radiation, such as radio waves. Vision based navigation embodiments may be used to allow a UAV to land on a moving vehicle, such as a car or boat by setting the following distance to zero. Similarly, vision based embodiments may be used to guide a UAV to a fuel source, such as a tanker aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">UAVs may also be programmed to recognize specific targets with automatic target recognition software and automatically follow those targets to either track or to provide persistent situational awareness for that moving target. An example of a moving target could be a company commander leading troops through enemy territory wherein without direct communication to and from the commander the vehicle would automatically follow him and his troop and provide situational awareness when appropriate. Targets may be recognized based on how they look to optical sensors, infrared sensors or any other sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other embodiments of the invention, two or more UAVs (which may form a convoy) may form client and server nodes of a network. In these embodiments, one or more UAVs may be configured to autonomously follow a primary UAV using a loop pattern in two or three dimensions around the primary UAV. That is, the tracking UAV may loop around the primary UAV, as well as loop over and under and/or in front and in back of the primary UAV. Alternatively, the two or more UAVs may be configured to both track a vehicle simultaneously but at spaced distances from one another. For example, with two UAVs, the UAVs may both travel on similar closed-loop paths about the tracked vehicle but may travel at different elevations and/or spaced apart from one another, such as about 180° apart on a generally curvilinear path.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <b>303</b> tracking convoy <b>301</b> in an approximately circular path <b>321</b> about convoy <b>301</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. Generally, UAV <b>303</b> travels about convoy <b>301</b> in a loop pattern that is curvilinear at least in part and is completed over time as the convoy <b>301</b> travels, such that UAV <b>303</b> travels in essentially a complete 360° path around convoy <b>301</b>. The UAV may travel at one or more elevations relative to the convoy <b>301</b>. It will be understood that, depending on the tracking configuration, the speed at which convoy <b>301</b> travels and the path that convoy <b>301</b> proceeds along, the actual configuration of the loop pattern that UAV <b>303</b> travels will vary. For example, if convoy <b>301</b> travels along a straight path at a constant speed, with a circular tracking configuration, the path of UAV <b>303</b> will generally resemble a spiral pattern as the UAV <b>303</b> travels back and around the forwardly-moving convoy <b>301</b>. Over time, UAV <b>303</b> will travel essentially 360° at one or more elevations about convoy <b>301</b> and return to its original relative starting position with respect to convoy <b>301</b> so that it will have completed a curvilinear or closed-loop pattern about convoy <b>301</b>. Other embodiments of the invention may utilize other curvilinear closed-loop paths. Consequently, UAV <b>303</b> obtains images of a 360° area in various elevations around convoy <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While UAV <b>303</b> may be an aerial vehicle, other embodiments of the invention support surveillance vehicles (manned or unmanned) that travel on the surface of the water, under the surface of the water, on the ground, or in outer space. Also, embodiments of the invention support convoy <b>301</b> that travels on the surface of the water, under the surface of the water, on the ground, or in outer space.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows UAV <b>353</b> tracking convoy <b>351</b> in a non-circular path <b>371</b> (e.g., an elliptical path) according to an embodiment of the invention. The embodiment also supports path <b>351</b> that may be a circular path having different path parameters, e.g., a desired radial distance from convoy <b>351</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A path planning algorithm may determine to change the path of UAV <b>353</b> from circular path <b>321</b> to path <b>371</b> if a velocity ratio (V<sub>UAV</sub>/V<sub>convoy</sub>) exceeds a predetermined amount if evasive measures are necessary. If evasive measures are necessary, UAV <b>353</b> may follow different types of paths, including a zig-zag path within a determined region or some other path that may appear to be random to an adversary.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows apparatus <b>400</b> for controlling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <b>401</b> with moving ground station <b>403</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. Apparatus <b>400</b> comprises UAV <b>401</b> and moving ground station <b>403</b>, which may correspond to a car/truck (e.g., vehicle <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). UAV provides measurements, e.g., location and velocity information over telemetry communications channel <b>411</b>. Moving ground station provides path commands (that may be determined by a path planner algorithm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) to UAV <b>401</b> over wireless communications channel <b>413</b>. In the embodiment, moving ground station <b>403</b> receives location and velocity information from UAV <b>401</b> and determines its own location and velocity information. In the embodiment, moving ground station <b>403</b> determines its location and velocity using information received from a GPS receiver. This information <b>415</b> is passed to path planner algorithm software <b>407</b> through telemetry interface <b>409</b>. As will be discussed with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, path planner algorithm software <b>407</b> determines values for control variables <b>417</b> that instruct UAV <b>401</b> to travel on a desired path (e.g., a circular path around moving ground station <b>403</b>). Telemetry interface <b>409</b> inserts command information into radio messages that are sent to UAV <b>401</b> over wireless communications channel <b>413</b>. UAV <b>401</b> processes received radio messages to extract values of control variables and passes the extracted values to autopilot hardware and software <b>405</b> to instruct the propulsion system to travel on the desired path.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows apparatus <b>500</b> for controlling two vehicles <b>501</b> and <b>503</b> from controlling entity (central controller or control center) <b>505</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. In an example of the embodiment, vehicle <b>501</b> corresponds to a surveillance vehicle (e.g., UAV <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), vehicle <b>503</b> corresponds to a convoy vehicle (e.g. vehicle <b>12</b>), and control center <b>505</b> has a fixed position. Control center <b>505</b> communicates with vehicle <b>501</b> and vehicle <b>503</b> over communications channels <b>511</b> and <b>513</b>, respectively. Control center <b>505</b> receives position and velocity information from both vehicles <b>501</b> and <b>503</b> through communication interface <b>509</b>, which passes the information <b>515</b> to path planner algorithm software <b>507</b> that implements the flow diagram as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Path planner algorithm software <b>507</b> determines values of control variables <b>517</b>, which are sent to vehicle <b>501</b> and/or vehicle <b>503</b> so that vehicle <b>501</b> maintains a desired path with respect to vehicle <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows apparatus for a controller <b>600</b> (e.g., moving ground station <b>403</b> or control center <b>505</b>) according to an embodiment of the invention. Controller <b>600</b> comprises processor <b>601</b>, communications interface <b>603</b>, and GPS receiver <b>605</b>. Embodiments of the invention may utilize an inertial navigational system (e.g., a gyroscopic navigational system) to determine position and velocity information. Processor <b>601</b> receives position and velocity information from a surveillance vehicle (not shown) through communications interface <b>603</b> over wireless communications channel <b>609</b>. The embodiment supports a variety of wireless communications channels including light, microwave, infrared, and sonar communication channels. In addition, controller <b>600</b> obtains position and velocity information from a convoy vehicle for a configuration corresponding to apparatus <b>500</b> or obtains its own position and velocity information for a configuration corresponding to apparatus <b>400</b>. For a configuration in which controller <b>600</b> determines its own position and velocity information, controller <b>600</b> typically obtains GPS information from GPS receiver <b>605</b> over radio channel <b>607</b>. Processor <b>601</b> implements a path planner algorithm to determine values for control variables. The values for the control variables are sent to the controlled vehicles through communications interface <b>603</b> over wireless communications channel <b>609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic diagram of an apparatus of unmanned aerial vehicle <b>700</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. UAV <b>700</b> includes propulsion system <b>707</b> and guidance system <b>705</b> which powers and guides UAV <b>700</b> in its desired path, respectively. UAV <b>700</b> receives instructions through data communications interface <b>713</b> over wireless communication channel <b>717</b> from a controller (e.g., controller <b>600</b>) that contains values for control variables. Processor <b>701</b> extracts and processes the instructed values from the received instructions. Processed values are presented to guidance system <b>705</b> so that UAV <b>700</b> follows the desired path.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">UAV <b>700</b> determines position and velocity information about itself from GPS information received by GPS receiver <b>711</b> over radio channel <b>715</b> and from data acquired by data acquisition module <b>703</b>. The embodiment also supports methods that determine position and velocity of UAV <b>700</b>, e.g. triangulation techniques, that are known in the art. UAV <b>700</b> sends the position and velocity information to the controller through data transmission interface <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">UAV <b>700</b> collects surveillance images through camera <b>709</b> and transmits the images to a convoy vehicle through data transmission interface <b>713</b> over wireless communication channel <b>717</b>. UAV <b>700</b> may include auxiliary munitions module <b>721</b> that is equipped with one or more smoke grenades that may be released to identify potential ambush sites, with air-to-air missiles, and the like. Also, UAV <b>700</b> may include auxiliary communication module <b>719</b> to provide jamming of an adversary's communications channel or to provide an auxiliary wireless channel to supplement data transmission interface <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the invention may implement the path planner algorithm at the controller. The controller may be located at different locations for different configurations. For example, the controller may correspond to vehicle <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), ship <b>22</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), moving ground station <b>403</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), or control center <b>505</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another embodiment of the invention may implement the path planner algorithm software in the UAV rather than in the controller. In such cases, the UAV receives position and velocity information about the convoy and path parameters about the desired path. The UAV internally determines values for the control variables rather than receiving the values from the controller.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Computer Hardware and Software</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one implementation, the UAVs disclosed herein use the CloudCap autonomous flight control platform. A Software Developer Kit (SDK) enables third-party applications to interface with the Piccolo software for purposes of flight control, data acquisition, and payload data transmission. The system interfaces a UAV control system to the platform via this SDK, providing integration of the high-level adaptive behavior control system with a low-level autonomous control system and communication link.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Path Planning Algorithm</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A path planning algorithm allows a UAV (e.g., an airplane) to remain at a relatively fixed distance in front of the convoy vehicle (e.g., a car or a boat) or around the convoy vehicle when the velocity of the UAV, v<sub>UAV</sub>, is faster than the velocity of the boat, v<sub>CONVOY</sub>. The following description relates to an algorithm for identifying a path of an unmanned aerial vehicle in relation to a ground vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) travels a curvilinear path 360° around a convoy, which comprises at least one ground vehicle or at least one water vehicle. A camera that is mounted on the UAV points at the convoy. A nominal distance between the UAV and the convoy is user controllable. Also, the algorithm is cognizant of aircraft operational considerations that must not be exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an example of the embodiment, the UAV is constrained to an airspeed between 30 knots and 55 knots, a vertical speed of less than 500 ft/min, a roll angle of less than 28 degrees, a mounted camera pointing at “9 o'clock” and 25 degrees below horizon (left wing), and a camera field of view of 46 degrees horizontal with a 4:3 (NTSC) frame shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a relationship between convoy position and aircraft position according to an embodiment of the invention. Vector <b>805</b> represents the aircraft position P (or velocity V), vector <b>801</b> represents the convoy position P<sub>c </sub>(or convoy velocity V<sub>c</sub>), and vector <b>803</b> represents the relative position P<sub>r </sub>(or relative velocity V<sub>r</sub>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, vectors <b>801</b>, <b>803</b>, and <b>805</b> are represented in East, West coordinates at a relative true altitude.</p>

Camera <b>903</b> is mounted on left wing <b>905</b> at cam angle (camera angle) <b>909</b>. By way of example, the nominal camera angle is approximately 25 degrees. The roll angle is represented as roll angle (Φ) <b>907</b>.</p>

Vector (V<sub>rad</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>err</sub>) <b>1005</b> represents the error in the radial velocity.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>1111</b>, values of control variables (altitude and roll angle commands) are provided to the guidance system (e.g., guidance system <b>705</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) so that the surveillance vehicle follows a desired curvilinear (at least in part), closed-loop path with respect to the convoy vehicle. If the surveillance vehicle is not initially traveling on the desired path, the vehicle's path will converge to the desired path as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An embodiment of the invention includes the path controller algorithm as well as the software tool that has been developed for an easy development of this kind of controllers for the Piccolo systems.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Due to the time-consuming process of flight-testing, a simulation environment of the airplane and the ground vehicle is desirable for the development of path controllers. An embodiment provides an aircraft simulation environment, which incorporates a portion of the flying hardware. To complete the simulation environment, a ground vehicle model, the car model, is developed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The controller development platform (CDP) is a software kit that assists with the development and testing of UAV mission feasibilities. The path controller software developed by this kit ultimately resides on a computer that is connected to the ground station. Since the airplane can be simulated by the simulator, only a ground vehicle simulator needs to be constructed in the CDP.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The CDP may provide all the necessary information for path generation, from the aircraft data to the ground station data. This information may take on the form of packets of structures. The CDP has already written the “de-multiplexer” portion of the software that deciphers and stores the serial data from the ground station. These data is extracted and fed into the path-planning algorithm that computes and returns future navigation points. The future navigation points are then packed into a package and then sent to the ground station. The packaging and the serial communication functions may be provided by the CDP.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram of a simulation architecture. The bottom layer, Cloud Cap Communication SDK <b>1217</b> is a library that provides communication primitives between the controller and the ground station through serial port. The library comes with a packet dispatcher. Inside this module a routine is nested that forwards the packet received from the ground station to the correct modules.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The packets are passed to two modules: real car status module <b>1211</b> and airplane status module <b>1213</b>. Modules <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> keep track of the status of these vehicles by extracting the data from the packet forwarded to them by packet dispatcher <b>1215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Car model module <b>1209</b> maintains the status of a simulated car. The information is the same as those that are kept by real car status module <b>1211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">MUX module <b>1207</b> simple decide which set of data to fetch to the open loop controller <b>1203</b>. In the testing phase the data is taken from car model module <b>1209</b>; in the real ground test the data is taken from real car module <b>1211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">EECF/LLA conversion module <b>1205</b> supports the conversion between the data format used by the ACR system (GPS Longitude Latitude Altitude format) into a format more suitable for the development of the controller (Earth Centered Earth Fix).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The interaction between the user and the application is managed through a GUI module <b>1201</b> that displays a subset of the information fetched to controller <b>1203</b>. The user can monitor the performances of controller <b>1203</b> observing the displayed trajectory of the airplane and the car and reading the list of the waypoint that are sent. The user commands MUX <b>1207</b> and sets the Car Model parameters through GUI <b>1201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Path controller module <b>1203</b> is implemented by the developer. The necessary data is extracted from the packets from MUX module <b>1207</b>, which has been converted into the appropriate format by ECEF/LLA Conversion module <b>1205</b>. The data provided for this module includes: airplane position, altitude, and airspeed (true air speed as well as from the GPS receiver). After computing future waypoints, path controller module <b>1203</b> returns a list of waypoints that are in the LLA format used by the Piccolo. The future waypoints come in packages of three, which is chosen guard against communication packet loss. The packaging of waypoints is done by routines provided by the Cloud Cap Communication SDK library, which also sends the routes to the ground station. The ground station ultimately forwards these packets to the airplane.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Third, if the ratio of the velocities (σ) of the plane and the car is greater than some threshold (in an embodiment equal to 3), the function circle_path( ) is called to allow the plane to fly in circles above the car, and otherwise, a non-circular path is generated by desired_path( ). This eliminates the need for the plane to fly in extraneously large amplitudes of sinusoidal path when the car is moving slowly.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Fourth, in the function desired_path( ), the plane's future paths are generated with the consideration of communication speed and car's current position. The current implementation does not consider the real plane's position and assumes that the plane is following the path correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, The plane's desired path <b>1653</b> initially starts in front of the car <b>1651</b> by a predefined value, AHEAD_CAR. This can be done by adding the offset, AHEAD_CAR, to the car's position in x-direction in LOCA coordinate system.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Vectors delta_x_p <b>1601</b>B, <b>1601</b>C and delta_y_p <b>1603</b>B, <b>1603</b>C are calculated every second, then they are transformed to ECEF coordinates which then they will be added to the previous position of the plane as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B and 16C</figref>. Because all the calculations are done in LOCA coordinates before transforming it to ECEF coordinates, this allows the path to turn its direction as the car turns. And the delta in z-direction is set to zero to maintain the height of the plane from its initial condition. Then these X, Y, and Z points will be sent to the main function in a structure format named path_generator_output, which then it will be sent to the Piccolo box.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Finally, as the plane comes back and crosses the car's track again (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref>) it initializes the plane's new desired points to be in front of the car by AHEAD_CAR. This is required since when the car makes turns, it displaces the plane's location in x-direction (in LOCA) that needs to be compensated by this process.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Hardware in the Loop Simulation Setup</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A simulation setup may be used to test the feasibility of the path-planning algorithm. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation environment may be used. During the simulation, the ground station, the ground station computer, and the airborne avionics (the Piccolo box) are all incorporated into the process. However, unlike during actual flight, the Piccolo box sends its commands into a controller area network (CAN) bus instead of the servos that would maneuver the UAV. The CAN bus translates the avionics' control information into serial communication and feeds the signals into the USB port of a computer that is running aircraft simulation software. The simulation software runs a model of an aircraft by taking in the control inputs from the CAN bus. The model describes the aircraft by a set of parameters that is gathered empirically. The simulation program calculates the responses of the aircraft, such as GPS position, airspeed, and acceleration, and returns them back to the Piccolo box. This data is then returned via the wireless link back to the ground station, which is available for use or for recording purposes. This simulation process most directly tests the feasibility of the entire system by incorporating factors such as the wireless and serial communications as well as the path-planning algorithm all at once.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The simulator has visualization capability that provides a more intuitive feel of the behavior of the aircraft. The simulation sends out UDP packets, which contains the position and the Euler angles of the aircraft, to a designated visualization computer. These packets are then process by software such as FlightGear or Microsoft Flight Simulator for viewing. Due to the high demand of processor power for visualization, a computer independent from the simulator computer is used. A diagram of the simulation setup is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Car Model Simulation Implementation</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Trajectories are identified in real-time so that, when followed by a UAV, the UAV will stay in the vicinity of a designated ground vehicle. A ground station is mounted onto the designated ground vehicle. However, for simulation purposes, a car model is devised to feed into the path-planner program pseudo information of the ground vehicle. The car model is built by keeping track of the position as well as the velocity vector of the simulated car. The model resides in a software loop that is run once per second. The position of the car is updated by Equation 9 and 10:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_Latitude(<i>T+</i>1)=Car_Latitude(<i>T</i>)+Car_north_speed<sub>—</sub><i>LL</i>*delta<i>T</i>  (Equation 9)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_Longitude(<i>T+</i>1)=Car_Longitude(<i>T</i>)+Car_east_speed<sub>—</sub><i>LL</i>*delta<i>T</i>  (Equation 10)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where the position of the car model is reported in degrees of latitude and longitude. Since the algorithm is run once every second, an update of the car model's position occurs at 1 Hz, and so the deltaT variable in Equations 9 and 10 is set to one.
</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The car model's velocity vector has a size as well as a directional component, and they are modified by the clicks of buttons on the path-planner's graphic user interface (GUI). The equation for changing the velocity magnitude and direction information is reproduced in Equations 11 and 12 respectively below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_Heading(new)=Car_Heading(current)±delta_Car_Heading  (Equation 11)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_Speed(new)=Car_Speed(current)±delta_Car_Speed  (Equation 12),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where the Car_Heading variable has the units of radians and the Car_Speed variable has the units of meters per second. Each time a button is clicked on the GUI, the variables are manipulated by a certain preset amount, which is specified by constants delta_Car_Heading and delta_Car_Speed. The delta_Car_Heading was set to be seven point five degrees; and so every time the user clicks on the “right-turn” or “left-turn” button on the GUI, the Car_Heading variable increases or decreases by 7.5 degrees respectively. As for the speed information, each click of the “accelerate” or “decelerate” button would increase or decrease the Car_Speed variable by an amount of delta_Car_Speed. The delta_Car_Speed variable is chosen to be two miles per hour, which translates to roughly 0.477 meters per second. Since the heading and speed information is changed every time a button click has occurred, one can think of the changes as having units of “7.5 degrees per click” and “0.477 [m/s] per click” for the heading and the speed respectively.
</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Translating from Car_Heading and Car_Speed information to Car_north_speed_LL and Car_east_speed_LL is a two-step procedure. First, the north and the east components of the velocity vectors are extracted from the Car_Heading and Car_Speed information. Then, each of the components is translated from meters per second into degrees per second. Notice the “LL” attached to the tail of the velocity components in Equations 11 and 12, which means “in latitude and longitude.” The first step is accomplished by Equations 13 and 14 below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_north_speed=Car_Speed*COS(Car_Heading)  (equation 13)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_east_speed=Car_Speed*SIN(Car_Heading)  (equation 14)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Since the velocity components are still in the units of meters per second, the second step is to translate them into degrees per second. This step is achieved by first dividing each of the velocity components by the radius of the earth, and then multiplying each by 180/π to attain the units of degrees. This procedure is performed per Equations 15 and 16 below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_north_speed<sub>—</sub><i>LL</i>=(Car_north_speed/<i>rLat</i>)*180/π  (Equation 15)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Car_east_speed<sub>—</sub><i>LL</i>=(Car_north_speed/<i>rLon</i>)*180/π  (Equation 16)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">There are two different radii because the car model travels in a different circle when traveling in a north-south direction than in an east-west direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates these points.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The initial position of the car model takes on the latitude and longitude values of the simulated aircraft at the moment that the simulator is started. By knowing the latitude of the aircraft, the r<sub>Lat </sub>and r<sub>Lon </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> may be found using known parameters of the earth and trigonometry. The earth datum is defined per the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Once the radii are found, the angular velocity of the north and east components may be found. By multiplying the angular velocities by the deltaT in Equations 9 and 10, the angular contribution, the α and the β of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, may be found, which is used in Equations 9 and 10 to update the change in the simulated car's position.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In order to switch between the simulation and the real-world scenarios, a pre-compiler flag arrangement is used. Depending on how this flag is set, the compiled executable sends either the actual or the simulated car data to the path generation algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a simulation of the path planner algorithm software as shown in the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. While the simulated UAV does not initially have a circular path, the simulated UAV does converge to a circular path having a desired radial distance. The simulation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> demonstrates the robustness of the path determination algorithm to the effects of wind. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the simulated wind is from the direction of 90 degrees at 6.00 m/sec, and the airspeed of the simulated UAV is 23.15 m/sec.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a heavy fuels engine that propels an unmanned aerial vehicle according to an embodiment of the invention. Just behind the propeller is the ignition timing ring that contains a magnet that triggers the ignition to fire at the proper time in the operational cycle. The twisted wire on the right side of the front of the engine (as viewed from the back of the engine) is the wire going from the Hall Effect sensor that triggers the ignition system. The ignition system itself is outside the frame of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The ignition system high-voltage lead can be seen in the upper right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. (It is the thick wire going to the top of the engine and terminates in a spark plug cap (partially seen).) The electric pre-heater and aluminum intake manifold are immediately behind the high-voltage lead. The electric pre-heater is an off-the-shelf Bosch glow plug designed for use in automotive diesel engines. The exhaust system and muffler exit from the right side of the cylinder head (as viewed from the back of the engine). The small tube is a pressure line to the fuel tank that pressurizes the fuel system. The carburetor itself is partially visible just above the tape in the rear of the engine. The long, thin protrusion from the carburetor is part of the air-fuel high-speed mixture adjustment needle. The heavy fuels engine may incorporate an electric preheater and spark ignition. The preheater may be in a different location (e.g., the air intake vs. the cylinder itself).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, the fuel for the engine maybe a mixture of JP-5 or JP-8 and lubricant in an 8:1 ratio (11% lubricant). The specific gravity is about 0.805. Lubricants include Yamalube 2-R and Honda GN-2 two-cycle engine lubricants. Too low a percentage of lubricant, or type, may negatively impact durability by increasing piston/cylinder and/or bearing wear. Conversely, too high a level may decrease maximum power, as well as potentially increasing combustion chamber deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The engine may be considered a multifuel engine, running equally well on glow fuel, model diesel fuel, heavy fuels, and presumably also gasoline and automotive diesel fuels. The engine has the ability with its adjustable compression ratio to allow it to run on any of the fuels by modifying the compression ratio through the compression adjustment screw.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As alternatives to using ether as a starting aid, compression ratios can be increased and/or the fuel heated. As an example, suitable starting was provided by a combustion chamber volume of 0.20 cc and glow plug ignition.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, a modified head that incorporates an automotive diesel engine glow plug (Bosch P/N 80010) for combustion chamber pre-heating and a spark plug for ignition was provided. Use of a diesel glow plug in the combustion chamber provides a large source of heat in the presence of the compressed fuel-air mixture to directly vaporize the fuel, allowing it to be more easily ignited by the spark. The glow plug may heat the entire head to a temperature sufficient to vaporize the fuel and more easily ignite the fuel by the spark.</p>

<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">

<p id="p-0112" num="0114">Preferably, the engine is a small, spark-ignition heavy fuels engine. The operational characteristics with heavy fuels are currently better than compression ignition engines. Throttle transitions are smoother and the exhaust is visibly much cleaner. Compared to compression ignition engines the lower compression of spark-ignition systems also makes them a more attractive candidate for on-board starter/generators since engine weights are lighter than comparable compression ignition engines. Heavy fuels conversions of existing engines are easily accomplished with spark ignition. With compression ignition conversions, new heads with higher compression ratios must be designed and fabricated, along with strengthening the crankcases. A range of existing spark ignition engines requiring minimal modifications can be converted to heavy fuels. Additionally, with spark ignition compression ratios can be maintained at or near base engine levels, resulting in much lower mechanical loads on the engine, yielding greater engine reliability and life.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">Preferably, the engine includes ceramic engine components. High-wear components may benefit from the hardness and durability of ceramics with heavy fuels that have no added lubricants.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Auxiliary starting aids, such as electric preheating or ether, may be used with carbureted or port fuel injected heavy fuels engines, but may not be needed with direct cylinder fuel injection. The higher injection pressures of direct injection atomize the fuel so finely that additional starting aids may not be required. While electric pre-heating of the engine is effective, it may require several minutes or more to heat the engine to a point of starting. It also may increase the engine weight as well as requiring a battery of a size that makes it impractical as part of an airborne restart system. Starting aids such as propane, butane, ether, or alcohol are small and lightweight. There is no pre-heating required and they are able to start engines within 1 to 10 seconds depending on engine type and ambient conditions. Additionally, due to their light weight they can be incorporated into on-board starting systems for in-flight restarts.</p>
