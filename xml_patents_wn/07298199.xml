<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a substrate bias voltage generating circuit for use in a semiconductor memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A semiconductor memory device typically includes a substrate bias voltage generating circuit for generating a substrate bias voltage. The substrate bias voltage is applied to a P-well/substrate surrounding MOS transistors of the semiconductor memory device to obtain some of the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the substrate bias voltage is applied to a P-well/substrate to increase a threshold voltage of a parasitic MOS transistor. In addition, the substrate bias voltage is applied to a P-well/substrate to reduce the need for increasing the concentration of channel stop implants below a field oxide. This has been shown to improve junction breakdown and reduce leakage current. Further, the substrate bias voltage is applied to a P-well/substrate to reduce increases in a threshold voltage or a body effect of MOS transistors, thus reducing a junction capacitance at an end of a field oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the substrate bias voltage is applied to a P-well/substrate in a memory cell of a semiconductor memory device, leakage current of a storage node N+ layer connected to a cell capacitor is reduced, thereby increasing data retention time of the memory cell. In addition, since the data retention time is closely related to DRAM refresh time, the applied substrate bias voltage also affects the DRAM refresh time. Further, since the property of a cell transistor having the shortest channel in a chip embodying the semiconductor memory device is improved, a threshold voltage of the cell transistor can be suppressed. This has also been shown to reduce a boosted width of a word line voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary substrate bias voltage generating circuits are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,997 entitled “SUBSTRATE BIAS VOLTAGE CONTROLLING CIRCUIT IN SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,341 entitled “SUBSTRATE BIAS VOLTAGE GENERATING CIRCUIT FOR USE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE”, U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a conventional substrate bias voltage generating circuit, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are circuit diagrams showing exemplary embodiments of a detector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substrate bias voltage generating circuit <b>10</b> consists of a charge pump <b>12</b>, a detector <b>14</b>, and a driver <b>16</b>. The charge pump <b>12</b> generates a substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>in response to a clock signal CLK, and the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is supplied to a substrate (not shown). The detector <b>14</b> detects whether the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>maintains a predetermined negative voltage, and generates a detection signal DET as a detection result. The driver <b>16</b> generates the clock signal CLK in response to the detection signal DET.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The detector <b>14</b> may be one of two detector types, they are: an inverter type and a differential amplifier type. An inverter type detector is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and a differential amplifier type detector is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Examples of the inverter type and differential amplifier type detectors are disclosed in the above-mentioned references U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,997 and Korea Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-0107692, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an inverter type detector <b>14</b> receives an internal power supply voltage Vint and a substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>to generate a detection signal DET. The detector <b>14</b> has a voltage divider structure and generates the detection signal DET as a control signal for operating the charge pump <b>12</b> according to the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the detector <b>14</b> operates simultaneously with the generation of the internal power supply voltage Vint at power-up, a substrate bias voltage of a desired level may be rapidly set up. On the other hand, it is difficult for the detector <b>14</b> to stably maintain the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>in view of temperature variations, thus causing deterioration of the DRAM refresh time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a differential amplifier type detector <b>14</b> consists of a voltage dividing section <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a differential amplifier section <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The voltage dividing section <b>14</b><i>a </i>receives a substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>and an internal power supply voltage Vint and divides the received voltages V<sub>BB </sub>and Vint based on a predetermined resistance ratio. The voltage dividing section <b>14</b><i>a </i>outputs a divided voltage Vdiv to the differential amplifier section <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The differential amplifier section <b>14</b><i>b </i>compares the divided voltage Vdiv and a reference voltage Vref and outputs a detection signal DET.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the detector <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> uses a differential amplifier, it detects the substrate bias voltage more exactly than the detector <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In addition, since the voltage dividing section <b>14</b><i>a </i>generates the divided voltage Vdiv according to the resistance ratio, the detector <b>14</b> is capable of maintaining the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>in view of temperature variations. However, the detector <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> has a set up time that is slow at power-up.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, since the differential amplifier section <b>14</b><i>b </i>uses the reference voltage Vref and the divided voltage Vdiv as its input voltages, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the divided voltage Vdiv is lower than the reference voltage Vref until it reaches a predetermined voltage. For this reason, the detector <b>14</b> does not operate during a predetermined period of time at power-up, thus resulting in a slow set up time.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, a need exists for a substrate bias voltage generating circuit for use with a semiconductor memory device that is capable of maintaining a stable bias voltage during and after power-up.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing a semiconductor memory device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a semiconductor memory device <b>1000</b> comprises a memory cell array <b>200</b>; a write/read circuit <b>400</b> for writing/reading data to/from the memory cell array <b>200</b>; a control circuit <b>600</b> for generating a flag signal FLAG; and a substrate bias voltage generating circuit <b>800</b> for generating a substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>to be supplied to the memory cell array <b>200</b> in response to the flag signal FLAG.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, the substrate bias voltage generating circuit <b>800</b> comprises two detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> for detecting the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB</sub>. The detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> selectively operate according to the flag signal FLAG output from the control circuit <b>600</b>. The detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> are configured to be detector types whose operating characteristics are different from each other. In this embodiment, the control circuit <b>600</b> is configured to activate the flag signal FLAG when an operating mode is set up. The first detector <b>830</b> operates when the flag signal FLAG is inactivated, and the second detector <b>840</b> operates when the flag signal FLAG is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the semiconductor memory device <b>1000</b> is configured such that the detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> having different characteristics from each other operate selectively on the basis of the set-up timing of an operating mode. However, it is to be understood by one skilled in the art that the switch timing of the detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b>, is not limited to the set-up time of an operating mode.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing an exemplary embodiment of the substrate bias voltage generating circuit <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the substrate bias voltage generating circuit <b>800</b> comprises a charge pump <b>810</b>, a selector <b>820</b>, a first detector <b>830</b>, a second detector <b>840</b>, and a driver <b>850</b>. The charge pump <b>810</b> generates the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>in response to a clock signal CLK from the driver <b>850</b>. The selector <b>820</b> generates a selection signal DET_SEL in response to the flag signal FLAG from the control circuit <b>600</b>. For example, when the flag signal FLAG is at a low level indicating that an operating mode is not set up, the selector <b>820</b> generates the selection signal DET_SEL of a low level. When the flag signal FLAG is at a high level indicating that an operating mode is set up, the selector <b>820</b> generates the selection signal DET_SEL of a high level.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first detector <b>830</b> operates in response to the selection signal DET_SEL and detects whether the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is higher than a negative voltage of a desired level. In addition, the first detector <b>830</b> generates a first detection signal DET<b>1</b> as a detection result.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the detector <b>830</b> comprises an inverter type detection section <b>832</b> and a switch <b>834</b>. The detection section <b>832</b> is configured similar to that as illustrated in the detector <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. However, it is to be understood by one skilled in the art that the inverter type detection section <b>832</b> is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the switch <b>834</b> selectively outputs an output of the detection section <b>832</b> as the first detection signal DET<b>1</b> in response to the selection signal DET_SEL. For example, when the selection signal DET_SEL is at a low level, an output signal of the detection section <b>832</b> is output as the first detection signal DET<b>1</b> through the switch <b>834</b>. When the selection signal DET_SEL is at a high level, the switch <b>834</b> is inactivated such that the output signal of the detection section <b>832</b> is not output as the first detection signal DET<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second detector <b>840</b> operates in response to the selection signal DET_SEL, and detects whether the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is higher than a negative voltage of a desired level. The second detector <b>840</b> generates a second detection signal DET<b>2</b> as a detection result.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the detector <b>840</b> comprises a differential amplifier type detection section <b>842</b> and a switch <b>844</b>. The differential amplifier type detection section <b>842</b> is configured similar to that as illustrated by the detector <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. However, it is to be understood by one skilled in the art that the differential amplifier type detection section <b>842</b> is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the switch <b>844</b> selectively outputs an output of the detection section <b>842</b> as the second detection signal DET<b>2</b> in response to the selection signal DET_SEL. For example, when the selection signal DET_SEL is at a high level, an output signal of the detection section <b>842</b> is output as the second detection signal DET<b>2</b> through the switch <b>844</b>. When the selection signal DET_SEL is at a low level, the switch <b>844</b> is inactivated such that the output signal of the detection section <b>842</b> is not output as the second detection signal DET<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the driver <b>850</b> generates the clock signal CLK in response to either one of an output from the first and second detectors <b>840</b> and <b>840</b>. As described above, since the first and second detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> operate complimentarily to each other, either one of output signals from the detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> is applied to the driver <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, when the selection signal DET_SEL is at a low level indicating, for example, that an operating mode is not set up, the first detector <b>830</b> having the inverter type detection section <b>832</b> operates. When the selection signal DET_SEL is at a high level indicating, for example, that an operating mode is set up, the second detector <b>840</b> having the differential amplifier type detection section <b>842</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, during a power-up period where an operating mode is not set up, rapid voltage stabilization is accomplished. In addition, during an operating period where the operating mode is set up, a stable substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is maintained in view of temperature variations, due to the use of the detector <b>840</b> having the differential amplifier type detection section <b>842</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an alternative embodiment, the switch timing of the first and second detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> can be determined by read/write/refresh/NOP information instead of a command for setting up an operating mode. For example, the read/write/refresh/NOP information can be applied to a control circuit <b>600</b> and then to the first and second detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b>. In this embodiment, detection levels of the first and second detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> are determined such that the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is maintained at a predetermined voltage. However, the detection levels of the first and second detectors <b>830</b> and <b>840</b> can be defined such that the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is changed to different voltages when necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a circuit diagram showing an exemplary embodiment of the selector <b>820</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the selector <b>820</b> consists of two NAND gates <b>821</b> and <b>823</b> and two inverters <b>822</b> and <b>824</b>. The NAND gates <b>821</b> and <b>823</b> are connected to form an RS flip-flop. The selector <b>820</b> is reset by an input signal PVCCH indicating whether an internal power supply voltage reaches a predetermined voltage, and outputs a selection signal DET_SEL of a low level. The low level of the selection signal DET_SEL is maintained until a flag signal FLAG goes to a high level. When the flag signal FLAG has a low-to-high transition, the selection signal DET_SEL is changed to a high level from a low level.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing diagram for describing an operation of a semiconductor memory device according to an exemplary embodiment the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as an external power supply voltage is supplied, for example, to the semiconductor memory device <b>1000</b>, an internal power supply voltage Vint and an internal reference voltage start to be generated by an internal voltage generating circuit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the internal power supply voltage Vint reaches a predetermined voltage, a control signal PVCCH goes high. The selector <b>820</b> is then reset by a low-to-high transition of the control signal PVCCH. At this time, a flag signal FLAG and a selection signal DET_SEL are maintained at a low level. This means that the first detector <b>830</b> is activated and the second detector <b>840</b> is inactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first detector <b>830</b> then detects whether a substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is higher than a target voltage, and generates the first detection signal DET<b>1</b> as a detection result. The driver <b>850</b> generates a clock signal CLK in response to the first detection signal DET<b>1</b>, and the charge pump <b>810</b> performs a charge pumping operation in response to the clock signal CLK.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At a later time, the control circuit <b>600</b> activates the flag signal FLAG to a high level when an operating mode is set up. The selector <b>820</b> activates the selection signal DET_SEL in response to the activation of the flag signal FLAG. This means that the first detector <b>830</b> is inactivated and the second detector <b>840</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The second detector <b>840</b> then detects whether the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is higher than its target voltage, and generates the second detection signal DET<b>2</b>. The driver <b>850</b> generates the clock signal CLK in response to the second detection signal DET<b>2</b>, and the charge pump <b>810</b> carries out a charge pumping operation in response to the clock signal CLK.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the operations just described, the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is rapidly stabilized by the detector <b>830</b> having the inverter type detection section <b>832</b> at power-up or before setting-up an operating mode. Further, after power-up or setting-up an operating mode, the substrate bias voltage V<sub>BB </sub>is constantly maintained by the detector <b>840</b> having the differential amplifier type detector <b>842</b> even in view of temperature variations.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
