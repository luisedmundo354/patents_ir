<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates generally to the field of marine seismic data acquisition equipment. More specifically, the invention relates to structures for marine seismic streamers, and methods for making such streamers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Marine seismic surveying is typically performed using “streamers” towed near the surface of a body of water. A streamer is in the most general sense a cable towed by a seismic vessel. The cable has a plurality of seismic sensors disposed thereon at spaced apart locations along the length of the cable. The seismic sensors are typically hydrophones, but can also be any type of sensor that is responsive to the pressure in the water, or to changes therein with respect to time. The seismic sensors may also be any type of particle motion sensor or acceleration sensor known in the art. Irrespective of the type of such seismic sensors, the sensors generate an electrical or optical signal that is related to the pressure-related or motion-related parameter being measured by the sensors. The electrical or optical signals are conducted along electrical conductors or optical fibers carried by the streamer to a recording system. The recording system is typically disposed on the seismic vessel, but may be disposed elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a typical marine seismic survey, a seismic energy source is actuated at selected times, and a record, with respect to time, of the signals detected by the one or more sensors is made in the recording system. The recorded signals are later used for interpretation to infer structure of, fluid content of, and composition of rock formations in the Earth's subsurface. Structure, fluid content and mineral composition are typically inferred from characteristics of seismic energy that is reflected from subsurface acoustic impedance boundaries. One important aspect of interpretation is identifying those portions of the recorded signals that represent reflected seismic energy and those portions which represent noise.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to improve the quality of seismic data interpretation, one goal of marine seismic streamer design is to reduce the various forms of noise detected by the seismic sensors. A typical marine seismic streamer can be up to several kilometers in length, and can include thousands of individual seismic sensors. Because of the weight of all of the materials used in a typical marine seismic sensor, because of the friction (drag) caused by the streamer as it is moved through the water, and because of the need to protect the seismic sensors, electrical and/or optical conductors and associated equipment from water intrusion, a typical seismic streamer includes certain features. First, the streamer includes one or more strength members to transmit axial force along the length of the streamer. The strength member is operatively coupled to the seismic vessel and thus bears all the axial loading caused by drag (friction) of the streamer in the water. The streamer also includes, as previously explained, electrical and/or optical conductors to carry electrical power and/or signals to the various sensors and (in certain streamers) signal conditioning equipment disposed in the streamer and to carry signals from the various sensors to a recording station. The streamer also typically includes an exterior jacket that surrounds the other components in the streamer. The jacket is typically made from a strong, flexible plastic such as polyurethane, such that water is excluded from the interior of the jacket, and seismic energy can pass essentially unimpeded through the jacket to the sensors. A typical streamer also includes buoyancy devices at spaced apart locations along its length, so that the streamer is substantially neutrally buoyant in the water. The interior of the jacket is typically filled with oil or similar electrically insulating fluid that is substantially transparent to seismic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The typical fluid-filled streamer structured as described above is well proven and has been used in the seismic surveying industry for a considerable time. However, there are some drawbacks to the fluid-filled streamer structure described above. One such drawback is leakage of the fluid into the surrounding water when a streamer section is damaged or the outer jacket is cut. This allows water to enter interstices of a streamer cable and could cause electrical failure of components in the streamer. At the same time, the streamer buoyancy is compromised. Because the fluid in the streamer is typically hydrocarbon-based, such as kerosene or light oil, such leakage can cause environmental damage. Damage to the streamer can occur while the streamer is being towed through the water or it can occur while the streamer is being deployed from or retrieved onto a winch on which streamers are typically stored on the seismic tow vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another drawback to using fluid-filled streamers is that detectable noise can be generated by vibrations resulting from the streamer being towed through the water. Such vibrations can cause internal pressure waves that travel through the fluid inside the streamer, such waves often being referred to as “bulge waves” or “breathing waves.” Such noise is described, for example, in S. P. Beerens et al., <i>Flow Noise Analysis of Towed Sonar Arrays</i>, UDT 99—Conference Proceedings Undersea Defense Technology, Jun. 29-Jul. 1, 1999, Nice, France, Nexus Media Limited, Swanley, Kent. Noise in the form of pressure waves can be detected by the seismic sensors, making identification of reflected seismic energy in the recorded signals more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another drawback to fluid-filled seismic streamers known in the art is transient motion of the various components of the streamer. Transient motion can induce detectable noise in the streamer. Ideally, during a seismic survey the entire streamer would move through the water at substantially constant velocity, and all the streamer components (i.e., the outer jacket, connectors, spacers, strength members, and filling fluid) would also move at the same constant velocity and thus not move with respect to each other. Under actual seismic survey conditions, however, motion of the seismic streamer is not uniform throughout and thus can lead to transient motion of various components, most notably the strength members. Transient motion can be caused by such events such as pitching and heaving of the streamers; strumming of towing cables attached to the streamers (the strumming caused by vortex shedding on the cables), and operation of depth-control devices located on the streamers.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Transient motion of the strength members can cause transient longitudinal displacement of the spacers or connectors, causing pressure fluctuations in the fluid that are detected by the seismic sensors. Pressure fluctuations in the fluid that radiate away from the spacers or connectors can also cause the flexible outer jacket to bulge in and out as a traveling wave, giving this phenomenon its name. So called “bulge waves” can be detected by the seismic sensors. Another type of noise that can be caused by transient motion of the strength members will be further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other types of noise, generally called “flow noise”, can also affect the signals detected by the seismic sensors. For example, vibrations in and along the seismic streamer can cause extensional waves in the outer jacket and can cause resonance transients to travel along the strength members. A turbulent boundary layer created around the outer jacket of the streamer by the act of towing the streamer in the water can also cause pressure fluctuations in the fluid filling the streamer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In fluid-filled streamers, extensional waves in the jacket, resonance transients, and turbulence-induced noise are typically smaller in amplitude than bulge waves. Bulge waves are usually the largest source of vibration noise because these waves travel within the fluid core material filling the streamer and thus act directly on the seismic sensors. Nonetheless, all of these noise sources cumulatively can affect the detection of reflected seismic energy from the Earth formations below the water bottom, and thus affect the quality of seismic surveys.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Several methods and structures for streamers have been devised to reduce the foregoing types of noise. One such structure includes compartment isolation blocks within a fluid-filled streamer section to stop the vibration-caused bulge waves from traveling continuously along the entire length of the streamer. Another such noise reducing structure includes open-cell foam disposed in the interior of the streamer. The open-cell foam restricts the movement of the fluid in response to transient pressure changes and causes transient pressure energy to be dissipated into the outer jacket and the foam over a shorter longitudinal distance. Another structure used to reduce noise includes combining (summing) the signals from several longitudinally spaced apart seismic sensors to attenuate effects of relatively slow-moving bulge waves or similar noise. In such structures, an equal number of seismic sensors are positioned between or on both sides of each of the spacers in a streamer segment so that longitudinally equally spaced apart (from the spacer) pairs of seismic sensors detected equal yet opposite polarity pressure changes. Summing the signals from all the sensors in such a group can thus effectively cancel some of the noise.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another approach to reducing the effects of bulge waves is to eliminate the fluid from the streamer sections entirely, so that no medium exists in which bulge waves can propagate. This approach is exemplified by so-called “solid” streamers, in which each streamer section is filled with a solid core material instead of a fluid. However, in any solid material, some shear waves will develop, which can increase some types of noise detected by the seismic sensors. Shear waves, of course, for the most part cannot propagate in a fluid filled streamer because fluids have substantially zero shear modulus (at least as compared with typical solid materials). Additionally, many conventional solid core materials are not substantially acoustically transparent to pressure waves, thus reducing the sensitivity of such streamers to reflected seismic energy. To deal with the foregoing limitations of using solid fill material in a streamer, another approach to reducing noise in streamers has been developed, which is to replace the fluid with a semi-solid or gelatin-like filler material. Such semi-solid filler material is flexible and acoustically transparent to seismic energy. The use of semi-solid material may reduce the development of bulge waves as compared to those in a fluid filled streamer, because the semi-solid material has much lower compressibility than fluid and thus reduces longitudinal displacement of the spacers. A semi-solid material may also reduce the transmission of shear waves as compared with that of a solid streamer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Using a semi-solid material as described in the above referenced patent application substantially attenuates bulge waves, but noise resulting from the so called “Poisson Effect” from the strength members can actually increase as compared to fluid filled streamers. The Poisson Effect is characterized by a change in diameter of the strength member as the tension applied to the strength member changes. The diameter change will be related to the magnitude of the tension change and to Poisson's ratio of the material used for the strength member. As previously explained, various effects on the streamer can cause tension transients along the strength members. Tension transients typically propagate along the length of the strength member at a velocity related to the elastic modulus of the material used to make the strength member. As such tension transients travel along the strength member, a corresponding change in diameter of the strength member occurs. Changes in diameter of the strength member can induce compressional waves in the media that fill the streamer. In a typical streamer, seismic sensors are each disposed within a suitable opening in a sensor spacer. Each sensor spacer is adhesively coupled or otherwise affixed to the strength members, wherein the strength members pass through suitable openings in the spacers. Sensor spacers are typically made from dense, rigid plastic to protect the sensor from damage during handling and use. While effective at reducing damage to the sensors, the sensor spacers also effectively couple Poisson Effect noise, among other types of noise, from the strength members to the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is desirable to have a seismic streamer that takes advantage of the benefits of semi-solid filling materials, while having reduced amplitude of compressional waves (Poisson Effect waves) resulting from tension transients and other types of noise passing along the strength members transmitted into the seismic sensors.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example marine seismic data acquisition system as it is typically used in acquiring seismic data. A seismic vessel <b>14</b> moves along the surface of a body of water <b>12</b> such as a lake or the ocean. The marine seismic survey is intended to detect and record seismic signals related to structure and composition of various subsurface Earth formations <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> below the water bottom <b>20</b>. The seismic vessel <b>14</b> includes source actuation, data recording and navigation equipment, shown generally at <b>16</b>, referred to for convenience as a “recording system.” The seismic vessel <b>14</b>, or a different vessel (not shown), can tow one or more seismic energy sources <b>18</b>, or arrays of such sources in the water <b>12</b>. The seismic vessel <b>14</b> or a different vessel tows at least one seismic streamer <b>10</b> near the surface of the water <b>12</b>. The streamer <b>10</b> is coupled to the vessel <b>14</b> by a lead in cable <b>26</b>. A plurality of sensor elements <b>24</b>, or arrays of such sensor elements, are disposed at spaced apart locations along the streamer <b>10</b>. The sensor elements <b>24</b>, as will be explained in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are formed by mounting a seismic sensor inside a sensor spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During operation, certain equipment (not shown separately) in the recording system <b>16</b> causes the source <b>18</b> to actuate at selected times. When actuated, the source <b>18</b> produces seismic energy <b>19</b> that emanates generally outwardly from the source <b>18</b>. The energy <b>19</b> travels downwardly, through the water <b>12</b>, and passes, at least in part, through the water bottom <b>20</b> into the formations <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> below the water bottom <b>20</b>. Seismic energy <b>19</b> is at least partially reflected from one or more acoustic impedance boundaries <b>22</b> below the water bottom <b>20</b>, and travels upwardly whereupon it may be detected by the sensors in each sensor element <b>24</b>. Structure of the formations <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, among other properties of the Earth's subsurface, can be inferred by travel time of the energy <b>19</b> and by characteristics of the detected energy such as its amplitude and phase.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Having explained the general method of operation of a marine seismic streamer, an example embodiment of a streamer according to the invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cut away view of a portion (segment) <b>10</b>A of a typical marine seismic streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A streamer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may extend behind the seismic vessel (<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for several kilometers, and is typically made from a plurality of streamer segments <b>10</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> connected end to end behind the vessel (<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The streamer segment <b>10</b>A in the present embodiment may be about 75 meters in overall length. A streamer such as shown at <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thus may be formed by connecting a selected number of such segments <b>10</b>A end to end. The segment <b>10</b>A includes a jacket <b>30</b>, which, in the present embodiment, can be made from 3.5 mm thick transparent polyurethane and has a nominal external diameter of about 62 millimeters. In each segment <b>10</b>A, each axial end of the jacket <b>30</b> may be terminated by a coupling/termination plate <b>36</b>. The coupling/termination plate <b>36</b> may include rib elements <b>36</b>A on an external surface of the coupling/termination plate <b>36</b> that is inserted into the end of the jacket <b>30</b>, so as to seal against the inner surface of the jacket <b>30</b> and to grip the coupling/termination plate <b>36</b> to the jacket <b>30</b> when the jacket <b>30</b> is secured by an external clamp (not shown). In the present embodiment, two strength members <b>42</b> are coupled to the interior of each coupling/termination plate <b>36</b> and extend the length of the segment <b>10</b>A. In a particular implementation of the invention, the strength members <b>42</b> may be made from a fiber rope made from a fiber sold under the trademark VECTRAN, which is a registered trademark of Hoechst Celanese Corp., New York, N.Y. The strength members <b>42</b> transmit axial load along the length of the segment <b>10</b>A. When one segment <b>10</b>A is coupled end to end to another such segment (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the mating coupling/termination plates <b>36</b> are coupled together using any suitable connector, so that the axial force is transmitted through the coupling/termination plates <b>36</b> from the strength members <b>42</b> in one segment <b>10</b>A to the strength member in the adjoining segment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The segment <b>10</b>A can include a number of buoyancy spacers <b>32</b> disposed in the jacket <b>30</b> and coupled to the strength members <b>42</b> at spaced apart locations along their length. The buoyancy spacers <b>32</b> may be made from foamed polyurethane or other suitable material having a density selected to provide the segment <b>10</b>A preferably with approximately the same overall density as the water (<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), so that the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) will be substantially neutrally buoyant in the water (<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As a practical matter, the buoyancy spacers <b>32</b> provide the segment <b>10</b>A with an overall density very slightly less than that of fresh water. Appropriate overall density may then be adjusted in actual use by selecting the number of buoyancy spacers <b>32</b> and fill media having suitable specific gravity to be utilized in each segment <b>10</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The segment <b>10</b>A includes a conductor cable <b>40</b>, which may be centrally located, and which may include a plurality of insulated electrical conductors (not shown separately), and may include one or more optical fibers (not shown). The cable <b>40</b> conducts electrical and/or optical signals from the sensors (which will be further explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) to the recording system (<b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The cable <b>40</b> may in some implementations also carry electrical power to various signal processing circuits (not shown separately) disposed in one or more segments <b>10</b>A, or disposed elsewhere along the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The length of the conductor cable <b>40</b> within a cable segment <b>10</b>A is generally longer than the axial length of the segment <b>10</b>A under the largest expected axial stress on the segment <b>10</b>A, so that the electrical conductors and optical fibers in the cable <b>40</b> will not experience any substantial axial stress when the streamer <b>10</b> is towed through the water by a vessel. The conductors and optical fibers may be terminated in a connector <b>38</b> disposed in each coupling/termination plate <b>36</b> so that when the segments <b>10</b>A are connected end to end, corresponding electrical and/or optical connections may be made between the electrical conductors and optical fibers in the conductor cable <b>40</b> in adjoining segments <b>10</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sensors, which in the present embodiment may be hydrophones, can be disposed inside respective sensor spacers, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> generally at <b>34</b>. The hydrophones in the present embodiment can be of a type known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to those sold under model number T-2BX by Teledyne Geophysical Instruments, Houston, Tex. In the present embodiment, each segment <b>10</b>A may include 96 such hydrophones, disposed in arrays of sixteen individual hydrophones connected in electrical series. In a particular implementation of the invention, there are thus six such arrays, spaced apart from each other at about 12.5 meters. The spacing between individual hydrophones in each array should be selected so that the axial span of the array is at most equal to about one half the wavelength of the highest frequency seismic energy intended to be detected by the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It should be clearly understood that the types of sensors used, the electrical and/or optical connections used, the number of such sensors, and the spacing between such sensors are only used to illustrate one particular embodiment of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of this invention. In other embodiments, the sensors may be particle motion sensors such as geophones or accelerometers. A marine seismic streamer having particle motion sensors is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/233,266, filed on Aug. 30, 2002, entitled, Apparatus and Method for Multicomponent Marine Geophysical Data Gathering, assigned to an affiliated company of the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At selected positions along the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) a compass bird <b>44</b> may be affixed to the outer surface of the jacket <b>30</b>. The compass bird <b>44</b> includes a directional sensor (not shown separately) for determining the geographic orientation of the segment <b>10</b>A at the location of the compass bird <b>44</b>. The compass bird <b>44</b> may include an electromagnetic signal transducer <b>44</b>A for communicating signals to a corresponding transducer <b>44</b>B inside the jacket <b>30</b> for communication along the conductor cable <b>40</b> to the recording system (<b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Measurements of direction are used, as is known in the art, to infer the position of the various sensors in the segment <b>10</b>A, and thus along the entire length of the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Typically, a compass bird will be affixed to the streamer (<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) about every 300 meters (every four segments <b>10</b>A). One type of compass bird is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,611 issued to Burrage and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present embodiment, the interior space of the jacket <b>30</b> may be filled with an acoustically transparent filler material <b>46</b> such as buoyancy void filler (“BVF”), which may be a curable, synthetic urethane-based polymer. The BVF <b>46</b> serves to exclude fluid (water) from the interior of the jacket <b>30</b>, to electrically insulate the various components inside the jacket <b>30</b>, to add buoyancy to a streamer section and to transmit seismic energy freely through the jacket <b>30</b> to the sensors <b>34</b>. The BVF <b>46</b> in its uncured state is essentially in liquid form and may be introduced into the interior of the jacket <b>30</b> in such liquid form for cure afterward. Upon cure, the BVF <b>46</b> no longer flows as a liquid, but instead becomes substantially solid. However, the BVF <b>46</b> upon cure retains some flexibility to bending stress, is substantially elastic, and freely transmits seismic energy to the seismic sensors. It should be understood that the BVF used in the present embodiment only is one example of an acoustically transparent filler material that can be used to fill the interior of the streamer. Other materials could be also used. For example, a selected substance, such as a thermoplastic, that is heated above its melting point, and introduced into the interior of the jacket <b>30</b>, and subsequent cooled, may also be used in a streamer according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor spacers <b>34</b>, as explained in the Background section herein, are typically molded from a rigid, dense plastic to better protect the seismic sensors therein from damage during handling and use. While effective in reducing incidence of damage to the seismic sensors, the rigid plastic used in the sensor spacers <b>34</b> also efficiently couples noise from the strength members <b>42</b> to the seismic sensor therein. Also as explained in the Background section herein, one source of noise is the Poisson Effect, wherein stretching of the strength members <b>42</b> under axial tension causes them to undergo a reduction in diameter. When the axial tension is reduced on the strength members <b>42</b>, they increase diameter. The strength members <b>42</b> are typically tightly fit in, and adhesively bonded to through passages (<b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the sensor spacers <b>34</b>. Thus diameter changes in the strength members <b>42</b> are efficiently transferred to the sensor spacers <b>34</b>, providing a source of noise that can be detected by the seismic sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a system known in the art prior to the present invention in which seismic sensors are mounted in the sensor spacers. The sensor spacer <b>34</b> includes an opening <b>50</b> shaped to accept a seismic sensor <b>56</b>. The sensor <b>56</b> in this embodiment can be the model number T-2BX hydrophone made by Teledyne Geophysical Instruments, explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The housing of the sensor <b>56</b> includes ribs <b>56</b>A on its lateral edges, such that when the sensor <b>56</b> is inserted into the opening <b>50</b>, the sensor <b>56</b> is retained in the opening <b>50</b> by interference fit. The spacer <b>34</b> also includes through passages <b>52</b> through which the strength members (<b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are inserted. An adhesive port <b>54</b> is provided on the spacer <b>34</b>, and into which adhesive (not shown) is injected after the strength members (<b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are inserted into the through passages <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Having explained generally the construction of a marine seismic sensor streamer, one embodiment of a structure for a streamer according to the invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, of which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded view to show the relevant components. A sensor spacer <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be molded from rigid polypropylene or similar plastic as previously explained herein, and may include an opening <b>50</b> having size and shape configured to receive a seismic sensor <b>56</b> therein. In the present embodiment, the seismic sensor <b>56</b> may be retained in the opening <b>50</b> by interference fit as explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or, in a particular embodiment, by the action of the BVF (<b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) upon cure thereof such that there is substantially no direct contact between the sensor <b>56</b> and the interior surface of the opening <b>50</b>. Prior to and during cure of the BVF (<b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in such embodiments, the sensor <b>56</b> may be suspended from contacting the interior surface of the opening <b>50</b> by using soft elastomer rings (not shown) or the like. The seismic sensor <b>50</b> may be a hydrophone or any other type of seismic sensor known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The exterior of the sensor spacer <b>34</b> may include on each side thereof a substantially semi cylindrically shaped channel <b>52</b>A extending along the longitudinal dimension of the spacer <b>34</b>. The channel <b>52</b>A has a diameter selected to receive the strength member <b>42</b> therein substantially without contact between the strength member <b>42</b> and the interior of the channel <b>52</b>A. In the longitudinal position at which the strength member <b>42</b> is to be inserted into the channel <b>52</b>A, the strength member <b>42</b>A may be covered on its exterior by a tube <b>60</b> made from dense, rigid plastic, such as a thermoplastic sold under the trademark ISOPLAST, which is a registered trademark of The Upjohn Company, 7000 Portage Rd., Kalamazoo, Mich. 49001. The tube <b>60</b> may be adhesively bonded or otherwise affixed to the strength member <b>42</b>. The tube <b>60</b> preferably includes a flange <b>62</b> or similar enlarged diameter feature at each longitudinal end thereof to retain an associated elastomer ring <b>64</b> or ring made of similarly soft, compressible material from moving beyond the longitudinal end of the tube <b>60</b>. The elastomer rings <b>64</b> have an uncompressed external diameter larger than the diameter of the flanges <b>62</b> such that when the strength member <b>42</b> is inserted into the channel <b>52</b>A, there is substantially no contact between any part of the tube <b>60</b>, the flanges <b>62</b> or the strength member <b>42</b>, and the body of the spacer <b>34</b>. Preferably, the interior of the channel <b>52</b>A includes grooves <b>66</b> or similarly shaped features that cooperatively engage and retain the elastomer rings <b>64</b>. The elastomer rings <b>64</b> are prevented from movement along the interior of the channel <b>52</b>A by the grooves <b>66</b>, and are retained longitudinally along the exterior of the tube <b>60</b> by the flanges <b>62</b>. Thus, the spacer <b>34</b> is longitudinally fixed with respect to the strength member <b>42</b> when the strength member <b>42</b>, tube <b>60</b> and elastomer rings <b>64</b> are inserted into the channel <b>52</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When Poisson waves travel along the strength member <b>42</b>, they are to a substantial extent attenuated in radial amplitude by the tube <b>60</b>. The tube <b>60</b> will expand to some extent under the expansion force of the strength member <b>42</b> as Poisson waves travel therealong, but because the tube has a much higher rigidity than the strength member, a substantial portion of the radial expansion of the strength member <b>42</b> will not result in corresponding expansion of the tube <b>60</b>. Further, because the tube <b>60</b> is separated from the spacer <b>34</b> by the elastomer rings <b>64</b>, any diameter change in the tube <b>60</b> will be substantially isolated from the spacer <b>34</b>. As a result, the effects of Poisson waves traveling along the strength member will be substantially isolated from the spacer <b>34</b>, and thus from the sensor <b>56</b>. An assembled view of the sensor spacer <b>34</b> according to this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the present embodiment, it is contemplated that the strength members <b>42</b> will be retained in the channels <b>52</b>A by the jacket (<b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be clearly understood that while it is preferable to use gel as explained herein to fill the interior of the jacket, using such gel for filling the interior of the jacket is not necessary to cause the streamer of the invention to perform its intended function. Gel is only required to fill the opening (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the sensor spacer <b>34</b> in the present embodiment to retain the sensor <b>56</b> therein and isolate the sensor <b>56</b> acoustically from the sensor spacer <b>34</b>. As explained above, it is only necessary to mount the spacer <b>34</b> such that it is substantially acoustically isolated from the strength member(s) in order to accomplish the intended function of a streamer according to the various aspects of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Streamers and streamer segments made according to the various aspects of the invention may have reduced noise resulting from transient tension of the strength members, for increased accuracy in seismic surveying.</p>
