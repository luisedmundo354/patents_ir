<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of determining the mass of a mail piece using a load cell. A mail piece whose mass is to be determined is transported across a platform without stopping or slowing the mail piece. A load cell measures the horizontal force applied to the load cell by the transported mail piece. This horizontal force, along with the acceleration of the mail piece, allows a determination of the mass of the mail piece.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject invention relates to a method for rapidly determining the mass of a mail piece.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mailing systems where a mail piece is transported onto a postal scale, the appropriate postage is determined and used to set a postage meter, and the mail piece is then transported to the postage meter for imprinting with a postal indicia representative of the postage amount are known. One such system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,878, issued May 10, 1988 to the assignee of the subject invention. In such systems, there is a constant need to increase the rate at which the scale can determine the mass of a mail piece in order that the throughput of the system can be increased. Heretofore, weighing devices for such mail processing systems have been developed, but these generally have been rather slow. Actually, many prior weight devices combined a standard scale with a mechanism that would stop the mail to allow weighing to take place. These systems require large transports and high acceleration and deceleration rates. To keep pace with a high throughout rate, multiple scales would be used with alternate mail pieces diverted to such scales.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A separate approach for providing high throughput mailing systems has been the use of vibrating tray scales to determine the mass of a mail piece where the mass is estimated as a function of the frequency at which a scale tray vibrates after a mail piece is placed upon it and the system is excited. Such a system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,082,072. While such prior art systems have proven generally satisfactory, there is still a need for a method of operation which is suitable for use with load cell technology while still providing desired high throughput rates of at least three mail pieces per second for mailing systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for determining the mass of an article in motion. For the purpose of determining the mass of the article, a platform and an associated means for transporting the article are mounted on resilient support means. A load cell is oriented in such a manner as to measure a horizontal force applied to the load cell by the transported article. The transporting means moves the article across the platform, without stopping, in accordance with a known acceleration profile. While the article is in motion, a load cell measures the horizontal force acting on the load cell. The horizontal force is then correlated with the acceleration rate of the article in order to determine the mass of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment of the invention, a multiple frequency, time varying velocity profile is applied to a servo motor which controls the motion of the article. The current output of the motor passes through a current limiter. Predetermined weight breaks are identified by predetermining which frequency will saturate the current limiter for an article of a known mass. For each frequency, with the transported article on the platform, the output of the current limiter is measured. By comparing the frequency of the velocity signal when the motor is current limited against the predetermined frequencies which saturate the current limiter, the mass of the article is rapidly determined.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the weighing conveyer <b>1</b> of the present invention. The conveyer <b>1</b> is interposed between a suitable feeding module (not shown) from which mail pieces <b>13</b> are fed seriatim to the weighing conveyer <b>1</b> where they are weighed prior to a postage indicia being printed thereon by a postage meter module <b>20</b>. The weighing conveyer <b>1</b> is comprised of a load cell <b>2</b> and a resilient base <b>81</b>. Preferably base <b>81</b> is formed of a vibration damping material, as is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,479,561, to Feinland et al. Thus, as mail piece <b>13</b> is transported, external vibrations are not felt by the load cell <b>2</b> but are isolated from ground by base <b>81</b>. Such a system is described, for example, in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,082,072 which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the weighing conveyer <b>1</b> has a pair of stanchions <b>80</b> fixedly mounted to frame <b>3</b>. Secured to the upper end of frame <b>3</b> is a bracket <b>4</b> which supports a platform <b>15</b> for receiving a mail piece from the aforementioned feeding module, and a plurality of springs <b>6</b> to which paired arms <b>7</b> are attached, there being pins <b>8</b> extending between and joining the paired arms <b>7</b>, each pin <b>8</b> supporting an idler roller <b>9</b>. The plurality of springs <b>6</b> having a first tang <b>10</b> that abuts the bracket <b>4</b> and a second tang <b>11</b> that is in engagement with the upper part <b>12</b> of one of the paired arms <b>7</b>. With this construction, the arms <b>7</b> are biased towards a mail piece <b>13</b>, shown in a position in which its weight would be determined by the load cell <b>2</b>. Because of the biasing action of the springs <b>6</b> upon the arms <b>7</b>, the rollers <b>9</b> will engage a mail piece <b>13</b> and urge it against the belt <b>14</b> until such time as the mail piece <b>13</b> exits the weighing conveyer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the downstream side of the weighing conveyer <b>1</b> is the metering module <b>20</b> for imprinting a mail piece <b>13</b> with an indicia. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the metering module <b>20</b> is comprised of a printer <b>41</b> and a pair of stanchions <b>22</b> fixedly mounted to frame <b>42</b>. Secured to the upper end of the stanchions <b>22</b> is a bracket <b>21</b> which supports a platform <b>40</b> for receiving a mail piece <b>13</b> from the aforementioned weighing conveyer, and a plurality of springs <b>23</b>. Attached to springs <b>23</b> are paired arms <b>24</b>, there being pins <b>25</b> extending between and joining the paired arms <b>24</b>, each pin <b>25</b> supporting an idler roller <b>26</b>. The springs <b>23</b> have a first tang <b>27</b> that abuts the bracket <b>21</b> and a second tang <b>28</b> that is in engagement with the upper part of one of the paired arms <b>24</b>. With this construction, the arms <b>24</b> are biased towards a mail piece <b>13</b>. Because of the biasing action of the springs <b>23</b> upon the arms <b>24</b>, the rollers <b>26</b> will engage a mail piece and urge it against the belt <b>29</b> until such time as the mail piece <b>13</b> exits the metering module <b>20</b>. Further details of the metering module <b>20</b>, and the manner in which the postage indicia is printed, need not be set forth herein for an understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the weighing conveyer <b>70</b> embodiment shown therein is provided with a printer <b>50</b> for printing a postage indicia. The weighing conveyer <b>70</b> is further comprised of a load cell <b>51</b> fixably mounted to frame <b>52</b>, a bracket <b>53</b> which supports a platform <b>54</b> for receiving mail piece <b>13</b> from a suitable feeding module (not shown), a plurality of springs <b>55</b> to which paired arms <b>56</b> are attached, there being pins <b>57</b> extending between and joining the paired arms <b>56</b>, each pin <b>57</b> supporting an idler roller <b>58</b>.

With this construction, the arms <b>56</b> are biased towards a mail piece <b>13</b>, shown in a position in which its weight would be determined by the load cell <b>51</b>. Because of the biasing action of the springs <b>55</b> upon the arms <b>56</b>, the rollers <b>58</b> will engage a mail piece <b>13</b> and urge it against belt <b>61</b> until such time as the mail piece <b>13</b> receives a postage indicia from printer <b>50</b> and exits the weighing conveyer <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the weighing conveyor <b>1</b>, <b>70</b> includes drive means for moving the mail piece <b>13</b> along the platform <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>. Rotatably supported by each shaft <b>30</b>, <b>65</b> are intermediate rollers <b>31</b>, <b>62</b> and end rollers <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> which act as support for belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b>. The end roller <b>33</b>, <b>64</b> has a shaft <b>30</b>, <b>65</b> on which is mounted gear <b>35</b>, <b>66</b>. The conveyor <b>1</b>, <b>70</b> generally includes a conventional motor <b>45</b>, <b>67</b>, such as a d.c. motor. The motor <b>45</b>, <b>67</b> has a drive shaft <b>46</b>, <b>68</b> on which is mounted a gear <b>34</b>, <b>69</b>. The motor gear <b>34</b>, <b>69</b> transmits motion to gear <b>35</b>, <b>66</b> by means of pulley <b>16</b>, <b>71</b> thereby imparting rotation to belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b>. Thus, it will be seen that rotation of the motor shaft <b>46</b>, <b>68</b> and the pulley <b>16</b>, <b>71</b> will drive the belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b> in a direction to move mail piece <b>13</b> across the surface of the platform <b>15</b>, <b>54</b>. To accurately control position of belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b>, the conveyor <b>1</b>, <b>70</b> may include a conventional motor controller and microprocessor (not shown). In general, control of the belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b> in order to keep the internal contents of the mail piece <b>13</b> from shifting is not considered as part of the subject invention nor as necessary for an understanding of the subject invention. However, it should be recognized that coupling the mail piece <b>13</b> to the belt <b>14</b>, <b>61</b> in a controlled manner is advantageous in making a rapid and accurate determination of the mass of mail piece <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows circuitry that converts the mechanical displacement of the load cell <b>2</b> into a digital signal for further processing. Strain gage <b>100</b> comprises four strain sensors <b>101</b> that are physically fixed to load cell <b>2</b> in a conventional manner, and which are resisted elements whose resistance changes in response to strain in load cell <b>2</b>. Sensors <b>101</b> are connected to form a bridge circuit that is excited with a DC voltage. The output of strain gage <b>100</b> is an analog electrical signal representative of the mechanical displacement of load cell <b>2</b> in response to the application of a horizontal force by the mail piece <b>13</b>. The signal is amplified by amplifier <b>102</b> and then input to a commercially available analog-to-digital converter <b>104</b> where it is converted into a series of digital signals representative of samples of the analog signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Data from the load cell <b>2</b> is subject to errors from several sources, including external vibrations and electronic noise. Hence, the digital signals are processed by digital filter <b>106</b>. Preferably such a filter would be a Kalman filter which may be implemented in a known manner in any of a number of commercially available microprocessors specially adapted for digital signal processing. The Kalman filter can factor into account the error sources and provide a filtered signal of the current mass of the mail piece <b>13</b> seen by the load cell <b>2</b>. The filter <b>106</b> may eliminate high frequency electrical noise and low frequency mechanical noise from the signal received from the load cell <b>2</b>. Signals that are output by the filter <b>106</b> are received by microprocessor <b>108</b> and processed to determine the mass of the mail piece <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The manner of determining the mass of the mail piece <b>13</b> will now be described using the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A mail piece is conveyed along the platform <b>15</b> between belt <b>19</b> and rollers <b>9</b> at a velocity V(t)=V<sub>avg</sub>+V<sub>a</sub>·sin ωt where V<sub>avg </sub>is the average velocity of motor <b>45</b>, V<sub>a </sub>is the amplitude of the sinusoidal varying velocity signal, and ω is the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage applied to motor <b>45</b>. Without stopping or slowing down the mail piece <b>13</b>, the load cell <b>2</b> measures the mass of the transported mail piece <b>13</b>. The mail piece <b>13</b> is weighed as it moves at the transport velocity by adding a sinusoidal velocity profile to the desired constant transport velocity. This in turn produces a sinusoidal acceleration profile for motion of the mail piece <b>13</b>. This acceleration profile produces a reaction load to ground, proportional to the mass of the mail piece <b>13</b>, at the known forcing frequency. From this, one will be able to determine the mass of mail piece <b>13</b> in accordance with the formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>F<sub>load cell</sub>∝m<sub>mail</sub>·a(t)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where F<sub>load cell </sub>is the horizontal force acting on the load cell <b>2</b>, m<sub>mail </sub>is the mass of article <b>13</b>, and a(t) is the acceleration rate of the article <b>13</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An alternate method for determining the weight of a mail piece <b>13</b> being transported across the weighing conveyer <b>1</b> is to apply a multiple frequency, time-varying velocity signal to the motor <b>45</b>. The multiple frequencies may be applied, for example, by using a Fourier Series velocity profile, a linear combination of velocity components at different frequencies, to excite the mail piece <b>13</b> at frequencies that saturate the load cell <b>2</b> at each of the postal weight breaks. Such a method requires torque limiting the motor <b>45</b> to prevent inadvertent overloading of the motor <b>45</b>. The motor <b>45</b> assumes an almost constant torque mode when the predetermined weight break has been exceeded. By looking at the frequencies that are attenuated by the torque limit, it is straightforward to process the load cell signals frequency spectra and determine which weight break the mail might exceed. This allows for a faster determination of the mass of mail piece <b>13</b>.</p>
