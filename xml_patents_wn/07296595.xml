<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/649,628, filed Feb. 2, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to fluid flow control valves, and more particularly to flow control between a high flow rate and a reduced flow rate of fluid through a valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Throttle valves typically provide for fluid flow rate control by establishing a first open state and a second open state in which a restrictor orifice is used to provide a relatively high resistance to fluid flow through the throttle valve. Such throttling valves often employ a first flow path through a first valve opening, and a second flow path through a restrictor orifice which establishes a restricted flow rate when the first valve opening is closed. However, while the second restricted open state produces a relatively high resistance to flow to provide a desired reduced flow rate through the valve, the first open state still produces a relatively low resistance to flow through the valve such that the first open state still affects fluid flow through the throttle valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a flow valve that controls fluid flow rate utilizing a first open position and a second open position. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, various embodiments of a flow valve having an inlet, an outlet, and a passageway therebetween are provided that comprise a damper element pivotally arranged within the passageway. The damper element is movable between a first position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially unaffected by the damper element, and a second position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially reduced by the damper element. An adjustable stop is further provided for adjustably limiting the movement of the damper element to establish the second position of the damper element. The various embodiments of a flow valve further comprise a movable operator for enabling movement of the damper element between the first position and at least a second position. A spring may be provided for biasing the damper element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, some embodiments provide for a flow valve in combination with a gas valve, to establish first and second fluid flow rates through the flow valve in combination with the gas valve. In such embodiments, a flow valve having an inlet, an outlet, and a passageway therebetween comprises a damper element pivotally arranged within the passageway, where the damper element is movable between a first position and at least a second position. The first position establishes a first fluid flow rate through the passageway that is substantially unaffected by the damper element, and the second position establishes a second fluid flow rate through the passageway that is substantially reduced by the damper element. An adjustable stop is further provided for adjustably limiting the movement of the damper element to establish the second position of the damper element. The flow valve further comprise a movable operator for enabling movement of the damper element between the first position and at least a second position. A spring may be provided for biasing the damper element. Thus, some embodiments provide for a flow valve in combination with a gas valve, where the inlet of the flow valve is in connection with the outlet of the gas valve such that fluid flow through the gas valve and flow valve may be controlled to provide at least two flow rates.</p>

It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One embodiment of a flow valve in accordance with the principles of the present invention is generally shown as <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The flow valve <b>120</b> has an inlet <b>122</b>, an outlet <b>124</b>, and a passage way <b>126</b> therethrough. The flow valve <b>120</b> further comprises a damper element <b>128</b> pivotally arranged within the passageway <b>126</b> that is movable between a first position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially unaffected by the damper element, and a second position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially reduced by the damper element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiment of a flow valve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a solenoid <b>130</b> is provided for engaging the damper element <b>128</b>, wherein the solenoid <b>130</b> when operated permits movement of the damper element <b>128</b> to its second position shown as a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the solenoid is not operated or actuated, the solenoid operator or shaft <b>130</b> engages the damper element <b>128</b> for establishing a first position of the damper element <b>128</b>. Specifically, the flow valve <b>120</b> comprises a stop <b>132</b> to establish a travel limit for the solenoid operator <b>130</b> when the solenoid is not being operated. When against the stop <b>132</b>, the solenoid operator <b>130</b> engages the damper element <b>128</b> for establishing a first position of the damper element <b>128</b>. A spring <b>134</b> can be utilized to bias the damper element <b>128</b> against the solenoid operator <b>130</b> in the first position. In this embodiment, the spring <b>134</b> is a torsion spring configured to be secured to the damper element <b>128</b>, and to contact an inner surface of the flow valve <b>120</b> to bias the damper element against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b>. Of course, instead of a torsion spring <b>134</b>, some other biasing means can be provided such as a leaf spring. The flow valve <b>120</b> comprises a second spring <b>136</b> for returning the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> to a position in engagement with the stop <b>132</b> and the damper element <b>128</b> for establishing the first position of the damper element when the solenoid is not being operated. Thus, the flow valve <b>120</b> provides for a damper element that is held in a first position that is generally parallel with the passage way <b>126</b> through the valve, such that the resulting first flow rate through the valve is substantially unaffected when the valve is in this first open position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the coil <b>138</b> is energized, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> is operated or movable in a direction towards an air gap <b>140</b> and a core <b>142</b>. When operated, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> compresses the spring <b>136</b> as it moves to a second position against the core <b>142</b>, and movement of the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> permits rotation of the damper element <b>128</b> about a rotation pin <b>144</b> towards the position represented by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The torsion spring <b>134</b> biases the damper element <b>128</b> against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> as the solenoid shaft moves, thus permitting the damper element to pivot as the solenoid is operated. When the solenoid is actuated, the solenoid shaft moves up against the core <b>142</b>, and the torsion spring <b>134</b> rotates the damper element <b>128</b> to follow the shaft <b>130</b> to establish an adjustable second position of the damper element <b>128</b>. Thus, a substantially lower second flow rate through the valve is produced when the damper element <b>128</b> is in the second open position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an alternate construction of the first embodiment of a flow valve <b>120</b>, the flow valve further comprises a stop <b>146</b> for limiting the rotation of the damper element <b>128</b> to establish the second position. When the solenoid <b>130</b> is operated, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> moves upward against the core <b>132</b>. The torsion spring <b>134</b> biases the damper element <b>128</b> against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> as the solenoid shaft moves upward, thus permitting the damper element to pivot as the solenoid is operated. An adjustable stop <b>146</b> is provided for adjustably limiting the movement of the damper element <b>128</b> to establish an adjustable second position of the damper element <b>128</b>. In this alternate construction, the adjustable stop <b>146</b> is a screw that may be adjusted to vary the maximum amount of rotation of the damper element <b>128</b>. The screw <b>146</b> may be adjusted to change the second position of the damper element <b>128</b> to vary the amount of restriction of fluid flow through the valve as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the solenoid of the first flow valve embodiment is not operated, a stop <b>132</b> establishes a travel limit for the solenoid shaft when the solenoid <b>130</b> is not being operated. When against the stop <b>132</b>, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> engages the damper element <b>128</b> for establishing a first position of the damper element <b>128</b>. A spring <b>134</b> can be utilized to bias the damper element <b>128</b> against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> in the first position. The spring <b>134</b> is a torsion spring configured to be secured to the damper element <b>128</b>, and to contact an inner surface of the flow valve <b>120</b> to bias the damper element against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b>. The flow valve <b>120</b> comprises a second spring <b>36</b> for biasing the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> to a position in engagement with the stop <b>132</b> and the damper element <b>128</b> for establishing the first position of the damper element when the solenoid is not being operated. The flow valve <b>120</b> provides for a damper element that is held in a first position that is generally parallel with the passage way <b>126</b> through the valve, such that the resulting first flow rate through the valve is substantially unaffected when the valve is in this first open position. Thus, the flow rate of about 3.5 inches of water exiting the gas valve (such as gas valve <b>450</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is substantially unaffected such that a first flow rate of 3.5 inches of water pressure is provided when the damper element is in the first position. Alternatively, the flow rate may be substantially unaffected such that the flow rate through the valve is not reduced by more than that which may be noticeably measured, such as 0.1 inches of water pressure. Unlike other throttle valves that produce a relatively low resistance to flow through the valve, the present valve does not necessitate readjustment of the gas valve pressure setting to allow for the relatively low resistance of a throttle valve. The design of this embodiment in its most open position allows the flow valve <b>120</b> to be used in combination with a gas valve, such that the flow rate is substantially unaffected and does not require any readjustment of the gas valve's outlet pressure or flow rate settings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the coil <b>138</b> is energized, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> is operated or movable in a direction towards an air gap <b>140</b> and a core <b>142</b>. When operated, the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> compresses the spring <b>136</b> as it moves to a second position against the core <b>142</b>, and movement of the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> permits movement of the damper element <b>128</b> towards the position shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The torsion spring <b>134</b> biases the damper element <b>128</b> against the solenoid shaft <b>130</b> as the solenoid shaft moves, thus permitting the damper element <b>128</b> to pivot as the solenoid is operated. The screw <b>146</b> may be adjusted to change the second position of the damper element <b>128</b> to vary the amount of restriction of fluid flow through the valve as desired. Thus, a substantially lower adjustable second flow rate through the valve is produced when the valve <b>120</b> is in this second open position. When used in combination or connection with a gas valve, this second flow rate may be adjusted to provide a flow rate in the range of 1.4 inches of water pressure to 2.9 inches of water pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a second embodiment of the present invention, a flow valve <b>220</b> is provided that comprises an inlet <b>222</b>, an outlet <b>224</b>, and a passageway <b>226</b> therebetween as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The flow valve <b>220</b> further comprises a damper element <b>228</b> that is pivotally arranged within the passageway <b>226</b>, as in the first embodiment. The flow valve <b>220</b> further comprises a solenoid shaft <b>230</b> is biased by a spring of the solenoid towards the damper element <b>228</b> to hold the damper element <b>228</b> in a first open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, in the second embodiment, the solenoid shaft <b>230</b> is generally coupled to the damper element <b>228</b>, such that the solenoid when operated causes the damper element to rotate without the biasing of the torsion spring <b>134</b>. The solenoid shaft preferably comprises a head on the end of the shaft that is configured to slidably engage an opening or slot in the damper element <b>228</b>, such that the head may engage the damper element <b>228</b> while the shaft slides through the slot in the damper element <b>228</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the second embodiment, the flow valve <b>220</b> functions exactly the same as in the first embodiment, without the torsion spring <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a third embodiment of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a flow valve <b>320</b> is provided that comprises an inlet <b>322</b>, an outlet <b>324</b>, and a passageway <b>326</b> therebetween. The flow valve <b>320</b> further comprises a damper element <b>328</b> that is pivotally arranged within the passageway <b>326</b>, as in the first embodiment. The flow valve <b>320</b> further comprises a solenoid operator or shaft <b>330</b> that when not operated engages the damper element <b>328</b> to hold the damper element <b>328</b> in a first open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the third embodiment, the damper element <b>328</b> in this first open position provides substantial resistance to the fluid flow to provide a first substantially reduced flow rate through the flow valve <b>320</b>. Thus, this embodiment of a flow valve <b>320</b> is normally in a first restricted flow rate position when the solenoid is not being actuated or operated. This first restricted flow rate is also adjustable by adjustment means <b>346</b>, which varies the resistance by adjusting the angle of the damper element <b>328</b> may pivot to. When the solenoid <b>330</b> is actuated, the solenoid shaft <b>330</b> that is coupled to the damper element <b>328</b> moves and causes the damper element <b>328</b> to rotate to a generally horizontal second open position shown by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus, this embodiment of a flow valve <b>320</b> provides a second flow rate through the valve that is substantially unaffected when the solenoid is operated to establish the second open position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the damper element <b>328</b> of the third embodiment is shown in more detail. The end portion of the solenoid operator or shaft <b>330</b> preferably comprises a tapered portion and a head <b>331</b>. The solenoid operator <b>330</b> is configured to be slidably received within an opening or space between two protruding portions <b>329</b> of the damper element <b>328</b>. When the solenoid is not energized or operated, the head <b>331</b> on the solenoid operator <b>330</b> is configured to engage and hold the damper element <b>328</b> in a first restricted flow position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the solenoid is energized, the head <b>331</b> moves upwards and engages the protruding portions <b>329</b> of the damper element <b>328</b>, to pivot or rotate to the damper element <b>328</b> to a generally horizontal second position. The flow rate through the valve is substantially unaffected when the solenoid is operated to establish the second open position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a fourth embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flow valve <b>420</b> in combination with a gas valve <b>450</b> is provided to produce at least two fluid flow rates through the gas valve <b>450</b> and flow valve <b>420</b> in accordance with the principles of the present invention. It should be noted that the flow valve <b>420</b> may comprise any one of the flow valve embodiments described herein, or other embodiments within the scope of the invention. In this embodiment of a flow valve in combination with a gas valve <b>450</b>, the inlet of the flow valve <b>420</b> is in connection with the outlet of the gas valve <b>450</b>. The inlet <b>422</b> of the flow valve <b>420</b> may comprise internal threads for receiving a threaded fitting <b>452</b>. Alternatively, the inlet comprise external threads (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>) for threadably connecting directly to the outlet of the gas valve <b>450</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The inlet could alternatively comprise a flange mount for mounting the inlet of the valve <b>400</b> directly to the outlet of a gas valve. An example of a gas valve having a threaded outlet of this type that may be utilized in combination with the flow valve <b>420</b> is a 36G03 gas valve manufactured by White-Rodgers, a Division of Emerson Electric Co. Such a valve is adjusted to have a single outlet flow rate of about 3.5 inches of water pressure when switched to an open state. Thus, the flow valve <b>420</b> in combination with the gas valve <b>450</b> permits fluid flow through both the flow valve <b>420</b> and gas valve <b>450</b> when the gas valve <b>450</b> is in an open state. Furthermore, the flow valve <b>420</b> provides for a first flow rate and at least a second substantially reduced flow rate at the outlet of the flow valve, to provide at least two stage flow through the gas valve <b>450</b> and flow valve <b>420</b> combination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an alternate construction of the fourth embodiment, the flow valve <b>420</b> may also be used in combination with a two-stage gas valve <b>450</b>′ (not shown), such as for example the 36G Gemini Two-Stage gas valve manufactured by White-Rodgers, a Division of Emerson Electric Co. In this alternate construction of the fourth embodiment, the combination of a flow valve <b>420</b> with a two-stage gas valve <b>450</b>′ can yield multiple flow rates for multi-stage firing rates in a heating application. The two stage gas valve <b>450</b>′ would be capable of producing first and second flow rates independent of and substantially unaffected by the flow valve <b>420</b> when in the first open position, to provide a first high flow rate and a second reduced flow rate. When the solenoid <b>430</b> of the flow valve <b>420</b> is operated to produce a second open position, the first and second flow rates of the gas valve will be substantially reduced to provide a third reduced flow rate and a fourth reduced flow rate. Thus, this fifth embodiment of a flow valve in combination with a two-stage gas valve provides for four flow rates, at least two of which are substantially unaffected by the flow valve <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet another alternate construction of the fourth embodiment, the solenoid operator of the flow valve may comprise a voice coil operator in place of a solenoid. The voice coil's displacement varies with the voltage applied to the voice coil, such that the displacement of operator, and the damper element, may be controlled by varying the voltage to the voice coil. The use of a voice coil in any of the prior disclosed embodiments would allow for variably displacing the damper element in numerous positions between the first position and the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A fifth embodiment of a variable flow rate valve in accordance with the principles of the present invention is generally shown as <b>520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The flow valve <b>520</b> has an inlet <b>522</b>, an outlet <b>524</b>, and a passage way <b>526</b> therethrough. The flow valve <b>520</b> further comprises a damper element <b>528</b> pivotally arranged within the passageway <b>526</b> that is movable between a first maximum open position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially unaffected by the damper element <b>528</b>, and a second minimum position in which fluid flow through the passageway is substantially reduced by the damper element <b>528</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment of a variable flow rate valve, a displacement device <b>532</b> having a movable operator or shaft <b>530</b> is provided for engaging the damper element <b>528</b>. The valve may further comprise a spring for biasing the damper element <b>528</b> against the operator <b>530</b>. The displacement device in this embodiment is preferably a stepper motor that is capable of extending or retracting the operator <b>530</b> to a number of variable displacement positions. The stepper motor <b>532</b> when operated to fully retract the operator <b>530</b> permits movement of the damper element <b>528</b> to its first maximum “open” position shown as a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When the operator <b>530</b> is fully extended by the stepper motor, the operator <b>530</b> establishes a minimum or substantially restricted flow position of the damper element <b>528</b>. Where a spring for biasing the damper element <b>528</b> against the operator <b>530</b> is used, such a spring may be a torsion spring. The torsion spring may be configured to secure the damper element <b>528</b>, and to contact an inner surface of the flow valve <b>520</b> to bias the damper element against the operator <b>530</b>. The damper element of the flow valve <b>520</b> includes a first maximum position that is generally parallel with the passage way <b>526</b> through the valve, such that the resulting first flow rate through the valve is substantially unaffected when the valve is in this first open position. Thus, the flow rate (at about 3.5 inches of water) exiting a gas valve in connection with the flow valve <b>520</b> is substantially unaffected by the flow valve <b>520</b>, such that a first flow rate at about 3.5 inches of water pressure is provided when the damper element is in the first position. Alternatively, the flow rate may be substantially unaffected such that the flow rate through the valve is not reduced by more than that which may be noticeably measured, such as 0.1 inches of water pressure. Unlike other throttle valves that produce a relatively low resistance to flow through the valve, the present valve does not necessitate readjustment of the gas valve pressure setting to allow for the relatively low resistance of a throttle valve. The design of this embodiment in its most open position allows the flow valve <b>520</b> to be used in combination with a gas valve <b>50</b>, such that the flow rate is substantially unaffected and does not require any readjustment of the gas valve's outlet pressure or flow rate settings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the stepper motor <b>532</b> of this fifth embodiment is actuated to extend the operator, the operator or shaft <b>530</b> is movable in a direction towards the position shown in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. An adjustable stop <b>546</b> is provided for adjustably limiting the movement of the damper element <b>528</b> to establish an adjustable minimum position of the damper element <b>528</b>. In this embodiment, the adjustable stop <b>546</b> is preferably a screw that may be adjusted to vary the maximum amount of rotation of the damper element <b>528</b>. The screw <b>546</b> may be adjusted to change the second position of the damper element <b>528</b> to vary the amount of restriction of fluid flow through the valve as desired. Thus, a substantially lower adjustable second flow rate through the valve is produced when the valve is in this minimum open position. The stepper motor accordingly is operable to pivotally move the damper element <b>528</b> to one or more positions between the maximum position and minimum position, to vary the fluid flow rate through the valve. When combined with a gas valve <b>550</b>, the adjustment screw may be adjusted to provide a minimum flow rate in the range of 1.4 inches of water pressure to 2.9 inches of water pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the fifth embodiment, the variable flow rate valve <b>520</b> may also be used in combination with a gas valve (not shown), such as for example the 36G Gemini gas valve manufactured by White-Rodgers, a Division of Emerson Electric Co. In this fifth embodiment, the combination of a variable output flow rate valve <b>520</b> with a gas valve can yield multiple flow rates for multi-stage firing rates in a heating application.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternate construction of the fifth embodiment, the displacement device <b>532</b> may comprise a voice coil operator in place of a stepper motor. The voice coil's displacement varies with the voltage applied to the voice coil, such that the displacement of operator <b>530</b> may be controlled by varying the voltage to the voice coil <b>532</b>. Likewise, a rotary solenoid operator could be employed to achieve the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
