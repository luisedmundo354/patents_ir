<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a plasma display panel (PDP) and, more particularly, to a composition of glass for PDP and its fabrication method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, a plasma display panel (PDP) device receives much attention as a next-generation display device together with a thin film transistor (TFT), a liquid crystal display (LCD), an EL (Electro-Luminescence) device, an FED (Field Emission Display) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The PDP is a display device using a luminescent phenomenon according to an energy difference made when red, green and blue fluorescent materials are changed from an excited state to a ground state after being excited by 147 nm of ultraviolet rays which are generated as a He+X3 gas or N3+X3 gas is discharged from a discharge cell isolated by a barrier rib.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thanks to its properties of facilitation in manufacturing from a simple structure, a high luminance, a high light emitting efficiency, a memory function, a high non-linearity, a 160Â° or more optical angular field and the like, the PDP display device is anticipated to occupy large-scale display device markets.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A structure of the conventional PDP will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing a structure of a conventional PDP.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional PDP includes: a lower insulation layer <b>20</b> formed on a lower glass substrate <b>21</b>; an address electrode <b>22</b> formed at a predetermined portion on the lower insulation layer <b>20</b>; a lower dielectric layer <b>19</b> formed on the address electrode <b>22</b> and the lower insulation layer <b>20</b>; an isolation wall <b>17</b> defined in a predetermined portion on the lower dielectric layer <b>19</b> in order to divide each discharging cell; a black matrix layer <b>23</b> formed on the isolation wall <b>17</b>; a fluorescent layer <b>18</b> formed with a predetermined thickness on the side of the black matrix layer <b>23</b> and the isolation wall <b>17</b> and on the lower dielectric layer <b>19</b>, and receiving ultraviolet ray and emitting each red, green and blue visible rays; a glass substrate <b>11</b>; a sustain electrode <b>12</b> formed at a predetermined portion on the upper glass substrate <b>11</b> in a manner of vertically intersecting the address electrode <b>22</b>; a bus electrode <b>12</b> formed on a predetermined portion on the sustain electrode <b>12</b>; an upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> formed on the bus electrode <b>13</b>, the sustain electrode <b>12</b> and the upper glass substrate <b>11</b>; and a protection layer (MgO) <b>15</b> formed on the second upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> in order to protect the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The operation of the conventional PDP will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">First, as the upper glass substrate <b>11</b> and the lower glass substrate <b>21</b> of the conventional PDP, an SLS (Soda-Lime Silicate) glass substrate is used.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lower insulation layer <b>20</b> is positioned on the lower glass substrate <b>21</b>, the SLS glass substrate, and the address electrode <b>22</b> is positioned on the lower insulation layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The lower dielectric layer <b>19</b> positioned on the address electrode <b>22</b> and the lower insulation layer <b>20</b> blocks visible rays emitted toward the lower glass substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to increase the luminous efficacy, a dielectric layer having a high reflectance is used as the lower dielectric layer <b>19</b>. The lower dielectric layer <b>19</b>, a translucent dielectric layer with a reflectance of 60% or above, minimizes loss of light.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fluorescent layer <b>18</b> is formed by laminating in a sequential order of red, green and blue phosphor materials. A specific wavelength of visible ray is emitted depending on an intensity of an ultraviolet ray according to plasma generated between the isolation walls <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Meanwhile, at a lower surface of the upper glass substrate <b>11</b>, the SLS glass substrate, there are formed the sustain electrode <b>12</b> positioned to vertically intersect the address electrode <b>22</b> and the bus electrode <b>13</b> positioned on the sustain electrode <b>12</b>. And upper dielectric layer having an excellent light transmittance is positioned on the bus electrode <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The protection layer <b>15</b> is positioned on the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> in order to prevent the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> from being damaged due to generation of plasma. Herein, since the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> is directly contacted with the sustain electrode <b>12</b> and the bus electrode <b>13</b>, it must have a high softening temperature in order to avoid a chemical reaction with the sustain electrode <b>12</b> and the bus electrode <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thereafter, as the upper plates <b>11</b>Ëœ<b>15</b> and the lower plates <b>19</b>Ëœ<b>22</b> are bonded by a seal material <b>16</b>, a PDP is completely formed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Of the formed structures, the isolation wall <b>17</b>, the lower dielectric layer <b>19</b>, the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b>, the seal material <b>16</b> are glass compositions containing a large amount of Pb.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the fabrication process of the isolation wall <b>17</b>, the lower dielectric layer <b>19</b>, the upper dielectric layer <b>14</b> and the seal material <b>16</b> may have a vital influence on a human body.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, discarding of the glass composition may cause an environmental pollution.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Especially, as the move of regulating use of materials detrimental to the human body and the environment is becoming more active worldwide, development of an unleaded dielectric materials that may substitute the dielectric of the PDP containing a large volume of Pb is actively made.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The conventional unleaded glass composition includes alkali metal-oxide to lower a softening temperature of glass, but there has been reported that movement of alkali metal ion during discharging makes a bad influence on the discharge characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an effort to solve the problem of the unleaded glass composition containing the alkali metal-oxide, an unleaded non-alkali dielectric comprising ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>â€”BaO has been proposed, which, however, has a problem that a glass structure is so unstable that a transition point of glass contained in the unleaded non-alkali dielectric is too high or a phase separation of glass occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, in order to drop the softening temperature, the amount of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is added by 60Ëœ50 wt %, but in this case, a problem arises that a cost of the dielectric material is increased due to the high-priced Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and a luminous efficacy is degraded as a discharge current is increased due to the high electric pemittivity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Other conventional PDPs and their fabrication methods are disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,838,106 issued on Nov. 17, 1998, a U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,859 issued on Jun. 5, 2001, and a U.S. Pat. No. 6,599,851 issued on Jul. 29, 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As stated above, the glass composition used for the PDP in accordance with the conventional art has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">That is, first, the glass composition includes a large amount of Pb which is critical to the human body and the environment, and the unleaded glass composition adopting the alkali metal-oxide intended not to use Pb has such degraded discharge characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Second, the glass composition having ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>â€”BaO as a primary component, which is proposed as an unleaded non-alkali dielectric has a high softening temperature, causes a phase separation, and has an unstable glass structure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Third, since the large amount of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is contained in the glass composition to lower the softening temperature, the fabrication cost of the glass composition is increased, and the electric permittivity of glass is so high that the luminous efficacy is degraded.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Therefore, one object of the present invention is to provide a glass composition of a plasma display panel (PDP) which is environment-friendly, has a high discharge efficiency and is used as various PDP dielectric materials, and its fabrication method.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A glass composition for a PDP and its fabrication method, by which a ZnO-B<b>2</b>O3 group and alkaline earth metal oxide are composed to be environment-friendly, to have a high discharge efficiency and to be used for various PDP dielectric materials, said glass composition being a low melting point unleaded non-alkali glass composition which can be formed at a low cost, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the glass composition, the low melting point unleaded non-alkali glass composition, in accordance with the present invention can be used for an isolation wall, a lower dielectric layer, an upper dielectric layer and a seal material of a PDP, with a high discharge efficiency, and can be fabricated at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The glass composition of the present invention contains 10Ëœ40 mol % of ZnO, 10Ëœ40 mol % of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and 10Ëœ25 mol % of alkaline earth metal oxide (RO) (BaO, SrO, CaO and MgO) as primary components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, in order to lower the glass transition point, a small amount of, that is, 1Ëœ15 mol %, comparatively high-priced Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is added. A small amount of additive (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>) in the range of 0Ëœ10 mol % is added to heighten a glass durability and prevent crystallization.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>group, alkaline earth metal oxide, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and additives will now be described in sequence. The ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>group and the alkaline earth metal oxide are essential elements of the glass composition of the present invention, and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and additives can be contained in or excluded from the glass composition.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">ZnO and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention uses ZnO and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the primary component used for forming unleaded non-alkali dielectric as in the conventional art, but an addition ratio of ZnO and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is limited. That is, in the present invention, the ratio of Zn and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is limited to be 0.5Ëœ1.5. The reason is because if B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is excessively added in the glass composition, a glass transition point rises too high while if ZnO is excessively added in the glass composition, the glass composition would be easily crystallized. Preferably, ZnO and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>are added by 10Ëœ40 mol %, respectively, to the glass composition.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Alkaline-Earth Metal Oxide</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to lower the transition point, 10Ëœ25 mol % of alkaline-earth metal oxide (RO) is added to the glass composition. Preferably, the alkaline-earth metal oxide can be BaO, SrO, CaO, MgO, or their mixture. BaO is the most effective to lower the transition point, and SrO, CaO and MgO in sequential order. However, if the alkaline-earth metal oxide is excessively added to the glass composition, a thermal expansion coefficient is increased, and especially, if MgO is excessively added to the glass composition, crystallization would be easily made. Therefore, it is preferred that one of BaO, SrO, CaO and MgO or their mixture is added by 10Ëœ25% to the glass composition.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to lower the glass transition point, a small amount of, that is, 1Ëœ15 mol %, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is added to the glass composition. Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is limited in the range of about 1Ëœ15 mol % to restrain increasing of the dielectric constant (that is, permittivity). For example, if Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is added beyond the range limited in the present invention to the glass composition and then used as an upper dielectric of the PDP, the dielectric constant of the upper dielectric would increase, resulting in that a luminous efficacy would decrease due to the increase in the discharge current.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring back to the conventional art, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>has a high percentage, accounting for 60Ëœ80 wt % of overall glass composition, so such a big problem arises that the dielectric constant as well as its cost increases. However, compared to the conventional art, in the present invention, the use amount of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is considerably reduced to restrain increase of the dielectric constant, whereby the luminous efficacy can be improved and at the same time a fabrication cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Additive</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The additive adopted for the glass composition of the present invention includes La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>serves to enhance a glass durability and lower a thermal expansion coefficient, and especially, it helps prevent crystallization of glass.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">SiO<sub>2 </sub>increases a mechanical strength and lowers the thermal expansion coefficient, but too much addition of SiO<sub>2 </sub>would increase the glass transition point, so only a small amount of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, one of the additives or their mixture is added by 0Ëœ10 mol % to the glass composition.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Characteristics of the unleaded dielectric made of the glass composition for a PDP in accordance with the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a table showing a result of measurement of glass compositions after forming composition ratios of glass compositions for a PDP through seven embodiments in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is noted that the result of measurement of glass compositions according to each embodiment shows that characteristics of the glass composition of the present invention is suitable for the glass composition for a PDP.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">There can be various methods for forming glass compositions with components according to each embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the present invention, after glass powder is formed with components according to each embodiment, the glass powder is coated as a thin film on a SLS (Soda-Lime Silicate) glass substrate by a screen printing method, and then, the coated thin film is fired to form an unleaded upper dielectric. The result shows measurement of the characteristics of the upper dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, transition pints of unleaded upper dielectrics formed according to each embodiment are in the range of 480Â° C.Ëœ550Â° C., thermal expansion coefficients are 70Ëœ95Ã—10âˆ’7/Â° C., and dielectric constants are 8Ëœ13, which confirm that the unleaded upper dielectrics exhibit excellent characteristics as a dielectric material of the PDP. Herein, the transition point and the thermal expansion coefficient, the characteristics of the unleaded upper dielectrics formed according to each embodiment, were measured by processing the unleaded upper dielectric to 10 mmÃ—1 mmÃ—1 mm and measuring the processed unleaded upper dielectric with an equipment of Netzsch TMA 402, and the thermal expansion coefficient was obtained in the temperature range of 50Â° C.Ëœ350Â° C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A method for preparing the glass composition for a PDP and a method for fabricating the unleaded dielectric by using the glass composition will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The method for preparing the glass composition for a PDP includes: mixing 10Ëœ50 mol % of ZnO, 10Ëœ40 mol % of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 10Ëœ25 mol % of alkaline earth metal oxide and 15 mol % or less Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; and melting the mixture at a high temperature, quenching the melted component to form a glass flake, and milling the glass flake to form unleaded non-alkali glass powder. The ratio of ZnO and B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is 0.5Ëœ1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">First, components according to each embodiment are weighed as much as a pre-set amount and mixed, the mixture is put in a platinum crucible and melt at 1000Â° C.Ëœ1300Â° C. in an electric furnace for 1Ëœ2 hours, and then the melted component is quenched to form a glass flake.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The glass flake is milled with a ball mill to crush fine to create glass powder. As the milling process for forming the glass powder, a dry milling process and a wet milling process are all available, and preferably, the dry milling process is used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, when the glass powder is formed by the wet milling process, hydroxy (OH) group is adsorbed to the finely crushed glass surface, so that when a thin film is fired, air bubbles are formed in the thin film. That is, when the thin film formed through the wet milling process is fabricated to an upper dielectric, a transmittivity of the upper dielectric is degraded. Therefore, the glass powder is preferably formed through the dry milling process, and an average particle diameter of the mile glass powder is preferably 1Ëœ4 Î¼m.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thereafter, the milled glass powder is mixed in an organic vehicle consisting of a solvent (e.g., butyl carbitol acetate, butyl carbitol), a binder (e.g., ethyl cellulose) and a plasticizer (e.g., dibutyl phthalate (DBP)) to form a paste, the paste is coated as a thin film on the SLS glass substrate by a screen printing method, the coated thin film is dried at a temperature of 120Â° C., and then fired at 560Â° C. 590Â° C. for 10Ëœ30 minutes, thereby forming an unleaded upper dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the present invention, after the glass composition is made to the paste, the paste is fabricated to the unleaded upper dielectric for a PDP through the printing process, but the unleaded upper dielectric can be formed in various ways such as a green sheet laminating, die coater, doctor blade, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Especially, when forming the isolation wall by using the glass composition in accordance with the present invention, the isolation wall can be formed through a photosensitivity paste method, a press molding method and a rift-off method.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The transmittivity curves of the unleaded of the unleaded non-alkali upper dielectrics formed with a thickness of 30 Î¼m on the 2.7 mm SLS glass substrate according to each embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing a transmittivity of an unleaded non-alkali upper dielectric layer formed with the glass composition in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this drawing, the transmittivity of the unleaded non-alkali upper dielectric layer is 75% or more of the overall visible ray region, and the transmittivity curve confirms that the glass compositions according to the embodiments of the present invention are suitable for the transparent dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a transmittivity curve of the unleaded non-alkali upper dielectric layer in accordance with the fourth, fifth and seventh embodiments of the present invention, from which it is noted that the each transmittivity of the dielectric layers of the fourth, fifth and seventh embodiments is excellent compared to the other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each glass composition according to each embodiment can be made to glass powder through a dry milling process after melting and quenching process, so that the glass composition can be easily applied to various processes and used as an isolation wall of the PDP, an upper dielectric layer, a lower dielectric layer, a seal material, and the like. Especially, mixing the glass composition to a ceramic filler (TiO<sub>2 </sub>or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) can form the unleaded non-alkali isolation wall dielectric or unleaded non-alkali lower dielectric, whereby all the dielectric materials for a PDP can be made to unleaded and non-alkali.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In fabricating the upper dielectric layer by using the unleaded non-alkali glass composition as a dielectric material, the thickness of the upper dielectric layer is preferably 25Ëœ40 Î¼m.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In fabricating the lower dielectric layer by using the unleaded non-alkali glass composition as a dielectric material, the thickness of the upper dielectric layer is preferably 15Ëœ25 Î¼m.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In forming the isolation wall by using the unleaded non-alkali glass composition as a dielectric material, the thickness of the upper dielectric layer is preferably 80Ëœ200 Î¼m.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The thickness of each composition of the PDP can be suitably adjusted within the range proposed through the transition point, the thermal expansion coefficient, the dielectric constant, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, as known from the experiment results of the embodiments of the various glass compositions, the low melting point unleaded non-alkali glass composition without containing Pb and alkali oxide can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As so far described, a composition of glass for PDP and its fabrication method of the present invention have the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">That is, first, by composing the ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>group and alkaline earth metal oxide, an environment-friendly glass composition can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Second, the glass composition comprising the ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>group and alkaline earth metal oxide can be used as various PDP dielectric materials. The dielectric formed with the glass composition exhibits an improved discharge efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Third, by composing the ZnOâ€”B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>group and alkaline earth metal oxide, the low melting point unleaded non-alkali glass composition can be fabricated at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.</p>
