<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention substantially relates to a method of segmenting a wafer, and more particularly, to a method that allows automatic wafer expansion and wafer sorting after dicing the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the fabrication of semiconductor chips or MEMS chips, a wafer is first treated with tens or more than hundreds of processes to form a plurality of semiconductor devices or MEMS devices. The wafer is subsequently diced by a dicing process to form a plurality of dies. The dies are thereafter packaged so as to form a plurality of chips able to be electrically connected to printed circuit boards.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a schematic diagram illustrating a conventional method of performing a dicing process with a dicing apparatus. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wafer <b>10</b> to undergo a dicing process is bonded to a bonding layer <b>12</b>, such as a tape. The bonding layer <b>12</b> meanwhile is bonded to a supporting frame <b>14</b> so as to fasten the position of the wafer <b>10</b>. When the wafer <b>10</b> is accurately aligned in the dicing apparatus, a cutter <b>16</b> is exploited through predetermined scribe lines to segment the wafer <b>10</b> into a plurality of dies <b>18</b>. Selectively, a wafer expansion process can be performed according to the dimension of the scribe lines by expanding the bonding layer <b>12</b>, so as to enlarge the gap between two adjacent dies <b>18</b> for the convenience of a further wafer sorting process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above method is the most common way to dice the wafer <b>10</b>. However, since the width of the cutter <b>16</b> is no longer ignorable as the critical dimension of semiconductor processes decreases and the improvement of wafer integration, the dicing process using the cutter <b>16</b> is no longer able to dice a wafer with high integration. Therefore, a dicing process by way of etching is another choice.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a conventional method of performing a dicing process in an etching manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a wafer <b>30</b>, having a photoresist pattern <b>36</b> disposed thereon for defining scribe lines, is bonded to a carrier <b>34</b> with a bonding layer <b>32</b>. Then, an anisotropic etching process is performed to etch the wafer <b>30</b> uncovered by the photoresist pattern <b>36</b> until the wafer <b>30</b> is etched through so as to form a plurality of dies <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above method is able to reduce the dimension of the scribe lines so as to increase the amounts of dies <b>30</b> arranged in the wafer. However, due to the narrowness of the scribe lines, the wafer sorting process cannot be easily performed after the dicing process. In addition, since the carrier <b>34</b>, such as a bare wafer, is a rigid structure, the wafer expansion process in which the bonding layer <b>32</b> is extended to increase the gap of the dies <b>38</b> cannot be carried out. In such a case, the photoresist pattern <b>36</b> is removed in advance, and then the bonding layer <b>32</b> is removed to separate the dies <b>38</b> from the carrier <b>34</b>. Following that, the dies <b>38</b> are picked up and sorted manually. Accordingly, the throughput is reduced and the dies <b>38</b> may be damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore a primary object of the claimed invention to provide a method of segmenting a wafer to overcome the aforementioned problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating a method of segmenting a wafer according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a device wafer <b>50</b> including a substrate layer <b>52</b>, an insulating layer <b>54</b>, and a device layer <b>56</b> disposed from bottom to top is provided. The device layer <b>56</b> includes a plurality of devices (not shown) to be diced. In this embodiment, the device wafer <b>50</b> is an SOI wafer, but not limited to. The device wafer <b>50</b> can also be a silicon wafer or other semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first mask pattern <b>58</b> is formed on the surface of the device layer <b>56</b>. The first mask pattern <b>58</b> includes a plurality of first openings <b>60</b> that partially expose the surface of the device layer <b>56</b>. The first mask pattern <b>58</b> can be a photoresist pattern or other materials normally adopted as a hard mask. The first openings <b>60</b> expose predetermined scribe lines of the device wafer <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an anisotropic etching process, e.g. a plasma etching process, is performed to remove the device layer <b>56</b> and the insulating layer <b>54</b> not protected by the first mask pattern <b>58</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first mask pattern <b>58</b> is then removed, and a medium layer <b>62</b> is formed on the surface of the device layer <b>56</b>. The medium layer <b>62</b> serves as a medium for fastening the device wafer <b>50</b> on a carrier wafer (not shown), and also functions to protect the device wafer <b>50</b>. The medium layer <b>62</b> must to be removed later, and thus a material able to be removed easily is required. In this embodiment, the medium layer <b>62</b> is selected from Benzocyclobutene (BCB), polyimide, epoxy, photoresist, and dry film that can be formed on the surface of the device layer <b>56</b> by either coating or sticking. Also, the material and forming method of the medium layer <b>62</b> is not limited to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the medium layer <b>62</b> is then bonded to a carrier wafer <b>66</b> with a bonding layer <b>64</b> so as to fasten the device wafer <b>50</b> on the carrier wafer <b>66</b>. In this embodiment, the bonding layer <b>64</b> is a thermal release tape or UV tape, but not limited to. The thermal release tape can be removed by heating, and the UV tape can be removed by UV irradiation. The bonding layer <b>64</b> can also be other material as long as the material can be easily removed without causing damage to the device layer <b>56</b> and the medium layer <b>62</b>. The carrier wafer <b>66</b> can be a semiconductor wafer, a glass wafer, a quartz wafer, etc. It is to be noted that if UV tape is adopted as the bonding layer <b>64</b>, the carrier wafer <b>66</b> must be a transparent wafer such as a glass wafer or a quartz wafer. In addition, a wafer thinning process can be selectively performed to reduce the thickness of the substrate layer <b>52</b> wherever necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a second mask pattern <b>68</b> is formed on the surface of the substrate layer <b>52</b>. The second mask pattern <b>68</b> includes a plurality of second openings <b>70</b> corresponding to the first openings (not shown). The second mask pattern <b>68</b> can be a photoresist pattern or other materials normally adopted as a hard mask. In addition, the pattern layout of the second mask pattern <b>68</b> can be modified if different devices are formed in the device layer <b>56</b>. For instance, if the devices to be diced are piezoresistor sensor devices, the second mask pattern <b>68</b> further includes third openings <b>72</b> so as to form stand (supporter) of the piezoresistor sensor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an anisotropic etching process, e.g. a plasma etching process, is performed to remove the substrate layer <b>52</b> not covered by second mask pattern <b>68</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second mask pattern <b>68</b> is then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the bonding layer <b>64</b> is removed so as to separate the medium layer <b>62</b> from the carrier wafer <b>66</b>. If the bonding layer <b>64</b> is a thermal release tape, separation of the medium layer <b>62</b> and the carrier wafer <b>66</b> is carried out by raising the temperature to over the separation temperature of the thermal release tape. If the bonding layer <b>64</b> is a UV tape, separation of the medium layer <b>62</b> and the carrier wafer <b>66</b> is implemented by UV irradiation from bottom of the carrier wafer <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the substrate layer <b>52</b> is then bonded to an extendable film <b>74</b> that is fastened on a supporting frame <b>76</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the medium layer <b>62</b> is removed from the surface of the device layer <b>56</b>. The medium layer <b>62</b> can be removed in different manners. For diminishing possibility of particle problems, a dry clean process, e.g. an oxygen plasma clean process or a supercritical carbon dioxide clean process, is preferred. Accordingly, while the substrate layer <b>52</b> is bonded to the extendable film <b>74</b>, automatic wafer expansion and wafer sorting process can be directly performed by extending the extendable film <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method of segmenting a wafer according to the present invention utilizes a medium layer to bond the device wafer to a carrier wafer. Subsequently, an anisotropic etching process is performed from the substrate layer, and the device wafer is then bonded to an extendable film. Consequently, automatic wafer expansion and wafer sorting process can be directly performed. In addition, the medium layer is removed by a dry clean process in such a manner that the device layer is not contaminated and the extendable film is not damaged. For some MEMS devices, e.g. pressure sensor devices, IR sensor devices, and MEMS microphone devices, the suspended structure of these devices can be easily fabricated in the anisotropic etching process from the substrate layer. On the contrary, the wafer expansion process according to the conventional method has to be implemented manually. Consequently, production yield is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.</p>
