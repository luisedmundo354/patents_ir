<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicones of various structures are well known as ingredients of rinse conditioners to endow softness to fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. 2002/0147128 discloses stable, aqueous fabric softening compositions which comprise selected polyalkyleneoxy polysiloxanes. The compositions may contain various further optional ingredients. These optional ingredients include perfumes and various selected fabric care polysaccharides.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,059 discloses a conditioning shampoo composition for hair and/or skin which comprises a stable microemulsion of a high viscosity, slightly cross-linked silicone with a particle size of &lt;0.15 microns, in combination with a cationic deposition polymer and a surfactant. The cationic deposition polymer is preferably selected from the group consisting of cationic guar gum derivatives and cationic polyacrylamides.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 03/028682 discloses shampoo compositions having from about 5 to about 50 weight percent of a detersive surfactant, at least about 0.1 weight percent of non-platelet particles having a particle size of at least 0.1 micron, at least about 0.05 weight percent of a deposition aid, from 0 to about 2.5 weight percent silicone, and at least about 20 weight percent of an aqueous carrier. The deposition aid is preferably a cationic polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Our UK patent application no. 0121148.1, unpublished at the priority date of this invention, describes and claims a substituted Î²<sub>1-4 </sub>linked polysaccharide having covalently bonded on the polysaccharide moiety thereof, at least one deposition enhancing group which undergoes a chemical change in water at a use temperature to increase the affinity of the substituted polysaccharide to a substrate, the substituted polysaccharide further comprising one or more independently selected silicone chains. The polysaccharide acts as a vehicle to deposit the silicone chains bound to it, onto the fabric, from a wash liquor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Our UK patent application no. 0123380.8, also unpublished at the priority date of this invention discloses that such substituted polysaccharides can be incorporated in compositions containing a silicone, per se to enhance deposition of the free silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, our UK patent application no. 0228216.8, also unpublished at the priority date of this invention, discloses that perfume can be incorporated into the silicone component of compositions containing such polysaccharides and silicones, in order to enhance deposition of the perfume onto fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many silicones that give beneficial fabric softening do not deposit well from detergent compositions because they are too viscous to from a suitable emulsion. This means that the benefit that would be derived from the efficient deposition of such viscous silicones cannot be harnessed from detergent compositions. Therefore, it is often the practice to use a silicone oil or mixture of silicone oils with a low viscosity, e.g. in the range of from 200 to 5,500 mPas. This makes the silicone easier to emulsify and deposit onto fabric. However, we have now found that by modifying the viscosity of viscous silicones that are conventionally too viscous to deposit well onto fabrics from detergent compositions, by the use of a viscosity modifying agent, surprisingly, the deposition of the viscous silicone onto fabrics is greatly improved from detergent compositions.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A fifth aspect of the present invention provides a use of a laundry treatment composition according to the first aspect of the invention to enhance the softening benefit of a laundry treatment composition on a substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present invention, a viscosity modifying agent comprising one or more low viscosity components must be dispersed or dissolved in the silicone. Preferably, it is dissolved.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">The Viscosity Modifying Agent</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The viscosity modifying agent can be any suitable substance which can be mixed with the silicone such that the viscosity of the resulting silicone/viscosity modifying agent mixture is modified compared to that of the initial silicone. The viscosity modifying agent can be a viscosity lowering agent or a viscosity increasing agent. The viscosity modifying agent is preferably a viscosity lowering agent. The viscosity modifying agent is preferably intimately mixed with the silicone. It is further preferred that the viscosity modifying agent is uniformly mixed with the silicone. Preferably, the viscosity modifying agent is at least partially soluble in the silicone, more preferably it is substantially or fully soluble in the silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The viscosity modifying agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of a volatile silicone, a perfume, an organic solvent and a low viscosity silicone, more preferably from the group consisting of volatile silicone and perfume, and most preferably, the viscosity modifying agent is a volatile silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The viscosity modifying agent does not have to deliver a softening benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Viscosity modifying agents according to the invention are particularly useful where a softening silicone has a viscosity above 5,000 mPas or above 5,500 mPas.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The amount of viscosity modifying agent is preferably from 5% to 40%, more preferably from 10% to 30% by weight of the silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Suitable volatile silicones include dimethyl, methyl (aminoethylaminoisobutyl) siloxane, typically having a viscosity of from 100 mPas to 200 mPas with an average amine content of ca. 2 mol %. A specific example is DC245 ex Dow Corning.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Perfumes, especially those used in laundry treatment products, consist of at least one but usually a mixture of a plurality of fragrances of natural and/or synthetic origin dispersed, or more usually dissolved in a vehicle or carrier. The vehicle or carrier may be aqueous (i.e. water or water plus one or more water-miscible solvents) or it may consist solely of one or more organic solvents which may or may not be water-miscible, even though water is substantially absent. It is preferred for the vehicle or carrier to be dissolved or dispersed in the silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Any suitable organic solvent may be used as a viscosity modifying agent in the present invention. Examples include isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and hexane.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Suitable low viscosity silicones include silicone oils or mixture of silicone oils with a low viscosity, eg in the range of from 200 to 5,500 mPas, for example from 200 to 5,000 mPas. A preferred example is Hydrosoft ex-Rhodia, an amino silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Mixtures of the one or more types of viscosity modifying agents may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dissolved and/or dispersed viscosity modifying agent is preferably present in a weight ratio of from 1:10,000 to 1:5, preferably from 1:1,000 to 1:10 relative to the silicone.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Viscosity Modifying Agent Processing</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The viscosity modifying agent may be admixed with all or part of the silicone prior to incorporation in the composition as a whole (whether that composition is a component of a laundry treatment composition per se). The step of admixture may be carried out in any suitable apparatus such as a high shear mixer. The amount of viscosity modifying agent is preferably incorporated in a weight ratio to the final silicone content of the composition of from 1:1,000 to 2:1, more preferably from 1:100 to 1:5, especially from 1:50 to 1:10.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">The Silicone</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein reference to a silicone in which a viscosity modifying agent is dispersed or dissolved therein includes both a single liquid silicone compound or a mixture of two or more different liquid silicone compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Silicones are conventionally incorporated in laundry treatment (e.g. wash or rinse) compositions to endow antifoam, fabric softening, ease of ironing, anti-crease and other benefits. Any type of silicone can be used to impart the lubricating property of the present invention however, some silicones and mixtures of silicones are more preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Typical inclusion levels are from 0.01% to 25%, preferably from 0.1% to 5% of silicone by weight of the total composition.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Suitable silicones include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0032">non-volatile silicone fluids, such as poly(di)alkyl siloxanes, especially polydimethyl siloxanes and carboxylated or ethoxylated varients. They may be branched, partially cross-linked or preferably linear.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0033">aminosilicones, comprising any organosilicone having amine functionality for example as disclosed in EP-A-459 821, EP-A459 822 and WO 02/29152. They may be branched, partially cross-linked or preferably linear.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0034">any organosilicone of formula H-SXC where SXC is any such group hereinafter defined, and derivatives thereof.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0035">reactive silicones and phenyl silicones</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The choice of molecular weight of the silicones is mainly determined by processability factors. However, the molecular weight of silicones is usually indicated by reference to the viscosity of the material. Preferably, the silicones are liquid and typically have a viscosity in the range 5,000 mPas to 300,000 mPas. Suitable silicones include and, for example, Rhodorsil Oil 21645, Rhodorsil Oil Extrasoft and Wacker Finish 1300. These viscosities are typically measured at 21 s<sup>â1</sup>, as are other viscosities referred to herein, unless specifically indicated to the contrary.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">More specifically, materials such as polyalkyl or polyaryl silicones with the following structure can be used:</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="16.34mm" wi="35.73mm" file="US07297672-20071120-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>

However, compositions of the invention may also constitute a component for a laundry treatment composition. A composition which is a component for a laundry treatment composition is one which is incorporated in the laundry treatment composition during manufacture of the latter.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0080">Compositions consisting only of, or mainly of (e.g. up to 95% by weight of that composition) the silicone and dissolved or dispersed viscosity modifying agent, and optionally a suitable vehicle or carrier where the viscosity modifying agent is a perfume, may be incorporated in a laundry treatment composition. Generally these compositions also comprise a deposition aid for the silicone and the dissolved or dispersed viscosity modifying agent. Alternatively, or additionally, such a deposition aid may be separately incorporated in the laundry treatment composition.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0081">A preferred deposition aid comprises a polymeric material comprising one or more moieties for enhancing affinity for a fabric, especially for cotton or a cotton-containing fabric and one or more silicone moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0082">One preferred class of deposition aids are substituted polysaccharides. These are described further hereinbelow.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0085">The emulsion must contain another liquid component as well as the silicone with dispersed or dissolved silicone component, preferably a polar solvent, such as water. The emulsion has typically 30 to 99.9%, preferably 40 to 99% of the other liquid component (eg water). Low water emulsions may be for example 30 to 60% water, preferably 40 to 55% water. High water emulsions may be for example 60 to 99.9% water, preferably 80 to 99% water. Moderate water emulsions may be for example 55 to 80% water.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0086">The emulsion may contain an emulsifying agent, preferably an emulsifying surfactant for the silicone with dispersed or dissolved viscosity modifying agent and polysaccharide. The emulsifying agent is especially one or more surfactants, for example, selected from any class, sub class or specific surfactant(s) disclosed herein in any context. The emulsifying agent most preferably comprises or consists of a non-ionic surfactant. Additionally or alternatively, one or more selected additional surfactants from anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants may be incorporated in or used as the emulsifiying agent.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0087">Suitable non-ionic surfactants include the (poly)alkoxylated analogues of saturated or unsaturated fatty alcohols, for example, having from 8 to 22, preferably from 9 to 18, more preferably from 10 to 15 carbon atoms on average in the hydrocarbon chain thereof and preferably on average from 3 to 11, more preferably from 4 to 9 alkyleneoxy groups.

<p id="p-0076" num="0096">Whether in a composition of a component (especially an emulsion) to be incorporated in a laundry treatment composition or in a laundry treatment composition as a whole, the weight ratio of silicone to the deposition aid is preferably from 1:1 to 100:1, more preferably from 5:1 to 20:1. The weight ratio of deposition aid to emulsifying agent is from 1:2 to 100:1, preferably 2:1 to 10:1. Further, in any such composition (especially emulsion components) the weight ratio of silicone with dissolved or dispersed viscosity modifying agent to emulsifying agent is from 100:1 to 2:1, preferably from 100:3 to 5:1, more preferably from 15:1 to 7:1.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Emulsion Processing</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0098">When in the form of an emulsion, the emulsion is prepared by mixing the silicone with dissolved or dispersed viscosity modifying agent deposition aid, other liquid component, e.g. water and preferably, also an emulsifying agent, such as a surfactant, especially a non-ionic surfactant, e.g. in a high shear mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0099">Whether or not pre-emulsified, the silicone with dissolved or dispersed viscosity modifying agent and the deposition aid may be incorporated by admixture with other components of a laundry treatment composition. Preferably, the emulsion is present at a level of from 0.0001 to 40%, more preferably from 0.001 to 30%, even more preferably from 0.1 to 20%, especially from 1 to 15% and for example from 5 to 10% by weight of the total composition.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Substituted Polysaccharides</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0101">A preferred deposition aid, whether a laundry treatment composition or a component therefore, is a substituted polysaccharide.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0102">The substituted polysaccharide is preferably water-soluble or water-dispersible in nature and comprises a polysaccharide substituted with at least one silicone moiety attached to the polysaccharide aid by a hydrolytically stable bond.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0103">In such a substituted polysaccharide, the silicone chain is preferably attached to the polysaccharide by a covalent stable bond. That means that the bonding of the silicone should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo hydrolysis in the environment of the treatment process for the duration of that process. For example, in laundry cleaning applications, the substituted polysaccharide should be sufficiently stable so that the bond between the silicone and polysaccharide does not undergo hydrolysis in the wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the silicone has been deposited onto the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0104">Preferably, the bond between the silicone and the polysaccharide is such that the decay rate constant (k<sub>d</sub>) of the material in an aqueous solution at 0.01 wt % of the material together with 0.1 wt % of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 40Â° C. at a pH of 10.5 is such that k<sub>d</sub>&lt;10<sup>â3</sup>s<sup>â1</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0105">By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0106">By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0107">By an increase in the affinity of the substituted polysaccharide for a substrate such as a textile fabric upon a chemical change, what is meant is that at some time during the treatment process, the amount of material that has been deposited is greater when the chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of chemical change.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0108">Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorption, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">The Polysaccharide Part</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0109">The polysaccharide is preferably Î²<sub>1-4 </sub>linked and is a cellulose, a cellulose derivative, or another Î²-<sub>1,4</sub>-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as mannan and glucomannan.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0110">Preferably, the polysaccharide has only Î²<sub>1-4 </sub>linkages. Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the Î²<sub>1-4 </sub>linkages, such as Î²<sub>1-3 </sub>linkages. Thus, optionally some other linkages are present. Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0111">The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are therefore not in themselves counted in determining the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0112">A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups. In the substituted polysaccharides of the present invention, at least some of these hydroxyl groups are independently substituted by, or replaced with, one or more other substituents, at least one being a silicone chain. The âaverage degree of substitutionâ for a given class of substituent means the average number of substituents of that class per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">The Deposition Enhancing Group(s)</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0113">A deposition enhancing group is a group which undergoes a chemical change in use, and is attached to the polysaccharide agent group by means of a covalent stable bond. This chemical change results in an increase of the affinity of the material for the substrate and is referred to further below.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0114">The chemical change which causes the increased substrate affinity is preferably caused by hydrolysis, perhydrolysis or bond-cleavage, optionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst. Hydrolysis of substituent ester-linked groups is typical.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0115">By ester linkage is meant that the hydrogen of an âOH group has been replaced by a substituent such as Râ²âCOâ, Râ²SO<sub>2</sub>â etc to form a carboxylic acid ester, sulphonic acid ester (as appropriate) etc together with the remnant oxygen attached to the saccharide ring. In some cases, the group Râ² may for example contain a heteroatom, e.g. as an âNHâ group attached to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage. However, the term ester linkage is still to be construed as encompassing these structures.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0116">The average degree of substitution of these pendant groups which undergo the chemical change is preferably from 0.1 to 3 (e.g. from 0.3 to 3), more preferably from 0.1 to 1 (e.g. from 0.3 to 1)</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">The Silicone Chain(s)</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0127">any remaining R groups being selected from hydrogen and other substituents.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0128">For the avoidance of doubt, as already mentioned, in formula (I), some of the R groups may optionally have one or more structures, for example as hereinbefore described. For example, one or more R groups may simply be hydrogen or an alkyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0129">Preferred groups which undergo the chemical change may for example be independently selected from one or more of acetate, propanoate, trifluroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate cinnamate, formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate, gluconate, methanesulphonate, toluene, sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, aspartic, glutamic, and malic acids.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0130">Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate, hemisuccinate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propanoate. The term âmonoacetateâ is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of 1 or less on a cellulose or other Î²-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0131">Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30Â° C. and in any case below 50Â° C. When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160). Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate. Glycollic and lactic ester are most common.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0132">Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose chloracetate (GB-A-320 842) by treating 100 parts with 32 parts of NaOH in alcohol added in small portions.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0133">An alternative method of preparing cellulose esters consists in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher ionisation constant (FR-A-702 116). The ester is heated at about 100Â° C. with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester. By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate. A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also. As an example cellulose acetate (10 g.) in dioxan (75 ml.) containing oxalic acid (10 g.) is heated at 100Â° C. for 2 hours under reflux.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0134">Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, e.g. the acetate, is dissolved in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid (1.82Ã10<sup>â5</sup>). With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used. If a mixed cellulose ester is treated with an acid this should have an ionisation constant greater than that of either of the acids already in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0135">A cellulose acetate-lactate-pyruvate is prepared from cellulose acetate, 40 percent. acetyl (100 g.), in a bath of 125 ml. pyruvic acid and 125 ml. of 85 percent. lactic acid by heating at 100Â° C. for 18 hours. The product is soluble in water and is precipitated and washed with ether-acetone. M.p. 230-250Â° C.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0136">In the case of those materials having a cellulose backbone and pendant ester groups, without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, the inventors have conjectured that the mechanism of deposition is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0137">Cellulose is substantially insoluble in water. Attachment of the ester groups to make a cellulose derivative causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain or chains, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility. In the treatment liquor, the ester groups are hydrolysed, causing the cellulose derivative to increase its affinity for the substrate, e.g. the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0138">In the case when solubilising groups are attached to the polysaccharide, this is typically via covalent bonding and, may be pendant upon the backbone or incorporated therein. The type of solubilising group may alter according to where the group is positioned with respect to the backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0139">In this specification the ânâ subscript used in the general formulae of the substituted polysaccharide is a generic reference to a polymer. Although ânâ can also mean the actual (average) number of repeat units present in the polysaccharide, it is more meaningful to refer to ânâ by the number average molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0140">The number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of the substituted polysaccharide part may typically be in the range of 1,000 to 200,000, for example 2,000 to 100,000, e.g. as measured using GPC with multiple angle laser scattering detection.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0141">The silicone chains preferred for use to substitute or replace (dependent upon the synthetic route use to prepare the substituted polysaccharides of the invention) at least one âOR group in the compounds of formula (I) are representative of preferred silicone chains for use in substituted polysaccharides used in the invention as a whole, i.e. whether or not the overall structure conforms to formula (I).</p>

Protocol for Washing Test Cloths (Silicone Deposition)
</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0310">The following protocol was used in the following examples to deposit silicone onto test cloths from the wash.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0311">The test cloths used were mercerised cotton, 20 cmÃ20 cm in size.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0312">The cloths were washed in 200 ml pots, which were prepared as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0313">Per pot
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0314">0.1 litre of wash liquor (as detailed in the table above, which included enough test composition to give 3.0 mg silicone per g of cotton)</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0315">1 cotton test cloth</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0316">Each pot was then heated to 40Â° C. for 30 min with agitation (bottleshaker at a shake speed of about 100 shakes per minute). The cloths were then rinsed in 2Ã200 ml tap water (nominal hardness 24Â° F. H) and dried overnight on a flat surface at ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0317">Protocol for Measuring Silicone Eeposition</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0318">The dried fabrics were then analysed for silicone deposition according to the following protocol:
<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0319">Solvent extraction of silicone from fabric was carried out using 10 ml Tetrahydrofuran (THF) per g of cotton.</li>
    <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0320">The silicone was then extracted at room temperature for 24 h under constant agitation.</li>
    <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0321">The THF was then analysed for silicone levels via gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using an evaporative light scattering detector.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0322">An analogous method was used to detect perfume deposition.</p>
