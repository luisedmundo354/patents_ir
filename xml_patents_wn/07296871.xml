<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to integrated circuits, and, in one embodiment, particularly to analyses of inkjet print head heater chips.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inkjet printing devices such as inkjet printers, all-in-one devices, multifunction devices, and the like, typically uses a print controller or a printer host to control and to communicate with an inkjet print head. A thermal inkjet print head generally has a heater chip. The heater chip typically includes logic circuitry, a plurality of power transistors, and a set of heaters or resistors, among other things. A hardware or software printer driver will selectively address or energize the logic circuitry such that appropriate resistors are heated for printing. In some heater chip designs, the heater chip includes memory used to store information about the print head. Data stored in the memory is used to identify the print head to determine if the print head is a monochrome print head, a color print head or a photograph quality print head. Data stored in the memory is used to keep track of ink usage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To monitor and to characterize the functionality of the heater chip, a variety of analytical or monitoring methods, and electrical and material analyses are used to analyze the materials layered in the heater chip and the semiconductor devices of the heater chip. For example, an electrical method is performed by electrically measuring structures that help monitor critical process parameters on every wafer. The electrically measured results of die process monitor (“DPM”) structures on the wafer are compared against a predetermined specification. Examples of electrically characterized parameters include sheet resistance, effective line width, and the like. While an electrical method provides a fast indication of process variation and problems, the electrical method does not generally provide a complete characterization. For example, an electrical monitoring method can generally indicate problems, but rarely can determine a root cause of the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, material methods are performed using different metrologies in terms of dimension, composition, topology, and the like. For example, material methods such as sectional analysis or cross-section analysis are used to characterize a print head chip. Using sectional analysis, heater chip characteristics such as devices or film features, information on critical dimension, composition profiles, topology as well as material interaction can be collected. Once the information has been collected, other analyses such as process control and failure analysis can use the information to assist in manufacturing processes. For the printhead heater chip, the heater chip analysis becomes even more important since heater chip characteristics such as the film stack thickness needs to be precisely controlled in order to achieve required thermal performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Section analysis is performed by grinding and polishing a thin film stack at a location of interest at the heater chip, followed by optical and e-beam inspection. Section analysis is usually very tedious and time consuming. For example, many sectional cuts are necessary to complete a thorough analysis and inspection.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.

The use of “including,” “comprising,” or “having” and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Unless limited otherwise, the terms “connected,” “coupled,” and “mounted” and variations thereof herein are used broadly and encompass direct and indirect connections, couplings, and mountings. In addition, the terms “connected” and “coupled” and variations thereof are not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an inkjet print head <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The print head <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>12</b> that defines a nosepiece <b>13</b> and an ink reservoir <b>14</b> containing ink or a foam insert saturated with ink. The housing <b>12</b> can be constructed of a variety of materials including, without limitation, one or a combination of polymers, metals, ceramics, composites, and the like. The inkjet print head <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has been inverted to illustrate a nozzle portion <b>15</b> of the print head <b>10</b>. The nozzle portion <b>15</b> is located at least partially on a bottom surface <b>26</b> of the nosepiece <b>13</b> for transferring ink from the ink reservoir <b>14</b> onto a print medium (not shown). The nozzle portion <b>15</b> can include a heater chip <b>16</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a nozzle plate <b>20</b> having a plurality of nozzles <b>22</b> that define a nozzle arrangement and from which ink drops are ejected onto printing media that is advanced through a printer (not shown). The nozzles <b>22</b> can have any cross-sectional shape desired including, without limitation, circular, elliptical, square, rectangular, and any other shape that allows ink to be transferred from the print head <b>10</b> to a printing medium. The heater chip <b>16</b> can be formed of a variety of materials including, without limitation, various forms of doped or non-doped silicon, doped or non-doped germanium, or any other semiconducting material. The heater chip <b>16</b> is positioned to be in electrical communication with conductive traces <b>17</b> provided on an underside of a tape member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The heater chip <b>16</b> is hidden from view in the assembled print head <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The heater chip <b>16</b> is also attached to the nozzle plate <b>20</b> in a removed area or cutout portion <b>19</b> of the tape member <b>18</b>. The heater chip <b>16</b> is attached such that an outwardly facing surface <b>21</b> of the nozzle plate <b>20</b> is generally flush with and parallel to an outer surface <b>29</b> of the tape member <b>18</b> for directing ink onto a printing medium via the plurality of nozzles <b>22</b> in fluid communication with the ink reservoir <b>14</b>. Although a thermal inkjet printing apparatus is used in the example, other types of inkjet technology such as piezoelectric technology can also be used with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Sectional analysis is important for integrated circuits such as the heater chip <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, a sectional analysis includes making a single sectional cut through the integrated circuits such as the heater chip <b>16</b>. The sectional cut includes a cut through integrated circuits and semiconductor devices at one or more angles to a vertical axis. In some embodiments, a sectional cut includes a cross-sectional cut made at a right angle to the vertical axis of the chip <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described previously, using a sectional cut through device or film features, information on critical dimensions, composition profiles, topology, as well as material interaction can be collected. As a result, information that characterizes the integrated circuit, semiconductor device including thickness of the film stack can be precisely controlled in order to achieve a required thermal performance. In some embodiments, the film stack can include a heater layer, a passivation film, and a cavitation film. In addition, the integrated circuit or the heater chip <b>16</b> can have other characteristics that can also be revealed with a small number of sectional cuts made through the circuit or the chip <b>16</b>. By making a sectional cut through the location, desired characteristics of the integrated circuit or the heater chip <b>16</b> can be completely revealed. If other characteristics of the integrated circuit or the heater chip <b>16</b> are desired, other sectional cuts can also be made. In at least one embodiment of the invention, the total amount of sectional cuts is substantially less than an amount of the characteristics revealed thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For the print head chip <b>16</b>, devices or structures whose measurements or information can characterize the print head chip can include, without limitation, a scribe step without second metal layer, and a scribe step with a second metal layer. Both of these measurements check an edge seal of the chip <b>16</b>. Other measurements include N implant depth, and P implant depth which measures n-diffusion and p-diff-usion respectively. Measurements such as lightly-doped drain (“LDD”) implant depth, N-doped well (“NWELL”) implant depth, and LDD space checks a diffusion region depth, NWELL diff-usion region depth, and LDD diff-usion region space can also be made.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other measurements that can also characterize the chip <b>16</b> include first-metal-layer-implant-contact-width, contact-to-polycrystalline Silicon space on active, polycrystalline Silicon line-width on gate oxide, and polycrystalline Silicon space on gate oxide. For example, the first-metal-layer-implant-contact width provides a contact size. The contact-to-polycrystalline Silicon space on active measurements checks a space between the contacts and the polycrystalline Silicon. The polycrystalline Silicon line-width on gate oxide measurement, and the polycrystalline Silicon space on gate-oxide measurement check the polycrystalline Silicon gate width and space at an active region, respectively. The polycrystalline Silicon line-width-in-field-oxide measurement, and the polycrystalline Silicon space-on-field-oxide measurement check a polycrystalline Silicon gate width and space on top of a field oxide, respectively. The polycrystalline Silicon metal contact checks the polycrystalline Silicon metal contact size.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Still other measurements include first-metal-layer-line width, first-metal-layer-to-first-metal-layer space, and first-metal-layer-to-second-metal-layer via that check a first metal layer line width, a distance between the first metal layer lines, and a via size between the first metal layer and the second metal layer, respectively. Other measurements can include second-metal-layer line width that checks a second metal layer line width, and second-metal-layer-to-second-metal-layer space that checks a second metal spacing, respectively. Another measurement includes second-metal-layer-to-first-metal-layer-to-polycrystalline Silicon overlap that checks an overlap between the second metal layer, the first metal layer, and the polycrystalline Silicon, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Still other measurements include first-metal-layer-with-Tantalum-step-up, and Tantalum-with-spin-on-glass (“SOG”) step down. The first-metal-layer-with-Tantalum-step-up measurement provides a coverage of a first-layer-metal-over-edge-of-an-active-region. The Tantalum-with-SOG-step-down measurement provides a SOG step coverage over an active region. Other measurements are heater length with Tantalum and without SOG, and heater width with Tantalum and without SOG, which provide a length and a width of the heater. Similarly, measurements such as heater length without Tantalum and with SOG, and heater width without Tantalum and with SOG which also provide a length and a width of the heater. Fuse length and fuse width, both without Tantalum but with SOG provide fuse resistor length and width without Tantalum but with SOG, respectively. Field effect transistor (“FET”) drain contacts and source contacts provide power transistor contact size. FET polycrystalline Silicon line width and first metal layer line width measure a transistor polycrystalline Silicon width and a first metal layer width, respectively. FET P-substrate contact measurement checks a p-substrate contact size of a transistor. FET LDD space measurement checks a transistor LDD space. Ink-via-seal-after-silicon-trenching-fix, ink-via-seal-before-silicon-trenching-fix, and ink-via-seal-without-inter-metal-dielectric (“IMD”) measurements check ink via edge seals.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a top view of an exemplary one-cut structure <b>200</b> of the print head chip <b>16</b>. The exemplary one-cut structure <b>200</b> includes a plurality of locations <b>202</b>. A plurality of devices (discussed below) are arranged in one of the locations <b>202</b> or in an array in one of the locations <b>202</b> such that a sectional cut through one of the locations <b>202</b> can completely reveal a sectional view or the characteristics of the devices or structures. In some embodiments, the devices span an area <b>203</b> of no greater than 0.5×10<sup>−6</sup>m<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the area <b>203</b> is no greater than 0.08×10<sup>−6</sup>m<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the area <b>203</b> is no greater than 1 percent of the die area. In some embodiments, the area is no greater than 0.15 percent of the die area.
