<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of surgical fixation systems involving screws is an accepted practice for a variety of orthopedic procedures. One procedure experiencing proliferated growth is that of spinal fixation, wherein surgical screws are bored into adjacent vertebral bodies and used to anchor rods to immobilize one or more spinal levels. Each screw generally comprises a shank for introduction into bone (such as a pedicle) and a housing or “tulip” coupled to the shank, either fixedly to form a “fixed axis screw” or adjustably to form a “multi-axis screw”. In either event, the rod is received within the housing of the screw and a fastener is employed to secure the rod within or to the housing. One manner of tightening the fastener within or to the housing involves the use of a basic torque driver, such as a screwdriver dimensioned to drive the fastener into engagement with the screw housing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although generally effective, this basic torque driver is nonetheless disadvantageous in that a surgeon must apply the entire torque necessary to properly tighten the fastener. Another drawback of the existing systems is that, to the extent such basic torque drivers include meters or “read outs,” such meters are challenging to read during the application of torque by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed at overcoming, or at least improving upon, the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention accomplishes this goal by providing a system and method for applying torque to a fastener, including a stationary anti-torque handle, a mechanism to multiply an input force and transfer the force to the output shaft, an input handle for generating the input force, and an output shaft to turn the screw (collectively “torque multiplier system”). As will be described in greater detail below, the torque multiplier system of the present invention advantageously supplies the operator with a greater mechanical advantage and thereby decreases the required torque input. It is also more stable than previous torque drivers and thereby offers a more accurate method of assuring that the torque requirement is met.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one broad aspect of the present invention, the anti-torque device may include any number of components capable of preventing rotation of the screw housing. By way of example only, the anti-torque device may include a shaft which mates at its distal end to the screw housing, and a handle coupled to the proximal end of the shaft for establishing leverage and stability when applying torque. The input handle will multiply the force input by the user and transfer it to the fastener along the output shaft. This input force can be generated in numerous fashions, including but not limited to the use of a rod in a ratcheting action or twisting a pistol grip handle. The transfer mechanism may include any number of components capable of conveying the input force along the output shaft to the screw. By way of example only, the transfer mechanism may include, but is not limited to, gears, pulleys, or levers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The torque multiplication system disclosed herein boasts a variety of inventive features and components that warrant patent protection, both individually and in combination. Moreover, although described herein within the context of spinal fixation procedures, it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that the torque multiplication system of the present invention may be employed in any number of suitable procedures without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref> illustrate an example of a torque multiplication system <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention in use with a pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the torque multiplication system <b>10</b> includes an anti-torque component <b>12</b>, a torque input handle <b>14</b>, a torque transfer mechanism <b>16</b>, and an output shaft <b>18</b>. As will be discussed in further detail below, the torque multiplication system <b>10</b> of the present invention may be used to apply a torque to a fastener, which (by way of example only) may be a setscrew <b>84</b> of the pedicle screw system <b>80</b> shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). To do so, the pedicle screw system <b>80</b> (comprising a screw shank <b>86</b>, a screw housing <b>82</b>, setscrew <b>84</b>, and a linking rod <b>88</b>) is first positioned at the target site. The screw shank <b>86</b> is first implanted into the bone until a desired depth is achieved, for example at the point where the screw housing <b>82</b> is generally flush with the bone surface. The linking rod <b>88</b> is then placed within the screw housing <b>82</b> and the setscrew <b>84</b> is thereafter screwed over the rod <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The torque multiplier system <b>10</b> is then coupled to the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. This is accomplished by coupling the distal end <b>20</b> of the anti-torque component <b>12</b> to the screw housing <b>82</b>. The distal end <b>21</b> of the output shaft <b>18</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), which is coupled to the input handle <b>14</b> and transfer mechanism <b>16</b>, is then coupled to the setscrew <b>84</b>. While holding the stabilizing handle <b>13</b> of the anti-torque component <b>12</b> in one hand, the user would then rotate the input handle <b>14</b> about an axis parallel to the length of the input handle <b>14</b> to create torque. The torque created by rotating the input handle <b>14</b> is conveyed to the output shaft <b>18</b> via the transfer mechanism <b>16</b>. This conveyance causes the output shaft <b>18</b> to rotate which consequently causes rotation of the setscrew <b>84</b>. The setscrew <b>84</b> compresses the linking rod <b>88</b> into the screw housing <b>82</b> of the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. This compression will lock the pedicle screw system in place relative to the screw shank <b>86</b>, thereby providing stabilization to the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref> illustrate the anti-torque component <b>12</b> forming part of the torque multiplier system <b>10</b> described above. The anti-torque component <b>12</b> comprises a stabilizing handle <b>13</b>, a joining member <b>15</b>, and a tubular shaft <b>19</b> which collectively prevent rotation of the torque multiplication system <b>10</b> during use. The stabilizing handle <b>13</b> contains a stabilizing axle <b>24</b> extending into the input handle <b>14</b>, thereby providing stability to the input handle <b>14</b> as torque is applied. The tubular shaft <b>19</b> is a hollow, elongated shaft dimensioned to receive the output shaft <b>18</b>, described in further detail below. The distal end <b>20</b> of the tubular shaft <b>19</b> is dimensioned to interact with the housing <b>82</b> of the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. To accomplish this, distal end <b>20</b> contains a pair of wings <b>23</b> extending in a distal direction from the distal end <b>20</b>. The wings <b>23</b> are dimensioned to mate with the wings <b>85</b> of the screw housing <b>82</b>. By way of example only, this mating is accomplished by positioning the wings tubular shaft <b>19</b> such that the wings <b>85</b> of the screw housing <b>82</b> are received in between the wings <b>23</b> of the distal end <b>20</b> of the tubular shaft <b>19</b>. The wings <b>23</b> may be provided having any number of peripheral profiles depending upon the peripheral profile of the wings <b>85</b> of the screw housing <b>82</b>, including but not limited to the generally rectangular peripheral shape as shown. The tubular shaft <b>19</b> is connected to the stabilizing handle <b>13</b> through a joining member <b>15</b>. The joining member <b>15</b> is generally located near a proximal end of the tubular shaft <b>19</b> may be provided having any number of suitable formations capable of bridging the gap between the tubular shaft <b>19</b> and the stabilizing handle <b>13</b>, including but not limited to (and by way of example only), generally angled, generally arcuate, and generally straight.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> illustrate the torque transfer mechanism <b>16</b> and the output shaft <b>18</b> of the torque multiplication system <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the torque transfer mechanism <b>16</b> includes a first gear <b>26</b>, a second gear <b>28</b>, and a plurality of torsion beams <b>30</b>. The first gear <b>26</b> is located at a medial end of the input handle <b>14</b>. By way of example only, the first gear <b>26</b> is generally circular in shape and has a plurality of radial grooves <b>50</b> distributed about its circumference. The second gear <b>28</b> is located at a proximal end of the output shaft <b>18</b>, and is connected to the output shaft <b>18</b> by a plurality of torsion beams <b>30</b> that extend distally from the second gear <b>28</b> through the cylindrical cover <b>36</b> to the base surface <b>38</b> of the output shaft <b>18</b>. By way of example only, the second gear <b>28</b> is generally circular in shape and has a plurality of radial grooves <b>52</b> distributed about its circumference. Grooves <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are dimensioned to interact with each other such that first and second gears <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> cooperate (e.g. by forming a bevel gear) to effect a transfer of torque from the input handle <b>14</b> (by way of the first and second gears <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and torsion beams <b>30</b>) to the output shaft <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, the output shaft <b>18</b> includes a cylindrical cover <b>36</b> at a proximal end and an engagement head <b>21</b> at a distal end. The cylindrical cover <b>36</b> includes a base surface <b>38</b> from which an elongated cylindrical protrusion <b>37</b> extends distally to the engagement head <b>21</b>. As previously mentioned, the second gear <b>28</b> is located at a proximal end of the output shaft <b>18</b>. A torque indicator <b>34</b> is connected to the second gear <b>28</b>. The torque indicator <b>34</b> extends towards the base surface <b>38</b> and rotates with the second gear <b>28</b> when the input handle <b>14</b> is activated. When the second gear <b>28</b> rotates, the torsion beams <b>30</b> begin to deflect, and the indicator <b>34</b> continues to twist. The deflection of the torque indicator <b>34</b> can be seen through an indicator window <b>32</b> in the cylindrical cover <b>36</b>. When the torque indicator <b>34</b> has deflected to the vertical torque window <b>42</b>, the desired torque has been achieved.</p>

The second joining member <b>128</b> is configured to connect the proximal end of the tubular shaft <b>124</b> to a medial end of the input handle <b>114</b>. To accomplish this, the second joining member <b>128</b> includes a gap <b>132</b> having an engagement structure <b>134</b> (e.g., a pin) extending therein. The gap <b>132</b> is dimensioned to movably receive the medial end <b>146</b> of the elongated rod <b>142</b> of the input handle <b>114</b>, as will be described further below.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The distal end <b>136</b> of the tubular shaft <b>124</b> is dimensioned to interact with the housing <b>82</b> of the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. To accomplish this, distal end <b>136</b> contains a pair of wings <b>138</b> extending in a distal direction from the distal end <b>136</b>. The wings <b>138</b> are dimensioned to mate with the wings <b>85</b> of the screw housing <b>82</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The torque input handle <b>114</b> includes a gripping member <b>140</b> positioned towards a lateral end of an elongated rod <b>142</b>. The torque input handle <b>114</b> further includes an engagement feature <b>144</b> (e.g. an aperture configured to receive a pin) located near the medial end <b>146</b> of the elongated rod <b>142</b>. The engagement feature <b>144</b> is dimensioned to movably engage with the engagement structure <b>134</b> located on the second joining member <b>128</b> such that the engagement structure <b>134</b> may act as a fulcrum and the torque input handle <b>114</b> may act as a lever (e.g. a ratchet crank handle). A gear-engagement feature <b>148</b> is provided at the medial end <b>146</b> of the elongated rod <b>138</b>, and is dimensioned to interact with the gear <b>156</b> of the torque transfer mechanism <b>116</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref> illustrate the torque transfer mechanism <b>116</b> and the output shaft <b>118</b> in greater detail. The torque transfer mechanism <b>116</b> includes an inner cylinder <b>150</b>, a transfer axle <b>152</b>, a shearing disk <b>154</b>, a gear member <b>156</b>, and a shear pin <b>158</b>. The inner cylinder <b>150</b> includes an elongated portion <b>160</b> that extends in a proximal direction through the cylindrical cover <b>190</b> to a base surface <b>194</b> of the output shaft <b>118</b>. The proximal end <b>162</b> of the inner cylinder <b>150</b> is provided with threads <b>164</b> dimensioned to interact with the shearing disk <b>154</b>, as described below. The inner cylinder <b>150</b> is further provided with a hollow portion <b>166</b> dimensioned to receive the transfer axle <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The transfer axle <b>152</b> is provided as a generally elongated member having a distal portion <b>168</b> and a proximal portion <b>170</b>.

The proximal portion <b>170</b> is dimensioned to be rotatably received within the central bore <b>172</b> of the shearing disk <b>154</b>, described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The shearing disk <b>154</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and dimensioned to snugly fit within the inner cavity <b>198</b> of the cylindrical cover <b>190</b> of the output shaft <b>118</b>. The shearing disk <b>154</b> includes a central bore <b>172</b> dimensioned to receive the proximal portion <b>170</b> of the transfer axle <b>152</b>. The central bore <b>172</b> may further include a threaded region <b>174</b> dimensioned to engage the threads <b>164</b> of the inner cylinder <b>150</b> such that the shearing disk <b>154</b> is rendered stationary in relation to the inner cylinder <b>150</b> (and thus the output shaft <b>118</b>). The shearing disk <b>154</b> is further provided with a first aperture <b>176</b> dimensioned to receive the shaft <b>186</b> of the shear pin <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The gear member <b>156</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and includes a central bore <b>178</b> dimensioned receive at least a portion of the proximal portion <b>170</b> of the transfer axle <b>152</b>. The gear member <b>156</b> is further configured to rest on top of both the shearing disk <b>154</b> and the cylindrical cover <b>190</b> of the output shaft <b>118</b>. The gear member <b>156</b> is provided with a plurality of radial grooves <b>180</b> distributed about its circumference. The radial grooves are dimensioned to interact with the gear-engagement feature <b>148</b> of the input handle <b>114</b>. The gear member <b>156</b> is further provided with a second aperture <b>182</b> dimensioned to align with the first aperture <b>176</b> of the shearing disk <b>154</b>, and to receive the shaft <b>186</b> of the shear pin <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shear pin <b>158</b> includes a head <b>184</b>, a shaft <b>186</b>, and a breakaway region <b>188</b> located generally near the interface of the head <b>184</b> and shaft <b>186</b>. The shaft <b>186</b> is dimensioned to be inserted through the first and second apertures <b>176</b>, <b>182</b> of the shearing disk <b>154</b> and rotating gear <b>156</b>, respectively. The head <b>184</b> is adapted to snap off the shaft <b>186</b> at the breakaway region <b>188</b> upon application of a predetermined amount of torque to the input handle <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The output shaft <b>118</b> includes a cylindrical cover <b>190</b> at a proximal end and an engagement head <b>192</b> at a distal end (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The cylindrical cover <b>190</b> includes a base surface <b>194</b> from which an elongated cylindrical protrusion <b>196</b> extends distally to the engagement head <b>192</b>. The cylindrical cover <b>190</b> includes an inner cavity <b>198</b>, wherein the inner cylinder <b>150</b> of the torque transfer mechanism <b>116</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, the shaft <b>186</b> of the shear pin <b>158</b> is inserted into the first and second apertures <b>176</b>, <b>182</b> of the shearing disk <b>154</b> and the gear member <b>156</b>, respectively, such that the shearing disk <b>154</b> and the gear member <b>156</b> are temporarily stationary relative to one another. Due to the treaded engagement of the shearing disk <b>154</b> and the inner cylinder <b>150</b>, the gear member <b>156</b> is effectively stationary relative to the distal end <b>192</b> of the output shaft <b>118</b>. Once the shear pin <b>158</b> is in place, the torque multiplier system <b>110</b> is coupled to the pedicle screw system <b>80</b> in a similar fashion as to that described above in relation to torque multiplier system <b>10</b>. This is accomplished by coupling the distal end <b>136</b> of the anti-torque component <b>112</b> to the screw housing <b>82</b>. The distal end <b>192</b> of the output shaft <b>118</b> is then coupled to the setscrew <b>84</b>. While holding the stabilizing handle <b>120</b> of the anti-torque component <b>112</b> in one hand, the user would then pivot the input handle <b>114</b> back and forth using a ratchet-like motion to create torque. The torque created by ratcheting the input handle <b>114</b> is conveyed to the output shaft <b>118</b> via the transfer mechanism <b>116</b>. The gear-engagement feature <b>148</b> of the input handle <b>114</b> interacts with the radial grooves <b>180</b> of the gear member <b>156</b> such that the gear member <b>156</b> is caused to rotate by the ratcheting action of the input handle <b>114</b>. Because the shear pin <b>158</b> is temporarily coupling the gear member <b>156</b> and the shearing disk <b>154</b>, the rotation of the gear member <b>156</b> causes rotation of the shearing disk <b>154</b>, which in turn causes the rotation of the output shaft <b>118</b>. The rotation of the output shaft <b>118</b> consequently causes rotation of the setscrew <b>84</b>. The setscrew <b>84</b> compresses the linking rod <b>88</b> into the screw housing <b>82</b> of the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. This compression will lock the pedicle screw system in place relative to the screw shank <b>86</b>, thereby providing stabilization to the pedicle screw system <b>80</b>. The shear pin <b>158</b>, which serves as a method of torque determination, will shear at the breakaway region <b>188</b> once the input torque reaches a predetermined level. The head <b>182</b> of the shear pin <b>158</b> can be removed by the user and the shaft <b>186</b> will drop into the cylindrical cover <b>190</b>.</p>
