<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention provides an apparatus and method for providing a heat exchanger for vehicles that have liquid cooled engines. The heat exchanger is positioned within the vehicle so as to accept airflow moving across the vehicle when the vehicle is in motion. The heat exchanger is positioned within the vehicle so as not to adversely affect the vehicle's center of gravity. A divider is used with the heat exchanger to help channel at least a portion of the airflow to the heat exchanger, while also preventing any byproduct produced from contact between airborne materials and the heat exchanger from causing a nuisance to the operator.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to improved cooling systems for vehicles. In particular, the invention relates to improved heat exchanger systems for vehicles having liquid-cooled engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is well known that many vehicles, including motorcycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, watercraft, and the like, are powered by internal combustion engines. Typically, these engines are positioned within engine compartments and are adapted to propel the vehicles. Generally, each internal combustion engine communicates with a cooling system that functions to cool the engine. If the engine is liquid cooled, the cooling system generally will include one or more heat exchangers (e.g., extruded radiators). These heat exchangers are typically spaced away from the engine and are used for running engine coolant therethrough for heat dissipation purposes, as is known in the art. Generally, these heat exchangers are linked to the engine through passages (e.g., rubber hoses) operatively coupled to the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In snowmobiles, the heat exchangers are generally positioned within the snowmobile drive tunnel (generally located beneath a rear body portion of the snowmobile). An endless drive track, also disposed within the drive tunnel, carries and circulates snow within the drive tunnel as the track moves. The heat exchangers are positioned adjacent to the track so that some of the snow carried by the track is subsequently deposited onto the heat exchangers. Generally, the coolant running from the engine is of an elevated temperature. As such, when circulated through the heat exchanger, the coolant causes outer surfaces of the heat exchanger to rise in temperature. Subsequently, if cool air makes contact with the heat exchanger, the air will likely cause the heat exchanger outer surfaces to lower in temperature, thereby also lowering the temperature of the engine coolant circulating therein as well. Alternatively, if snow makes contact with the heat exchanger, it will likely melt because of the high temperature outer surfaces of the heat exchanger. The melting of the snow requires a substantial amount of heat, which is essentially removed from the heat exchanger and the engine coolant therein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Engine cooling problems can occur with snowmobiles, however, when used in low snow or tightly-packed snow conditions (e.g., on a road), from which little or no snow is kicked up onto the heat exchangers in the tunnel. Thus, in many snowmobile designs, the heat exchangers within the snowmobile drive tunnel are used in combination with one or more additional heat exchangers positioned in a front portion of the snowmobile, generally within a body assembly. These heat exchangers, typically located forward of the tunnel and within the body assembly, communicate with one or more openings in the body assembly (i.e., in the hood). In turn, these heat exchangers provide heat exchange between the engine coolant circulated therein and air or airborne precipitation (e.g., snow, water, etc.) that enters the snowmobile through the openings. In turn, the engine may be adequately cooled using these heat exchangers in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately, problems are known to exist in using heat exchangers in the body assembly as described above. One such problem is the heat exchanger's potential of providing the snowmobile with a higher center of mass. As mentioned above, the heat exchanger is generally located proximate to one or more openings in the body assembly. By locating the heat exchanger proximate to the openings, the heat exchanger, in turn, is positioned relatively high in the body assembly. In turn, the snowmobile's center of mass is raised, which can likely affect the overall stability of the snowmobile. Consequently, when ridden, the snowmobile may be limited, for example, in its handling or maneuverability, which could lead to consumers having a negative impression of the snowmobile.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem with such a system is the heat exchanger's potential to create steam. As mentioned above, these heat exchangers are located within the body assembly, proximate to the openings in the body assembly. As airborne precipitation (snow, water, etc.) enters the openings, it comes in contact with the heat exchanger. Contact between the high temperature outer surface of the heat exchanger and the lower temperature precipitation generally leads to the precipitation vaporizing into steam. Such steam subsequently rises out of the body assembly through the openings in the hood. As soon as the steam exits the hood, it generally condenses due to the cold outside air temperature. Subsequently, the condensation is directed at the windshield of the snowmobile by the natural flow of the air into and about the outer surface of the snowmobile. Likewise, such condensation is directed at the operator of the snowmobile. If exposed to freezing air temperatures, the condensation may additionally freeze. This condensation, being directed at and potentially freezing to the windshield and the operator, can be a nuisance for the operator in operating the snowmobile.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain embodiments of the invention provide a snowmobile having a longitudinally extending chassis having a front portion and a rear portion. The chassis supports a liquid-cooled engine proximate the front portion and an operator seat proximate the rear portion. The engine includes coolant passages for carrying liquid coolant that absorbs heat generated by the engine during operation. The engine powers a drive track operatively connected to the chassis proximate the rear portion. The chassis front portion mounts a pair of steerable skis and supports a body assembly containing the engine and a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is housed within the body assembly, connected in fluid communication with the engine coolant passages, and adapted to dissipate heat from the liquid coolant. The body assembly has airflow inlet openings and outlet apertures for allowing ambient air into and out of the body assembly and in contact with the heat exchanger. The body assembly is formed by an upwardly open nosepan covered by a hood.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments of the snowmobile of the invention, the heat exchanger is contained within the nosepan. Additionally, in certain embodiments of the snowmobile of the invention, the heat exchanger is located forward of the engine. Also, in certain embodiments of the snowmobile of the invention, the heat exchanger and the engine each define a center of mass, with the heat exchanger center of mass below the engine center of mass. Additionally, in certain embodiments of the snowmobile of the invention, the airflow outlet aperture is in the nosepan, whereby air flowing out the outlet aperture during forward movement of the snowmobile is not directed upwardly rearward towards the operator. Also, in certain embodiments of the snowmobile of the invention, the airflow inlet opening is in the nosepan.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, certain embodiments of the invention provide a snowmobile having a longitudinally extending chassis having a front portion and a rear portion. The chassis supports a liquid-cooled engine proximate the front portion and an operator seat proximate the rear portion. The engine includes coolant passages for carrying liquid coolant that absorbs heat generated by the engine during operation. The engine powers a drive track operatively connected to the chassis proximate the rear portion. The chassis front portion mounts a pair of steerable skis and supports a body assembly containing the engine and a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is housed within the body assembly, connected in fluid communication with the engine coolant passages, and adapted to dissipate heat from the liquid coolant. The body assembly has airflow inlet openings and outlet apertures for allowing ambient air into and out of the body assembly. One or more of the airflow inlet openings is in contact with the heat exchanger. The body assembly includes a first airflow inlet opening allowing ambient air into a first cavity within the body assembly. The first cavity contains the heat exchanger. The ambient air entering the first cavity through the first airflow inlet opening does not contact the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Finally, certain embodiments of the invention provide a recreational or utility vehicle having a longitudinally extending chassis having a front portion and a rear portion. The chassis supports a liquid-cooled engine. The engine includes coolant passages for carrying liquid coolant that absorbs heat generated by the engine during operation. The chassis supports a body assembly containing the engine and a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is housed within the body assembly, connected in fluid communication with the engine coolant passages, and adapted to dissipate heat from the liquid coolant. The body assembly includes first and second airflow inlet openings that are exposed to airflow when the vehicle is in motion. The first airflow inlet opening allows ambient air into a first cavity within the body assembly. The first cavity contains the heat exchanger. The ambient air entering the first cavity through the first airflow inlet opening does not contact the engine. The first cavity is separated from a second cavity within the body assembly. The second cavity contains the engine. Ambient air entering the second cavity does not contact the heat exchanger. The second airflow inlet opening allows ambient air into one of the first and second cavities.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following detailed description is to be read with reference to the drawings, in which like elements in different figures have like reference numerals. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict selected embodiments, but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It will be understood that many of the specific details of the vehicle incorporating the system illustrated in the drawings could be changed or modified by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing significantly from the spirit of the invention. The heat exchanger system of the invention is exemplified for use on vehicles such as snowmobiles; however, the system may also be used on other vehicles having liquid-cooled engines, such as motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, watercraft, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A snowmobile <b>10</b> having a system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The snowmobile <b>10</b> includes a number of parts formed of suitable materials that cover, protect, and are supported by a longitudinally extending chassis <b>12</b>. The chassis has a front portion <b>14</b> and a rear portion <b>15</b>. Proximate to the rear portion <b>15</b>, the chassis supports a drive tunnel that accommodates a seat <b>16</b> adapted to carry one or more riders in straddle fashion. A handlebar assembly <b>18</b>, positioned forwardly of the seat <b>16</b>, is conventionally connected to a pair of front skis <b>20</b> for steering the snowmobile <b>10</b>. The front skis <b>20</b> are supported by a suitable front suspension system that is connected to the chassis <b>12</b>, proximate to the front portion <b>14</b>. Beneath the seat <b>16</b> and within the drive tunnel, a suitable rear suspension is operatively coupled to the drive tunnel (or alternatively, to the chassis <b>12</b>) and suspends an endless track assembly <b>22</b>. The endless track assembly <b>22</b> is driven by an internal combustion engine <b>24</b> (represented in dashed lines), which is located within a body assembly <b>26</b> and supported by the front portion <b>14</b> of the chassis <b>12</b>. In preferred embodiments, a heat exchanger (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is also located within the body assembly <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tunnel has a top portion (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) under the seat <b>16</b> which connects to generally downwardly extending sidewalls <b>23</b> (only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that are positioned on opposite sides of the endless track <b>22</b>. As such, the endless track <b>22</b> is disposed within the drive tunnel. Generally horizontal running boards <b>25</b> (only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) extend outward from the chassis <b>12</b> or extend outward from each sidewall <b>23</b> respectively. The width of the running boards <b>25</b> preferably tapers rearwardly. The engine <b>24</b> is liquid-cooled and includes passages (not shown) for carrying liquid coolant that absorbs heat generated by the engine <b>24</b> during operation. Although not expressly shown, the engine <b>24</b> contains a conventional pump for circulating the liquid coolant from the engine <b>24</b> through the heat exchanger and back to the engine <b>24</b>. The front skis <b>20</b> exit the body assembly <b>26</b> through suspension wells <b>27</b> (only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) defined therein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A front face of the snowmobile <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The snowmobile <b>10</b> is illustrated without the front skis <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the body assembly <b>26</b> includes a hood <b>28</b> defining a frontal upper portion of the snowmobile <b>10</b> and an upwardly opening nose pan <b>30</b> defining a frontal lower portion of the snowmobile <b>10</b> covered or closed by the hood <b>28</b>. The hood <b>28</b> and nose pan <b>30</b> are preferably separated by a belt line <b>29</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, but visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>), generally covered by a bumper <b>31</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. The hood <b>28</b> and nose pan <b>30</b> each include a plurality of holes or apertures. Preferably, the plurality of holes includes one or more first airflow inlet openings <b>32</b> (preferably in the nose pan <b>30</b>) and one or more second airflow inlet openings <b>34</b> (preferably in the hood <b>28</b>). One or more of these openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> preferably communicates fluidly with the heat exchanger (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) located within the body assembly <b>26</b>. In preferred embodiments, as shown, the first openings <b>32</b> are generally centrally located on a front surface of the nose pan <b>30</b>, forward-oriented, and generally square-shaped. In preferred embodiments, the second openings <b>34</b> are generally centrally located on a lower front surface of the hood <b>28</b>, forward-oriented, and generally rectangular-shaped. Preferably, both openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are oriented forward of the operator of the snowmobile <b>10</b> and allow for ambient air to flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A perspective view showing a cutaway front portion of the snowmobile hood <b>28</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As such, the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, normally housed underneath the hood <b>28</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>, is visible. In preferred embodiments, as shown, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is an auxiliary radiator. A framework <b>38</b> that generally defines an upper surface of the nose pan <b>30</b> preferably secures the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. In turn, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is positioned within the confines of the nose pan <b>30</b>, and is preferably positioned lower than the beltline <b>29</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. Consequently, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is positioned low in the body assembly <b>26</b> so as not to raise the center of mass of the snowmobile <b>10</b> with the inclusion of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. In preferred embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is positioned proximate to the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> in the nose pan <b>30</b> and hood <b>28</b>, respectively. As such, air that flows into the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may naturally flow to the heat exchanger <b>36</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In preferred embodiments, a divider <b>40</b> is included within the body assembly <b>26</b>. Preferably, the divider <b>40</b> is a generally rectangular plate and is operatively coupled to the framework <b>38</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the divider <b>40</b> is coupled to the framework <b>38</b> via a hinge <b>42</b> formed by a forward end of the framework <b>38</b> and a rear end of the divider <b>40</b>. As such, the divider <b>40</b> is positioned above the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. In combination, a lower surface of the divider <b>40</b> and hinge <b>42</b> define an upper extension for the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, while an upper surface of the nose pan <b>30</b> defines a lower extension for the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. As such, both extensions generally define a first cavity <b>43</b> through which air may flow from one or more of the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. Preferably, the divider <b>40</b> is disposed so as to extend laterally across the length of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>; however, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows only a portion of the divider length so as to not conceal the heat exchanger <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The hinge <b>42</b> allows the divider <b>40</b> to be pivoted higher and lower about a generally horizontal axis defined by the hinge <b>42</b>. Adjusting the divider <b>40</b> about the hinged point in this fashion can modify the volume of the first cavity <b>43</b> by widening or narrowing a front opening of the first cavity <b>43</b>. In turn, the volume of air that the first cavity <b>43</b> accommodates can be modified. Consequently, the amount of air that can travel into the first cavity <b>43</b> at a given time is also made modifiable, as described below. Thus, the adjustability of the divider <b>40</b> provides variability in regard to the cooling functionality of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A perspective view of one embodiment of the divider <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In preferred embodiments, the divider <b>40</b> is fabricated of a plastic or like resilient material and is, in turn, formed by injection molding. As described above, the divider <b>40</b> preferably has male hinge portions <b>44</b> located on one end to enable the divider <b>40</b> to be coupled to the framework <b>38</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In turn, an opposing end of the divider <b>40</b> can be raised or lowered about the hinged point. Preferably, as shown, side segments <b>46</b> extend downward from each side of the divider <b>40</b>. The segments <b>46</b> function in further directing air flowing through one or more of the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. Finally, the front end of the divider <b>40</b> preferably includes a protrusion <b>48</b> to function in securing the divider <b>40</b> in its intended position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A cross-sectional side view of a front portion of the snowmobile <b>10</b> taken about lines <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in accordance with certain embodiments. In such certain embodiments, as depicted, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is contained within the nosepan <b>30</b>, and perhaps more preferably, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is completely contained within the nosepan <b>30</b>. The heat exchanger <b>36</b> has an established center of mass, as does the engine <b>24</b>. Determining the center of mass for such objects is well known in the art. In certain embodiments, when the heat exchanger <b>36</b> and the engine are installed on the snowmobile <b>10</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the center of mass of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is below the center of mass of the engine <b>24</b>, and perhaps more preferably, the center of mass of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is at least one inch below the center of mass of the engine <b>24</b>. In other certain embodiments, the center of mass of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is below the belt line <b>29</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in certain embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is located forward of the rear of the engine <b>24</b>, and perhaps preferably, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is located forward of the engine <b>24</b>. Generally, the engine <b>24</b> has an exhaust pipe system including an exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>. In certain embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is located below the exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>, perhaps more preferably below an elbow in the exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>, and perhaps optimally, under the elbow in the exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the divider <b>40</b> is rotatably coupled at hinge <b>42</b> to framework <b>38</b>. The divider is rotated about its hinge <b>42</b> to a first position. In the first position, the divider <b>40</b> is positioned so as to be in a generally horizontal orientation. As such, the forward end of the divider <b>40</b> preferably extends higher than first openings <b>32</b> and lower than second openings <b>34</b>. In preferred embodiments, the front end of the divider <b>40</b> is secured in this first position at an upper portion of the nose pan <b>30</b>. This securement can be provided any of a number of ways, as is known in the art. One type of securing method is to have the protrusion <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) on the front end of the divider <b>40</b> held between two rigid segments extending from the underside of the body assembly <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the first position, the divider <b>40</b> preferably directs external air <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> entering the body assembly <b>26</b> from both the first openings <b>32</b> and the second openings <b>34</b>. In preferred embodiments, as shown, with the divider <b>40</b> in the first position, ambient air <b>52</b> entering from the first openings <b>32</b> is directed under the divider <b>40</b> into the first cavity <b>43</b> towards the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. The ambient air <b>50</b> entering from the second openings <b>34</b> is directed over the divider <b>40</b> into an second cavity <b>51</b> towards the engine <b>24</b> and exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>. The air <b>50</b> routed to the second cavity <b>51</b>, and to the engine <b>24</b> and exhaust headpipe <b>54</b>, provides for direct cooling of the engine <b>24</b>, while the air <b>52</b> routed to the first cavity <b>43</b>, and to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, provides for indirect cooling of the engine <b>24</b> (i.e., by way of cooling the engine coolant circulating within the heat exchanger <b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the air <b>50</b> directed into the second cavity <b>51</b> (i.e., above the divider <b>40</b>) either remains within the second cavity <b>51</b> or is directed out one or more upper holes <b>56</b> defined in the hood <b>28</b>. In contrast, the air <b>52</b> directed into the first cavity <b>43</b> (i.e., below the divider <b>40</b>) preferably enters a front surface <b>58</b> of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> and exits a rear surface <b>60</b>. With the heat exchanger <b>36</b> positioned low in the body assembly <b>26</b>, once the air <b>52</b> exits the rear surface <b>60</b> of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, the air <b>52</b> is preferably directed through an outlet aperture <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In preferred embodiments, the outlet aperture <b>62</b> is defined in the nose pan <b>30</b>, located rearward of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, and below the center of mass of the engine <b>24</b>. Preferably, the outlet aperture <b>62</b> is respectively defined in one or more of the suspension wells <b>27</b> of the snowmobile <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As detailed above, the front skis <b>20</b> exit the body assembly <b>26</b> through the suspension wells <b>27</b> defined therein. Such wells <b>27</b> typically are sealed to prevent snow from entering the body assembly <b>26</b>. In certain embodiments, one or more of the suspension wells <b>27</b> defines the outlet aperture <b>62</b> therein. The outlet aperture <b>62</b> can be a variety of sizes, however, it is preferably sized to be at least one square inch, and perhaps optimally, at least six square inches.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Typically, the air <b>52</b> entering the first cavity <b>43</b> flows naturally from the heat exchanger <b>36</b> and continues through the outlet aperture <b>62</b> due to the negative pressure that is exhibited underneath the nose pan <b>30</b> when the snowmobile <b>10</b> is in motion. Because of the negative pressure created when the snowmobile <b>10</b> is in motion, the air <b>52</b> is pulled through the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, through the outlet aperture <b>62</b>, rearward around the track assembly <b>22</b>, and under the running boards <b>27</b>. Consequently, the air <b>52</b> is not directed upwardly rearward towards the operator of the snowmobile <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except the divider <b>40</b> is shown rotated to a second position. In this second position, the divider <b>40</b> is rotatably coupled at hinge <b>42</b> to the framework <b>38</b>, yet positioned in an upwardly angled orientation with respect to the hinge portion <b>42</b>. As such, the front end <b>49</b> of the divider <b>40</b> preferably extends higher than the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and is secured to a lower portion of the hood <b>28</b>. As described above, such securement can be made in a variety of ways as is known in the art. In the second position, the divider <b>40</b> preferably directs external air entering the body assembly <b>26</b> from both the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> into the first cavity <b>43</b> towards the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. Consequently, as described above, the air routed into the first cavity <b>43</b> provides for indirect cooling of the engine <b>24</b> (i.e., by way of cooling the engine coolant circulating within the heat exchanger <b>36</b>). Additionally, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the air flowing to the heat exchanger <b>36</b> preferably flows through the heat exchanger <b>36</b> via the front surface <b>58</b> and exits the rear surface <b>60</b>. As such, once the air exits the rear surface <b>60</b> of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, the air is preferably directed through the outlet aperture <b>62</b> preferably defined in the nose pan <b>30</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> and described above, the air that is directed into the first cavity <b>43</b> through one or more of the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> subsequently flows through the heat exchanger <b>36</b> and exits through the outlet aperture <b>62</b>. However, additional materials may be airborne that enter the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> as well. For example, in the case of snowmobiles, precipitation (snow, water, etc) may enter the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. As mentioned above, if snow were to contact a high temperature surface of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, the snow would generally vaporize. In turn, the water vapor would likely travel out hood openings <b>56</b> to likely condense, and subsequently be directed at the windshield of the snowmobile <b>10</b> as well as the operator. However, in using the divider <b>40</b> (and the hinged portion <b>42</b> of the framework <b>38</b>) to form the upper extension for the first cavity <b>43</b> extending to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, such water vapor can generally be kept within the first cavity <b>43</b>. In turn, the chances of the precipitation leaving the body assembly <b>26</b> through the hood <b>28</b> are greatly reduced. Consequently, the operator is less likely to be affected, as detailed above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Whether the divider <b>40</b> is in the first or second position, generally the same amount of air generally is brought into the body assembly <b>26</b> (i.e., via the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with the divider <b>40</b> in the first position, the incoming air <b>50</b> is routed into the second cavity <b>51</b> (to the engine <b>24</b> and exhaust pipe <b>54</b>) and the incoming air <b>52</b> is routed into the first cavity <b>43</b> (to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, with the divider <b>40</b> in the second position, the incoming air is only routed into the first cavity <b>43</b> (to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>). While both positions provide cooling, it is believed that having the divider <b>40</b> in the second position provides an increased cooling function in comparison with having the divider <b>40</b> in the first position. This is largely because when the divider <b>40</b> is in the first position, at least a portion of the air <b>50</b> directed to the engine <b>24</b> and exhaust pipe <b>54</b> is routed out one or more of the openings <b>56</b> in the hood <b>28</b>. As such, it is believed that the air <b>50</b> provides less of a cooling effect on the engine <b>24</b>. In contrast, when the divider <b>40</b> is in the second position, there is no such opening for the air directed to the heat exchanger <b>36</b> to escape through. Consequently, the vast majority of the air directed at the heat exchanger <b>36</b> in turn flows through the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, which enables the second position of the divider <b>40</b> to be more efficient in terms of overall engine cooling than the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, when one adjusts the divider <b>40</b> from the first position to the second position, the volume of the first cavity <b>43</b> is increased. In addition, ambient air can be directed into the first cavity <b>43</b> via both of the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In turn, an increased amount of ambient air can be directed into the first cavity <b>43</b> (and into the heat exchanger <b>36</b>) per unit time. Consequently, with the increased ambient air amount per unit time through the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, there is increased cooling of the engine <b>24</b> via the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. Consequently, the increased cooling from the heat exchanger <b>36</b> can compensate for a lack of cooling of the engine <b>24</b> from heat exchangers located in the drive tunnel during poor cooling conditions (i.e., low snow or tightly-packed snow conditions). However, while the overall cooling of the snowmobile <b>10</b> may be increased by positioning the divider <b>40</b> in the second position, the increased airflow amount directed through the heat exchanger <b>36</b> also may cause the snowmobile <b>10</b> to be less aerodynamic. In effect, the overall top-end speed that the snowmobile <b>10</b> normally reaches may be decreased along with its fuel efficiency because of the change in divider position.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned above, whether the divider <b>40</b> is in the first or second position, the same amount of air is being brought into the engine compartment <b>26</b> (i.e., via the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>). However, when the divider <b>40</b> is in the first position, much of the air <b>50</b> that is routed into the second cavity <b>51</b> is in turn funneled out one or more of the openings <b>56</b> in the hood <b>28</b> without much of a drag effect on the snowmobile <b>10</b>. In contrast, when the divider <b>40</b> is in the second position, the air directed into the first cavity <b>43</b> generally has to flow through the heat exchanger <b>36</b> in order to exit the engine compartment <b>26</b> through the outlet aperture <b>62</b>. As such, there is more drag on the vehicle with the divider <b>40</b> being in the second position instead of the first position. Consequently, an operator would not necessarily want to permanently leave the divider <b>40</b> in the second position because of this additional drag created on the snowmobile <b>10</b>. In particular, if the conditions for cooling are favorable (e.g., excessive snow or loosely-packed snow conditions), an operator may likely want to switch the divider <b>40</b> to the first position to decrease the drag on the snowmobile <b>10</b>. Thus, an operator would most likely be selective about which position the divider <b>40</b> is set at, essentially balancing cooling functionality versus snowmobile performance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">There are many aspects of the heat exchanger system described above involving preferred embodiments. While the aspects may be preferred, it is contemplated that embodiments of the invention may also exist which incorporate variations to these aspects without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, while the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are described as being defined in both the hood <b>28</b> and nose pan <b>30</b> respectively, the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> could both instead be located in the nose pan <b>30</b> or in the hood <b>28</b>. In addition, the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are shown and described as generally being rectangular-shaped and square-shaped respectively. Also, the quantity of openings shown for each of the upper and lower openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is two. It should be appreciated that these openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> could be defined to be any of a variety of different sizes as well as differing quantities than shown and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, while the system is described as being located in a front portion of the vehicle, and preferably within an engine compartment, neither is a requisite. It is contemplated that the system could instead be positioned anywhere on the vehicle, or contained within any of a variety of structures instead, so long as there is exposure to airflow. Also, while the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is described as being operatively coupled to the upper surface of the nose pan <b>30</b> and being operatively coupled to the divider <b>40</b> by the hinged portion <b>42</b> of the framework <b>38</b>, it is contemplated that the heat exchanger <b>36</b> could just as well be coupled to the nose pan <b>30</b> and the divider <b>40</b> without the framework <b>38</b> being used for intermediary purposes. Additionally, while the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is described as being mounted low in the body assembly <b>26</b>, it is appreciated that the heat exchanger <b>36</b> may be raised in position, yet still generally not increase the vehicle's center of mass. If the heat exchanger <b>36</b> were raised as such, a shield, functioning as a second divider, could be extended from the rear surface <b>60</b> of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> so that air flowing through the heat exchanger <b>36</b> could continue to still be directed out underneath the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finally, while the divider <b>40</b> of the heat exchanger system is described as a generally rectangular plate that is fabricated of plastic, it is contemplated that the divider <b>40</b> could be a variety of shapes and sizes as well as formed of a number of different materials without departing from the spirit of the invention. In addition, while the divider <b>40</b> is described as being in one of the first or second positions, it is contemplated that the divider <b>40</b> could have a multitude of positions providing a spectrum of settings at which the heat exchanger <b>36</b> could function. The divider <b>40</b> would then preferably be set by the operator based on riding conditions. Further, while the two positions demonstrate the air flowing through the second opening <b>34</b> in the hood <b>28</b> to be directed to one of the first or second cavities <b>43</b> and <b>51</b> respectively, it is contemplated that the front edge of the divider <b>40</b> could also be positioned in front of the second opening <b>34</b> to divide the air coming therethrough to both the first and second cavities <b>43</b> and <b>51</b> respectively as well. Likewise, the front end of the divider <b>40</b> could be positioned in front of the first opening <b>32</b> to divide the air coming therethrough to both the first and second cavities <b>43</b> and <b>51</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In using the heat exchanger system described above, there are many advantages. One such advantage is providing an effective heat exchanger for the vehicle. As such, the heat exchanger could complement the use of other heat exchangers on the vehicle. In snowmobiles, as described above, the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is preferably mounted low within the engine compartment <b>26</b> so as not to adversely raise the center of mass of the snowmobile <b>10</b>. Consequently, the handling and maneuverability of the snowmobile <b>10</b> is not likely to be affected by the inclusion of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. Further, by preferably using a divider <b>40</b> in front of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, any steam created by precipitation (snow, water, etc.) coming in contact with the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is contained. With the airflow entering the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> in the nose pan <b>30</b> and the hood <b>28</b> respectively, the steam is also not likely to flow back out either of those openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In turn, the steam is not likely to escape the body assembly <b>26</b> and cause any nuisance to the operator as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another advantage is providing a heat exchanger which is dynamic in use. By preferably having the divider <b>40</b> rotatably coupled to the hinged portion <b>42</b> that extends from the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, one can vary an effective volume of the first cavity <b>43</b>, and in turn, vary the amount of air that enters the heat exchanger <b>36</b> by altering the position of the divider <b>40</b>. As such, the cooling functionality of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> can be altered. In snowmobiles, as described above, the positioning of the divider <b>40</b> would be changed in response to riding conditions. For example, if the conditions are poor for cooling the engine via the heat exchangers located in the drive tunnel (e.g., little snow or tightly-packed snow conditions), the divider <b>40</b> may be adjusted to a position so as to increase the volume of the first cavity <b>43</b>. In so doing, the amount of air flowing into the first cavity <b>43</b> to the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is increased, and in turn, the cooling functionality of the heat exchanger <b>36</b> is increased as well. This is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where the divider <b>40</b> is set in the second position, thereby directing air flowing through both the first and second openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to the heat exchanger <b>36</b>. In contrast, if the conditions are favorable for cooling the engine via the extruded heat exchangers (e.g., excessive snow or loosely-packed snow conditions), the divider <b>40</b> can be adjusted to a position so as to decrease the volume of the first cavity <b>43</b>. In so doing, the amount of air flowing into the first cavity <b>43</b> over time is decreased, thereby decreasing the cooling functionality of the heat exchanger <b>36</b>, but also decreasing the amount of drag on the snowmobile <b>10</b>. This is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Other advantageous aspects of the system include having the divider <b>40</b> being easily accessible to the operator. As such, once the hood <b>28</b> is opened, the divider <b>40</b> can be positioned relatively easily. In addition, the adjustability of the divider <b>40</b> provides access to the first cavity <b>43</b>, enabling the operator to remove any debris that may have entered through the openings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and become trapped within the cavity <b>43</b>.</p>
