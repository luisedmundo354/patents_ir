<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and apparatus for validating client access to a network-accessible data store. Still more particularly, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for enabling an interface to validate a transaction request directed to a database system, and for configuring the transaction request based on an identification of the client that issued the transaction request.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field of network database systems, various approaches have been taken by software vendors to provide client validation and access to the database system. The ubiquitous nature of the Internet has resulted in numerous protocols and techniques for enabling client access to network database systems. The extensible markup language has emerged as one of the more popular protocols for describing and sharing data on the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A data provider hosting a database on the Internet will often allow access to the database by a wide variety of clients. It is frequently desirable to provide different access privileges to the database among various clients. In such a situation, different validation criteria are employed to allow or deny a client access to the database.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common strategy employed for validating a transaction request is to provide a validation document at the server in the form of an (extensible markup language (XML) document type definition (DTD). However, a different DTD is required for each client that has different validation criteria. Accordingly, a number of DTDs are required to facilitate validation of various clients accessing the database according to different validation criteria. The performance of a network server providing validation services to numerous clients having different access criteria is adversely affected due to the number of files or network input/output calls needed to validate each DTD corresponding to a different client.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be advantageous to deploy a single validation object that can be used to provide access to different clients having different access criteria. Moreover, it would be advantageous to provide a singleton in-memory object that facilitates configuration and validation of mandatory fields that vary among transaction requests issued by different clients.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a method, computer program product, and a data processing system for validating and configuring a database transaction request. A first transaction criteria of a plurality of transaction criteria is identified in a singleton in-memory object by reading a client identifier element value specified in a database transaction request. Each of the plurality of transaction criteria is associated with a respective client. Default data for a database field is determined based on the client identifier element value.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system <b>100</b> is a network of computers in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system <b>100</b> contains a network <b>102</b>, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system <b>100</b>. Network <b>102</b> may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the depicted example, server <b>104</b> is connected to network <b>102</b> along with storage unit <b>106</b>. In addition, clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> are connected to network <b>102</b>. These clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> may be, for example, a personal computer or network computer. In the depicted example, server <b>104</b> provides an interface to a database maintained in storage unit <b>106</b>. Server <b>104</b> validates a transaction request issued by a client that is directed to the database and configures fields of the transaction request according to validation criteria associated with the particular client. Clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> are clients to server <b>104</b>. Network data processing system <b>100</b> may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the depicted example, network data processing system <b>100</b> is the Internet with network <b>102</b> representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, including thousands of commercial, government, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages of course, network data processing system <b>100</b> also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the present invention. Server <b>104</b> as illustrated is a web server, also referred to as an HTTP server, and includes server software that processes XML-formatted database transaction requests. Server <b>104</b> includes software that utilizes a singleton in-memory object for validating and configuring transaction requests submitted by clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> that are directed to the database maintained in storage unit <b>106</b>. The connection between client and server is usually broken after the requested document or file has been served. HTTP servers are used on Web and Intranet sites.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of a data processing system that may be implemented as a server, such as server <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Data processing system <b>200</b> is an example of a computer that may be used to provide a transaction request interface to the database maintained in storage unit <b>106</b> and to validate and configure transaction requests submitted by clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b>. Data processing system <b>200</b> includes software that utilizes a Java bean marshalled from an XML validation document. The XML validation document defines transaction request criteria for various clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> and facilitates configuration of requisite fields of the transaction request. The transaction request validation and configuration provided by the server is client dependent and enables assignment of default values on a client-by-client basis. In the illustrative examples, an XML-formatted document communicated to data processing system <b>200</b> from a client, such as client <b>108</b>, defines a database transaction request. The transaction request includes a client identifier and various fields that define the particular database transaction type and attributes of the transaction request.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Data processing system <b>200</b> may be a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system including a plurality of processors <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> connected to system bus <b>206</b>. Alternatively, a single processor system may be employed. Also connected to system bus <b>206</b> is memory controller/cache <b>208</b>, which provides an interface to local memory <b>209</b>. I/O bus bridge <b>210</b> is connected to system bus <b>206</b> and provides an interface to I/O bus <b>212</b>. Memory controller/cache <b>208</b> and I/O bus bridge <b>210</b> may be integrated as depicted.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridge <b>214</b> connected to I/O bus <b>212</b> provides an interface to PCI local bus <b>216</b>. A number of modems may be connected to PCI local bus <b>216</b>. Typical PCI bus implementations will support four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors. Communications links to clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be provided through modem <b>218</b> and network adapter <b>220</b> connected to PCI local bus <b>216</b> through add-in boards.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additional PCI bus bridges <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> provide interfaces for additional PCI local buses <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>, from which additional modems or network adapters may be supported. In this manner, data processing system <b>200</b> allows connections to multiple network computers. A memory-mapped graphics adapter <b>230</b> and hard disk <b>232</b> may also be connected to I/O bus <b>212</b> as depicted, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may vary. For example, other peripheral devices, such as optical disk drives and the like, also may be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The data processing system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be, for example, an IBM eServer pSeries system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system or LINUX operating system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a block diagram illustrating a data processing system is depicted in which the present invention may be implemented.

More particularly, data processing system <b>300</b> submits an XML-formatted database transaction request that includes a client identifier and defines the desired database transaction type and various attributes of the transaction request.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Data processing system <b>300</b> employs a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) local bus architecture. Although the depicted example employs a PCI bus, other bus architectures such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) may be used. Processor <b>302</b> and main memory <b>304</b> are connected to PCI local bus <b>306</b> through PCI bridge <b>308</b>. PCI bridge <b>308</b> also may include an integrated memory controller and cache memory for processor <b>302</b>. Additional connections to PCI local bus <b>306</b> may be made through direct component interconnection or through add-in boards. In the depicted example, local area network (LAN) adapter <b>310</b>, SCSI host bus adapter <b>312</b>, and expansion bus interface <b>314</b> are connected to PCI local bus <b>306</b> by direct component connection. In contrast, audio adapter <b>316</b>, graphics adapter <b>318</b>, and audio/video adapter <b>319</b> are connected to PCI local bus <b>306</b> by add-in boards inserted into expansion slots. Graphics adapter <b>318</b> drives a display device <b>107</b> that provides the computer interface, or GUI, for displaying handwritten characters as supplied by the user. Expansion bus interface <b>314</b> provides a connection for a keyboard and mouse adapter <b>320</b>, modem <b>322</b>, and additional memory <b>324</b>. A pointer device such as mouse <b>109</b> is connected with adapter <b>320</b> and enables supply of pointer input to system <b>300</b> by a user. Small computer system interface (SCSI) host bus adapter <b>312</b> provides a connection for hard disk drive <b>326</b>, tape drive <b>328</b>, and CD-ROM drive <b>330</b>. Typical PCI local bus implementations will support three or four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of database table <b>400</b> maintained in storage unit <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that is accessible by clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Table <b>400</b> consists of records <b>410</b>-<b>413</b> that include respective data elements in fields <b>420</b>-<b>423</b>. Table <b>400</b> has a label, or identifier, assigned thereto. In the present example, table <b>400</b> has a label of “Problem.” Fields <b>420</b>-<b>423</b> have a respective label, or identifier, that facilitates insertion, deletion, querying, or other data operations or manipulations of table <b>400</b>. In the illustrative example, fields <b>420</b>-<b>423</b> have respective labels of “Ticket”, “UserID”, “Severity”, and “Description.” Fields <b>420</b>-<b>423</b> contain respective data elements of a common data type. The data elements of field <b>420</b> are unique and comprise a key value for identifying a particular record. Four exemplary records are contained in table <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Table <b>400</b> is representative of a database used for maintaining help desk problem descriptions and status information.

Transaction requests issued by clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are formatted in a common format and are communicated to data processing system <b>200</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, transaction requests issued by clients <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>112</b> consist of XML-formatted documents having transaction request fields that consist of XML elements defining the transaction type and attributes of the transaction request.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary transaction request <b>500</b> issued by a client, such as client <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that is communicated to data processing system <b>200</b>. Transaction request <b>500</b> is an XML-formatted document that includes a user identifier (userID) and various transaction request attributes. For purposes of discussion, assume transaction request <b>500</b> is issued by client <b>108</b> having a userID of client_A.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the illustrative example, the transaction request is delineated with request element <b>501</b>. Transaction request <b>500</b> includes userID element <b>502</b> including value <b>503</b> consisting of a text element of “client_A”. A transaction type is specified by transaction element <b>504</b> including value <b>505</b> consisting of a text element of “insert”. A database field target is specified by problem element <b>508</b>. Problem element <b>508</b> identifies table <b>400</b> as the database target to which transaction request <b>500</b> is directed. Problem element <b>508</b> includes elements specifying particular field targets and values. In the illustrative example, severity element <b>506</b> has a value <b>507</b> of “2”. Additionally, problem element <b>508</b> includes description element <b>510</b> having value <b>511</b> of “Description_Text_A”.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, transaction request <b>500</b> is representative of a transaction request to insert a record in table <b>400</b>. Particularly, transaction request <b>500</b> specifies a value of “2” to be inserted in Severity field <b>422</b> and a text string of “Description_Text_A” to be inserted in Description field <b>423</b> of the inserted record.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary transaction request <b>600</b> issued by a client, such as client <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that does not include non-required data and that is communicated to data processing system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.

In the illustrative example, description element <b>606</b> has value <b>607</b> of “Description_Text_B,” and transaction request <b>600</b> does not include an element that specifies a value for the severity field of the targeted table.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus, transaction request <b>600</b> is representative of a transaction request to insert a record in table <b>400</b> with a text string of “Description_Text_B” to be inserted in Description field <b>423</b> of the inserted record.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a portion of an exemplary validation document <b>700</b> from which a validation object is derived that is used by the server for validating and configuring database transaction requests as implemented according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Exemplary validation document <b>700</b> is an XML-formatted document although other document formats may be suitably substituted. Exemplary validation document <b>700</b> consists of various XML elements that describe access criteria for different clients. In particular, a client validation criteria consists of XML elements delineated by a criteria element.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrative example, exemplary validation document <b>700</b> includes user identifiers implemented as tag attributes <b>711</b> and <b>751</b> of user elements <b>710</b> and <b>750</b>. Tag attribute <b>711</b> has a value of “client_A” and tag attribute <b>751</b> has a value of “client_B”. Validation criteria for client_A are included within user element <b>710</b>. Likewise, validation criteria for client_B are included within user element <b>750</b>. Two exemplary transaction criteria are defined for each of the clients in exemplary validation document <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each criteria is defined by three child elements, namely a required element, a path element, and a default element. The required element denotes whether the transaction request must include data for the path specified by the path element of the respective criteria. The default element may specify a default value if the required element indicates the path data is not required. A default value is used by the validation algorithm to configure a database command if the path data is not provided by the transaction request and the required element indicates the path data is not required. If a required element specifies that the transaction request must include data for the path identified by the path element, an error, or exception, is generated in the event that the transaction request does not include the required data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A first transaction criteria for client_A is delineated by criteria1 element <b>718</b>, and a second transaction criteria is delineated by criteria2 element <b>738</b>. Criteria1 element <b>718</b> includes required element <b>722</b> having value <b>723</b> of “true,” thus indicating that transaction request <b>500</b> must include data for the path specified by path element <b>728</b>. Path element <b>728</b> includes value <b>729</b> of “Problem.Severity.” In the illustrative examples, a database path is specified in dot notation. For example, “Problem.Severity” indicates a database path consisting of table <b>400</b> labeled “Problem” and field <b>422</b> labeled “Severity.” It should be noted that a path specified in a client transaction request may or may not form a literal database path. For example, the path specified by problem and severity elements <b>508</b> and <b>506</b> of transaction request <b>500</b> may be mapped by, for example, column maps included within the configuration object or by another application adapted to map a client request to a particular database path. As referred to herein, a database path may refer to a literal database path or to a path that is mapped to a particular database target. Default element <b>734</b> is nulled. The second criteria of client_A includes required element <b>742</b> having value <b>743</b> of “true” that indicates transaction request <b>500</b> must include data for a path “userID” specified by value <b>747</b> of path element <b>746</b>. Default element <b>748</b> is nulled.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First and second transaction criteria of client_B are delineated by criteria1 element <b>758</b> and criteria2 element <b>774</b>, respectively. Criteria1 element <b>758</b> includes required element <b>762</b> having value <b>763</b> of “false” thus indicating that transaction request <b>600</b> does not have to include data for the path “Problem.Severity” specified by value <b>767</b> of path element <b>766</b>. A default value <b>771</b> of “3” is included within default element <b>770</b>. The second criteria of client_B includes a required element <b>778</b> having a value <b>779</b> of “true” that indicates transaction request <b>600</b> must include data for the path “userID” specified by value <b>783</b> of path element <b>782</b>. Default element <b>786</b> is nulled.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, exemplary validation document <b>700</b> is used as a source file that will be marshalled into a validation object that may be loaded into memory <b>209</b> of data processing system <b>200</b>. For example, exemplary validation document <b>700</b> may be processed with a Java Architecture for XML binding application to generate a validation object, such as a Java bean. The validation object includes computer-readable logic corresponding to the client criteria of exemplary validation document <b>700</b> and is loaded into the server memory as a singleton in-memory object. Accordingly, transaction requests from multiple clients may be validated and configured with the singleton in-memory validation object. Moreover, the validation object may be used to configure an SQL command including default path data for path data that is not specified in the transaction request.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Data processing system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes an XML-parser as a subroutine of the validation algorithm for evaluating the transaction request content of transaction requests <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5 and 600</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and comparing the transaction request content with the criteria defined in the validation object. The validation algorithm generates an exception and communicates the exception to the client when the transaction request fails any corresponding client criteria defined in the validation object when no default value is specified for the particular criteria. The validation algorithm generates an SQL command for submission to a database backend that performs SQL transactions with table <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> maintained in storage unit <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for any transaction request determined to conform with the validation object. A transaction request not including non-required data is validated by the validation algorithm. An SQL command is then generated using the default value for the non-required data.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart <b>800</b> showing the validation algorithm processing performed by data processing system <b>200</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Data processing system <b>200</b> receives a transaction request and a criteria index counter i is initialized to 1 (step <b>802</b>). The userID and transaction type is parsed from the transaction request (step <b>804</b>). A criteria i for the userID and transaction parsed from the transaction request is read from the validation object (step <b>808</b>). An evaluation is made to determine if the transaction request includes the path data specified in criteria i (step <b>810</b>). The validation algorithm validates the request for criteria i and proceeds to increment the criteria index counter i if the transaction request includes the path data specified in criteria i (step <b>812</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, an evaluation is made to determine if default data is specified in criteria i if the path data is not included in the transaction request (step <b>814</b>). The validation algorithm validates the request if default data is specified and saves the default data (step <b>815</b>). The validation algorithm proceeds to increment the criteria index counter (step <b>812</b>) after saving the default data. If, however, an evaluation of criteria i indicates no default data is specified, the validation algorithm proceeds to evaluate whether the path data is required (step <b>816</b>). If the path data is required, an exception is generated (step <b>817</b>) and the validation algorithm exits (step <b>818</b>). Alternatively, the validation algorithm validates the request against the current criteria i and proceeds to increment the criteria index counter i (step <b>812</b>) if the path data is not required for request validation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, a request may be validated against a particular criteria i by: including data for a path specified by criteria i; excluding path data specified by criteria i that has default data specified for the path; or by excluding data for a path that is specified as non-required by criteria i. The request is validated by the validation algorithm if a successful validation is made for each criteria of the validation object for the particular client and transaction type.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After validating a request against the current criteria i, the validation algorithm proceeds to determine if an additional criteria remains for examination to validate the transaction request (step <b>820</b>). The validation algorithm returns back to step <b>808</b> to read the remaining criteria if an additional criteria remains for evaluation. Otherwise, the transaction request is validated and an SQL command is generated according to the transaction request and any saved default path data identified for proper configuration of the transaction request (step <b>822</b>). The SQL command may then be communicated to the database system for processing and the validation algorithm exits (step <b>824</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, the present invention may better be understood with descriptions of client transaction request processing in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. Transaction request <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is communicated from client <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to data processing system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The XML-parser subroutine of the validation algorithm executed by data processing system <b>200</b> is adapted to parse data elements from transaction request <b>500</b> and compare the data element values with criteria defined in the validation object.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Values <b>503</b> and <b>505</b> of respective userID element <b>502</b> and transaction element <b>504</b> are parsed from transaction request <b>500</b>. First and second criteria defined in the validation object are identified for client <b>108</b> by matching the userID and transaction values parsed from transaction request <b>500</b> with attribute values <b>711</b> and <b>703</b> of user element <b>710</b> and transaction element <b>702</b>, respectively. Transaction request <b>500</b> is then evaluated against the criteria defined in the validation object. Criteria1 element <b>718</b> specifies that data for the path “Problem.Severity” must be specified in transaction request <b>500</b>. The validation algorithm confirms that transaction request <b>500</b> includes data for the required database path, namely the value of “2”. Criteria2 element <b>738</b> specifies that data for the path “userID” must be specified. The validation algorithm confirms that transaction request <b>500</b> includes data for the required database path, namely a user ID value of “client_A.” An SQL command is then generated conforming to transaction request <b>500</b>. The following exemplary SQL command is generated by the validation algorithm after validation of transaction request <b>500</b>:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">insert into Problem
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0056">values (‘client_A’, ‘2’, ‘Description_Text_A’)
<br/>
The SQL insert command is then communicated to the database backend and processed accordingly.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Assume now data processing system <b>200</b> receives transaction request <b>600</b> from client <b>110</b>. Values <b>603</b> and <b>605</b> of userID element <b>602</b> and transaction element <b>604</b> are parsed from transaction request <b>600</b>. First and second criteria for client <b>110</b> defined in the validation object are identified by matching the userID and transaction values parsed from transaction request <b>600</b> with attribute values <b>751</b> and <b>703</b> of user element <b>750</b> and transaction element <b>702</b>, respectively, of the validation object. Transaction request <b>600</b> is then evaluated against the identified criteria. Criteria1 element <b>758</b> indicates that a value for the path “Problem.Severity” is not required to be specified in transaction request <b>600</b>. The validation algorithm evaluates transaction request <b>600</b> for path data for the path identified by criteria1 element <b>758</b>. The validation algorithm determines that transaction request <b>600</b> does not include data for the path “Problem.Severity” identified by criteria1 element <b>758</b>. The validation algorithm then evaluates criteria1 element <b>758</b> to determine if default data is specified for the path. In the present example, default value <b>771</b> of “3” is specified for the path and the validation algorithm proceeds to evaluate transaction request <b>600</b> against the second criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Criteria2 element <b>774</b> specifies that data for the path “userID” must be specified. The validation algorithm confirms that transaction request <b>600</b> includes data for the required database path, namely a user ID value of “client_B.” An SQL command is then generated for transaction request <b>600</b>. In the particular example, the validation algorithm configures the SQL command according to the data included in transaction request <b>600</b> and default data identified for the database path “Problem.Severity.” The following SQL command is generated by the validation algorithm after validation of transaction request <b>600</b>:

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">The SQL command generated by the validation algorithm includes transaction request data, for example the data targeted for insertion in Description field <b>423</b>, that is parsed from transaction request <b>600</b> and default data identified for the database path “Problem.Severity” that is not included in transaction request <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">As described, the present invention provides a singleton in-memory object used to validate and configure database transaction requests from clients having different validation criteria.
