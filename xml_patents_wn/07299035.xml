<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a server device, a mobile communications terminal, an information transmitting system and an information transmitting method, and more particularly to a server device which transmits pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses to a mobile communications terminal, an information transmitting system, an information transmitting method, and a mobile communications terminal which receives pattern data transmitted from the server device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current development of mobile communications technology has been remarkable, and our daily life activities are made increasingly convenient in the current age of the “information society”. For example, as a result of the spread of the internet, useful application programs and data files can easily be downloaded into terminal devices such as personal computers or the like, and can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, items that are downloaded into terminal devices via the internet are not always limited to useful application programs and data. Specifically, computer viruses that destroy useful application programs and data also frequently invade terminal devices via the internet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, computer virus detection techniques using pattern matching systems are known as techniques for detecting whether or not a computer virus has invaded a terminal device. In such techniques, a database accommodating characteristic data sequences (hereafter referred to as “pattern data”) contained in computer viruses is transmitted to a terminal device from a server device and stored in the terminal device, and the abovementioned pattern data is compared with application programs and data that are similarly stored in the terminal device. As a result, in cases where application programs or data contain the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that these application programs or data contain a computer virus. In cases where computer virus detection techniques using pattern matching systems are utilized, it is necessary that the abovementioned database be successively updated to the most recent version in order to increase the probability of detecting computer viruses. Accordingly, when a new type of computer virus is detected, characteristic pattern data contained in this computer virus is transmitted to the terminal device from the server device, and the abovementioned database of the terminal device is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the following problems have been encountered in cases where the abovementioned conventional technique is used to detect computer viruses in a mobile communications terminal such as a portable telephone. Specifically, in the case of such a mobile communications terminal, the memory capacity and CPU capacity are insufficient compared to those of a terminal device such as a personal computer or the like. Accordingly, it is difficult to store all of the abovementioned database in a mobile communications terminal, and to compare all of the pattern data contained in this database with the application programs and data in the mobile communications terminal in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, while terminal devices such as personal computers or the like and server devices are usual connected by a wire circuit, mobile communications terminals and server devices are connected by a wireless circuit. Accordingly, in cases where all of the abovementioned database is transmitted to a mobile communications terminal from a server device, a very large wireless resource is consumed. For such reasons, the detection of computer viruses in mobile communications terminals cannot be efficient performed in the case of the abovementioned conventional technique.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, the operation of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described, and an information transmitting method constituting an embodiment of the present invention will also be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart which illustrates the operation of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment. In the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is sent to the portable telephone <b>100</b> from the server device <b>10</b>, a pattern data transmission request is first transmitted from the pattern data request transmitting unit <b>111</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> to the server device <b>10</b> (S<b>102</b>).

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The pattern data that is extracted by the pattern data extraction unit <b>13</b> is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> from the pattern data transmitting unit <b>14</b> (S<b>108</b>), and is received by the pattern data receiving unit <b>112</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>110</b>). The pattern data received by the portable telephone <b>100</b> is temporarily stored in the pattern data storage unit <b>113</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Subsequently, the pattern data stored in the pattern data storage unit <b>102</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> and the data (including application programs) stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b> are compared by the pattern data comparing unit <b>103</b> (S<b>114</b>), and a judgement is made as to whether or not the data stored in the memory of the portable telephone <b>100</b> has a portion that matches the abovementioned pattern data. Furthermore, the comparison of the data stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b> and the pattern data may be initiated at the time that the pattern data is received (or after a fixed period of time has elapsed following the reception of this pattern data); alternatively, this comparison may be initiated by instructions from the user of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, or may be periodically initiated on the basis of a predetermined period.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In cases where the results of the abovementioned comparison indicate that no portion matching the abovementioned pattern data is contained in the data stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b>, it is judged that no computer virus is present in the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and the processing is ended. On the other hand, in cases where a portion that matches the abovementioned pattern data is contained in the data stored in the memory of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, it is judged that a computer virus is present in the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and the processing of a warning to the user of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, processing that prohibits the execution of the application program in which the computer virus has been detected, processing that repairs the data in which the computer virus has been detected or the like is executed on the basis of predetermined set information by the computer virus processing unit <b>115</b> (S<b>116</b>). Furthermore, the, abovementioned warning processing, execution prohibition processing and repair processing are respectively similar to existing warning processing, execution prohibition processing and repair processing that are performed in cases where computer viruses are detected in personal computers.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, the effects and merits of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described. Computer viruses include many viruses that depend on the hardware or software of portable telephones. Furthermore, the quantity of pattern data that can be received, the quantity of pattern data that can be stored and the quantity of pattern data that can be compared vary according to the hardware and software of the portable telephone in question. In this regard, the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is devised so that when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> from the server device <b>10</b>, specified pattern data is extracted on the basis of the model name of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (information that specifies both the hardware and software), and this specified pattern data that is extracted is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device <b>10</b> to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b> and the quantity of pattern data that is compared by the portable telephone <b>100</b> can be efficiently reduced in accordance with the hardware and software of the portable telephone <b>100</b>. As a result, the detection of computer viruses in the portable telephone <b>100</b> can be performed in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the abovementioned embodiment, the portable telephone <b>100</b> sends a pattern data transmission request that includes the model name of the portable telephone <b>100</b> to the server device <b>10</b>, and the server device <b>10</b> extracts pattern data on the basis of this model name. However, various modifications of this embodiment are conceivable. For example, the system may be devised so that the portable telephone <b>100</b> transmits a pattern data transmission request that includes the name of the maker of the portable telephone <b>100</b> to the server device <b>10</b>, and the server device <b>10</b> extracts pattern data on the basis of this maker's name. Furthermore, instead of the model name or the name of the maker of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, it would also be possible to use the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, the name of the operating system, the security level, the permissible communications charge or the like. Moreover, in the pattern data database <b>11</b><i>a</i>, it would also be possible to extract and arrange the pattern data that is to be transmitted to the portable telephone according to respective model names beforehand.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As one example, a modification in which a pattern data transmission request that includes the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b> is sent to the server device <b>10</b> by the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and the server device <b>10</b> extracts pattern data on the basis of this memory capacity, will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the present modification, a pattern data database <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used instead of the pattern data database <b>11</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Pattern data, the degree of danger of computer viruses having this pattern data and the size of this pattern data are stored in association with each other in the pattern data database <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Here, the “degree of danger” of a computer virus is an indicator that indicates the virulence of the [deleterious] effect of the computer virus in question; for example, a degree of danger of “A” indicates that the [deleterious] effect of the computer virus is extremely great, a degree of danger of “B” indicates that the [deleterious] effect is considerable, and a degree of danger of “C” indicates that the [deleterious] effect is small.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart which shows the flow of the processing of the information transmitting system of the present modification. In the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the present modification, when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted from the server device <b>10</b> to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, a pattern data transmission request is first transmitted to the server device <b>10</b> from the pattern data transmission request transmitting unit <b>111</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>122</b>) Here, the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b> is included in the pattern data transmission request. Here, furthermore, the “memory capacity” may be the capacity of the entire memory region, or may be the capacity of the empty region; alternatively, this memory capacity may be the capacity of a region that is assigned beforehand for the purpose of storing pattern data. Furthermore, the term “memory” used here includes not only the internal memory of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, but also memories that may be connected to the portable telephone <b>100</b>. The pattern data transmission request that is transmitted from the portable telephone <b>100</b> is received by the pattern data transmission request receiving unit <b>12</b> of the server device <b>10</b> (S<b>104</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When a pattern data transmission request is received by the pattern data transmission request receiving unit <b>12</b> of the server device <b>10</b>, specified pattern data is extracted from a plurality of sets of pattern data by the pattern data extraction unit <b>13</b> on the basis of the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b> that is included in the abovementioned pattern data transmission request (S<b>126</b>) To describe this in greater detail, specified pattern data that is to be transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> is extracted from the pattern data stored in the pattern data database <b>111</b><i>b </i>of the storage unit <b>11</b> in order from the highest degree of danger that does not exceed the range of the abovementioned memory capacity. For example, in a case where the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b> is “40 kB”, “pattern data 1” (degree of danger A, 15 kB) and “pattern data 6” (degree of danger A, 20 kB) are extracted information transmitting system he pattern data database <b>11</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Subsequently, the processing of S<b>128</b> through S<b>136</b> is the same as the processing of S<b>108</b> through S<b>116</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The quantity of pattern data that can be stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b> depends on the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b>. By extracting pattern data on the basis of the memory capacity of the portable telephone <b>100</b> and transmitting the extracted pattern data to the portable telephone <b>100</b> as in the present modification, it is possible to achieve an efficient reduction in the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device <b>10</b> to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and the quantity of pattern data that is compared by the portable telephone <b>100</b>, in accordance with the memory capacity of this portable telephone <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Next, while reference is made to the application program database <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the storage unit <b>41</b>, a judgement is made by the pattern data transmitting unit <b>44</b> as to whether or not the respective application programs extracted by the pattern data extraction unit <b>43</b> are present in the server device <b>40</b>. Here, in the case of application programs that are not present in the server device <b>40</b>, it cannot be detected whether or not a computer virus is contained in the server device. Accordingly, in the case of pattern data for computer viruses in which application programs that are not present in the server device <b>40</b> are the object of detection, this pattern data is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>408</b>). Furthermore, in the case of pattern data for computer viruses in which application programs that are present in the server device <b>40</b> are the object of detection, this pattern data is not transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>.

To describe this in greater detail, the pattern data extracted by the pattern data extraction unit <b>43</b> is compared with the application programs, and a judgement is made as to whether or not the application programs have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data. Here, in cases where the application programs have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that a computer virus is contained in these application programs, while in cases where the application programs do not have portions that match the abovementioned pattern data, it is judged that no computer virus is contained in these application programs.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, in a case where the two application programs “application program 1” and “application program 2” are extracted by the pattern data extraction unit <b>43</b>, it is found that “application program 2” is not present in the server device <b>40</b> when reference is made to the application program database <b>41</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Accordingly, “pattern data 2”, which is pattern data for a computer virus in which “application program 2” is the object of detection is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>. On the other hand, since “application program 1” is present in the server device <b>40</b>, “pattern data 1”, which is pattern data for a computer virus in which “application program 1” is the object of detection, is not transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and this “pattern data 1” is used by the pattern data comparing unit <b>45</b> of the server device <b>40</b> to detect whether or not a computer virus is contained in “application program 1”.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In cases where it is judged by the pattern data comparing unit <b>45</b> that a computer virus is contained in a specified application program, processing that sends a warning to the manager of the server device <b>40</b>, processing that prohibits downloading of the application program in question, processing that deletes this application program or the like is performed by the computer virus processing unit <b>46</b> on the basis of predetermined set information (S<b>420</b>). Furthermore, in cases where it is judged by the pattern data comparing unit <b>45</b> that a computer virus is contained in a specified application program, a warning indicating that a computer virus is contained in this specified application program is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> from the computer virus processing unit <b>46</b> (S<b>422</b>), and this warning is received by the computer virus processing unit <b>115</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>424</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Next, the effects and merits of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described.

<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In cases where the number of times that computer virus detection information has been received by the computer virus detection information receiving unit <b>75</b> reaches a number that is equal to or greater than a predetermined fixed number, the warning transmitting unit <b>76</b> transmits a warning to portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission. More concretely, in cases where the number of times that pattern data in the computer virus detection information database <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the storage unit <b>71</b> has been detected reaches a number that is equal to or greater than a preset threshold value, a warning is transmitted to portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission. Here, for example, the term “portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission” may refer to all of the portable telephone for which a utilization agreement has been concluded with the mobile communications business operator, or all of the portable telephones for which an agreement to utilize a computer virus detection service has been concluded.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Furthermore, the portable telephone <b>100</b> of the information transmitting system <b>7</b> has a construction similar to that of the portable telephone of the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the abovementioned first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Next, the operation of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described, and an information transmitting system constituting an embodiment of the present invention will also be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a flow chart which shows the operation of the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment. The processing of S<b>702</b> through S<b>716</b> in the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment is similar to the processing of S<b>102</b> through S<b>116</b> that was described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment, furthermore, in cases where the data that is stored in the memory of the portable telephone <b>100</b> includes portions that match specified pattern data, computer virus detection information that includes this pattern data is transmitted to the server device <b>70</b> from the computer virus processing unit <b>115</b> of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>718</b>), and this computer virus detection information is received by the computer virus detection information receiving unit <b>75</b> of the server device <b>70</b> (S<b>720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">When computer virus detection information is received by the computer virus detection information receiving unit <b>75</b>, reference is made to the pattern data that is included in the computer virus detection information, and 1 is added to the number of times that corresponding pattern data in the computer virus detection information database <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the storage unit <b>1</b> has been detected (S<b>722</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Furthermore, the computer virus detection information database <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the storage unit <b>71</b> is periodically referred to by the warning transmitting unit <b>76</b>, and in cases where the number of times that pattern data in the computer virus detection information database <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the storage unit <b>71</b> has been detected reaches a number that is equal to or greater than a threshold value that has been set beforehand for the number of times that this pattern data is detected, a warning is transmitted to portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission (S<b>724</b>). The warnings transmitted from the server device <b>70</b> are received by the portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission (S<b>726</b>). In this case, the portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission may be narrowed down on the basis of the model names, operating system names or the like of the portable telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Next, the effects and merits of the information transmitting system of the present embodiment will be described. In the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment, as in the information transmitting system <b>1</b> of the abovementioned first embodiment, when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted from the server device <b>70</b> to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, specified pattern data is extracted on the basis of the model name of the portable telephone <b>100</b> (information that specifies both the hardware and software), and the specified pattern data that is thus extracted is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device <b>70</b> to the portable telephone <b>100</b>, the quantity of data that is stored in the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and the quantity of data that is compared by the portable telephone <b>100</b>, can be efficiently reduced in accordance with the software and hardware of the portable telephone <b>100</b>. As a result, the detection of computer viruses in the portable telephone <b>100</b> can be accomplished in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Furthermore, in the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment, the server device <b>70</b> receives computer virus detection information from the portable telephone, and in cases where the number of times that such computer virus detection information data is received reaches a number that is equal to or greater than a predetermined fixed number, a warning is transmitted to portable telephones that are the object of warning transmission. Accordingly, the portable telephones can be warned regarding a widely spread computer virus.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Here, the information transmitting system <b>7</b> of the present embodiment extracts specified pattern data on the basis of the model name of the portable telephone <b>100</b>, and transmits the specified pattern data that is thus extracted to the portable telephone <b>100</b>. However, it would also be possible to devise this system so that specified pattern data extracted on the basis of the memory capacity, operating system, downloading history of application programs or the like is transmitted to the portable telephone <b>100</b> as described in the respective embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Furthermore, in the information transmitting systems of the respective embodiments described above, it would also be possible to devise the system so that pattern data that has already been utilized by the portable telephone <b>100</b> (i.e., pattern data for which comparative processing has been completed) is deleted. By deleting pattern data that has already been utilized, it is possible to utilize the memory of the portable telephone <b>100</b> in an effective manner. In regard to the deletion of pattern data, the following aspects maybe indicated. For example, the deletion of pattern data may be performed for a portion of the pattern data rather than for all of the pattern data. Furthermore, the deletion of pattern data may be initiated when an effective deadline set beforehand for the pattern data has passed, or may be initiated after a fixed period of time has elapsed following the completion of comparative processing. Furthermore, the deletion of pattern data may also be initiated by instructions from the server device or by instructions from the user of the portable telephone. Moreover, this deletion may be initiated following the detection of computer viruses or following the completion of repair processing.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Furthermore, the constituent elements of the information transmitting systems of the respective embodiments described above are physically disposed in a single server device; however, it would also be possible to physically disperse these constituent elements among a plurality of server devices. For example, in the server device <b>20</b> of the second embodiment, it would be possible to devise the system so that the pattern data extraction unit <b>23</b> and terminal information database <b>21</b><i>a </i>are present in physically different server devices, and so that the pattern data extraction unit <b>23</b> sends inquiries regarding terminal information to physically different server devices.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the server device, information transmitting system and information transmitting method of the present invention, when pattern data used for the detection of computer viruses is transmitted to a mobile communications terminal, specified pattern data is extracted on the basis of terminal information such as the hardware or software of the mobile communications terminal, the reception history of data in the mobile communications terminal or the like, and the specified pattern data that is thus extracted is transmitted to the mobile communications terminal. Accordingly, the quantity of pattern data that is transmitted from the server device to the mobile communications terminal, the quantity of pattern data that is stored in the mobile communications terminal, and the quantity of pattern data that is compared by the mobile communications terminal, can be efficiently reduced in accordance with the conditions of this mobile communications terminal. As a result, the detection of computer viruses in the mobile communications terminal can be accomplished in an efficient manner.</p>
