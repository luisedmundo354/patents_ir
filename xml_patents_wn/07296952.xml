<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to slider-operated plastic zippers intended for use in reclosable pouches, bags or other packages. In particular, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for feeding sliders to a slider insertion device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reclosable fastener assemblies are useful for sealing thermoplastic pouches or bags. Such fastener assemblies often include a plastic zipper and a slider. Typically, the plastic zippers include a pair of interlockable fastener elements, or profiles, that form a closure. As the slider moves across the profiles, the profiles are opened or closed. The profiles in plastic zippers can take on various configurations, e.g. interlocking rib and groove elements having so-called male and female profiles, interlocking alternating hook-shaped closure elements, etc. Reclosable bags having slider-operated zippers are generally more desirable to consumers than bags having zippers without sliders because the slider eliminates the need for the consumer to align the interlockable zipper profiles before causing those profiles to engage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional slider-operated zipper assemblies typically comprise a plastic zipper having two interlocking profiles and a slider for opening and closing the zipper. In one type of slider-operated zipper assembly, the slider straddles the zipper and has a separating finger at one end that is inserted between the profiles to force them apart as the slider is moved along the zipper in an opening direction. The other end of the slider is sufficiently narrow to force the profiles into engagement and close the zipper when the slider is moved along the zipper in a closing direction. Other types of slider-operated zipper assemblies avoid the use of a separating finger. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,047,450 discloses a zipper comprising a pair of mutually interlockable profiled structures, portions of which form a fulcrum about which the profiled structures may be pivoted out of engagement when lower edges of the bases are forced towards each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An improvement in sliders is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,954,970 entitled “Insertion Apparatus for Attaching Sliders onto Zipper Bags and Film”. This slider can be inserted on the zipper so that the zipper is secured in the slider. As a result, during an opening of the reclosable bag the interlocking closure elements of the zipper will not unintentionally re-engage within the slider. For example, a reengagement of the interlocking closure elements could occur when the zipper opening end of the slider is pushed toward a closed zipper park position. Such a re-engagement can occur during operation of the zipper or if the slider is inserted too far from a slider end stop on the zipper. By reducing the possibility of unintentional re-engagement of the interlocking members of the profiles, production of defective bags is reduced. U.S. Pat. No. 6,954,970 discloses a slider insertion apparatus comprising an activator that opens a first portion of a zipper tape, a pusher that inserts the slider onto a second portion of the zipper tape, and a zipper guide that holds a third portion of the zipper tape closed. The zipper guide and the activator with pusher are manufactured to facilitate forward movement of the zipper tape within the slider insertion apparatus; to properly position the profiles of a section of zipper for slider insertion; and to secure an adjacent section of the zipper when the slider is inserted. A loading rack with a supply of sliders may be part of the slider insertion apparatus, with the loading rack being a mechanically attachable device or module.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems for transporting sliders to a slider insertion device are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,666,626 (incorporated by reference herein) entitled “System for Transporting Sliders for Zipper Bags”. That application discloses feeding sliders into a slider insertion device by means of a feeder tube that only accepts correctly oriented sliders having an asymmetric profile, i.e., one leg of the slider is longer than the other leg. Sliders are launched into the feeder tube by a sender apparatus that is controlled by a programmable controller based on feedback received by the controller from various sensors that detect the presence or absence of sliders at particular locations in the slider transport system. The sliders are pneumatically transported in predetermined quantities from a supply of sliders, e.g., a vibratory hopper, to a loading rack.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,666,626 discloses embodiments in which sliders are transported via a flexible feeder tube that connects an exit port of the sending apparatus with an entry port of a loading rack mounted to a slider insertion device or of the slider insertion device itself. In the case where a single feeder tube is used, the length of that tube must be selected as a function of the available layout at a particular plant or facility. The length of feeder tube will need to be at least equal to the distance separating the exit port of the slider sender apparatus and the entry port of the slider insertion apparatus, which in turn will depend on placement of those apparatus. The placement of equipment is a function of the location and configuration of the available space and the presence of obstacles or impediments to the feeder tube being laid in a straight line. These factors will vary from plant to plant, making it necessary to customize the feeder tube length for each installation of slider insertion equipment. In particular, measurements will need to be made at the site of installation before the feeder tube is cut and shipped by the equipment vendor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, when the automated slider insertion equipment is moved from one location in a plant to another location in the same plant or to a different plant, a length of feeder tube that was suitable for one layout of the equipment may become unsuitable when that equipment is rearranged at a new site where new specifications must be met. If a shorter feeder tube is needed, then of course the existing feeder tube can be cut, but in the case where re-installation or re-configuration of the slider insertion system mandates a longer feeder tube, the existing short feeder tube may be rendered unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the labor involved in measuring a site where slider insertion equipment is to be installed, calculating the length of the feeder tube required, and then cutting feeder tubing to the calculated length must increase the cost of the equipment. Further, errors in measurement or prediction could give rise to inefficiencies and economic loss.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need for a feeder tube system that can be easily adapted to suit different manufacturing plant circumstances. In particular, there is a need for a slider feeder tube system in which the overall length of the slider feeder tubing can be varied to fit the requirements of any installation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to a modular slider feeder tube system that can be easily assembled to meet any length requirement. This is accomplished by connecting two or more feeder tubes in a chain to form a conduit of sufficient length. The feeder tubes may be cut to one or more predetermined lengths and stored in inventory. For each installation, a predetermined number of feeder tubes can be shipped and then linked together by the installer at the installation site. The feeder tubes are spliced together using tube coupling devices that also form a part of the invention. The invention is further directed to a method for installing a modular feeder tube system to connect a slider sender apparatus to a slider insertion apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One aspect of the invention is a tube made of resilient material and comprising a channel that extends from a first opening at one end of the tube to a second opening at the other end of the tube, the first opening having a first profile that is asymmetric and the second opening having a second profile different than the first profile, the area of the second profile being greater than the area of the first profile. The channel comprises two sections, a relatively longer channel section running from the first opening to an intermediate point along the tube length and a relatively shorter channel running from the intermediate point to the second opening. The longer channel section has the first profile along its entire length.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the invention is a tube coupling device comprising an elongated body and first and second clamping plates. The elongated body comprises a central section, a first mandrel projecting from one end of the central section, a second mandrel projecting from the other end of the central section, and a channel of constant profile running through the first and second mandrels and the central section. The first and second clamping plates are fastened to opposing sides of the central section. The first clamping plate comprises a first projection directed toward the first mandrel and a second projection directed toward the second mandrel, while the second clamping plate comprises a third projection directed toward the first mandrel and a fourth projection directed toward the second mandrel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further aspect of the invention is a modular feeder tube system comprising first and second feeder tubes having respective ends that are coupled by a tube coupling device. Each of the first and second feeder tubes is made of resilient material and comprises a respective channel having a profile that is asymmetric and substantially constant along the lengths of the channels. The tube coupling device also comprises a channel, via which channel the channel of the first feeder tube communicates with the channel of the second feeder tube. Each of the channels maintains the orientation of each slider passing therethrough so that the same end of the slider is always in the lead.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of installing a modular feeder tube system to connect a slider sending apparatus to a slider insertion apparatus, comprising the following steps: (a) coupling first through N-th feeder tubes together in a chain, wherein N≧2; (b) coupling an uncoupled end of the first feeder tube to the slider sending apparatus; and (c) coupling an uncoupled end of the N-th feeder tube to the slider insertion apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further aspect of the invention is a system comprising: a source of sliders; a slider sender apparatus coupled to receive sliders from the slider source; a modular feeder tube system comprising first through N-th feeder tubes spliced together in a chain, wherein N≧2, one end of the first feeder tube being coupled to the slider sender apparatus; and a slider insertion apparatus coupled to one end of the N-th feeder tube. Each of the slider sender apparatus, first through N-th feeder tubes, and slider insertion apparatus comprises a respective channel, the channels being in communication to form a conduit, each of the channels being profiled to maintain the orientation of each slider passing therethrough so that the same end of the slider is always in the lead.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made to the drawings, in which similar elements in different drawings bear the same reference numerals. For the purpose of illustration, the present invention will be described with reference to feeding of a slider of the type depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, application of the slider feeding system of the present invention is not limited to sliders of the type described below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The slider <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a top wall <b>16</b> and opposing side walls or arms <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> integrally with opposite sides of the top wall <b>16</b>, forming a channel having a zipper opening end <b>12</b> and a zipper closing end <b>14</b>. A leg <b>11</b> projects downward from side wall <b>17</b>. The slider comprises a keeper <b>15</b> extending downward from the top wall <b>16</b> and disposed between arms <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. The slider further comprises a plurality of mutually aligned, longitudinally extending retaining shoulders <b>19</b> projecting from the side wall <b>17</b>, and a plurality of mutually aligned, longitudinally extending retaining shoulders <b>20</b> projecting from the side wall <b>18</b>. The retaining shoulders <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> are shown as separate; however, the shoulders may be continuous along the length of the slider <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The keeper <b>15</b>, as well as the retaining shoulders <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, secure a zipper within the slider <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an end view of the zipper opening end of the slider <b>10</b> with the slider shown encompassing a portion of a zipper <b>25</b> of a type known to those skilled in the art. In the state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the keeper <b>15</b> secures an interlocking member <b>22</b> of zipper part or half <b>24</b> of zipper <b>25</b> by preventing the interlocking member <b>22</b> from moving toward the mating interlocking member <b>26</b> of zipper part or half <b>28</b>. If the interlocking members are formed of a sufficiently stiff material, the interlocking member <b>22</b> may include a slight recess to accommodate the keeper <b>15</b>. By preventing movement of the interlocking member <b>22</b> towards the interlocking member <b>26</b>, the zipper parts <b>24</b> and <b>28</b> always remain partially disengaged at the opening end, thereby reducing the possibility of an unintentional full engagement of the interlocking members within the slider.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The arms of the slider are designed with interior surfaces having lower portions that converge in a direction from the opening end of the slider to the closing end, and having upper portions that diverge in the same direction. The lower portions on the interior surfaces of the slider arms <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> press the bottom edges of the interlockable members <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> toward each other when the slider is moved in the closing direction. These members are designed with surfaces that cooperate to form a fulcrum, about which the interlockable members rotate when their bottom edges are pressed together, causing the zipper portions above the fulcrum point to separate. In particular, the male and female profiles disengage, thereby opening the zipper as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Conversely, when the slider is moved in the opposite or opening direction, the upper portions of the interior surfaces of the slider arms press the upper portions of the interlockable members <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> together, causing the zipper to close, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an arrangement view depicting a known slider feed tube and sender apparatus that provides a conduit for supplying sliders from a vibratory bowl <b>56</b> to a slider insertion device <b>52</b>. The apparatus generally includes an elongated sender track <b>58</b>, a feed tube <b>60</b>, a programmable controller <b>62</b> and an optional loading rack <b>64</b>. In the slider feeding process, a sensor <b>66</b> on the sender track <b>58</b> detects the amount of, or a lack of, sliders <b>10</b> in the sender track. The sensor <b>66</b> signals the controller <b>62</b>. In response to a signal indicating a shortage of sliders, the controller <b>62</b> actuates the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> to an operating mode. When operating, the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> releases a quantity of sliders <b>10</b> from a supply of sliders in the vibratory bowl to a slider entry port <b>68</b> of the sender track <b>58</b>. After the sensor <b>66</b> detects that the sender track <b>58</b> has a predetermined amount or an adequate quantity of sliders, the controller <b>62</b> causes the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> to shutdown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The controller <b>62</b> also actuates a solenoid-operated plunger <b>70</b> to allow the passage of sliders <b>10</b> from the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> to the sender track <b>58</b> during the operating mode of the vibratory bowl. During the shutdown mode of the vibratory bowl <b>56</b>, a reciprocating piston <b>72</b> of the solenoid-operated plunger <b>70</b> blocks the passage of sliders <b>10</b> from the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> to the sender track <b>58</b>. The quantity of sliders <b>10</b> released to the sender track <b>58</b> is pushed along the sender track by directional air connections <b>74</b>, which pneumatically push the sliders to a slider exit port <b>76</b> of the sender track <b>58</b>. The air connections <b>74</b> are fluidly supplied by pressurized air from an air register <b>78</b> or any other source of pressurized air.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another solenoid-operated plunger <b>80</b> is positioned at the slider exit port <b>76</b>. Once the sliders <b>10</b> are sent to the slider exit port <b>76</b>, they are ready to be launched into the feeder tube <b>60</b>. Launching of the sliders <b>10</b> is based, at least partly, upon the amount of sliders in the loading rack <b>64</b>. A sensor <b>82</b> at the loading rack <b>64</b> detects a lack of sliders <b>10</b> in the loading rack or variations in the amount of sliders required in the loading rack. When a lack of sliders <b>10</b> or a variation of the required amount of sliders is detected, the sensor <b>82</b> signals the controller <b>62</b>, which actuates the solenoid-operated plunger <b>80</b> and a solenoid-operated pneumatic valve <b>84</b>. Upon actuation, the reciprocating piston <b>86</b> of solenoid-operated plunger <b>80</b> retracts to open a passage from the sender track <b>58</b> to the feeder tube <b>60</b>. Simultaneously, the pneumatic valve <b>84</b> opens to provide an air blast in the sender track <b>58</b> upstream of sliders <b>10</b> therein. The air blast launches the sliders <b>10</b> out of the sender track <b>58</b> in the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The solenoid-operated plunger <b>70</b>, in a corollary function, prevents the air-launched sliders <b>10</b> from being pushed back into the vibratory bowl <b>56</b> by closing the passage back to the vibratory bowl when the pneumatic valve is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The launched sliders <b>10</b> pass from the sender track <b>58</b> to the feeder tube <b>60</b>, which is molded with a channel configured to ensure efficient passage of the sliders <b>10</b> without jamming during operation. After passage through the feed tube <b>60</b>, the sliders arrive at the loading rack <b>64</b>. When a sufficient quantity of sliders <b>10</b> is detected in the loading rack <b>64</b>, the sensor <b>82</b> signals the controller <b>62</b> to close the pneumatic valve <b>84</b> and the solenoid-operated plunger <b>80</b>. This process repeats itself as the sliders <b>10</b> are inserted onto a zipper tape for a reclosable bag by the slider insertion device <b>52</b>. A sensor <b>88</b> is provided as a backup to signal the controller <b>62</b> when more sliders <b>10</b> are needed in the loading rack <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The loading rack <b>64</b> guides successive sliders to a slider insertion area <b>65</b> of the slider insertion device <b>52</b>. Similar to the sender track <b>58</b>, the loading rack <b>64</b> is a track that maintains the orientation of the sliders <b>10</b>. The sliders <b>10</b> released to the loading rack <b>64</b> are pushed along the rack by directional air connections <b>90</b>, which pneumatically move the sliders to the slider insertion area <b>65</b>. The air connections <b>90</b> are fluidly supplied by pressurized air from the air register <b>78</b> or from any other source of pressurized air. A sensor <b>92</b> is provided to detect the presence of a slider <b>10</b> in the slider insertion area <b>65</b>. If a slider is not detected in the slider insertion area <b>65</b>, the sensor <b>92</b> signals a solenoid-operated pneumatic valve <b>94</b> to release air into the loading rack <b>64</b>, thereby moving the next slider into the slider insertion area <b>65</b>. The loading rack <b>64</b> is preferably slanted so that gravity assists the movement of sliders toward the slider insertion area.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The feeder tube <b>60</b> is molded from a resilient material to prevent the feeder tube <b>60</b> from axially twisting or kinking, thereby allowing the feeder tube to be formed as a curved path. One suitable resilient material is polyurethane rubber (70 durometer). Other moldable resilient materials can also be used. The feeder tube <b>60</b> has a channel shaped to maintain the orientation of the sliders passing therethrough. The feeder tube <b>60</b> is press-fit and fastened to an attachment piece <b>96</b> located at the slider exit port <b>76</b> of the sender track <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the single feeder tube shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be replaced by a modular slider feeder tube system. The modular feeder tube system comprising two or more feeder tubes of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5-7</figref>, spliced together end to end by means of respective tube coupling devices of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Each feeder tube is made of resilient material, e.g., polyurethane rubber. For the sake of simplicity and ease of manufacture, each feeder tube preferably has the same length. Any number of feeder tubes can be spliced together to form a conduit of a desired length to meet the requirements of particular installations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each feeder tube <b>112</b> has a channel that extends from a first opening at one end of the tube to a second opening at the other end of said tube. The tube channel comprises two sections: a relatively longer channel section <b>114</b> running from the first opening to an intermediate point along the tube length and a relatively shorter channel <b>116</b> running from the aforementioned intermediate point to the second opening. The length of the longer channel section <b>114</b> is on the order of multiple feet (e.g., 8 feet) and the length of said shorter channel section <b>116</b> is on the order of the width of the feeder tube, e.g., 1 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first opening has the six-sided asymmetric profile seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The opening at the other end of the tube has the rectangular profile <b>116</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the example presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the profile of channel section <b>114</b> is a six-sided polygon with five interior angles each substantially equal to 90 degrees. This six-sided profile generally matches the profile of the slider when viewed from the end. The profile of channel section is designed so that a slider can enter the feeder tube channel only if a certain end of the slider is leading. Then the slider will slide down the channel section <b>114</b> on its back, with the projecting leg <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) of the slider projecting into the recess <b>118</b> that forms part of the channel section <b>114</b>. The channel section <b>114</b> has the six-sided profile seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> along its entire length. Preferably, the channel section <b>116</b> has the rectangular profile along its entire length. The outer profile of each feeder tube is rectangular, e.g., square, along the entire length of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The channel section <b>116</b> is offset from channel section <b>114</b> and the area of its profile is greater than the area of the profile of channel section <b>114</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The profile of channel section <b>116</b> is shaped to receive the tapered end of a feeder tube connector or a tube coupling device of the types to be described in detail below. At the intermediate point where the channel section <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> meet, the feeder tube has a planar internal surface <b>115</b> lying between inner and outer closed boundaries. The inner boundary is the junction of channel section <b>114</b> and surface <b>115</b>, while the outer closed boundary is the junction of channel section <b>116</b> and surface <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Two feeder tubes of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be spliced together, end to end, by the tube coupling device <b>120</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tube coupling device <b>120</b> comprises an elongated body and a pair of clamping plates <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>b</i>. The elongated body comprises a central section <b>122</b>, a first mandrel <b>124</b> projecting from one end of central section <b>122</b>, a second mandrel <b>126</b> projecting from the other end of central section <b>122</b>, and a channel <b>121</b> of constant profile running through mandrels <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and central section <b>122</b>. The profile of channel <b>121</b> is the same as the profile of the channel section <b>114</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) of each feeder tube. The mandrel <b>126</b> is wider and taller than the mandrel <b>124</b> and is press-fitted into the slider exit end (channel section <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of a feeder tube <b>112</b><i>b </i>(indicated by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The mandrel <b>124</b> is press-fitted into the slider insertion end (channel section <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of another feeder tube <b>112</b><i>a</i>. Both mandrels are tapered, mandrel <b>124</b> in two mutually perpendicular planes, and mandrel <b>126</b> in only one plane, to facilitate a tight fit in the feeder tube channels. The result is that the long channel sections <b>114</b> of two feeder tubes <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>are linked by channel <b>121</b> of the tube coupling device <b>114</b>, providing a continuous conduit that sliders can slide along on their way to the slider insertion device from a slider supply source. The direction of slider travel is indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Because the end of the slider guide channel (item <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the feeder tube that delivers the slider to the tube coupling device <b>114</b> is not expanded by mandrel <b>126</b> of the tube coupling device, the slider can make a smooth transition from the slider guide channel to the tube coupling channel <b>121</b> without snagging on an edge at the entrance to channel <b>121</b>. Although insertion of the other mandrel <b>124</b> in the receiving end of the slider guide channel of feeder tube <b>112</b><i>a </i>does expand the slider guide channel adjacent the exit to channel <b>121</b>, the gradual curvature of the expanded slider guide channel of the feeder tube poses no sharp corner or other impediment on which the slider could snag or jam.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the ends of the feeder tubes are clamped to the respective mandrels by the clamping plates. The clamping plates <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>b </i>are fastened to opposing sides of the central section <b>122</b> by means of fasteners <b>132</b>. Each clamping plate comprises projections <b>130</b> directed respectively toward mandrels <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, the projections on clamping plate <b>128</b><i>a </i>opposing the respective projections on clamping plate <b>128</b><i>b</i>. The projections <b>130</b> grip the ends of the resilient feeder tubes when the clamping plates are fastened to the central section <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The central section <b>122</b> of the tube coupling device and the mandrels <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are integrally formed in two parts: a base <b>134</b> and a cover <b>136</b>. The base <b>134</b> comprises a longitudinal recess that is covered by the cover <b>136</b> to form the channel <b>121</b>. The recess in the channel <b>121</b> for the projecting leg of the slider is formed in the base <b>134</b>. The channel <b>121</b> has a constant profile along its entire length, that profile being the same as the profile of channel section <b>114</b> of the feeder tube (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), namely, a six-sided polygon with five interior angles each substantially equal to 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above-described tube coupling devices can be used to splice first through N-th feeder tubes together in a chain, wherein N≧2, one end of the first feeder tube being coupled to a slider sender apparatus, and a slider insertion apparatus being coupled to one end of the N-th feeder tube. Each of the slider sender apparatus, first through N-th feeder tubes, and slider insertion apparatus comprises a respective channel, the channels being in communication to form a conduit, each of the channels being profiled to maintain the orientation of each slider passing therethrough so that the same end of the slider is always in the lead. Thus sliders can be transported in succession from a source of slider, e.g., a vibratory hopper, to a slider insertion device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One type of slider insertion device that can receive sliders via the modular feeder tube system disclosed herein is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a bottom view showing portions of the slider insertion apparatus from a slider entry point to a slider insertion area at the terminus of a U-shaped slider base; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a top view of some of the same parts, such as the U-shaped slider base, plus other parts not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, such as the zipper guide.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The slider base comprises a U-shaped lower slider base <b>31</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and an upper slider base <b>32</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), which are fastened together to form a U-shaped channel that reverses the orientation of the sliders to be inserted during their transit along the channel. The slider base <b>31</b>/<b>32</b> is connected to an air jet rail <b>108</b> by means of a pair of splice plates <b>34</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6) and 35</figref> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and a support plate <b>36</b>. The numeral <b>102</b> designates a cover for the air jet rail <b>108</b>. The air jet rail <b>108</b> has a channel for sliders that is aligned and in communication with an entry end of the U-shaped channel. A jet of air, produced by means previously described, propels the sliders along the air jet rail and toward the slider base.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The air jet rail <b>108</b> is in turn connected to a feeder tube connector <b>104</b> having a connector cap <b>106</b>. The feeder tube connector <b>104</b> has a channel for sliders that is aligned and in communication with the channel of the air jet rail. The end of a feeder tube of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be press-fitted onto the feeder tube connector <b>104</b> in the same manner as previously described in connection with mandrel <b>126</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the tube coupling device. The connector <b>104</b> has substantially the same geometry and dimensions as mandrel <b>126</b> has. (Conversely, the attachment piece at the exit port of the slider sender apparatus has the same geometry and dimensions as those of mandrel <b>124</b> of the tube coupling device <b>120</b>.) When a feeder tube is connected to the feeder tube connector <b>104</b>, the channel of the feeder tube communicates with the channel inside the feeder tube connector.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, sliders originating at the vibratory hopper (not shown) travel, in succession, through the feeder tube (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the feeder tube connector <b>104</b>, the air jet rail <b>108</b>, and the slider base formed by parts <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. The lead slider is stopped at the pre-insertion position when its leading end abuts an activating fork (not shown). Each successive slider takes its place at the end of the line of sliders, which line can extend all the way back to optical sensors supported by a pair of sensor mounts <b>110</b>, only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, along the air jet rail <b>108</b>. If the sensors detect the absence of a slider at the monitored location in the air jet rail, a signal is produced to a programmable controller that results in more sliders being supplied from the vibratory hopper in a manner disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/106,687. If a slider is detected at the monitored position, then no new sliders are supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The slider insertion operation will now be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. When the slider arrives at a pre-insertion position under the activator with pusher <b>52</b>, a capture spring <b>30</b> holds the correctly oriented slider in place. During subsequent slider insertion, the pusher (not shown) will push the slider toward a stationary zipper tape with sufficient force to overcome the holding force being applied by the capture spring. The activator with pusher <b>52</b> is moved from a retracted position to an extended position by an air cylinder <b>54</b> for inserting a slider onto an underlying section of the zipper tape.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the slider being correctly positioned prior to insertion, the zipper tape must also be correctly positioned and supported in that correct position during slider insertion. In the automated slider insertion apparatus depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the zipper tape is threaded over a saddle <b>40</b> comprising an elongated upright plate. The saddle <b>40</b> has a straight contact edge <b>41</b>. The zipper tape sits against contact edge <b>41</b> during slider insertion and slides along edge <b>41</b> during zipper tape advancement. The saddle <b>40</b> is flanked by the extension flanges (not shown) of the interlocked halves of the zipper tape, while the underbelly of an opposing section of the zipper tape sits against the contact edge <b>41</b> of the saddle <b>40</b>. Means (not shown) are provided for gripping the zipper tape in an area adjacent the slider insertion zone, thereby holding the zipper tape closed as a slider is clipped onto the zipper tape by the aforementioned pusher.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the invention has been described with reference to various embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
