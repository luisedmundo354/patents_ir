<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to an air intake system for a gas turbine system, including a bypass arrangement and methods of operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gas turbine systems are useful in generating electricity. These types of systems are particularly convenient in that they can be constructed quickly; they are also desirable because they produce fewer harmful emissions than coal or oil based turbine systems. Gas turbines utilize air for combustion purposes. Due to the precision moving parts in these types of systems, the combustion air needs to be clean. To ensure clean air for combustion, air filters have been used to clean the air taken into the gas turbine system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Filters are used to purify the air intake for gas turbines. The filter media used for the purification, over time, will load with contaminant. Filters are used until they are plugged (contaminant blocks all flow through the media) or until a predetermined restriction level is reached. Both are associated with flow and the work necessary to move the flow. Either too little fluid is allowed to flow through, or too much work is required to move the desired flow due to the higher restriction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some systems, pulse jet cleaning is used to periodically remove contaminant from the upstream side of the filter media. Using pulse cleaning increases the life of the filter by decreasing the restriction and increasing the service interval. Pulse cleaning has been used with pleated filters in arrangements described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,364,751; 4,218,227; 4,331,459; and 5,575,826, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. In addition, pulse-cleaning is used with z-media arranged in V-packs, as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/731564, filed Dec. 8, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pulse cleaning removes at least some of the dust and contaminant from the upstream side of the filters. The dust and debris are allowed to fall by gravity down into collection hoppers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A hopper arrangement is provided including a container. The container includes an enclosure and a damper arrangement. The container defines an interior volume. The damper arrangement is selectively moveable in a plurality of positions to manipulate access to the interior volume. A first position includes a standby position wherein the enclosure and the damper arrangement block access to the interior volume. In preferred embodiments, another position includes a pressure-relief position wherein the interior volume is open to a continuous airflow path through the container. In some embodiments, there is a further position including an evacuation position wherein the damper arrangement allows access to the interior volume and blocks a continuous airflow path through the container.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A gas turbine intake system is provided including a hood, a filter arrangement downstream of the hood and constructed and arranged to purify air upstream from a gas turbine, and a collection hopper. The collection hopper is in airflow communication with an upstream side of the filter arrangement and downstream of the hood. The collection hopper is positioned to collect debris caught by the filter arrangement. The collection hopper includes at least a standby position and a pressure-relief position. The standby position includes the collection hopper forming a closed interior volume. The pressure-relief position includes the collection hopper forming an open airflow passageway to allow a continuous stream of airflow through the collection hopper and to the filter arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of filtering air for a gas turbine system is provided. The method includes drawing air into a hood and then into a filter arrangement. Next, there is a step of collecting debris from the filter arrangement into a collection hopper oriented below the filter arrangement. Further, there is a step of allowing air to bypass the hood and flow to the filter arrangement through a bypass flow passageway selectively opened by the collection hopper.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">A. Overview of System</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The methods of use, arrangements, and constructions disclosed herein are usable with a variety of systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> depict one example system. In this case, the example system shown is a gas turbine system. The gas turbine system is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> at reference numeral <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, gas, such as air, is shown drawn into an air intake system <b>22</b> at arrows <b>23</b>. The air intake system <b>22</b> includes a hood <b>27</b> and a plurality of gas filter elements <b>24</b>. The plurality of gas filter elements <b>24</b> are held within a tube sheet <b>26</b>. The tube sheet <b>26</b> divides system <b>22</b> into a dirty air plenum <b>46</b>, upstream of the tube sheet <b>26</b>, and a clean air plenum <b>48</b>, downstream of the tube sheet <b>26</b>. The air is cleaned with the filter elements <b>24</b>. The hood <b>27</b> can be a moisture separator, a noise muffler, a large debris catcher, and a combination of each of these. After cleaning, the air flows downstream at arrows <b>28</b> and into a gas turbine generator, where it is used to generate power. It should be understood that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, only a portion of the air intake system <b>22</b> is depicted. This is for purposes of clarity and explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a front elevational view of the air intake <b>22</b>. Several filter elements <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are used and arranged in columns <b>30</b>. After a period of use, the pressure drop across the filter elements <b>24</b> will increase due to the collection of impurities. The filter elements <b>24</b> are periodically cleaned by directing a flow of higher pressure fluid (such as a pulse of compressed gas) into the filter elements <b>24</b> in a direction from the downstream side of the filter element to the upstream side of the filter element <b>24</b>. This will remove at least some of the contaminant and particulate matter from the filter element <b>24</b> and reduce the restriction across the filter elements <b>24</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a reverse-pulse cleaning system <b>32</b> is provided in the air intake system <b>22</b>. The reverse-pulse cleaning system <b>32</b> is mounted on the frame <b>34</b> of the air intake system <b>22</b>. The reverse-pulse cleaning system <b>32</b> typically includes a manifold <b>36</b> in communication with a nozzle arrangement <b>38</b>. The compressed air is directed by the manifold <b>36</b> into the nozzles <b>38</b>. The nozzles <b>38</b> direct the compressed air into individual filter elements <b>24</b> on their downstream sides. Dirt and debris is knocked loose from the upstream side of the filter elements <b>24</b>, where it falls by gravity to a hopper arrangement <b>40</b> (also referred to herein as “collection hopper <b>40</b>”). In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the hopper arrangement <b>40</b> includes one hopper <b>41</b> for each column <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the hopper arrangement can be configured to correspond to two or more columns.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the gas turbine system <b>20</b> in normal operation. “Normal operation” is defined as the air flowing at arrows <b>23</b> into the dirty air plenum <b>46</b>, through the filter elements <b>24</b>, and into the clean air plenum <b>48</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a bypass condition of the gas turbine system <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the air intake <b>22</b> is clogged for some reason, such as icing. In this condition, the combustion air is allowed to partially or completely bypass the hood <b>27</b>. In this arrangement, the intake air is directed through a path <b>29</b> through the hopper arrangement <b>40</b>. From there, the intake air is directed through the filter elements <b>24</b> and into the clean air plenum <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">B. An Example Pressure-Relief System</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, in certain conditions, the air intake <b>22</b> will be clogged for various reasons. This could be due to freezing rain, snow, an abundant amount of dirt, etc., clogging the intake system, particularly the hood <b>27</b>. In such a condition, it is still important to allow air to reach the filters <b>24</b> for a cleaning before being directed to the gas turbine. The gas turbine system <b>20</b> is particularly well suited to handle these types of conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, a method and system is provided for filtering air for the gas turbine system <b>20</b>. The method and apparatus includes drawing air into the hood <b>27</b> and then into the filter arrangement <b>24</b>. Next, debris, dirt, etc. is separated from the air by the filter arrangement <b>24</b>. The debris, dirt, etc. is collected from the filter arrangement <b>24</b> into the collection hopper <b>40</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the collection hopper <b>40</b> is oriented below the filter arrangement <b>24</b>. This allows the dirt and debris to fall by gravity from the filter elements <b>24</b> into the collection hopper <b>40</b>. For example, when the reverse pulse cleaning system <b>32</b> operates, dirt and debris is knocked loose from the upstream side of the filter elements <b>24</b>, and it falls by gravity into the collection hopper <b>40</b>. If restriction across the filter elements <b>24</b> reaches a predetermined level, or if the operator is concerned that the intake system is going to become blocked or restricted, the bypass or pressure-relief system is actuated. This allows air to bypass the hood <b>27</b> and flow to the filter elements <b>24</b> through a bypass flow passageway selectively opened by the collection hopper <b>40</b>. Example apparatus and systems to accomplish this method are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, a first example of hopper arrangement <b>40</b> is illustrated schematically, in front elevational view. The hopper arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> includes a container <b>50</b>. The container <b>50</b> includes an enclosure <b>52</b> defining an interior volume <b>54</b>. The enclosure <b>52</b> has, preferably, a damper arrangement <b>56</b>. The damper arrangement, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, is selectively moveable in a plurality of positions to manipulate access to the interior volume <b>54</b>. In this example, the damper arrangement <b>56</b> is selectively moveable in at least three positions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a standby position <b>58</b>. The standby position <b>58</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is a position of the hopper arrangement <b>40</b> in which the enclosure <b>52</b> and damper arrangement <b>56</b> block access to the interior volume <b>54</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it can be seen how the interior volume <b>54</b> is closed to airflow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate examples of the hopper arrangement <b>40</b> in an evacuation position <b>60</b>. The evacuation position is one in which the damper arrangement <b>56</b> allows access to the interior volume <b>54</b> while still blocking a continuous flow of air through the container <b>50</b>. In the particular example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the evacuation position <b>60</b> blocks a straight-line airflow through the container <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, shows a plurality of top dampers <b>62</b> pivoted relative to other portions of the container <b>50</b> to allow access to the interior volume <b>54</b>, while bottom dampers <b>64</b> continue to block access to the interior volume <b>54</b>. In use, dust and debris falls from the filter elements <b>24</b> into the collection hopper <b>40</b> and rest on top of the top dampers <b>62</b>. During part one of the evacuation position <b>60</b>, the top dampers <b>62</b> are pivoted and empty the dust and debris from the top dampers <b>62</b> into the interior volume <b>54</b> to rest on the bottom dampers <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates part two of the evacuation position <b>60</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the top dampers <b>62</b> are blocking access to the interior volume <b>54</b>, while the bottom dampers <b>64</b> are pivoted relative to a remaining portion of the container <b>50</b>. In practice, the dust and debris is emptied from the interior volume <b>54</b> by sliding along the bottom dampers <b>64</b> and falling by gravity to the ground or other disposal site below the collection hopper <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a pressure-relief position <b>66</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pressure-relief position <b>66</b> opens the interior volume <b>54</b> to a continuous stream of airflow through the hopper arrangement <b>40</b>. In practice, the airflow is allowed to flow through the hopper arrangement <b>40</b> and up into the dirty air plenum <b>46</b> to the upstream side of the filter elements <b>24</b>. From there, the air is purified or filtered, and is then allowed to flow to the turbine. In the particular arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pressure-relief position <b>66</b> allows a straight-line airflow through the container <b>50</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it can be seen how both the top dampers <b>62</b> and bottom dampers <b>64</b> are pivoted relative to a remaining portion of the container <b>50</b>, such that both the top dampers <b>62</b> and bottom dampers <b>64</b> allow airflow access to the interior volume <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, it should be apparent that the evacuation position <b>60</b> includes at least a first evacuation position <b>68</b> and a second evacuation position <b>70</b>. The first evacuation position <b>68</b> includes the damper arrangement <b>56</b> allowing access to the interior volume <b>54</b> from a position above the interior volume <b>54</b> while blocking access to the interior volume <b>54</b> from a position below the interior volume <b>54</b>. The second evacuation position <b>70</b> includes the damper arrangement <b>56</b> blocking access to the interior volume <b>54</b> from a position above the interior volume while allowing access to the interior volume <b>54</b> from a position below the interior volume <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, in the embodiment illustrated, the enclosure <b>52</b> includes a surrounding wall <b>72</b> having an open top <b>74</b> and an open bottom <b>76</b>. As mentioned above, the damper arrangement includes at least the top damper <b>62</b> and the bottom damper <b>64</b>. The top damper <b>62</b> selectively covers the open top <b>74</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b>. The bottom damper <b>64</b> selectively covers the open bottom <b>76</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b>. The pressure-relief position <b>66</b> includes the top damper <b>62</b> and the bottom damper <b>64</b> being pivoted relative to the surrounding wall <b>72</b> to allow airflow through the open top <b>74</b> and open bottom <b>76</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, it can be seen that the particular damper arrangement <b>56</b> illustrated includes at least three top dampers <b>62</b> and at least three bottom dampers <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The standby position <b>58</b> includes the at least three top dampers <b>62</b> closing the open top <b>74</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b> and the at least three bottom dampers <b>64</b> closing the open bottom <b>76</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, it can be appreciated that the evacuation position <b>60</b> includes one of either the first evacuation position <b>68</b> and the second evacuation position <b>70</b>. In the first evacuation position <b>68</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the at least three top dampers <b>62</b> are moved to allow access through the open top <b>74</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b> and the at least three bottom dampers <b>64</b> close the open bottom <b>76</b> of the surrounding wall <b>72</b>.</p>

This pressure-relief position <b>66</b> forms an open air flow passageway to allow a continuous stream of airflow through the collection hopper <b>40</b> and to the filter arrangement <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, the collection hopper <b>40</b> illustrated further includes a collection bin <b>78</b> oriented below the filter arrangement <b>24</b> and above the top damper <b>62</b>. The collection bin <b>78</b> defines an interior <b>80</b> in airflow communication with the filter arrangement <b>24</b>. The top damper <b>62</b> is selectively moveable to allow communication between the interior <b>80</b> of the collection bin <b>78</b> and the interior volume <b>54</b> of the container <b>50</b>. When in the pressure-relief position <b>66</b>, the damper arrangement <b>56</b> is adjusted such that air flow is permitted to flow through the open bottom <b>76</b>, then through the open top <b>76</b>, then into the interior <b>80</b> of the collection bin <b>78</b>, and finally to the filter arrangement <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> illustrate an example embodiment of the collection hopper <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8-11</figref> collection hopper <b>40</b> illustrates the use of only two top dampers <b>62</b> and two bottom dampers <b>64</b> (as opposed to the three top dampers and three bottom dampers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>.) The embodiment of the collection hopper <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> shows details of one example mechanism for operating the damper arrangement <b>56</b> of the hopper <b>40</b>. In particular, the damper arrangement <b>56</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref> is operated by a pneumatic control system <b>82</b>. The pneumatic control system <b>82</b> includes an upper pneumatic cylinder <b>84</b> to control the upper damper <b>62</b>, and a lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> to control the bottom damper <b>64</b>. Of course, control systems other than pneumatic are usable, including mechanical systems having gears or cams; hydraulic systems; or electrically controlled systems. The pneumatic system <b>82</b> is the system illustrated in the FIGS. and is described below, but the other control systems are also usable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the top damper <b>62</b> includes first and second links <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> pivotally attached to first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>. When the upper pneumatic cylinder <b>84</b> is extended from the standby position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to the first evacuation position <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), the first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> pivot about each of its respective axes <b>93</b>, <b>94</b>, away from the open top <b>74</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> are pivoted to a position almost 90° from their standby position. In FlG. <b>9</b>, the position is between 45° and 90°. This allows for dust and debris that has collected in the interior <b>80</b> of the collection bin <b>78</b> and on top of the first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> to fall by gravity into the interior volume <b>54</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the first and second links <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> connect the upper pneumatic cylinder <b>84</b> to the first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> at a hinge <b>95</b>, <b>96</b>, in which the first and second axes <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> pass through.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref> illustrate operation of the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b>. The lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> includes first and second links <b>98</b>, <b>99</b>. The links <b>98</b>, <b>99</b> pivotally attach to first and second hinges <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. Passing through the first and second hinges <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are first and second axes <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The bottom damper <b>64</b> includes first damper <b>105</b> and second damper <b>106</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> is in the standby position. In contrast to the upper pneumatic cylinder <b>84</b>, in the standby position, the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> is extended. To move the bottom damper <b>64</b> from the standby position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to the second evacuation position <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> is retracted. When the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> is retracted, the first and second links <b>98</b>, <b>99</b> cause the first and second dampers <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> to pivot about axes <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The first and second dampers <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are then pivoted to a position between 45°-90° relative to their standby position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). This allows dust and debris that has collected within the interior volume <b>54</b> to fall by gravity from the interior volume <b>54</b> out of the hopper arrangement <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the hopper arrangement <b>40</b> in the pressure-relief position <b>66</b>. In the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the upper pneumatic cylinder <b>84</b> is extended, while the lower pneumatic cylinder <b>86</b> is retracted. This moves the first and second dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> of the top dampers <b>62</b> relative to axes <b>93</b>, <b>94</b>, and moves first and second dampers <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> of the bottom dampers <b>64</b> relative to axes <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. With each of the dampers <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> pivoted to be between 45° and 90° relative to the standby position, a continuous airflow stream is opened through the hopper arrangement <b>40</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the air stream path opened is a straight-line airflow path. In other embodiments, the airflow path could be at an angle, such as 90°, causing air to turn a corner. It should also be appreciated that while the illustrated embodiment shows the dampers at an angle of about 90°, of course, the angle could be substantially less or more than the one shown, depending upon the degree and amount of pressure-relief airflow desired. For example, the damper arrangement <b>56</b> could be controlled so that the angle of the damper is relative to the standby position could only be 10°, or 170°, if measuring from the opposite side. In many preferred embodiments, the angle of the dampers when in the pressure-relief position will be between 60°-120°.</p>

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">C. Methods of Use</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In operation, the gas turbine intake system <b>22</b> operates as follows. Air to be cleaned before entering the gas turbine is drawn through the intake system <b>22</b> at arrows <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The air is drawn first through the inlet hood <b>27</b> and then through the filter elements <b>24</b>. The filter elements <b>24</b> remove dust and other debris from the air. The cleaned air then proceeds through the outlet side of the system <b>22</b> at arrows <b>28</b>. The cleaned air is then used by a gas turbine for generating power.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Periodically, the filter elements <b>24</b> are cleaned by having a pulse of pressurized air blasted through the filter elements <b>24</b> from the downstream side to the upstream side. This helps to knock loose any dust or other debris collected on the upstream side of the filter elements <b>24</b>. The dust and debris falls by gravity into the collection hoppers <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Under certain conditions, the inlet hood <b>27</b> may become clogged or otherwise occluded. For example, snow or an ice storm may block significant portions of the inlets through the hood <b>27</b>. In such a condition, it is still desirable to have air reach the filter elements <b>24</b>. The pressure-relief system, described above, is used. In particular, the collection hopper <b>40</b> is adjusted to open a continuous airflow path through the collection hopper <b>40</b> in order to reach the filter elements <b>24</b>. For example, in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the top dampers <b>62</b> and bottom dampers <b>64</b> pivot relative to the rest of the enclosure <b>52</b> in order to open up a straight-line airflow path through the open bottom <b>76</b>, through the interior <b>54</b>, through the open top <b>74</b>, through the interior volume <b>80</b>, and to the filter elements <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pressure-relief position can be triggered either manually, or automatically based on a predetermined level of measured restriction.</p>
