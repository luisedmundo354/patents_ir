<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and apparatus are disclosed for forming a sample of an object, extracting the sample from the object, and subjecting this sample to microanalysis including surface analysis and electron transparency analysis in a vacuum chamber. In some embodiments, a method is provided for imaging an object cross section surface of an extracted sample. Optionally, the sample is iteratively thinned and imaged within the vacuum chamber. In some embodiments, the sample is situated on a sample support including an optional aperture. Optionally, the sample is situated on a surface of the sample support such that the object cross section surface is substantially parallel to the surface of the sample support. Once mounted on the sample support, the sample is either subjected to microanalysis in the vacuum chamber, or loaded onto a loading station. In some embodiments, the sample is imaged with an electron beam substantially normally incident to the object cross section surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor device monitoring, and specifically to the preparation and imaging of thin samples for testing internal structure of fabricated devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the study of electronic materials and processes for fabricating such materials into an electronic structure, a specimen of the electronic structure is frequently used for microscopic examination for purposes of failure analysis and device validation. For instance, a specimen of an electronic structure such as a silicon wafer is frequently analyzed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) to study a specific characteristic feature in the wafer. Such characteristic feature may include the circuit fabricated and any defects formed during the fabrication process. An electron microscope is one of the most useful equipment for analyzing the microscopic structure of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In preparing specimens of an electronic structure for electron microscopic examination, various polishing and milling processes can be used to section the structure until a specific characteristic feature is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As device dimensions are continuously reduced to the sub-half-micron level, the techniques for preparing specimens for study in an electron microscope have become more important. The conventional methods for studying structures by an optical microscope cannot be used to study features in a modem electronic structure due to the unacceptable resolution of an optical microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the focused ion beam (FIB) technique, focused ion beam is used to either locally deposit or remove materials. Typical ion beams have a focused spot size of smaller than 100 nm when produced by a high intensity source. Sources of such high intensity ions can be either liquid metal ion sources or gas field ion sources. Both of these sources have a needle type form that relies on field ionization or evaporation to produce the ion beam. After the ion beam is produced, it is deflected in a high vacuum and directed to a desired surface area. The focused ion beams can be suitably used in the semiconductor processing industry in a cutting or attaching method to perform a circuit repair, a mask repair or a micromachining process. A cutting process is normally performed by locally sputtering a surface with a focused ion beam.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an ion beam milling process, a material is selectively etched by a beam of ions such as Ga<sup>+</sup> focused to a sub-micron diameter, the technique is often referred to as focused ion beam etching or milling. FIB milling is a very useful technique for restructuring a pattern on a mask or an integrated circuit, and for diagnostic cross-sectioning of microstructures. In a typical FIB etching process, a beam of ions such as Ga<sup>+</sup> is incident onto a surface to be etched and the beam is deflected to produce a desirable pattern. The focused ion beam can be used to bombard a specimen surface such that a cavity is formed on the surface of an electronic structure to review a characteristic feature of the structure for electron microscopic examination. The FIB technique utilizes a primary beam of ions for removing a layer of material at a high current, and for observing the surface that was newly formed at a low current. The observation of the surface is made by detecting the secondary electrons emitted from the sample surface when the surface is bombarded by the ions. A detector is used to receive the secondary electrons emitted from the surface to form an image. Even though the FIB method can not produce an image of a high resolution like that obtainable in a SEM/TEM, the FIB method can be used to sufficiently identify a newly formed cross-sectional surface which may contain the characteristic feature to be examined. The capability of the FIB technique for making observations down to a resolution of 5˜10 nm enables the cutting of a precise plane in an electronic structure such that the electronic structure may be later examined by a SEM or TEM technique at a higher resolution than that capable with FIB.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although TEM techniques can provide a higher resolution image and a more detailed description of the internal structure of a than is available using SEM techniques, they are only effective for electron transparent samples. Thus it is a basic requirement for TEM samples that the sample must be thin enough to be penetrated by the electron beam and thin enough to avoid multiple scattering, which causes image blurring. Nonetheless, it is recognized in the art that thin samples extracted from wafers may be brittle, and subject to fracture or crumbling. Furthermore, the fragile nature of thin extracted samples means that processes for extracting thin samples are difficult to automate, thus hindering efforts to automate these processes. There is an ongoing need for reliable and automated techniques for the obtaining and imaging of TEM samples to make TEM sampling a viable part of semiconductor analysis and manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional technique for conducting electron transparency analysis with nanometer level spatial resolution is scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The TEM is an apparatus in which an electron beam is irradiated onto a sample, and the transmitted electron beam is magnified using a lens. On the other hand, the STEM is an apparatus in which an electron beam is focused onto a micro-area, and a two-dimensional image is obtained by measuring intensities of the transmitted electron beam while the electron beam is being scanned on the sample. US 20030127595, incorporated herein by reference, discloses methods and apparatus for scanning transmission electron microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Enabled by automated, multicolumn tools combining SEM and FIB in a single device, automated techniques for the obtaining and imaging of SEM samples are already well known and are employed in the automated reviewing of defects and for process monitoring. Examples of commercially available models of such multicolumn tools include SEMVision™ G2 FIB (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, Calif.) and the DualBeam™ (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oreg.). It is noted that the SEMVision™ G2 FIB is also used in process control.</p>

This method includes placing an object into a vacuum chamber, forming a sample from the object and imaging the sample such that at least a portion of an electron beam traverses at least a portion of the sample. It is noted that in some embodiments, the forming and imaging are carried out in the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to some embodiments, the object is a substantially cylindrically shaped object such as a semiconductor wafer. According to other embodiments, the object is a prismatic object such as a die.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to some embodiments, the object is penetrated to a depth of at most 10% of a thickness of the object during the stage of forming. According to other embodiments, the object is penetrated to a depth of at most 3%, 5%, 20%, or 50% of a thickness of the object during the stage of forming.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to some embodiments, the formed sample is situated onto a sample support and imaged in situ while situated on the sample support. According to some embodiments, the situating is effected using a robotic manipulator.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to some embodiments, the stage of forming includes focused ion beam or electron beam milling. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the stage of forming excludes mechanical cleaving. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the stage of forming excludes laser cutting.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to some embodiments, the stage of forming includes a beam milling selected from the group consisting of ion beam milling and electron beam milling.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that methods for sample formation wherein the stage of forming includes ion beam milling and excludes mechanical cleaving are desirable because they damage the wafer only in the vicinity of the area from where the sample is extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to particular embodiments, the stage of forming includes cutting a first cut into the object using an ion beam, the first cut at least partially surrounding a target location on a surface of the object and cutting a second cut in the object, using the ion beam, at an acute angle to a plane of the object, thereby undercutting the target location.</p>

According to some embodiments, the sample is imaged such that the electron beam is incident substantially normally to the object cross section surface of the sample. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that imaging the object cross section surface of the sample in some embodiments reveals details of the internal structure of a cross section of the object, and is useful in defect analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to some embodiments, the sample is situated on a surface of the sample support such that an object cross section surface of the sample is substantially parallel to the surface of the sample support. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that situating the sample on the sample support with this orientation is useful in certain situations where it is desired to subsequently subject the cross section surface to a particle beam with a predetermined orientation relative to the cross section surface.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to some embodiments, the sample includes a segment having two substantially parallel surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to some embodiments, the sample comprises a segment having two substantially parallel surfaces that are substantially perpendicular to the outer surface of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Optionally, after the sample mounted on the sample support the sample is further thinned before and/or after imaging. In some embodiments, the sample thinning includes subjecting a object cross section surface of the sample to a focused ion beam that is incident normally to the object cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to some embodiments, the sample support includes a TEM grid.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the sample support is cylindrically shaped and includes exactly one aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The sample support includes any appropriate material known in the art. Appropriate materials include but are not limited to copper, nickel, molybdenum, and platinum.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In yet other embodiments, the sample support is other than a TEM grid, preferably a mostly solid flat support where less than the overwhelming majority of the upper surface of the sample support is occupied by the at least one aperture. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it has been found that use of such a sample support stabilizes the process whereby the sample is situated on the sample support, once again obviating the need for the method to be implemented by skilled technicians.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to some embodiments, less than about 98% of an area of the surface of the sample support is occupied by the at least one aperture. According to particular embodiments, less than about 50% of an area of the surface of the sample support is occupied by the at least one aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to some embodiments, the sample includes a segment having two substantially parallel surfaces, and the probe is affixed to the sample in a geometric orientation such that one of the parallel surfaces of the sample faces away from the object as the sample is extracted from the object and rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to some embodiments, a probe is affixed to the sample before the imaging. One exemplary location to attach the probe is to the outer surface of the formed sample.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to some embodiments, the probe is substantially nonparallel to the outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to some embodiments, the probe is oriented away from the outer surface. Optionally, the probe is oriented at an angle that is substantially 55 degrees from the normal vector of the outer surface of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, when the sample is removed from the object, it is rotated substantially 120 degrees before mounting on the sample support.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Any known technique for affixing the needle or probe is appropriate for the present invention. According to some embodiments, a tip of the needle or probe is fixed to the sample by ion-beam metal deposition. Alternately, a tip of the needle or probe is fixed to the sample by electrostatic attraction.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The probe is optionally detached from the sample before electron transparency imaging. Exemplary techniques for detaching the probe or needle include ion beam milling.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to some embodiments, the stage of imaging includes situating the sample onto a sample support, and said probe is detached from the sample after situating.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Any shape object is appropriate for the disclosed method. Thus, in some embodiments, a sample is formed from a wafer that is substantially cylindrical. In some embodiments, a wafer is pre-cleaved before placing in the vacuum chamber to form and extract the sample. In some embodiments, the object is substantially prismatic.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is now disclosed for the first time a method of sample and imaging including placing an object into a vacuum chamber, forming a sample from the object, and subjecting an object cross section surface of the sample to microanalysis, wherein the forming and microanalysis are carried out while the sample is in the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to some embodiment, microanalysis includes subjecting the sample to a particle beam selected from the group consisting of an ion beam and an electron beam, wherein the particle beam is incident substantially normally to said object cross section surface.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is now disclosed for the first time a method of extracting and mounting a sample. The disclosed method includes forming the sample from the object so that the sample includes an object cross section surface of the object, and situating at least one sample onto a surface of a sample support that includes at least one aperture so that the object cross section surface of the sample is substantially parallel to the surface of sample support.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to some embodiments, the sample is further subjected to electron transparency analysis within the same vacuum chamber that the sample was formed from the object. Alternately, at least one mounted sample onto a loading station or cassette. Optionally the loading station or cassette can be shipped to a separate tool for electron transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to some embodiments, the forming of the sample produces an indentation in the object, and the method further includes depositing material into the indentation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to particular embodiments, the deposition is carried in the vacuum chamber. According to particular embodiments, the indentation is completely filled by the deposited material. According to particular embodiments, the deposition includes focused ion beam deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that methods provided by embodiments of the present invention cause minimal damage to a semiconductor wafer while still allowing for defect analysis and process control including electron transparency of a cross section of the wafer. Furthermore, it is now disclosed that the optional filling of the indentation with deposited material further minimizes the damage rendered to the wafer by the sampling process.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It is now disclosed for the first time a method forming a sample of an object in a vacuum chamber, and iteratively thinning and imaging the sample inside the vacuum chamber, producing a plurality of images. The disclosed method includes providing an object in a vacuum chamber, forming a sample from the object inside the vacuum chamber, thinning at least a portion of the sample with an ion beam, and imaging the thinned sample, wherein at least a portion of said sample is subjected to an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, at least one said stage of imaging includes electron transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, at least one said stage of imaging includes detecting particles selected from the group consisting of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, auger electrons, and photons.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the sample is thicker than an electron transparency threshold at a time during a first stage of imaging, and the sample is electron transparent at a time during said subsequent stage of imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, at least one stage of imaging further includes subjecting at least a portion of the sample to optical microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, the thinning and imaging are repeated at least once until said at least a portion of said electron microscopy specimen is eliminated by said thinning.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Any known method for thinning a sample with an ion beam is appropriate for the disclosed method. Appropriate methods include but are not limited to subjecting the sample to a focused ion beam, and subjecting the sample to a beam of argon ions from an ion gun.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, the thinning includes selective removal of material.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is disclosed the embodiments of the present invention that recite iterative thinning and electron transparency analysis of a sample are also appropriate for samples that are not necessarily electron-transparent upon removal from the wafer. This embodiment of the present invention is particularly advantageous, since more structurally sound samples are less prone to mechanical damage such as fracture upon formation or removal from the wafer. More stable samples are easier to handle, and are particularly appropriate for embodiments where the methods of sample preparation and imaging are automated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Furthermore, it is noted that for some embodiments the optimal sample thickness for imaging is not known a priori. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide methods for obtaining a plurality of imaging, each one reflecting a different sample thickness. In some embodiments, the alternate sample thinning and imaging are performed automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In a particular embodiment, the alternate ion beam milling and electron microscopy imaging are performed in situ when the sample is mounted on a sample support. It is noted that for some embodiments, this allows for the mounting of thicker and more stable samples than would otherwise be used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Although certain embodiments of the invention do not preclude the precleaving of an object or semiconductor wafer before sample formation, the techniques of the present invention do not require the wafer to be precleaved before extracting the samples, and do not require mechanical milling as part of the sample formation process. Embodiments and methods where the wafer is not precleaved are easier to automate, thus providing for defect analysis and process control in a manner that is minimally disruptive to the semiconductor manufacturing practice. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that obtaining samples from the wafer using methods of the present invention does only minimal damage to the wafer, leaving much of the wafer intact, and minimizing the economic impact of defect analysis on the overall cost of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The present inventors for the first time are disclosing a tool including a vacuum chamber, an ion beam source for forming a sample from an object, a robotic manipulator for extracting and manipulating a formed sample, and an electron microscopy device for performing electron transparency analysis of a sample extracted from an object within the tool. Heretofore, this automatic tool was not possible, due to the difficulties associated sample handling, and more specifically, due to difficulties with automatically removing an electron-transparent sample and mounting the sample for imaging. More specifically, the lack of a process whereby a sample of a sample can be milled to a very small thickness that is not limited by the sample transfer process from the wafer in the same vacuum chamber in which the sample is formed precluded the creation of the tool disclosed herein. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that methods of embodiments of the present invention overcome these difficulties.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be understood that the class of embodiments described herein provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily delimit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In accordance with many embodiments of the present invention, a disclosed method for sample formation begins with cutting of a portion of an object. In one specific embodiment, the object is a semiconductor wafer, though in other embodiments, exemplary objects include a biological material, a micromechanical device, a thin film, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an exemplary illustration of an object <b>102</b> from which a portion is to be extracted near a target location <b>106</b>, the object <b>102</b> including an upper or outer surface <b>112</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the object <b>102</b> depicted is of cylindrical shape, though this is by no means a limitation, and the present invention may be practiced with an object of any shape, including objects of substantially rectangular prism shape, objects of irregular dimensions, or any other shape. In some embodiments, the object <b>102</b> is a semiconductor wafer. It is noted that for many embodiments, the object <b>102</b> is a cylindrically shaped semiconductor wafer, and the relative dimensions of the diameter of the object <b>102</b> and the thickness of the object <b>102</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not to scale. For many such embodiments, the wafer is much thinner relative to the diameter than is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In many embodiments, the initial cutting penetrates the upper surface of the object <b>102</b>. In particular embodiments, the target location <b>106</b> is chosen based on the presence of a particular feature of interest warranting further study using electron transparency analysis. Exemplary features include failing semiconductor devices such as capacitors made of a number of sequentially deposited layers, or a metal contact in a memory cell. In the semiconductor industry, such failing devices are commonly located through electrical-failure-site maps using various surface and voltage features. Such a feature normally would have a microstructure penetrating into the bulk of the wafer and may be surrounded by other microstructures such as other cell circuitry. For purposes of illustration, the feature of interest will be assumed to be in a Y-Z plane defined by the Z and Y axes. It will be appreciated that because the feature is included in the Y-Z plane, the Y-Z plane defines a cross-section plane of the object <b>102</b> to be exposed in specimen preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Although only one target location <b>106</b> is illustrated on upper surface <b>112</b> of object <b>102</b>, in various embodiments more than one target location <b>106</b> exists, and samples are extracted and imaged from multiple target locations.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">After identifying the specific location <b>106</b>, a sample is formed by cutting object <b>102</b> through upper surface <b>112</b>. Although not a specific requirement, in many embodiments, the cutting technique includes an ion beam milling technique, preferably a focused ion beam milling technique. In the focused ion beam (“FIB”) technique, an object <b>102</b> or a subsection of object <b>102</b> is mounted on a specimen holder (not shown) and conveniently placed into a focused ion beam chamber (not shown) for focused ion beam milling. It is noted that for many embodiments wherein a FIB technique is used to cut the object <b>102</b>, the present invention provides methods for sample extraction wherein other portions of the object are not subjected to incidental damage. Such incidental damage is especially costly for the embodiments wherein the object <b>102</b> is a semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The FIB may be either a single-beam model, or a dual-beam model. Typical FIB instruments are those manufactured by Applied Materials (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, Calif.) including the SEMVision™ G<b>2</b> FIB and those available from FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oreg., as models 200, 820, 830, or 835. The skilled practitioner is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,610 of Shemesh et al, titled “System and Method for Directing a Miller.”</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The X-Y plane as denoted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as the “object plane.”</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the present invention wherein a sample <b>104</b> is initially formed by an ion beam creating two substantially parallel trenches <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> through upper surface <b>112</b> of object <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the vector B represents the incident vector of the ion beam, while the vector N represents the outward normal of an outer surface <b>124</b> of sample <b>104</b>. As used herein, the “outer surface” of the sample refers to a surface affixed in the sample corresponding to the upper surface <b>112</b> of the object <b>102</b>. When the sample <b>104</b> is subsequently removed from the object <b>102</b> and subjected to rotation, the outer surface <b>124</b> of the sample <b>104</b> affixed therein rotates with the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-D</figref>, sample <b>104</b> is a thin sample with two substantially parallel walls, or a membrane shaped sample, and sample <b>104</b> includes a region with a shape that is substantially a rectangular prism. In certain exemplary embodiments the width of this rectangular prism along the Y axis is ˜15-20 μm, the depth of this rectangular prism along the Z axis is ˜3-5 μm. In other exemplary embodiments, the depth of this rectangular prism is no more than 10 microns, in some embodiments no more than 20 microns, in some embodiments no more than 50 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments wherein it is intended to subject a portion of sample <b>104</b> to electron transparency analysis, a thickness along the X axis is 20-100 nm. Nevertheless, this thickness range should not be construed as a limitation, as embodiments of the present invention provide apparatus and methods for thinning a sample extracted from the object in the same vacuum chamber in which the sample is formed. Thus, in some embodiments where it is intended to subject a portion of sample <b>104</b> to electron transparency analysis, the thickness along the X axis is greater than 100 nm, even on the order of magnitude of a micron. For these embodiments, the sample is thinned after formation before electron transparency analysis. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that a thicker sample is it is less likely to fracture or crumble.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">For embodiments where it is intended to subject the sample <b>104</b> to microanalysis other than electron transparency analysis, the sample may be of any thickness along the X axis. In some embodiments, the sample thickness is greater than 100 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">These aforementioned dimensions are merely exemplary values, and it is to be understood that the samples of different dimensions are also acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the membrane shaped sample <b>104</b> includes an outer surface <b>124</b>, and proximal <b>120</b> and distal <b>122</b> object cross section surfaces. As used herein, a “sample wall” is a surface of the sample <b>104</b> affixed on the sample that is substantially perpendicular to an outer surface affixed within the sample. Examples of sample walls include proximal <b>120</b> and distal <b>122</b> object cross section surfaces. In some embodiments, a sample wall is adjacent to the outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, the sample comprises a segment having two substantially parallel surfaces. As used herein, an “object cross section surface” is a sample wall affixed on the sample that is substantially parallel to parallel trenches <b>110</b> and <b>108</b> upon formation of the parallel trenches. Exemplary object cross section surfaces include proximal <b>120</b> and distal <b>122</b> object cross section surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, it has been found by the present inventors that it is useful to subject sample walls, more particularly object cross section surfaces to microanalysis wherein the sample wall or object cross section surface is subjected to a beam of electrons to produce a microanalysis image.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Optionally, the object cross section surface is iteratively thinned and microanalyzed, providing a plurality images wherein each image represents a different exposed object cross section surface.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It is noted for the stage of sample formation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, there is no fundamental difference between the proximal and distal sample walls, and the method for sample formation does not require any asymmetry in the sample geometry at this stage. Thus, the denoting of surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> as “proximal” and “distal” object cross section surfaces is arbitrary for the stage of sample formation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the proximal <b>120</b> and distal <b>122</b> object cross section surfaces are treated differently at a later stage in the sample formation and extraction process.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Subsequent to the forming of the membrane shaped sample <b>104</b>, sample <b>104</b> is removed from the surrounding object <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Various techniques for cutting a completely formed sample and for removing the sample from the wafer are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,700,121 discloses the cutting of a sample from a larger object by forming two adjacent parallel trenches, where the sample is formed with a tether connecting the sample to the larger object. The sample is subsequently detached from the larger object using a micromanipulator. Exemplary techniques include but are not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,072, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An additional technique for cutting a completely formed sample and for subsequently detaching the sample is disclosed in U.S. published patent application 2002/0121614, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, which discloses a method of sample separation and lift-out by cutting with an ion beam a first cut into the wafer at a substantially normal incidence, and subsequently cutting with an ion beam a second cut into the wafer, undercutting the target so that the sample is completely released from the wafer. The sample can be removed from the wafer by affixing a probe to the sample, and then separating the sample from the wafer with the probe. It is to be understood that any of these disclosed methods, as well as others known to the skilled artisan, for forming a sample from a portion of the wafer, and for removing this sample from the wafer may be employed in accord with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates an exemplary method for undercutting the membrane-shaped sample <b>104</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the incident angle of the beam B is shifted to orient the vector B so that it is tilted from the surface <b>112</b> in order to form a wedge <b>126</b> underneath the rectangular prism. It is noted that either the proximal <b>120</b> or distal <b>122</b> object cross section surfaces or both surfaces may optionally be polished with a FIB beam after the formation of the substantially parallel trenches <b>110</b> and <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">There are different techniques known in the art for reorienting a corpuscular beam relative to an object upon which the beam is incident. In some embodiments, the object is situated on rotatable and tiltable stage, and an angle of incidence is changed by rotating and/or tilting the stage. In some embodiments, the beam source is an ion beam column, and the angle of incidence is changed by rotating or tilting the beam column. For example, a disclosure of rotation of a corpuscular beam column is available in U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,125, incorporated herein by reference. Nevertheless, this is not limiting, and it is noted that other techniques known in the art for tilting beam column are also appropriate for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">It is also noted that a combination of known techniques is also appropriate for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> provides a perspective view of the next step of sample formation, whereby one <b>121</b> of the two remaining walls connecting sample <b>104</b> to object <b>102</b> is cut away. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the thin connecting wall <b>121</b> is cut away using a milling beam. It is noted that according to some embodiments, the thin connecting wall <b>121</b> is optionally cut at an angle □ to the X axis. Exemplary values of □ range from about 0.01° to about to 0.2°.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As depicted in embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, when connecting wall <b>121</b> is cut at an angle□, any geometric symmetric between the proximal object cross section surface <b>120</b> and the distal object cross section surface <b>122</b> is broken.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In particular embodiments, before sample removal, a probe or needle is attached to the sample in order to remove the sample from the wafer. In some embodiments, the object <b>102</b> is resting on a stage (not shown), and once the needle or probe is attached to the object <b>102</b>, the sample is removed by lowering the stage.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is noted that appropriate needles are available from, for example, The Micromanipulator Co., Inc. (Carson City, Nev.).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> provides an illustration of an exemplary system wherein a needle <b>128</b> is welded to sample <b>104</b> using metal deposition with FIB. It is to be understood that welding is just one method of affixing needle <b>128</b> to sample <b>104</b>, and that any other technique, including affixing needle <b>128</b> using electrostatic attractive forces or adhesive, is appropriate for the practice of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The translational and rotational motion of needle <b>128</b> may be controlled by a human operator, or alternatively, may be controlled by a robotic controller.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In specific embodiments, the position of the needle is controlled using a vacuum or atmosphere manipulator. In embodiments in which the methods of the current invention are performed automatically, the motion of the needle is controlled by a robotic controller. Although the needle or probe may be attached to the sample at any angle and to any location on the outer surface <b>124</b> of the sample <b>104</b>, it is now disclosed specific orientations by which the needle or probe is attached to the sample <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrates an exemplary needle orientations and location. Thus, according to some embodiments, the probe or needle is affixed to said outer surface <b>124</b> of the sample such that said probe is substantially nonparallel to the outer surface of the sample <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, it is noted that the probe or needle <b>128</b> is oriented away from the outer surface <b>124</b>. According to some embodiments, this orientation implies that the minimal distance between the center <b>125</b> of the outer surface <b>124</b> and a vector representing the projection of said probe onto the outer surface is given by the distance between the center <b>125</b> of the outer surface <b>124</b> and the point of contact <b>127</b> between the probe or needle <b>128</b> and the outer surface of the sample <b>124</b>. According to some embodiments, the probe or needle <b>128</b> is oriented at an angle that is substantially 55 degrees from the normal vector of the outer surface <b>124</b> of the sample <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">It is noted that in embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a probe or needle vector originating at the point of contact <b>127</b> in the direction of the probe or needle is oriented in the (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) direction relative to the x-y-z axis affixed to the sample <b>104</b>. It is noted that the (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) orientation of the attached needle once more distinguishes between the proximal object cross section surface <b>120</b> and the distal object cross section surface <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, the probe or needle orientation facilitates rotation of the sample <b>104</b> upon removal from the object <b>102</b> such that the proximal object cross section surface <b>120</b> faces upwards once the sample <b>104</b> has been removed from the wafer <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the rotation is substantially a 120 degree rotation, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention wherein once the probe or needle is attached, a second wall <b>123</b> attaching the sample <b>104</b> to the object <b>102</b> is cut away. In some embodiments, the cutting of the second wall <b>123</b> is performed effected with a focused ion beam.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Once the sample <b>104</b> with the probe or needle <b>128</b> attached is cut away and detached from the object <b>102</b>, the sample <b>104</b> is removed from object <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, this removal is effected by lifting the sample <b>104</b> from the object with the affixed probe <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, removal of the sample <b>104</b> is effected by lowering a stage (not shown) upon which object <b>102</b> is resting while the sample is attached to a needle or probe <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">An exemplary illustration of sample <b>104</b> after sample <b>104</b> is extracted from object <b>102</b> and rotated is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. It is noted that the membrane shaped sample <b>104</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> has a beam shape in the Y-Z plane. Although the beam shape is not a requirement of the present invention, it is understood that this shape may imbue the sample with extra stability, lowering the probability that the sample will crack or break during sample formation, sample removal or imaging of the sample. It is understood that if the original sample <b>104</b> is too thin (in the X direction according to the axis provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), then the sample is more likely to be fragile, and could be physically damaged upon removal from the wafer, or thereafter, and could also adversely impact efforts to automate this process. On the other hand, if the original sample <b>104</b> is too thick, this may encumber subsequent efforts to thin the sample so as allow electron transparency analysis in the thickness dimension (the X dimension depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), for those embodiments where it is desired to subject the sample to electron transparency analysis. For embodiments in which the sample is subsequently thinned using FIB milling, a sample that is initially too thick concomitantly increases the time necessary to FIB mill the sample to a thickness appropriate for electron transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, subsequent to the extraction of sample <b>104</b> from object <b>102</b>, sample <b>104</b> is affixed to an upper surface <b>130</b> of a sample support <b>134</b>. In some embodiments, the sample <b>104</b> is beneath an ion beam when extracted from object <b>104</b>, attached to probe or needle <b>128</b> and suspended in the vacuum chamber. Subsequently, a stage holding a sample support <b>134</b> is brought underneath sample <b>104</b>, so that it may be lowered onto the desired location of the sample support <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">It is noted that in embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, sample <b>104</b> is affixed to sample support <b>134</b> such that the outer surface <b>124</b> of the sample <b>104</b> is substantially perpendicular to upper surface <b>130</b> of sample support <b>134</b>, thereby allowing the subsequent electron transparency analysis of a cross section of sample <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, sample <b>104</b> is rotated as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> in order to achieve the desired orientation of sample <b>104</b> relative to sample support <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Optionally, sample <b>104</b> is rotated so that an object cross section surface is substantially parallel to the upper surface <b>130</b> of sample support <b>134</b>. In some embodiments, sample <b>104</b> is rotated so that proximal object cross section surface <b>120</b> is substantially parallel to the upper surface <b>130</b> of sample support <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">According to some embodiments, an object cross section of the sample that is “substantially parallel to the surface of the sample support” is parallel to the surface of the sample support within a tolerance that is at most 10 degrees. In some embodiments, this tolerance is at most 5 degrees. In some embodiments, this tolerance is at most 3 degrees. In some embodiments, this tolerance is at most 1 degree.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In particular embodiments, needle <b>128</b> or other appropriate probe is removed after sample <b>104</b> is situated on sample support <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Sample <b>104</b> is then optionally affixed to an appropriate sample support for optional microanalysis. In exemplary embodiments, the microanalysis includes transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, sample support <b>134</b> includes at least one optional aperture <b>132</b>, through which an electron beam can pass during electron transparency analysis. In specific embodiments, sample <b>104</b> is positioned on upper surface <b>130</b> of sample support <b>134</b> such that at least part of sample <b>104</b> is on or over one of apertures <b>132</b>. In other embodiments, the sample support is solid, and lacks an aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In particular embodiments, the sample <b>104</b> is subjected to electron transparency analysis while mounted on the sample support <b>134</b>. Thus, sample <b>104</b> is positioned on upper surface <b>130</b> of sample support <b>134</b> such that at least part of sample <b>104</b> is on or over one of apertures <b>132</b> allows for an electron beam to traverse both at least a portion of the sample <b>104</b> and an aperture <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, subsequent to mounting on the sample support <b>134</b>, the sample <b>104</b> is subjected to a particle beam <b>142</b> such as an electron beam or an ion beam such as a focused ion beam emitted from beam source <b>140</b>.

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some embodiments, the microanalysis includes electron transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In some embodiments, the microanalysis includes at least one process selected from the group consisting of detection of secondary electrons, detection of backscattered electrons, and detection of photons including x-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">It is noted that carrying out this process in one tool eliminates the need to transfer a sample back and forth between two different tools, allowing for the automation of the process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-D</figref> provides a flow chart describing some embodiments of the present invention. The process begins by forming the sample <b>602</b> in the vacuum chamber. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, after the sample is created it is subjected to an iterative process of surface analysis <b>604</b> and surface removal by thinning <b>606</b>. In some embodiments, the surface analysis <b>604</b> includes any process associated with scattering electrons off of a surface of the sample, such as SEM, EDX and detection of Auger Electrons. Optionally, the sample is subjected to optical microscopy. In some embodiments, at the time of surface analysis <b>604</b>, the sample is thicker for detection of secondary electrons. According to some embodiments, at the time of surface analysis <b>604</b> no detector is required below the microanalyzed sample.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">It is noted that any method known for sample thinning is appropriate for the present invention. In some embodiments, the sample is thinned <b>606</b> using a focused ion beam. In some embodiments, the surface removal by thinning is effected by a sputtering argon ion beam.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">After an appropriate number of iterations of surface removal by thinning <b>606</b>, the sample is thin enough for electron transparency analysis. It is understood that the “electron transparency threshold” wherein a sample becomes thin enough for electron transparency analysis is not defined in terms of a specific numerical thickness, as this number depends on a number of factors, such as the energy of the electron beam source, the nature of the material to be subjected to electron transparency analysis, and the like. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that in some instances, thinning a sample with a thickness that is the same order of magnitude as the electron transparency threshold can improve the resolution of an electron transparency analysis image.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Once the sample is sufficiently thinned it is subjected to electron transparency analysis <b>608</b>. In some embodiments, a detector below the analyzed sample is required during the staged of transparency analysis <b>608</b>. Furthermore, it is noted that data collection step <b>610</b>A-D is illustrated as a final step in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-D</figref>, though it is understood that data may be collected throughout any illustrated process.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In one exemplary embodiment, the imaged portion of a sample represents a cross section of an object such as a semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">It is noted that in some embodiments the sample is subjected to more than one type of microanalysis. Furthermore, although the disclosed method is applicable to electron transparency analysis, this is not a limitation, and in some embodiments, microanalysis techniques other than electron transparency analysis are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, the thinning includes using a FIB that selectively removes certain materials from a surface of the sample. Thus, in exemplary embodiments FIB ion milling includes introducing an interactive species such as xenon difluoride.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> provides an illustration of an alternate embodiment of the iterative process of sample re-thinning and imaging. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, a single step of microanalysis <b>612</b> entails both surface and transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> provides a description of an embodiment wherein the microanalysis includes only transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> provides a description of an embodiment wherein the microanalysis includes surface analysis only and excludes transparency analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> provides an exemplary figure of sample thinning according to some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Optionally, at least one sample prepared using methods and apparatus described herein, is situated on a sample support, transferred out of the tool, and loaded onto a loading stations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> provides a flow chart of different sample delivery options. Thus, according to one embodiment, a created sample <b>602</b> is unloaded for surface analysis <b>630</b>. Optionally, the sample is thinned with <b>636</b> or without <b>632</b> microanalysis before unloading for surface and/or transparency analysis <b>634</b>. In some embodiments, the loading onto the loading station and transferring is automated, and controlled by a robotic arm (not shown), providing a fully automated process for obtaining of samples mounted to sample supports.</p>
