<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A suspension packaging system can include a foldable member configured to form a cavity as well as a suspension device for suspending an article to be packaged within the cavity. The suspension portion can include foldable portions configured to cooperate with a retention member having pockets. The foldable portions can fit into the pockets and then be folded so as to generate tension in the retention member. The entire device, with the exception of the retention member, can be made from a single piece of material, such as corrugated cardboard, which thus reduces waste and simplifies bulk distribution of such a suspension packaging system.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Inventions</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions are directed to a packaging system. In particular, the present inventions are directed to a suspension packaging system that includes a stretchable retention member having at least one pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Protective packaging devices are often used to protect goods from shocks and impacts during shipping or transportation. For example, when transporting articles that are relatively fragile, it is often desirable to cushion the article inside a box to protect the article from a physical impact with the inner walls of the box that might be caused by shocks imparted to the box during loading, transit, and unloading.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In most cases, some additional structure is used to keep the article from moving uncontrollably within the box. Such additional structures include paper or plastic packing material, structured plastic foams, foam-filled cushions, and the like. Ideally, the article to be packaged is suspended within the box so as to be spaced from at least some of the walls of the box, thus protecting the article from other foreign objects which may impact or compromise the outer walls of the box.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,675,973 discloses a number of inventions directed to suspension packaging assemblies which incorporate frame members and one or more retention members. For example, many of the embodiments of the U.S. Pat. No. 6,675,973 include the use of a retention member formed of a resilient material. Additionally, some of the retention members include pockets at opposite ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In several of the embodiments disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,675,973, free ends of the frame members are inserted into the pockets of the retention member. The free ends of the frame member are then bent, pivoted, or folded to generate the desired tension in the retention member. Because the retention member is made from a resilient material, the retention member can stretch and thus provide a mechanism for suspending an article to be packaged, for example, within a box.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of at least one of the inventions disclosed herein includes the realization that a single piece of material can be configured to provide both a container defining a cavity and means for tensioning a resilient member around an article to be packaged within the cavity. This provides several advantages. For example, by forming such a device out of a single piece of material, the device can be transported in an unfolded and flat state as a single piece, thereby simplifying the storage, transportation, and use of such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, when a packaging system using a somewhat rigid material, such as cardboard, is formed of two separate pieces, the two separate pieces need to be gathered at the location at which the system is assembled. For example, many of the embodiments shown in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,675,973 include one assembly for tensioning a resilient member around an article to be packaged and a box or other container for housing the first assembly. In a retail setting using such a device, the establishment would order equal numbers of the support members and the corresponding containers, which may be delivered to the retail establishment in different boxes. Generally, equal numbers of the boxes and support members will be stocked by the retail establishment. Difficulties can arise in stocking two different components of a single assembly. For example, one may not realize that a supply of one component has run out, even though the supply of the other component has not. Thus, by constructing the system from a single piece of material, it is less likely that a stocking error will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, in accordance with one embodiment, a packaging kit for packaging an article and maintaining the article in a position spaced from a wall of a container, comprises a resilient member comprising a body portion and first and second pockets disposed at opposite ends of the body portion. A substantially rigid member comprises a container portion comprising a plurality of foldable portions configured to form at least a bottom and first, second, third, and forth walls extending from a periphery of the bottom. An article securing portion comprises at least a support portion and at least first and second pivotable portions configured to be pivotable relative to the support portion, the pivotable portions configured to be insertable into the first and second pockets, respectively. The article securing portion is pivotably connected to the container portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another embodiment, a packaging container for packaging an article and maintaining the article in a position spaced from a wall of the container comprises a resilient member comprising a body portion and first and second pockets disposed at opposite ends of the body portion. A substantially rigid member comprises a container portion comprising means for forming at least a bottom and first, second, third, and forth walls extending from a periphery of the bottom. The container also includes means for securing an article with the resilient member under tension, wherein the means for securing is pivotably connected to the means for forming.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For purposes of summarizing the inventions and the advantages achieved over the prior art, certain objects and advantages of the inventions have been described hereinabove. Of course, it is to be understood that not necessarily all such objects or advantages may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the inventions. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the inventions may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or a group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other objects or advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">All of these embodiments are intended to be within the scope of the inventions disclosed herein. These and other embodiments of the inventions will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments having reference to the attached figures, the inventions not being limited to any particular preferred embodiments disclosed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An improved packaging system is disclosed herein. The packaging system includes an improved structure which provides new alternatives to known suspension packaging systems.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following detailed description, terms of orientation such as “upper,” “lower,” “longitudinal,” “horizontal,” “vertical,” “lateral,” “midpoint,” and “end” are used here to simply the description in the context of the illustrated embodiments. Because other orientations are possible, however, the present inventions should not be limited to the illustrated orientations. Additionally, the term “suspension” is not intended to require that anything, such as an article to be packaged, is suspended above anything. Rather, the terms “suspended” as used herein, is only intended to reflect that such an article is held in a position spaced from another member, such as at least some of the walls of a container or box. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other orientations of various components described herein are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a foldable member <b>10</b> is illustrated therein in an unfolded state and is constructed in accordance with an embodiment. The foldable member <b>10</b> includes a container portion <b>12</b> and a suspension portion <b>14</b>. The container portion <b>12</b> is configured to form a container having a cavity or a recess. The suspension portion <b>14</b> is configured to form a support and means for tensioning a resilient member for suspending an article to be packaged in a position spaced from at least some of the walls of the container portion <b>12</b>. Optionally, the member <b>10</b> can include a lid portion <b>16</b> configured to form a lid for the container portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A further advantage is provided where, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the container portion <b>12</b> is connected to the suspension portion <b>14</b>. As such, when manipulated into a folded state, the suspension portion <b>14</b> can be conveniently folded into the cavity of the container portion <b>12</b>. Additionally, in this embodiment, both the container portion <b>12</b> and the suspension portion <b>14</b> can be formed from a single piece of material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The member <b>10</b> can be constructed from various materials, including but without limitation, paper, cardboard, corrugated cardboard, plastic, and other appropriate materials. The chosen material for constructing the member <b>10</b> can be any substantially rigid but foldable material. It will be appreciated that, although denominated as rigid or substantially rigid, the chosen material would preferably have an amount of flexibility in the cases of extreme physical impact. In some embodiments, the material used to form the tray member <b>10</b> is a single wall corrugated C-flute cardboard.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this embodiment, the member <b>10</b> includes a central base member <b>20</b>. The designation as a “base member” does not impart any particular significance to the member <b>20</b>. Rather, the base member <b>20</b>, in this embodiment, simply forms a bottom or a top of the container, described in greater detail below. However, for ease of description, it is convenient to begin with the description of the base member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The size of the base member <b>20</b> can be chosen by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide the desired amount of surface area of the bottom or top of the container formed by the member <b>10</b>. In an exemplary but non-limiting embodiment, where the member <b>10</b> is intended to package a modem or a hard drive, the base member <b>20</b> can be about 10 inches square. However, this is merely an exemplary embodiment, and the base member <b>20</b> can have other dimensions for use in packaging modems or hard drives, or any other article that is to be packaged.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The container portion <b>12</b> can also include lateral wall portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and end wall portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Each of the lateral wall portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are configured to form a double wall portion when folded. For brevity, the construction of the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> will be described. However, it is to be understood that the lateral wall portion <b>24</b> also can include the same features.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lateral wall portion <b>22</b> includes an outer panel <b>30</b> and an inner panel <b>32</b>. Additionally, the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> can include at least one fold line defined between the inner panel <b>30</b> and the outer panel <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> includes an outer fold line <b>34</b> and an inner fold line <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fold lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> can be formed as perforations in the member <b>10</b>, i.e., broken cut lines passing partially or completely through the material forming the member <b>10</b>. In the alternative, or in addition, the fold lines can be crushed portions of the material forming the member <b>10</b>. Of course, depending on the material used to construct the member <b>10</b>, the fold lines can be formed as mechanical hinges, thinned portions, adhesive tape, or any other appropriate mechanical connection which would allow various portions of the tray member to be folded or rotated with respect to each other. These concepts apply to all the fold lines described herein, although this description will not be repeated with respect to the other fold lines described below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the illustrated embodiment, when the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> is folded upwardly and inwardly toward the base member <b>20</b>, the inner panel <b>32</b> forms an inner wall of the container and the panel <b>30</b> forms an outer wall. The area between the fold lines <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, identified generally by the reference numeral <b>38</b>, will form an upper edge of the lateral wall portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The lateral wall portion <b>22</b> can also include means for securing the walls in place when folded. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the inner panel <b>32</b> includes a projection <b>40</b> on its outermost edge <b>42</b>. When the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> is completely folded, the projection <b>40</b> will rest against the base member <b>20</b> adjacent a fold line <b>44</b> defined at the boundary between the base portion <b>20</b> and the lateral wall portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The projection <b>40</b> is merely one type of configuration that can be provided for securing the lateral wall portion <b>22</b> in place. Optionally, lateral edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the inner panel <b>32</b> can include projections similar to the projection <b>40</b>. As such, the lateral edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> will press against the end walls <b>28</b>, <b>26</b>, respectively, when in a folded state. Further, the base member <b>20</b> can include an aperture for receiving the projection <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment, the inner panel <b>32</b> can be substantially narrower than the outer panel <b>30</b>. For example, an optional outermost edge <b>42</b>′ is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so as to illustrate another embodiment in which the inner panel <b>32</b> is significantly narrower than the outer panel <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, it is preferable that the lateral edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are either enlarged or include projections for securing the inner panel <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This alternative provides a significant advantage because the inner panel <b>32</b> and the corresponding panel of the lateral wall portion <b>24</b> define the outermost extremes of one of the major dimensions of the member <b>10</b>. Thus, by reducing the width of the panel <b>32</b> and the corresponding part of the lateral wall portion <b>42</b>, the overall size and thus the waste of raw material used to form the member <b>10</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, as is well known in the arts using bulk cardboard, anything cut from cardboard begins as a large rectangular piece. The large rectangular piece must be at least as large, in every dimension, as the final product. Thus, by reducing the greatest dimensions of the finished piece, the size of the original raw material can be reduced, thus resulting in less wasted cardboard.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The end wall portion <b>26</b> can include a single wall panel <b>50</b> connected to the main panel along a fold line <b>52</b>. The end wall portion <b>26</b> can also include corner flaps <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, connected to the wall panel <b>50</b> along fold lines <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. Optionally, the lid portion <b>16</b> can be connected to the end wall <b>50</b> along a fold line <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The lateral wall portion <b>26</b> is configured such that the panel <b>50</b> can be folded towards the base portion <b>20</b> along the fold line <b>52</b>. Additionally, the corner flaps <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> can be folded inwardly toward the panel <b>50</b>, at about a right angle, for example, such that when the panel <b>50</b> is folded into an orientation being approximately perpendicular to the base portion <b>20</b>, the corner flaps <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> lie along or adjacent to the fold lines <b>44</b> between the lateral wall portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the base portion <b>20</b>. With the corner flaps <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> in this orientation, the lateral wall portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can be folded over the corner flaps <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. As such, for example, the corner flap <b>56</b> is sandwiched between the outer panel <b>30</b> and the outer panel <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lid portion <b>16</b> can include a top panel portion <b>70</b> connected to the wall panel <b>50</b> along the fold line <b>62</b>. The top panel <b>70</b> can be approximately the same size as the base panel <b>20</b>. Additionally, the lid portion <b>16</b> can include a wall panel <b>72</b> and corner flaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. The wall panel <b>72</b> is connected to the top panel <b>70</b> along a fold line <b>78</b>. Additionally, the corner flaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are attached to the wall panel <b>72</b> along fold lines <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The corner flaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are configured to be inserted into a space between the walls of the lateral wall portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. For example, the corner flap <b>76</b> is configured to be inserted into a space between the outer wall <b>30</b> and the inner wall <b>32</b>, described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The end wall portion <b>22</b> can be configured substantially in the same manner as the end wall portion <b>26</b>. Thus, the end wall portion <b>28</b> includes a wall panel <b>90</b> connected to the base portion <b>20</b> along a fold line <b>92</b>. Additionally, the end wall portion <b>28</b> includes corner flaps <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> attached to the wall panel <b>90</b> along fold lines <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The suspension portion <b>14</b> is connected to the wall panel <b>90</b> along a fold line <b>102</b>. The location of the fold line <b>102</b> defines a width of the panel <b>90</b>. This width can be smaller than the width of the panel <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the width of the panel <b>90</b> is identified by the reference numeral <b>104</b>, and the width of the panel <b>50</b> is identified by the reference numeral <b>106</b>. Generally, the width <b>106</b> of panel <b>50</b> is also the same as the width of the panel <b>30</b>, the outer wall panel <b>30</b>, and the corresponding outer wall of the lateral wall portion <b>24</b>. Thus, the width <b>106</b> generally defines the maximum depth of the cavity formed by the container portion <b>12</b>. The reduced width <b>104</b> of a portion of the wall <b>90</b> provides additional clearance for the suspension portion <b>14</b>, illustrated in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The suspension portion <b>14</b> can also include a tensioning portion <b>110</b> that is configured to interact with a resilient member to suspend an article to be packaged within the cavity defined by the container portion <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the tensioning portion <b>110</b> includes a support panel <b>112</b> and at least one foldable portion. In some embodiments, the tensioning portion <b>110</b> can include two foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are connected to the support panel <b>112</b> along fold lines <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are configured to fit into pockets defined in a resilient member and to tension the resilient member by being folded along the fold lines <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optionally, extreme ends of the fold line <b>102</b>, identified generally by the reference numerals <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, can be cuts extending completely through the material forming the member <b>10</b>. As such, the panel <b>112</b> can be folded more easily relative to the panel <b>90</b> along the fold line <b>102</b>. Additionally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the end portions <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the fold line <b>102</b> are angled relative to the main portion of the fold line <b>102</b> to provide a contiguous connection to the corner panels <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this arrangement, the tensioning portion <b>110</b> can provide the dual functions of tensioning the resilient member so as to resiliently support an article to be packaged against the panel <b>112</b> and providing for a hinged folding movement of the article thus supported into the cavity defined by the container portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Optionally, the suspension portion <b>14</b> can further include a separator portion <b>130</b>. The separator portion can be configured to define a separation, within the cavity defined by the container portion <b>12</b>, and between the article to be packaged and a further open volume of space within the container.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the illustrated embodiment, the separator portion <b>130</b> includes a wall panel <b>132</b>, an anchor panel <b>134</b>, and corner panels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. The wall panel <b>132</b> is connected to the support panel <b>112</b> along a fold line <b>140</b>. The anchor panel <b>134</b> is connected to the wall panel <b>132</b> along fold line <b>142</b>. The corner panel <b>136</b> is connected to both the foldable panel <b>114</b> and the wall panel <b>132</b> along fold lines <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, respectively. Similarly, the corner panel <b>138</b> is connected to both the foldable portion <b>116</b> and the wall panel <b>132</b> along fold lines <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described in greater detail below, the wall panel <b>132</b>, the anchor panel <b>134</b>, and the corner panels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> can be folded relative to the tensioning portion <b>114</b> so as to define a separation between volumes of space within the cavity formed by the container portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in folding the container portion <b>12</b> so as to define a cavity, the corner panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> can first be folded upwardly into a generally perpendicular orientation relative to the end walls <b>50</b>, <b>90</b>. Then, the walls <b>50</b>, <b>90</b>, along with the corner panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> attached to and folded relative thereto, can be folded upwardly into a generally perpendicular orientation relative to the base <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, folded as such, at least the corner panels <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> define a small spacing between the corner panels <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> and the fold line <b>44</b>, the spacings identified generally by the reference numerals <b>160</b>. The spacings <b>160</b> are configured to receive the corner panels <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lateral wall portions <b>22</b> can then be folded so as to enclose the corner panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, therein. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inner panel <b>32</b> and the corresponding panel of the lateral wall section <b>24</b>, now form inner walls of a cavity <b>162</b>. Similarly, the end walls <b>50</b>, <b>90</b> form end walls of the cavity <b>162</b>, with the base portion <b>20</b> forming the bottom thereof. Prior to or after the formation of the cavity <b>162</b> as such, an article to be packaged can be secured to the tensioning portion <b>110</b> with a resilient member.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a resilient member <b>170</b> that can be used with the tensioning portion <b>110</b>. The resilient member in the illustrated embodiment is identified as a retention member <b>170</b>. The retention member <b>170</b> preferably is formed of a resilient body <b>172</b>. For purposes of convenience for the following description, the body <b>172</b> is identified as having a mid point M positioned in the vicinity of the middle of the resilient body <b>172</b>. The resilient body <b>172</b> also includes pockets <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> at opposite ends thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the retention member <b>170</b> is formed of a single piece of resilient material, and is sized to cooperate with the tensioning member <b>110</b> having the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the illustrated embodiment, the pockets <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> are formed of folds <b>178</b>, <b>180</b> formed in the resilient body <b>172</b> which have been attached (e.g., heat sealed) along lateral opposite edges thereof. In this embodiment, the heat sealing process forms the heat sealing lines <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>. The heat sealing lines <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> can be continuous or formed of a plurality of heat sealed points.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous methods for forming pockets in a resilient sheet material such as the resilient body <b>172</b>. However, it has been found that heat sealing is particularly advantageous as it does not require expensive adhesives in the time consuming steps required for using such adhesives. However, such adhesives can be used if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The retention member <b>170</b> has a length L<sub>1 </sub>that is sized depending on the other devices with which the retention member <b>170</b> is to cooperate. Thus, the length L<sub>1 </sub>can be sized such that when the retention member is in its final state, e.g., engaged with the folding portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, it generates the desired tension for the corresponding application. Thus, the length L<sub>1 </sub>will be smaller where a higher tension is desired and will be larger where a lower tension is desired. Additionally, the length L<sub>1 </sub>might be different for different sized articles that are to be packed. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the length L<sub>1 </sub>for the corresponding application.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The retention member <b>170</b> can be formed of any resilient material. In some embodiments, the retention member <b>170</b> can be made of a polyethylene film. However, virtually any polymer, elastomer, or plastic film can be used to form the retention member <b>170</b>. The density of the film can be varied to provide the desired retention characteristics such as overall strength, resiliency, and vibrational response. Preferably, the density of the retention member <b>170</b> is determined such that the retention member <b>170</b> is substantially resilient when used to package a desired article.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with the member <b>10</b> in the orientation described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the retention member <b>170</b> can be engaged with the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. For example, the pockets <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> of the retention member <b>170</b> can be placed over portions of the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Additionally, an article to be packaged <b>190</b> can be disposed between the body portion <b>172</b> of the retention member <b>170</b> and the support panel <b>112</b>. Then, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> can be folded downwardly (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) along the direction of arrows <b>192</b>, <b>194</b>, respectively, until the desired tension is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> can be folded to their maximum limit until they lie against the support panel <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the length L<sub>1 </sub>of the retention member <b>170</b> can be sized such that the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> generate the desired tension before they are folded against the support panel <b>112</b>, thereby leaving a clearance between the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and the panel <b>112</b>. This can provide additional cushioning for the article <b>190</b> between the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and a cover of the cavity <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in some embodiments, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> can include additional fold lines identified generally by the reference numerals <b>196</b>, <b>198</b>. As such, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> can be further folded to thereby generate an additional shock absorbing structure beneath the panel <b>112</b>. The function of this additional shock absorbing feature is described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates a top plan view of the member <b>10</b> having the article to be packaged <b>190</b> secured to the panel <b>112</b> with the resilient retention member <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the suspension portion <b>14</b> can then be rotated relative to the container portion <b>12</b>, in the direction identified by the arrow <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an orientation of the suspension portion <b>14</b> after having been folded in the direction of arrow <b>200</b>. In this orientation, the face of the panel <b>112</b> contacting the article <b>190</b> faces inwardly toward the cavity <b>162</b>. The foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> now face upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As noted above, the width <b>104</b> of the portion of the front wall <b>90</b> which connects to the suspension portion <b>14</b> along the fold line <b>102</b> is less than the width <b>106</b> defined by the wall <b>50</b>. The difference between the widths <b>106</b>, <b>104</b> allows the suspension portion <b>14</b> to fold slightly more deeply into the cavity <b>162</b>, thereby providing space for the additional thickness created by the folding portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> when in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The width <b>104</b> can be further decreased, in some embodiments, to provide additional clearance between the folding portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> in the upper peripheral edge of the cavity <b>162</b> defined by the width <b>106</b>. For example, as noted above, if it is desired to provide an additional shock absorbing effect by allowing the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to remain spaced from the support panel <b>112</b>, the additional space required can be accommodated by making the width <b>104</b> smaller. As such, the suspension portion <b>14</b> can sit more deeply in the cavity <b>162</b>, thereby allowing the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to remain spaced from the panel <b>112</b>. Thus, when a lid is placed over the cavity <b>162</b> at the height defined by the width <b>106</b>, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> can flex under the tension of the retention member <b>170</b> to absorb shocks and/or impacts made to a lid used to cover the upper opening of the cavity <b>162</b>, such as the lid portion <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it is to be noted that the separator portion <b>130</b> has also been folded to divide the internal cavity <b>162</b> into a suspension cavity <b>210</b> and an additional cavity <b>212</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the suspension cavity <b>210</b> serves to isolate the article <b>190</b> within the cavity <b>162</b>. The additional cavity <b>212</b> can be used to store other items, such as, for example, but without limitation, articles that are not as sensitive as the article <b>190</b>. In an illustrative but non-limiting embodiment, the article <b>190</b> can be a hard drive or a modem and the other article <b>214</b> disposed in the additional cavity <b>212</b> can be the power cord, data cable, and/or other items that are not as shock sensitive as the article <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the illustrated embodiment, it is to be noted that the corner panels <b>138</b>, <b>136</b> cooperate with the wall panel <b>132</b> to define a double wall divider between the cavity <b>210</b> and the cavity <b>212</b>. However, this is merely an optional arrangement and the corner portions <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> can be eliminated altogether. However, using the additional corner panels <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> provides additional structural integrity to the suspension portion <b>14</b> and in particular, the retention of the folded shape of the suspension portion <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this arrangement, the anchor panel <b>134</b> also aids in anchoring the position of the wall <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the divider portion <b>130</b> can also include foldable portions similar to the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and a resilient member, similar to the retention member <b>170</b>, for providing another suspension packaging arrangement in the cavity <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the lid portion <b>16</b> has been folded about the fold line <b>62</b> along the direction identified by the reference numeral <b>220</b>. Additionally, although not illustrated, the panels <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> along with the wall panel <b>72</b> can be further rotated in the direction identified by arrow <b>222</b> such that the panels <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are inserted into the gaps <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), so as to secure the wall panel <b>72</b> against the wall <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this arrangement, the member <b>10</b>, which can be formed from a single piece of material, is used not only to define one or a plurality of internal cavities <b>162</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, but also to provide a suspension packaging arrangement using a tensioned resilient member as well as a lid. Thus, the member <b>10</b> can be shipped in the flat and unfolded state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stacked in a tight fashion allowing a large number of members <b>10</b> to be transported to a user in high numbers and at low cost. Additionally, the retention members <b>170</b> can be provided in a roll form in high numbers and in a compact state.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an arrangement in which the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are not folded completely against the support panel <b>112</b>. Rather, the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are left to flex under the tension of the retention member <b>170</b> to provide a further shock absorbing function. Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can be considered to represent the arrangement illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in which the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> include the additional fold lines <b>196</b>, <b>198</b> providing an additional and further shock absorbing structure.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In either of these arrangements, the width <b>104</b> has been reduced to a width <b>104</b>′ to thereby provide increased clearance for the optional arrangement of the foldable portions <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a further modification of the member <b>10</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the base panel <b>20</b> can include an aperture <b>230</b> allowing for viewing of the article <b>190</b> therethrough. In such an arrangement, it is advantageous to use a retention member <b>170</b> that has a generally clear or translucent appearance, thereby allowing viewing of the article <b>190</b> through the aperture <b>230</b>. In this arrangement, the base member <b>20</b> can form what would be considered a “top” of the completed container. In some embodiments, the aperture <b>230</b> can be covered with a clear or translucent panel <b>232</b> so as to prevent the intrusion of foreign objects into the cavity <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although the present inventions have been described in terms of certain embodiments, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art also are within the scope of these inventions. Thus, various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the inventions. For instance, various components may be repositioned as desired. Moreover, not all of the features, aspects and advantages are necessarily required to practice the present inventions.</p>
