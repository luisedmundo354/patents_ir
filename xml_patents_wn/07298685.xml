<p id="p-0003" num="0002">PHOTONICS DATA STORAGE SYSTEM USING A POLYPEPTIDE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME (PCT/FR01/02386) filed on Jul. 20, 2001.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a large volume diffractive optics memory. In particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for recording information to and reading information from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory. Furthermore, the present invention relates to methods for making a multi-layer memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The large storage capacities and relative low costs of CD-ROMS and DVDs have created an even greater demand for still larger and cheaper optical storage media. Holographic memories have been proposed to supersede the optical disc as a high-capacity digital storage medium. The high density and speed of the holographic memory comes from three-dimensional recording and from the simultaneous readout of an entire packet of data at one time. The principal advantages of holographic memory are a higher information density (10<sup>11 </sup>bits or more per square centimeter), a short random access time (˜100 microseconds and less), and a high information transmission rate (10<sup>9 </sup>bit/sec).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In holographic recording, a light beam from a coherent monochromatic or multi-spectral source (e.g., a laser) is split into a reference beam and an object beam. The object beam is passed through a spatial light modulator (SLM) and then into a storage medium. The SLM forms a matrix of shutters (in the binary case) or, more generally, a matrix of photocells modulating the light intensity that represents a packet of data. The object beam passes through the SLM which acts to modulate the object beam with the binary information being displayed on the SLM. The modulated object beam is then directed to one point on the storage medium by a beam processor where it intersects with the reference beam to create a hologram representing the packet of data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An optical system consisting of lenses and mirrors is used to precisely direct the optical beam encoded with the packet of data to the particular spatially addressed area of the storage medium. Optimum use of the capacity of a thick storage medium is realized by spatial and angular multiplexing. In spatial multiplexing, a set of packets is stored in the storage medium shaped into a plane as an array of spatially separated and regularly arranged sub-holograms by varying the beam target in the x-axis and y-axis of the plane. Each sub-hologram is formed at a point in the storage medium with the rectangular coordinates representing the respective packet address as recorded in the storage medium. In angular multiplexing, recording is carried out by keeping the x- and y-coordinates the same while changing the irradiation angle of the reference beam in the storage medium. By repeatedly incrementing the irradiation angle, a plurality of packets of information is recorded as a set of sub-holograms at the same x- and y-spatial location.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Previous techniques for recording information to a highly multiplexed volume holographic memory, and for subsequently reading the information from this memory are limited in memory capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for recording to and reading from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory capable of an extended storage capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to increase the capacity of the multi-layer diffractive optics memory by developing hyper-multiplexing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the present invention to develop a hyper-multiplexing recording device for recording information to a multi-layer diffractive optics memory which has a small size.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is still another object of the present invention to develop a hyper-multiplexing reading device which reads information from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory which has a small size.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet a further object of the present invention to develop methods for making a multi-layer diffractive optics memory.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the present invention comprises an apparatus and method for recording information on a multi-layer diffractive optics memory. A composite mirror device comprises a plurality of sets of mirror elements. Each one of the mirror elements of the sets is configured to direct a reference beam to a point of the multi-layer memory at one of a plurality of angles. A plurality of planes is associated with each of the plurality of sets. There is one plane per set, each plane being defined for each of the sets of mirror elements so that the paths formed from the mirror elements of the set to the point lie in the plane. Each of the planes is separated from its neighbor by an angle selected to avoid crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further aspect of the present invention, the multi-layer diffractive optics memory comprises a plurality of layers of recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In still another aspect of the present invention, an object beam records information at the point of the memory extending through the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another aspect of the present invention, the reference beam is configured to interfere with the object beam in the memory throughout the point.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect of the present invention, an angular processing mirror positions the reference beam to one of the mirror elements which then directs the reference beam to the point.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In still another aspect of the present invention, the mirror elements of each of the sets of mirror elements implements angular multiplexing by forming the plurality of angles for the set.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect of the present invention, the memory is made of a polypeptide material.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still another aspect of the present invention, the memory comprises eight layers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another aspect of the present invention, each of the sets has 50 mirror elements.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another aspect of the present invention, the composite mirror device comprises 50 sets of mirror elements implementing 50 planes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another aspect of the present invention, the memory is moved in an -x or -y direction of the rectilinear coordinates of the surface of the memory so that the reference beam shifts with respect to the surface of the memory so that the point shifts to another spatial location on the surface of the medium whereby spatial multiplexing is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another aspect of the present invention, the present invention comprises an apparatus and method for reading information from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory. A composite mirror device comprises a plurality of sets of mirror elements. Each one of the mirror elements of the sets is configured to direct a reference beam to a point of the multi-layer memory at one of a plurality of angles. A plurality of planes is associated with the plurality of sets. There is one plane per set, each plane being defined for each of the sets of mirror elements so that the paths formed from the mirror elements of the set to the point lie in the plane. Each of the planes is separated from its neighbor by an angle selected to avoid crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In still another aspect, the present invention comprises the multi-layer diffractive optics memory.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another aspect of the present invention, the memory is composed of polypeptide material.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In yet another aspect of the present invention, an angular processing mirror positions the reference beam to the point of the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another aspect of the present invention, the angular processing mirror is a MEOMS.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In still another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of light-sensitive elements detects a reconstruction beam carrying a packet of information at the point illuminated with the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another aspect of the present invention, the plurality of light-sensitive elements forms a CCD camera.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In still another aspect of the present invention, there is a method for making a multi-layer diffractive optics memory on a glass substrate. A first layer of the memory is made by laying down a thin layer of polypeptide on a glass substrate. One or more interference patterns is recorded in the first layer. A thin layer of optical glue is laid down for protection over the first layer. A second layer is made by laying down a thin layer of polypeptide onto the previously constructed first layer and protection layer. One or more interference patterns is recorded in the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In still another aspect of the present invention, the steps of making a layer and recording a layer to build additional layers onto the glass substrate are repeated until a desired number of the layers are constructed.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Recording Process</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an apparatus <b>100</b> for recording information at a point <b>8</b><i>a </i>of a multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> according to the present invention. A laser (not shown) emits a coherent light beam which is divided by a beam splitter (not shown) into a reference beam <b>1</b> and an object beam <b>4</b>. The reference beam <b>1</b> is directed by an angular processing mirror <b>140</b> to one of the mirror elements <b>120</b> of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> which then aims the reference beam <b>1</b> onto one of the points <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b>. The object beam <b>4</b> is focused by a focusing lens <b>105</b> through a hole <b>125</b> in the composite mirror device <b>110</b> onto the point <b>8</b><i>a </i>where the object beam <b>4</b> interferes with the reference beam <b>1</b> creating a holographic interference pattern within the material of the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> is alternately referred to as a storage medium. The multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> comprises a polypeptide material capable of storing information coated onto a recording plate. At the end of a recording process, the multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> stores information therein. Two methods of creating a multi-layer diffractive optics memory will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The object beam <b>4</b> is modulated by a display (not shown) with a packet of information <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The display (not shown) may be any display for displaying a data packet <b>6</b> in two dimensions such as a spatial light modulator (SLM) or a liquid crystal light valve (LCLV). The display comprises, for example, a liquid crystal display screen on which data is encoded in a two-dimensional pattern of transparent and opaque pixels. The data is input to the display via a computer (not shown) or by other digital data or analog origins. The plurality of bits represented on the display screen of the display as a two-dimensional pattern of transparent and opaque pixels is known as a data packet <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The data packed <b>6</b> displayed is derived from any source such as a computer program, the Internet, and so forth. In an Internet storage application, the packets displayed may be formatted similarly to the packets of the Internet. The object beam <b>4</b> becomes modulated by the information to be recorded by means of transmission through the display.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The lasers, beam splitter and SLM devices for holographic recording have been developed in the art and further details can be found in the book <i>Holographic Data Storage</i>, Springer (2000) edited by H. J. Coufal, D. Psaltis, and G. T. Sincerbox.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the same time, the reference beam <b>1</b> undergoes reflection off the angular processing mirror <b>140</b> which can rotate so that the reference beam <b>1</b> arrives at one of the micro-mirrors <b>120</b> which are organized into sets of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> the orientation of which will modify the angle of incidence of the reference beam <b>1</b> with respect to the object beam <b>4</b>, again in the region of the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b>. Thus, by this process angular multiplexing is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The angular processing mirror <b>140</b> has stability characteristics fitting the constraints of recording. The angular processing mirror <b>140</b> sends the reference beam <b>1</b> to the composite mirror device <b>110</b>. The composite mirror device <b>110</b> comprises a plurality of mirror elements <b>120</b> spatially organized into rows and columns forming sets. Each of the mirror elements <b>120</b> has a specific spatial angular orientation. In one embodiment of the present invention, in every set (e.g., this could be a row) there are 50 mirrors to deflect the reference beam <b>1</b> at one of 50 angles and there are 50 rows of mirrors, one row for each of 50 planes of the mirror. Every set is oriented in a different way in order to process the beam to a different plane. In this embodiment, each point has 2500 packets of information stored therein (50 angles for each of 50 sets of mirror elements). Furthermore, a packet has a size of 800×600 bytes stored at a point 1 mm<sup>2</sup>. Thus the storage capacity is one terabits per centimeter squared.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic of the important signals involved in recording a diffraction pattern, or alternately a hologram, in the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> using angular and spatial multiplexing. Various diffractive recording processes have been developed in the art and further details can be found in the book <i>Holographic Data Storage</i>, Springer (2000) edited by H. J. Coufal, D. Psaltis, and G. T. Sincerbox. In forming a hologram, the reference beam <b>1</b> intersects with the object beam <b>4</b> to form a sub-hologram <b>8</b><i>a </i>(referred to alternately as a point) extending through the volume of storage medium <b>8</b>. There is a separate sub-hologram or point <b>8</b><i>a </i>extending through the volume for each angle and spatial location of the reference beam <b>1</b>. The object beam <b>4</b> is modulated with a packet of information <b>6</b>. The packet <b>6</b> contains information in the form of a plurality of bits. The source of the information for the packet <b>6</b> can be a computer, the Internet, or any other information-producing source. The hologram impinges on the surface <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the storage medium <b>8</b> and extends through the volume of the storage medium <b>8</b>. The information for the packet <b>6</b> is modulated onto the storage medium <b>8</b> by spatial multiplexing and angle multiplexing. Angle multiplexing is achieved by varying the angle α of the reference beam <b>1</b> with respect to the surface plane of the storage medium <b>8</b>. A separate packet <b>6</b> of information is recorded in the storage medium <b>8</b> as a sub-hologram for each chosen angle α and spatial location. Spatial multiplexing is achieved by shifting the reference beam <b>1</b> with respect to the surface of the storage medium <b>8</b> so that the point <b>8</b><i>a </i>shifts to another spatial location, for example point <b>8</b><i>a</i>′, on the surface of the storage medium <b>8</b>. One embodiment for shifting the reference beam is to mechanically move the memory <b>8</b> in a -x or -y direction with respect to the reference beam.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The storage medium <b>8</b> is typically a three-dimensional body made up of a material sensitive to a spatial distribution of light energy produced by interference of the object light beam <b>4</b> and the reference light beam <b>1</b>. A hologram may be recorded in a medium as a variation of absorption or phase or both. The storage material must respond to incident light patterns causing a change in its optical properties. In a volume hologram, a large number of packets of data can be superimposed, so that every packet of data can be reconstructed without distortion. A volume (thick) hologram may be regarded as a superposition of three dimensional gratings recorded in the depth of the emulsion each satisfying the Bragg law (i.e., a volume phase grating). The grating planes in a volume hologram produce change in refraction and/or absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Several materials have been considered as storage material for optical storage systems because of inherent advantages. These advantages include a self-developing capability, dry processing, good stability, thick emulsion, high sensitivity, and nonvolatile storage. Some materials that have been considered for volume holograms are photofractive crystals, photopolymer materials, and polypeptide material.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> may be made of photopolymer materials, polypeptide material, and other such materials for optical recording. With a photopolymer the density storage will be much more limited than by using a polypeptide with a shorter life duration and a lower SNR and a lower tolerancing. Polypeptides are the only photo-material allowing stability, transparency to substantially all wavelengths, large diffraction efficiency, an angular tolerancing that can be programmed and controlled, and a very good stability over a large range of temperatures. Polypeptide can be protected against ultra-violet light, moisture, scratches and other physical constraints. Thus, preferably, the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> is made of a polypeptide material.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An embodiment of a polypeptide material suitable for the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> is disclosed in the application PHOTONICS DATA STORAGE SYSTEM USING A POLYPEPTIDE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME (PCT/FR01/02386) filed on Jul. 20, 2001 and incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows in greater detail the diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> arranged in the form of a flat sheet, herein referred to as a matrix. In this example, the matrix is 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. Each of a plurality of points on the matrix is defined by its rectilinear coordinates (x, y). An image-forming system (not shown) reduces the object beam <b>4</b> to the sub-hologram <b>8</b><i>a </i>having a minimum size at one of the x, y points of the matrix. A point in physical space defined by its rectilinear coordinates contains a plurality of packets <b>8</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this case, a 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>image <b>8</b><i>a </i>is obtained by focusing the object beam <b>4</b> onto the storage medium <b>8</b> centered at its coordinate. Due to this interference between the two beams <b>1</b>,<b>4</b>, a diffractive image <b>8</b><i>a </i>1 mm<sup>2 </sup>in size is recorded in the storage medium <b>8</b> centered at the coordinates of the matrix. Spatial multiplexing is carried out by sequentially changing the rectilinear coordinates. The object beam <b>4</b> focuses on the storage medium <b>8</b> so that a separate image <b>8</b><i>a </i>is recorded at a unique position in the plane defined by its coordinates (x, y). This spatial multiplexing results in a 10 by 10 matrix of points (i.e. diffractive images) <b>8</b><i>a</i>. Angle multiplexing is carried out by sequentially changing the angle of the reference beam <b>1</b> by means of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> as described above. Angle multiplexing is used to create 25 packets of information <b>8</b><i>b </i>corresponding to 25 discrete variations of the angle of incidence of the reference beam. Experimental results show that 25 multiplexing angles are possible and this can be doubled, by a symmetric set-up to 50 angles. A data packet is reconstructed by shinning the reference beam <b>1</b> at the same angle and spatial location in which the data packed was recorded. The diffractive portion of the reference beam <b>1</b> diffracted by the storage medium <b>8</b> forms the reconstruction, which is typically detected by a detector array. The storage medium <b>8</b> may be mechanically shifted in order to store data packets at different points by its coordinates (x, y).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>shows the composite mirror device <b>110</b> comprising a plurality of micro-mirrors organized into sets. A micro-mirror <b>120</b> illustrates an instance of a micro-mirror. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>shows a typical example of the organization of the micro-mirrors <b>120</b>, including a first set of flat micro-mirrors including in a row of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> instances <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>, and a second set of micro-mirrors, including in another row of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> instances <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b</i>. Each of the micro-mirrors <b>120</b> has a specific orientation depending on its purpose (implemented function). The composite mirror <b>110</b> has a hole <b>125</b> in its center to allow the object beam <b>4</b> to cross through for the recording process. The hole <b>125</b> is not necessary for the subsequent reading process (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>shows a cross-section of the multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> having a plurality of layers <b>150</b>, two of which are labeled <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b</i>. In one of the embodiments of the present invention, there are 8 layers. A layer is coated on the surface of a glass or plastic substrate <b>150</b><i>c</i>. Each of the layers has a thickness of 30 microns of specially sensitized polypeptide material. On a single layer a maximum of 350 packets can be recorded. A memory with 8 layers allows for the storage of 2,500 packets of information (i.e. 2500 divided by 350 equals 8 rounded up).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>illustrates the principal of recording using a plurality of planes <b>160</b>. The multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> is formed by coating a plurality of layers of polypeptide material on the plate substrate, e.g., glass or plastic. There is illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>a plurality of planes <b>160</b> (e.g., <b>160</b><i>a</i>-<b>160</b><i>e</i>). The set of mirrors with instances <b>120</b><i>a</i>, . . . , <b>120</b><i>c </i>is organized such that reference beams formed extending from the mirrors <b>120</b> to a single point <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the recording plate <b>8</b> all lie in the same plane. For example, the mirrors <b>120</b><i>a</i>, . . . <b>120</b><i>c </i>form reference beams which are all in the same plane <b>160</b><i>e</i>. Each set of micro-mirrors lie in a different plane. All the micro mirror from a set of micro-mirrors are located (their central perpendicular axis) in the same plane and all the reference beams are routed to the same point in the recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Several planes, including mirror axis, are located at different angles. This is to say that these planes share one straight line, and, that between each of these planes there is a determined angular value (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>). So every plane incorporates its own set of axis of micro-mirrors all these mirrors are thus routing the reference beams toward the same point.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The number of these planes has a maximum value of 50 which has been experimentally checked to avoid cross talk. In one embodiment of the present invention, each plane comprises 50 micro-mirrors. The result of having 50 mirrors in 50 planes is 50×50=2500 pages (packets) recorded on the same point of the recording plate. These numbers may be increased and only depend on the multiplexing capability of the recording material.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Methods for Making a Multi-Layer Memory</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A multi-layer memory is composed of several superposed layers glued to each other. Preferably, every layer is composed of polypeptide material. Between every layer there is an interface containing glue. The multi-layering process is different depending on whether it uses glass or plastic as the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment of a process of making a multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> using a glass substrate <b>209</b>. A thin polypeptide layer <b>210</b> is added on top of the glass substrate <b>209</b>. Then, a recording is made on the layer <b>210</b> in a point matrix form (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) using angular multiplexing. Then a thin layer <b>211</b> of optical glue is applied for protection. Afterwards, a second layer <b>212</b> is layered on the thin layer <b>211</b> with an adapted coating machine to reach a satisfying uniformity. The process is repeated until the desired number of layers containing recordings are created. This method is slow and not completely automated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an embodiment of a process of making a multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> on a plastic film substrate <b>270</b>. First, there is a polypeptide layer coating <b>272</b> applied on the film substrate <b>270</b>. Then, there is sequential recording of consecutive sectors using different planes of multiplexing angles. The recording film <b>272</b> is cut into a plurality of sectors <b>275</b>, for example, sectors <b>275</b><i>a</i>, <b>275</b><i>b</i>, <b>275</b><i>c </i>are shown Then the sectors <b>275</b><i>a</i>-<b>275</b><i>c </i>are ordered, followed by the step of superposition and the step of protection. First, a polypeptide layer is coated on the film. Each of the sectors <b>275</b> is a portion of the recording film <b>272</b> in which a 10×10 points matrix is recorded (on 1 cm×1 cm). Each of the consecutive sectors <b>275</b> are recorded sequentially. During the recording of a sector, the sector before that recorded sector and the sector after that recorded sector are light protected. After recording of the complete roll of film, the film is processed with the processing method enclosed in the application PHOTONICS DATA STORAGE SYSTEM USING A POLYPEPTIDE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME (PCT/FR01/02386) filed on Jul. 20, 2001 and incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then, a second film is recorded and processed the same way. Then all the films are glued with an optical film glue so that the sectors are matched. The matching is done within an accuracy of 10 microns. An alternative method for making the multi-layer memory consists in cutting physically every sector and then superposing the cut sectors with an appropriate protection layer.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an apparatus <b>200</b> for reading information from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b> according to the present invention. A laser (not shown) emits a reference beam <b>1</b>. The reference beam <b>1</b> is directed by the MEOMS (Micro Opto Electro Mechanical System) <b>122</b> to one of the mirror elements <b>120</b> of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> which then aims the reference beam <b>1</b> onto one of the points <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the multi-layer diffractive optics memory <b>8</b>. The reference beam <b>1</b> is aimed at the point <b>8</b><i>a </i>to create a reconstructed beam <b>302</b> at the point <b>8</b><i>a </i>which is recorded by a CCD (charge couple device) camera <b>304</b>. The optical energy of the reconstruction beam <b>302</b> is converted by the CCD camera <b>304</b> to an electronic signal <b>307</b> carrying the information originally recorded which is subsequently interpreted by computer <b>306</b> and optionally displayed on monitor <b>308</b>. The reading system <b>200</b> can be thus miniaturized with fast access. The size of the reader <b>200</b> is close to that of a cigarette box. The capacity that can be reached this way is around one terabit per square centimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the composite mirror device <b>110</b> comprising a plurality of micro-mirrors organized into sets. The micro-mirror <b>120</b> illustrates an instance of a micro-mirror. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a typical example of the organization of the micro-mirrors <b>120</b>, including a first set of a plurality of flat micro-mirrors including in a row of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> (instances <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c </i>are shown), and a second set of micro-mirrors, including in another row of the composite mirror device <b>110</b> (instances <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>are shown). Each of the micro-mirrors <b>120</b> has a specific orientation depending on its purpose (implemented function). The composite mirror <b>110</b> which had a hole <b>125</b> in its center to allow the object beam <b>4</b> to cross through for the recording process is not necessary for the subsequent reading process.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Spatial multiplexing is achieved by shifting the reference beam <b>1</b> with respect to the surface of the storage medium <b>8</b> so that the point <b>8</b><i>a </i>shifts to another spatial location, for example point <b>8</b><i>a</i>′, (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the surface of the storage medium <b>8</b>. In one embodiment, spatial multiplexing is realized by mechanically shifting the memory <b>8</b> in an -x and -y direction with respect to the matrix of the memory <b>8</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Indeed, this application is intended to cover modifications of the present invention, in addition to those described herein, and the present invention is not confined to the details which have been set forth. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given.</p>
