<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates, in general, to a poppet valve and, more particularly, to an improved poppet valve assembly for use in a plastic injection molding machine where precise shot control is critical.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The plastic injection molding process typically utilizes two phases or stages—a plasticizing phase or stage followed by an injection phase or stage. Plastic injection molding machines usually utilize a heated barrel in order to plasticize or transform pelletized or granular thermoplastic material into the molten state. The barrel has a reciprocating auger-type feed screw mounted therein which forces the molten thermoplastic material through the outlet end of the barrel for injection into a die. During the plasticizing phase or stage, the feed screw rotates and forces the pelletized or granular thermoplastic material toward the forward end of the screw and barrel. As the pelletized or granular thermoplastic material flows toward the forward end of the feed screw and barrel, it is transformed into the molten state by a combination of frictional heat generated by the movement of the thermoplastic material against the screw and the inner surface of the barrel and conductive heat transferred through the wall of the barrel from electrical resistance heaters mounted on the exterior of the barrel. Continued rotation of the feed screw results in the molten thermoplastic material flowing to the end of the screw where it passes through a check valve into a cavity. As the molten thermoplastic material is received within the cavity, a differential pressure develops across the ends of the feed screw causing the feed screw to move toward the feed end of the barrel while the screw rotates. After a predetermined volume of “shot” of molten thermoplastic material is received within the cavity in front of the check valve, rotation of the feed screw is stopped by associated controls. The injection phase or stage then commences causing the feed screw to move forward toward the end of the barrel whereupon the check valve closes in response to flow of molten thermoplastic material. The “shot” of molten thermoplastic material now remaining in the cavity end of the barrel is then forced through a nozzle and into the die.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are a number of commonly used check valves that are responsive to the backflow of molten thermoplastic material in order to close same. These valve types include floating rings, reciprocating balls, and poppets. The poppet styles vary in configuration with some poppets utilizing complicated and failure-prone spring arrangements. Although the valves presently used in the injection molding industry meet with varying degrees of success, there still remains a need for a reliable, fast acting poppet valve in some applications. This is especially true where precise shot control is critical.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the foregoing limitations associated with presently available check valves for use in plastic injection molding machines, it has become desirable to develop a check valve that utilizes a uniquely responsive poppet member that does not require spring loading and wherein the poppet member is configured so that it is significantly more responsive to the backflow of molten thermoplastic material, thus resulting in the rapid closing of the check valve virtually immediately after the commencement of the injection phase or stage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention overcomes the problems associated with presently available check valves for plastic injection molding machines, and other problems, by providing a check valve that utilizes a highly responsive, free floating, self-aligning poppet member that is configured so that it is substantially more sensitive to the backflow of molten thermoplastic material than presently available check valves. The poppet member utilized by the check valve of the present invention has angularly spaced-apart tapered flutes on the outer surface thereof permitting molten thermoplastic material to flow through the flutes to fill the cavity in front of the check valve. When the cavity in front of the check valve is full, the commencement of the injection stroke causes the molten thermoplastic material to attempt to backflow through the angularly spaced-apart tapered flutes causing the check valve to close. The thermoplastic material grippingly engages the angularly spaced-apart tapered flutes on the poppet member resulting in virtually no relative movement between the backflow and the poppet member causing the poppet member to move with the backflow into sealing engagement with the check valve seat. A spherical valve seating surface provided on the poppet member allows for precise and repeatable sealing engagement with the check valve seat even if the poppet member is not in longitudinal alignment with same.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to the drawings where the illustrations are for the purpose of describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention and are not intended to limit the invention disclosed herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a front discharge valve <b>10</b> containing the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> of the present invention and illustrates the threaded attachment of the front discharge valve <b>10</b> to the end of a feed screw <b>14</b> within the injection unit <b>16</b> of a conventional plastic injection molding machine. The front discharge valve <b>10</b> is comprised of a body member <b>18</b> having a substantially cylindrical cross-section with a reduced diameter threaded portion <b>20</b> adjacent one end thereof and a blind bore <b>22</b> within the oppositely disposed end thereof. The reduced diameter threaded portion <b>20</b> is threadably received within a threaded blind bore <b>24</b> in end <b>26</b> of feed screw <b>14</b>. The blind bore <b>22</b> within body member <b>18</b> is sized so as to receive the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> of the present invention and fluidically communicates with the molten thermoplastic material by a plurality of equally angularly spaced-apart cross-bores <b>28</b> in body member <b>18</b>, each of which joins a longitudinally extending through bore <b>30</b> in body member <b>18</b>. Body member <b>18</b> and feed screw <b>14</b> are received within the bore <b>32</b> of an outlet barrel <b>34</b> in a conventional plastic injection molding machine. A barrel end cap <b>36</b> having an inwardly tapered conical surface <b>38</b> therein is attached to the outlet end of the outlet barrel <b>34</b> and functions to transfer molten thermoplastic material to a die (not shown). A nozzle (not shown) is attached to the outlet of end cap <b>36</b>. A plurality of heater bands <b>40</b> are mounted around the outer surface of end cap <b>36</b> and outlet barrel <b>34</b> and are utilized to assist in the melting of the pelletized or granular thermoplastic material and to keep the aforementioned material in the molten state as it is being delivered by the feed screw <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> is comprised of a holder <b>42</b>, an insert <b>44</b> received within one end of the holder <b>42</b> and a poppet member <b>46</b> slidingly movable within the holder <b>42</b>. The holder <b>42</b>, insert <b>44</b> and the poppet member <b>46</b> are received within blind bore <b>22</b> in the outlet end <b>48</b> of body member <b>18</b> of front discharge valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b>, the holder <b>42</b> is generally cylindrical in cross-section and has a substantially smooth outer surface <b>50</b> that terminates in a threaded outer surface <b>52</b>. One end <b>54</b> of the holder <b>42</b> has a bore <b>56</b> therein which communicates with one end of a through bore <b>58</b> within holder <b>42</b> by means of a substantially continuous tapered surface <b>60</b>. The other end of through bore <b>58</b> communicates with a blind bore <b>62</b> in the oppositely disposed end <b>64</b> of holder <b>42</b>. A substantially continuous shoulder <b>66</b> is provided at the junction of blind bore <b>62</b> and through bore <b>58</b>. A chamfer <b>68</b> is provided on the end <b>64</b> of the holder <b>42</b> adjacent the threaded outer surface <b>52</b> of the holder <b>42</b> to assist in the insertion of the holder <b>42</b> within the body member <b>18</b>. The diameter of bore <b>56</b> is less than the diameter of through bore <b>58</b> which is less than the diameter of blind bore <b>62</b> in holder <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The insert <b>44</b> is generally circular in cross-section and has a bore <b>80</b> provided in end <b>82</b> thereof. Bore <b>80</b> terminates in a substantially continuous tapered valve seating surface <b>84</b> which terminates in oppositely disposed end <b>86</b> of insert <b>44</b>. Chamfers <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are provided on ends <b>82</b>, <b>86</b>, respectively, of insert <b>44</b>. The outer diameter of insert <b>44</b> is slightly less than the diameter of blind bore <b>62</b> in holder <b>42</b> permitting insert <b>44</b> to be received within blind bore <b>62</b> in holder <b>42</b> and to be positioned therein so that end <b>86</b> of insert <b>44</b> contacts shoulder <b>66</b> in blind bore <b>62</b> in holder <b>42</b>. It should be noted that insert <b>44</b> may be an integral part of body member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Poppet member <b>46</b> is slidingly received within through bore <b>58</b> in holder <b>42</b> and is captured at one end thereof by substantially continuous tapered surface <b>60</b> in holder <b>42</b> and at the other end thereof by continuous tapered valve seating surface <b>84</b> on insert <b>44</b>. Poppet member <b>46</b> is substantially circular in cross-section and has an outer diameter slightly less than the diameter of through bore <b>58</b> in holder <b>42</b> permitting poppet member <b>46</b> to be slidingly moveable therein. One end <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> has a rounded surface <b>102</b> defined by a first radius whereas the oppositely disposed end <b>104</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> has a spherical surface <b>106</b> defined by a second radius. The first radius defining rounded surface <b>102</b> is greater than the second radius defining spherical surface <b>106</b>. End <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> defined by rounded surface <b>102</b> terminates in a substantially cylindrical surface <b>108</b> which, in turn, terminates in a substantially circumferential outwardly tapered surface <b>110</b>. Circumferentially outwardly tapered surface <b>110</b> terminates in cylindrical outer surface <b>112</b> of the poppet member <b>46</b>. The cylindrical outer surface <b>112</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> terminates in a substantially circumferentially inwardly tapered surface <b>114</b>. Circumferentially inwardly tapered surface <b>114</b> joins cylindrical outer surface <b>112</b> with end <b>104</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> defined by spherical surface <b>106</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, four equally angularly spaced-apart tapered flutes <b>120</b> are provided in the cylindrical outer surface <b>112</b> of poppet member <b>46</b>. The root diameter of the flutes <b>120</b> decreases from end <b>104</b> to end <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> resulting in the formation of four equally angularly spaced-apart ribs <b>122</b> which define the cylindrical outer surface <b>112</b> of poppet member <b>46</b>. The equally angularly spaced-apart tapered flutes <b>120</b> are outwardly tapered from end <b>104</b> to end <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b>. Thus, the transverse width of a flute <b>120</b> between two adjacent spaced-apart ribs <b>122</b> increases from end <b>104</b> to end <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> and the transverse width of each rib <b>122</b> decreases from end <b>104</b> to end <b>100</b> of poppet member <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The front discharge valve <b>10</b> containing the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> is installed in a conventional plastic injection molding machine and the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> operates in the same manner as other ball and poppet style check valves in such molding machines. As the feed screw <b>14</b> within the injection molding machine turns and advances molten thermoplastic material through the front discharge valve <b>10</b>, the flowing thermoplastic material pushes poppet member <b>46</b> away from the tapered valve seating surface <b>84</b> on insert <b>44</b> causing the front discharge valve <b>10</b> to open permitting thermoplastic material to flow between flutes <b>120</b> on poppet member <b>46</b> and the surface defining bore <b>58</b> in holder <b>42</b>. Once the cavity in front of the front discharge valve <b>10</b> is full, the feed screw <b>14</b> stops turning and moves toward the end cap <b>36</b> causing thermoplastic material to be injected into the die and causing pressure to increase in front of the discharge valve <b>10</b> which, in turn, causes the thermoplastic material to start moving in the opposite direction through flutes <b>120</b> and the surface defining bore <b>58</b> in holder <b>42</b>. The “backflowing” thermoplastic material grippingly engages the poppet member <b>46</b> causing poppet member <b>46</b> to move with the thermoplastic material which, in turn, causes in spherical end <b>104</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> to sealingly engage the tapered valve seating surface <b>84</b> on insert <b>44</b>, thus closing the front discharge valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An advantage provided by the poppet valve assembly <b>12</b> of the present invention over similar poppet valve assemblies resides in the tapered surfaces of the spaced-apart flutes <b>120</b> which grippingly engage the thermoplastic material as the material starts to backflow through the valve. This increased resistance induced by the tapered flutes <b>120</b> causes the front discharge valve <b>10</b> to close more rapidly than a typical poppet member having straight cut flutes on the surface thereof. In addition, the utilization of a spherical surface <b>106</b> on end <b>104</b> of poppet member <b>46</b> to engage continuous tapered surface <b>84</b> on insert <b>44</b> in order to close valve <b>10</b> makes the poppet member <b>46</b> self-aligning, thus allowing the poppet member <b>46</b> to freely float within bore <b>58</b> without being precisely longitudinally aligned with bore <b>80</b> in insert <b>44</b>.</p>
