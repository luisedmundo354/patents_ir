<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a stacked-type semiconductor device in which a plurality of semiconductor elements are stacked and to a fabrication method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Miniaturized thin stacked-type semiconductor devices in which a plurality of semiconductor elements are stacked, such as semiconductor devices in which a plurality of semiconductor memories are installed, are in demand in keeping with the expansion of the functions of small and lightweight portable information devices and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">First, a first conventional example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-270763 (a semiconductor device in which a semiconductor carrier electrode and an upper semiconductor element electrode are connected by means of a fine metal wire) will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The semiconductor device disclosed in the first conventional example is such that the surface of a first semiconductor element <b>53</b>, which has bumps <b>56</b> formed on surface electrodes, is oriented downward and the semiconductor element <b>53</b> is joined to a semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>, which is a multilayered circuit wiring substrate. A plurality of first electrodes <b>62</b> for conduction with the first semiconductor element <b>53</b> and a second plurality of electrodes <b>52</b> for conduction with a second semiconductor element <b>58</b> are formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>. Further, this plurality of first electrodes <b>62</b> and the bumps <b>56</b> that are formed on the first semiconductor element <b>53</b> are joined by means of conductive adhesive <b>65</b>. This conductive adhesive <b>65</b> is supplied to the bumps <b>56</b> beforehand. Further, underfill material <b>54</b> is made to fill and insulate the gap between the mutually joined first semiconductor element <b>53</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>. In addition, a second semiconductor element <b>58</b> is bonded via die-bonding material <b>57</b> to the rear face (the upper face in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>) of the first semiconductor element <b>53</b> such that the second semiconductor element <b>58</b> and first semiconductor element <b>53</b> are stacked. Further, wire bonding is used to connect electrically bonding pads <b>59</b> on the second semiconductor element <b>58</b> and a plurality of second electrodes <b>52</b> on the upper face of the semiconductor carrier <b>51</b> to one another via fine metal wires <b>60</b>. In addition, an insulating sealing resin <b>63</b> is made to fill and seal the wiring portion of the fine metal wires <b>60</b> and the periphery of the first semiconductor element <b>53</b> between the second semiconductor element <b>58</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>. Finally, external terminal electrodes <b>61</b> are mounted on the lower face (external face) of the semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next, a second conventional example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-347505 (a semiconductor device in which inner leads are adopted in place of the fine metal wires that are used in the first conventional example) will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The semiconductor device disclosed in the second conventional example has a first semiconductor element <b>73</b>, a second semiconductor element <b>78</b>, and a tape carrier <b>71</b> stacked and arranged in the same package. Further, the tape carrier <b>71</b> and the semiconductor elements <b>73</b> and <b>78</b> are electrically connected by means of inner leads <b>75</b> of the tape carrier <b>71</b>. That is, a plurality of lands <b>72</b> is formed on an array that is provided on the surface of the tape carrier <b>71</b> and external terminal electrodes <b>81</b> are mounted on the lands <b>72</b>. Further, the inner leads <b>75</b>, which extend from the lands <b>72</b>, are each bonded to electrode pads <b>74</b> of the first semiconductor element <b>73</b> and/or to the electrode pads <b>79</b> provided on the upper-face perimeter of the second semiconductor element <b>78</b>. In addition, sealing resin <b>83</b> is made to fill from the upper face of the second semiconductor element <b>68</b> to the outer perimeter of the tape carrier <b>71</b>, whereby the inner leads <b>75</b> and bonding pads <b>74</b> and <b>79</b> are protected.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the semiconductor device of the first conventional example includes factors that obstruct miniaturization. That is, the semiconductor device uses wire bonding to connect the bonding pads <b>59</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>58</b> to the second electrodes <b>52</b> of the semiconductor carrier <b>51</b>. In a case where the connections are made by using wiring bonding, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, a sealing fill region (bonding area) <b>70</b>, which is filled by means of insulating sealing resin <b>63</b>, must be provided at least as far as the outside of the second semiconductor element <b>58</b> so that the fine metal wires <b>60</b> jut out further than the outer edge of the second semiconductor element <b>58</b>. Hence, the mounting area is larger than that of the second semiconductor element <b>58</b>, which is an impediment to miniaturization of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There has also been a problem that because the first semiconductor element <b>53</b> and second semiconductor element <b>58</b> are completely sealed with resin, the semiconductor device is caused to be inferior in heat radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the semiconductor device of the second conventional example above includes factors obstructing an increased number of pins (a greater number of the external terminal electrodes <b>81</b>). That is, with the semiconductor device, the semiconductor elements <b>73</b> and <b>78</b>, which are arranged stacked in the same package, are electrically connected to the lands <b>72</b> by means of the inner leads <b>75</b>. Hence, the number of lands <b>72</b> arranged is limited by the amount of wiring of the inner leads <b>75</b>. Further, there must be a smaller number of mounting parts of the semiconductor elements <b>73</b> and <b>78</b> than the semiconductor device. The above factors obstruct any increase in the number of pins of the semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention solves the above problems, and has an object to provide a semiconductor element device that allows advances in miniaturization and possesses superior heat radiation, and a fabrication method for the semiconductor element device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the case of the present invention, the second semiconductor element is bonded to the one face of the first semiconductor element on the other face of which a first electrode is provided. The second semiconductor element is formed larger than the first semiconductor element and a second electrode is provided on the outer perimeter of the other face. A third electrode on the one face of a wiring substrate is joined by means of flip-chip bonding to the first electrode of the first semiconductor element. A fourth electrode provided on the outer perimeter of the other face of the wiring substrate and the second electrode of the second semiconductor element are connected via fine metal wire by means of wire bonding. The periphery of the first semiconductor element and the wiring portion of the fine metal wire are sealed by means of insulating sealing resin between the second semiconductor element and the wiring substrate, and a sealing fill region for the sealing resin is formed substantially the same as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A first embodiment of the semiconductor device according to the present invention and a first embodiment of the first and second fabrication methods of the semiconductor device will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor device comprises a first semiconductor element <b>3</b>, a second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, and a semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> constituting a multilayered circuit wiring substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first semiconductor element <b>3</b> has a plurality of bumps <b>6</b> constituting protruding electrodes formed on electrodes <b>6</b><i>a</i>, which are first electrodes on the other face (referred to as the lower face in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> hereinafter). Further, the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is formed with a larger outer diameter dimension than the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and bonding pads <b>9</b>, which are second electrodes, are formed on the outer perimeter that is outside the outer diameter dimension of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> on the other face. The semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> has a plurality of first adhesive layers <b>2</b>, which are third electrodes, formed on the one face (referred to as the upper face in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> hereinafter) in correspondence with the plurality of bumps <b>6</b> and has a plurality of second adhesive layers <b>12</b>, which are fourth electrodes, formed on the outer perimeter of the other face. As the material of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> used here, materials such as a glass epoxy board, an organic substrate or ceramic substrate can be adopted. A glass epoxy board is used here.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, a plurality of external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> is formed on the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b>. The external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> allow conduction to a predetermined first adhesive layer <b>2</b> on the outer perimeter of the other face. The external dimensions of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> are formed the same or somewhat larger than the external dimensions of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>. Further, because the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> must make an electrical connection with the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, a size is adopted for the external dimensions of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> that is at least one millimeter or more smaller than the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>. In addition, the other face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is bonded via die-bonding material <b>7</b> to the one face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>. Flip-chip bonding is used to bond the bumps <b>6</b> of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> to the first adhesive layer <b>2</b> of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> via a conductive adhesive <b>5</b> and the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> is stacked on the other face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>. In addition, underfill material <b>4</b> is introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bumps <b>6</b> are protected. Furthermore, wire bonding is used to form a connection via fine metal wires <b>10</b> with the first adhesive layer <b>2</b> that is formed from the bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> to the periphery of the other face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, in order to protect the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>, the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> and the fine metal wires <b>10</b>, an insulating sealing resin <b>13</b> is made to fill and seal the periphery of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> and the wiring portion of the fine metal wires <b>10</b> from the other face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> to the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b>. Further, a sealing fill region <b>20</b> for the sealing resin <b>13</b> is formed over substantially the same area as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First Fabrication Method of the Semiconductor Device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the first fabrication method of the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the other face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> is bonded via the die-bonding material <b>7</b> to the one face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> (step A). An insulating paste, insulating sheet, or the like, can be adopted as this die-bonding material <b>7</b> but an insulating sheet is used here.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the bumps <b>6</b> are formed on the electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>. Plated bumps or stud bumps for which metal is used can be adopted as the bumps but stud bumps are employed here.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, after the conductive adhesive <b>5</b> has been supplied to the bumps <b>6</b>, the semiconductor device is inverted and disposed on the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> so that the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> faces upward. The bumps <b>6</b> and first adhesive layer <b>2</b> are then joined by flip-chip bonding such that the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> is stacked on the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> (step B). Underfill material <b>4</b> is also introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bumps <b>6</b> are protected (step C).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the semiconductor device is inverted so that the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> faces downward. Second adhesive layers <b>12</b> are then formed on the periphery of the other face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b>. Wire bonding is then used to connect electrically the bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> and the second adhesive layer <b>12</b> via fine metal wires <b>10</b> (step D).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, in order to protect the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>, the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, and the fine metal wires <b>10</b>, sealing resin <b>13</b> is made to fill and seal the periphery of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> from the other face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> to the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> and the wiring portion of the fine metal wires <b>10</b> (step E). Here, a sealing fill region (bonding area) <b>20</b>, which is filled with the sealing resin <b>13</b>, is formed over substantially the same area as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>. Next, fabrication of the semiconductor device is completed by attaching external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, as a modified example of the first fabrication method above, the order of fabrication may be such that the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is bonded via die-bonding material <b>7</b> to the rear face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> (step A) after first joining the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> to the one face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> by means of flip-chip bonding (step B) and introducing underfill material <b>4</b> (step C), that is, the order may be step B, step C, step A, step D, and step E.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to achieve a favorable connection between the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> and the outside, the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> protecting the fine metal wires <b>10</b> and second adhesive layer <b>12</b> is formed thinner than the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>. This is because, when the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> is greater than the height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>, the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> is an obstacle when the semiconductor device is mounted, which hinders the connection with the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>. For example, the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>=approximately 250 μm, the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b>=approximately 200 μm, and the height of the fine metal wires <b>10</b> is formed approximately 150 μm from the other face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b>. Implementation may be such that the thickness and height shown here can be optionally changed in accordance with the height of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>. However, in a general semiconductor device, the difference (h−t) between the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> and the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> must be at least 50 μm or more.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the second fabrication method of the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4F to 4J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>are provided on the other face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, bumps <b>6</b> are formed on the electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, after the conductive adhesive <b>5</b> has been supplied to the bumps <b>6</b>, the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> is inverted and disposed on the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> so that the electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>face downward. Next, the bumps <b>6</b> and first adhesive layer <b>2</b> of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> are joined by means of flip-chip bonding and the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> is stacked on the one face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> (step B). In addition, underfill material <b>4</b> is introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bumps <b>6</b> are protected (step C).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is in the state of the wafer substrate (before dicing) <b>15</b> on which a plurality of the second semiconductor elements <b>8</b> is formed and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the first semiconductor elements <b>3</b> are connected via the die-bonding material <b>7</b> to the other face of each second semiconductor element <b>8</b> in the state of the wafer substrate <b>15</b> (step A). The bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor elements <b>8</b> and the second adhesive layers <b>12</b> of the semiconductor carriers <b>1</b> are electrically connected via the fine metal wires <b>10</b> by means of wire bonding (step D). An insulating paste, an insulating sheet, or the like, can be adopted as the die-bonding material but an insulating sheet is employed here.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4F and 4G</figref>, in order to protect the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>, second semiconductor element <b>8</b> and fine metal wires <b>10</b>, sealing resin <b>13</b> is made to fill and seal the periphery of the first semiconductor elements <b>3</b> and semiconductor carriers <b>1</b> and the wiring portion of fine metal wires <b>10</b> from the other face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> to the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> (step E).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4H and 4I</figref>, after being resin-sealed, the wafer substrate <b>15</b> is diced by using a blade <b>16</b> and the semiconductor devices are separated (step F). As a result, the individual semiconductor devices are produced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4I</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4J</figref>, the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> are attached to the semiconductor carriers <b>1</b> (step G). The fabrication of the semiconductor device is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The second fabrication method is able to fabricate a plurality of the semiconductor devices by performing together the die-bonding step (step A), wire bonding step (step D), resin-sealing step (step E), and dicing step (step F), which permits efficient fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As detailed above, according to the first embodiment, within the external form of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, the bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> and the second adhesive layers <b>12</b> formed on the other face (lower face) of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> are connected by means of fine metal wires <b>10</b> and it is therefore possible to form the sealing resin region <b>20</b> that is sealed by the insulating sealing resin <b>13</b> substantially the same as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>. Therefore, according to the above first embodiment, because there is no need to arrange the fine metal wires extending to the outside of the semiconductor element by means of wire bonding as per a conventional semiconductor device, in the existing package form, the shortest wire (fine metal wire) length=0.4 mm and the length of the bonding area pad 200 μmm=0.2 mms, and a region of 1.2 mm [=(0.4+0.2)×2] for each package edge is not necessary. Therefore, the sealing fill region <b>20</b> can be formed 1 mm or more smaller and a smaller stacked-layer type semiconductor device can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the semiconductor device of the first embodiment may have a structure in which a plurality of first semiconductor elements <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is arranged on the one face of a semiconductor carrier <b>21</b>. In this case, in the fabrication method, when first semiconductor elements <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are stacked on the one face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> by means of flip-chip bonding (step B), the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>a </i>and first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>b </i>are individually joined to the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> with the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>a </i>being joined first, followed by the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The second embodiment of the semiconductor device according to the present invention and fabrication method thereof will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Further, the same reference numerals were assigned to the same materials as those of the first embodiment and hence a description of these materials is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The semiconductor device of the first embodiment is subject to the condition that, in order to establish a favorable connection with the outside of the external terminal electrode <b>11</b>, the thickness t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> that protects the fine metal wires <b>10</b> and second adhesive layer <b>12</b> should be thinner than the mounting height h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>. Supposing that the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> is 200 μm, for example, the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> must be 250 μm or more. Hence, when the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> are solder balls, for example, the solder balls must be formed with a size equal to or more than 250 μm. As a result, limitations on the number of terminals to the outside arise and there is the risk of the problem that the condition cannot be applied to the semiconductor device with multiple pins, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, according to the second embodiment, the semiconductor device, which is subject to minimal restrictions on the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>, and the fabrication method thereof are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">That is, the other face (the lower face in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> hereinafter) of the semiconductor carrier <b>21</b> comprises a protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>that is very thick in the middle section and has the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b>, and a backward face <b>21</b><i>b </i>that is formed thin via a step <b>21</b><i>c </i>on the outer perimeter of the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>and has the second adhesive layer <b>12</b>. Further, the height:H of the step <b>21</b><i>c </i>between the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the backward face <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed substantially the same as the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> that covers the fine metal wires <b>10</b> and second adhesive layer <b>12</b>. Because the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> is taken up by the height H of the step <b>21</b><i>c</i>, the surface of the sealing resin <b>13</b> and the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>can be formed in substantially the same plane and there are no restrictions on the mounting height h of the external terminal electrode <b>11</b>. Naturally, there is no problem even when the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b>&lt;the height:H of the step <b>21</b><i>c </i>and, when the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b>&gt;the height:H of the step <b>21</b><i>c</i>, in cases where this difference is slight, restrictions on the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> are minimal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Therefore, in cases where the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> are solder balls or solder-plated, or similar, the height of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> can be varied freely. Further, sufficient adaptability is also possible with a LGA (Land Grid Array), in which the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> of the semiconductor carrier <b>21</b> are solderless. There are also no restrictions on the number of external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> and hence this implementation is applicable to the stacked-type semiconductor device with multiple pins.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, the fabrication method of the semiconductor device of the second embodiment permits fabrication by means of the same fabrication method as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the second embodiment, the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>with the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> is provided on the other face of the semiconductor carrier <b>21</b> and the backward face <b>21</b><i>b</i>, which is thin and has the second adhesive layer <b>12</b> is provided on the outer perimeter of the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a</i>, whereby thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> can be taken up by the height:H. That is, the thickness:t of the sealing resin <b>13</b> that covers the second adhesive layer <b>12</b> and protrudes from the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a </i>is reduced by the height:H from the backward face <b>21</b><i>b </i>to the protruding face <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Hence, no restrictions on the mounting height h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> arise.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the semiconductor device of the second embodiment may have a plurality of first semiconductor elements <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>arranged on the one face of the semiconductor carrier <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this case, in the fabrication method, when the first semiconductor elements <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are stacked on the one face of the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> by means of flip-chip bonding (step B), the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>a </i>and first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>b </i>are individually joined to the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> with the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>a </i>being joined first, followed by the first semiconductor element <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the electrode <b>31</b> is provided on the one face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, the bump <b>33</b> is formed on the electrode face <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, the tape carrier <b>41</b> is bonded via the die-bonding material <b>7</b> to the other face of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> (step W).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref>, the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is in the state of wafer substrate <b>15</b> (before dicing) on which a plurality of the second semiconductor elements <b>8</b> is integrally formed. The electrode faces <b>32</b> of each of the second semiconductor elements <b>8</b> in the state of the wafer substrate <b>15</b> and bumps <b>33</b> of the electrode faces <b>31</b> of the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> are joined via a conductive adhesive <b>5</b> by means of flip-chip bonding and the first semiconductor elements <b>3</b> are each stacked on respective second semiconductor elements <b>8</b> (step U). Further, underfill material <b>4</b> is introduced between the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, whereby bumps <b>33</b> are protected (step V). In addition, the inner leads <b>43</b> of the tape carrier <b>41</b> are connected to the bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> such that the tape carrier <b>41</b> and second semiconductor element <b>8</b> are electrically connected (step X).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref>, sealing resin <b>13</b> is made to fill and seal between the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> and tape carrier <b>41</b> and the periphery thereof. External terminal electrodes <b>11</b> are also attached to the tape carrier <b>41</b> (step Y).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21F</figref>, the wafer substrate <b>15</b> is diced by using a blade and individual semiconductor devices are produced, whereby fabrication of the semiconductor device is completed (step Z).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">By using these fabrication steps, a plurality of the semiconductor devices can be fabricated by performing together the flip-chip bonding step (step U), the underfill material introduction step (step V), the lead connection step (step X), the resin-sealing step (step Y), and the dicing step (step Z), which permits efficient fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">According to the above constitution, in comparison with the first and second embodiments, by using the inner leads <b>43</b> in place of the fine metal wires <b>10</b> and changing the semiconductor carrier <b>1</b> to the tape carrier <b>41</b>, a thinner-type semiconductor device can be provided. In particular, because the inner leads <b>43</b> are integrally extended from the tape carrier <b>41</b> and connected to the bonding pads <b>9</b> of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>, the semiconductor device is constituted such that, not only are there are no protrusions on the other face of the tape carrier <b>41</b>, which permits a thinner semiconductor device, but implementation of a constitution that is also externally simple is also possible and the mounting height h of the external terminal electrodes <b>11</b> can be reduced. Further, because the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and second semiconductor element <b>8</b> have a COC (Chip On Chip) structure, a high-speed operation between the first semiconductor element <b>3</b> and second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the semiconductor device may have a constitution in which pluralities of first semiconductor elements <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are arranged on the one face of a tape carrier <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Furthermore, in the case of the semiconductor devices of all the embodiments above, a highly exothermic power IC can be used as the second semiconductor element <b>8</b>. This is because the rear face of the second semiconductor element <b>8</b> is not resin-sealed and is exposed to the outside, whereby heat can be radiated efficiently. Thus, application is possible even in the case of a semiconductor device that is required to be highly exothermic.</p>
