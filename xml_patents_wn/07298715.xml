<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to wireless communication receivers, and amongst other things to wireless communication receivers having signal processing capability for performing beam forming, antenna diversity, as well as other functions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Discussion of Background</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wireless modems are used to interconnect computers or LANs using radio waves. Radio signals have advantages and disadvantages over hardwire systems. The wireless advantages include quick deployment, higher data rates than conventional telephone lines and the ability to serve customers independently of the traditional infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disadvantages of wireless transmission in the range of the MMDS/ITFS (multi-channel multi-point distribution system/instructional television fixed service) channels include fading and multi-path.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Wireless receivers utilize several techniques to overcome channel impairments like fading and multi-path. Once class of techniques to reduce fading and multi-path are referred to as beam forming. Beam forming techniques increase the antenna gain, and more importantly increases the antenna directivity while also allowing controllable direction selectivity. This enables reduction of external interference and improvement of the robustness against multi-path.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another class of techniques to reduce problems associated with fading and multi-path are referred to as antenna diversity. Antenna diversity uses two or more antennas that are shifted in space by one or more wavelengths of the transmitted carrier frequency. The spatial shifting can influence and many times it reduces fading. Diversity involves downconverting and demodulating the received signal in parallel from the two or more antennas and then selecting the “best” signal by post detection decision criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a common technique used for antenna diversity in wireless systems is depicted. Each of the two antennas <b>5</b> and <b>10</b> is connected to a separate full channel receiver which includes a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>15</b> and <b>20</b>, a down converter <b>25</b> and <b>30</b>, and a demodulator decoder <b>35</b> and <b>40</b>. The demodulator decoders <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> each receive an analog signal either at an IF or a baseband frequency and then demodulate the analog signal to provide a digital signal which has also been error corrected. After decoding and error correcting the digital signal each demodulator decoder <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> delivers a decoded data stream, comprising data packets, along with error information related to each data packet of the digital signal. The digital signal from each of the demodulators <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> is delivered to the buffer <b>50</b>, while the error information is delivered to diversity controller <b>45</b>. The diversity controller <b>45</b> selects the best packet data stream from the one of the two demodulators <b>35</b> or <b>45</b> according to a predetermined minimum error criterion. The selected data packet is then provided at data output <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a known technique used for beam forming in wireless receivers is depicted. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> utilizes vector combining, of amplitude and phase, of the signal received by each of two antennas <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. By amplitude balancing and adjusting the phase of the relative signals a shift in the direction of the combined antenna beam is achieved. The two received signals are typically combined in a beam forming RF module <b>80</b> that operates at the transmitted RF frequency. The signals from each of the two antennas <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> after been amplified by the attached low noise amplifier <b>70</b> and <b>75</b> is delivered to the beam forming module <b>80</b>. The beam-forming module <b>80</b> includes a phase shift and amplitude control unit <b>85</b> and a RF combiner <b>90</b>. The combined signal output by combiner <b>90</b> is a standard received signal at RF. The combined signal is then provided to a downconverter <b>95</b> and then to analog to digital converter (A/D) <b>100</b>. The digital signal is provided to a demodulator <b>105</b> with a channel estimation capability. The demodulator <b>105</b> utilizes the estimation capability to control the beam forming RF module for optimization of the received signal and for error minimization. The two antenna elements as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are very common for low cost wireless applications, but the same concept can be used with more antennas. Therefore, the beam-forming scheme depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be implemented with two antennas or with a phased array.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The techniques described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</figref> require a full receiving chain for each antenna. This is both expensive and increases the potential points of failure in a wireless receiver.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a technique to reduce the number of RF components by using digital signal processing functions in wireless receivers having two or more antennas, which results in the reduction of system cost. The reduction occurs by using an RF multiplexer or RF switch to sample the signal received by each of the antennas. By sampling the RF signal from the two (or more) antennas, the invention enables to implement a single RF chain, instead of dual (or more) RF chains in a conventional implementation of beam forming or antenna diversity. The sampling rate of the multiplexer or switch is greater than the Nyquist required sampling rate (Fs) of the received signal bandwidth. The sampled signal is a multiplexed single analog (RF) signal, which only requires one chain of receiver components.

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an additional embodiment, the present invention provides for a method for receiving a communication signal at a wireless communication device comprising at least two antennas. The method comprises receiving at each of at least two antennas a communication signal, sampling the communication signal to produce a sampled signal, down converting the sampled signal to generate a down converted signal, generating a digitized signal from the down converted signal, and demultiplexing the digitized signal to produce at least two digital signals each corresponding to the communication signal as received by the at least two antennas.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides a technique to reduce the number of RF components by using digital signal processing functions in wireless receivers having two or more antennas, which results in the reduction of system cost. By sampling the RF signal from the two (or more) antennas, the invention enables to implement a single RF chain, instead of dual (or more) RF chains in a conventional implementation of beam forming or antenna diversity. The reduction occurs by using an RF multiplexer or RF switch to sample the signal received by each of the antennas. The sampling rate of the multiplexer or switch is greater than the Nyquist required sampling rate (Fs) of the received signal bandwidth. The sampled signal is a multiplexed single analog (RF) signal, which only requires one chain of receiver components. A signal processor then is able to demultiplex the received signal at a lower frequency and can perform several functions including antenna diversity and beam forming utilizing digital signals at IF or baseband frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> thereof, there is illustrated a general block diagram of the signal processing implementation of the present invention. The received RF signals from the two antennas <b>130</b> and <b>135</b> is sequentially sampled by a single pole double through (SPDT) switch <b>150</b> which is used as a multiplexer. The switching rate (“SR”) of the SPDT switch <b>150</b> should be at least twice the Nyquist required sampling rate (“Fs”) for the received signal bandwidth. Since, the Nyquist sampling rate is greater then twice the signal bandwidth, the SPDT switch <b>150</b> sampling rate will be greater then four times bandwidth, e.g. Fs&gt;2*BW signal and SR&gt;2*Fs, where BW signal is the signal bandwidth. Generally SR will be selected to be N times Fs for N antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The output signal of the SPDT is a multiplexed single analog (RF) signal, which comprises the RF signals received by the two antennas. The bandwidth of the multiplex signal at the output of the SPDT switch <b>150</b> is half of the switching rate (SR/2). This bandwidth is more than twice the bandwidth of the input RF signal for two antennas. This bandwidth requires that the rest of the receiving chain, e.g. the downconverter, has to support this higher bandwidth in order to enable de-multiplexing of the two signals at a later point.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The multiplexed signal is down converted by down converter <b>155</b> to an IF or baseband signal. The down converted signal is provided to an analog to digital converter <b>165</b> (A/D) which in turn provides the digital signal. The digital signal is demodulated and processed at the signal processor unit <b>160</b>. The analog to digital converter <b>165</b> can be implemented externally to the signal processor <b>160</b> unit, or internally on the same chip.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At the signal processor <b>160</b> the digital signal is de-multiplexed by demultiplexer <b>170</b> and received at a dual channel receiver <b>175</b>. The signal at each of the channels of the dual channel receiver is related to the signal at each of the antennas <b>130</b> <b>135</b>. The dual channel receiver <b>175</b> also provides a control signal to the SPDT switch <b>150</b> that synchronizes the switching rate SR with operation of the clocks of the dual channel receiver <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The dual channel receiver <b>175</b> can be configured to implement various functions, including simply providing multiple data signals, if each of the antennas <b>130</b> and <b>135</b> is positioned to receive a different communication signal. In addition, antenna diversity or beam forming can be fully accomplished at the signal processor as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is presently preferred that a low noise amplifier <b>140</b> or <b>145</b> is used before the SPDT <b>150</b> for each of the antenna <b>130</b> and <b>135</b>, to amplify the received signal and to maintain a maximum signal to noise ratio in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A band pass filter (BPF) is included after each of the LNA <b>140</b> and <b>145</b>. This BPF rejects out of band signals. The sampling rate SR at the SPDT <b>150</b> should be at least twice the bandwidth of this rejection BPF, in order to reduce interference from adjacent channels.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although other combinations of components may be utilized, in one preferred embodiment, the LNAs <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> and SPDT <b>150</b> are constructed on a single active RF chip. The band pass filter (BPF) between the LNA and the SPDT switch, can be implemented either on chip or externally.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> was described above for a receiver with two antennas. The same concept can be used with higher number of antenna by multiplexing the RF input signal and demultiplexing at the signal processor. In this case, for receiving with N antennas the SPDT switch <b>150</b> will be replaced by a SPNT (N input and single output). For receiving with N antennas the switching rate will be the number of antennas multiplied by the required sampling rate per each antenna signal, e.g. SR=N*FS where N is the number of antennas, and FS&gt;2*Bwsignal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The same concept can be use for generating a multiplexed signal from several antennas with separate transmitters if their symbol rates are synchronized. This can be implemented as an example in point to multi point systems when the upstream symbol rate can be locked onto the common downstream symbol rate. In this case, after demultiplexing the signal in the signal processor <b>160</b>, parallel demodulator blocks can be implemented in the same signal processor, e.g. signal processor <b>160</b>. Such an architecture depends only on the signal processing capability of the signal processor, and can easily be achieved for low bit rate signals.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cost reduction in the RF equipment allowed by the present invention is easily seen by comparing the common block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with the presently preferred embodiment depicted in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> due to the reduced number of components. For example, the known antenna diversity block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizes two down converters <b>25</b> and <b>30</b>, versus one for the present invention. The cost savings over the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> results from the elimination of the beam forming RF module <b>80</b>, which includes complicated RF phase and amplitude controls.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a presently preferred configuration of the signal processor <b>160</b> utilized for beam forming is depicted. The analog multiplexed signal either at IF or baseband frequency, is converted to a digital signal by the A/D <b>200</b>. The digital signal is de-multiplexed into a stream of two separate digital data streams, each of which is from a separate antenna. Each of the digital data streams is filtered by the appropriate digital Band Pass Filter (BPF) <b>210</b> and <b>215</b>, for a bandwidth equal to the transmitted bandwidth. Since, the digital signals have the same amplitude and phases as the RF signals received at each of the front antennas, but have a much lower frequency carrier, e.g. IF or baseband compared to RF, a vector summation of these digital signals is equivalent to a vector summation of the RF. Therefore, controlling the amplitude and phase of these digital signals is equivalent to the same processing of the RF.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The two data streams are delivered to the Beam Forming and Demodulator block <b>225</b>, and also to the Channel Estimation block <b>220</b>. The beam forming processing is accomplished by summation of the two digital signals after amplitude balancing and phase shifting. The phase shifting enables control of the beam direction, as in a conventional RF beam forming process. By using more than two antennas, the beam can be optimized to have a spatial notch, to reject interference, as in conventional phased array techniques. The control of the phase and amplitude is accomplished by the channel estimator <b>220</b>. The channel estimator controls the relative phase shift of the two data stream according to known algorithms that implements minimization of the data errors at the demodulator and decoder output.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The signal after the summation is demodulated as a regular signal, and the received data is decoded at the decoder <b>240</b> to deliver the final data output. During demodulation processing the carrier frequency and the sampling frequency Fs are extracted. From the extracted sampling frequency the demodulator acquires and provides a signal to synchronize the Sync SR To SPDT <b>230</b>, and the Sync SR Delay <b>235</b>. The Sync SR To SPDT <b>230</b> is the double sampling rate switching clock of the SPDT switch <b>150</b>. The Sync SR Delay <b>235</b> is the corresponding delayed synchronized clock for the de-multiplexer <b>205</b>. These two synchronization signals are at the same frequency, but the timing signal provided to the demodulator is delayed to compensate for the down converter and filter delays between the RF and the output of the A/D <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a presently preferred configuration of the signal processor <b>160</b> for the performance of antenna diversity. The analog multiplexed signal either at IF or baseband frequency is converted to a digital signal by A/D <b>250</b>. As was describe with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above, this digital signal is de-multiplexed into a stream of two separate digital signals, each of them is related to a separate antenna by demultiplexer <b>235</b>. Each of the digital data streams is then filtered to the transmitted bandwidth by the appropriate digital Band Pass Filter (BPF) <b>260</b> or <b>265</b>. The two data streams are then demodulated and decoded in parallel by demodulator decoders <b>270</b> and <b>275</b>. The two demodulated data streams are delivered to the buffer <b>285</b>, while the error information is delivered to the diversity controller <b>280</b>. The diversity controller <b>280</b> selects the best packet data stream from the two demodulators according to a minimum error criterion that is predetermined and based on the FEC. The selected data packet is the data output.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The architecture described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be used with various modulation schemes, e.g. single carrier signals such as QAM, QPSK, BPSK or the like, as well as multiple carrier signals such as OFDM. In single carrier schemes, the demodulators used in the signal processor <b>160</b> will be the standard demodulator block for the modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For OFDM signals the band pass filters <b>210</b> and <b>215</b>, and <b>260</b> and <b>265</b> are implemented by a FFT block which is a standard signal processing block. For OFDM type signals when each of the two data stream is split by the FFT block into multiple sub carriers data stream, the diversity scheme can be implemented by comparing the amplitude of each carrier and using the higher one for the demodulation process. This will significantly reduce the fading influence when it is not equally distributed on the signal bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The beam forming processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can also be implemented to OFDM signals. For OFDM type signals each of the two data stream is split by the FFT block into multiple sub carriers data stream. The beam forming process <b>225</b> can be done separately on pairs of the same subcarrier from the two channels. This processing has the advantage of cannel estimation optimization per sub carrier, which has a higher improvement gain.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The signal processor <b>160</b> is currently preferred to be an integrated circuit, but can also be one or more separate elements. Further, even though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> depict the signal processor <b>160</b> as including A/D functionality, it should be noted that the A/D functionality may be separate from signal processor <b>160</b>.</p>

The invention may also be implemented by the preparation of application specific integrated circuits or by interconnecting an appropriate network of conventional component circuits, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
