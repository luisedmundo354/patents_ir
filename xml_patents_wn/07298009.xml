<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and more particularly to a semiconductor method and device with mixed orientation substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) is a dominant technology in semiconductor device manufacture. A CMOS device includes both n-channel (NMOS) and p-channel (PMOS) transistors. In CMOS technology, both kinds of transistors are used in a complementary way to form a current gate that forms an effective means of electrical control. Advantageously, CMOS transistors use very little power when not switching from one state to another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that the mobility of carriers is dependent on a number of factors, especially the surface plane of a wafer. Conventional silicon substrates typically have a surface oriented on the (100) crystal plane. In this plane, the mobility of electrons is higher than in other crystal planes, and therefore, the source-drain current of an n-channel FET formed on the semiconductor substrate having the (100) plane provides the largest current. However, the mobility of holes is not optimized in the (100) plane, and therefore, the source-drain current of a p-channel FET formed on the semiconductor substrate having the (100) plane is inevitably small. The p-channel FET therefore fails to have desirable characteristics, even though the n-channel FET exhibits good characteristics. Hole mobility could be enhanced, especially at high electric fields, if p-channel FETs were formed on the (110) plane.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,473 discloses a semiconductor body having element formation surfaces with different orientations. The semiconductor body is constructed in such a manner that a first semiconductor substrate of the (100) plane is laminated to a second semiconductor substrate of the (110) plane. At least one opening is made in the first semiconductor substrate to expose the second semiconductor substrate. An n-channel transistor can be formed in the first semiconductor substrate while a p-channel transistor is formed in the second semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,815,277 discloses FinFETs that are formed on the same substrate utilizing various crystal planes for FET current channels in order to optimize mobility and/or to reduce mobility. A substrate has a surface oriented on a first crystal plane that enables subsequent crystal planes for channels to be utilized. A first transistor is also provided having a first fin body. The first fin body has a sidewall forming a first channel, the sidewall oriented on a second crystal plane to provide a first carrier mobility. A second transistor is also provided having a second fin body. The second fin body has a sidewall forming a second channel, the sidewall oriented on a third crystal plane to provide a second carrier mobility that is different from the first carrier mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The paper by Yang et al., entitled High Performance CMOS Fabricated on Hybrid Substrate With Different Crystal Orientations,” 2003 IEDM, pp. 18.7.1-18.7.4 discloses a structure and technology for high performance CMOS using hybrid silicon substrates with different crystal orientations through wafer bonding and selective epitaxy. This type of mixed orientation substrate (MOS) is a new and excellent technology to boost the PMOS performance by using a (110) substrate while maintaining the NMOS performance by using (100) substrate. One of the challenges with a mixed orientation substrate lies in isolating the (110) portions of the substrate from the (100) portions of the substrate and at same time to make the good alignment with the shallow trench isolation (STI) later on, especially for the technologies below 45 nm.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other problems are generally solved or circumvented, and technical advantages are generally achieved, by preferred embodiments of the present invention which provides a method to form a mixed orientation substrate and the isolation in the same process module.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes a semiconductor body having semiconductor material of a first crystal orientation. A first transistor is formed in the semiconductor material of the first crystal orientation. An insulating layer overlies portions of the semiconductor body and a semiconductor layer overlies the insulating layer. The semiconductor layer has a second crystal orientation. A second transistor is formed in the semiconductor layer having the second crystal orientation. In the preferred embodiment, the semiconductor body is (100) silicon, the first transistor is an NMOS transistor, the semiconductor layer is (110) silicon and the second transistor is a PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a method of making a semiconductor device includes providing a wafer that includes a semiconductor body with semiconductor material of a first crystal orientation. An insulating layer overlies the semiconductor substrate and a semiconductor layer with semiconductor material of a second crystal orientation overlies the insulating layer. Portions of the semiconductor layer and the insulating layer are removed to expose a portion of the semiconductor body. A first transistor of a first conductivity type (e.g., n-channel) is formed in the semiconductor material of the first crystal orientation and a second transistor of a second conductivity type (e.g., p-channel) is formed in the semiconductor material of the second crystal orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a method of forming a semiconductor device once again includes providing a wafer that includes a semiconductor substrate of a first crystal orientation, an insulating layer over the semiconductor substrate, and a semiconductor layer of a second crystal orientation over the insulating layer. A portion of the semiconductor layer is removed to expose a portion of the insulating layer. Insulating material is formed over the wafer. Portions of the insulating material are removed to expose portions of the semiconductor layer and portions of the insulating material and insulating layer are removed to expose portions of the semiconductor substrate. Semiconductor material of the first crystal orientation is epitaxially grown over the exposed portions of the semiconductor substrate and semiconductor material of the second crystal orientation is epitaxially grown over exposed portions of the semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An advantage of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is the elimination of the typical shallow trench isolation process module including the trench filling. Since the active semiconductor areas are formed using an epitaxial process this process module is eliminated. In other words, in the preferred embodiment, the isolation regions are formed before the formation of the active semiconductor regions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further advantage of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is that only two masks are needed and the STI trench definition masks are avoided. Since the active areas are typically larger than the STI, the critical dimension of this mask is relaxed. Further, the total process steps are reduced significantly from a conventional process. Any reduction in process steps and complexity will lead to cost reductions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The making and using of the presently preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will be described with respect to preferred embodiments in a specific context, namely a mixed crystal orientation silicon substrate used to optimize CMOS device performance. The invention may also be applied, however, to other semiconductor devices such as bipolar and BiCMOS and other semiconductors such as silicon germanium.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An exemplary structure of the present invention will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A process flow for manufacturing this structure will then be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-16</figref>. An alternative structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor device <b>10</b> includes a first transistor <b>12</b> of a first conductivity type and second transistors <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of a second conductivity type. To enhance performance, the first transistor is formed in a semiconductor material of a first crystal orientation and the second transistors <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are formed in semiconductor material of a second crystal orientation. In the preferred embodiment, the first transistor <b>12</b> is an n-channel field effect transistor (FET) formed in (100) silicon and the second transistors <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are p-channel FETs formed in (110) silicon. In an alternate embodiment, the positions of the (100) orientation semiconductor and (110) orientation semiconductor could be switched with each other. In other words, the body substrate <b>18</b> orientation could be either (100) or (110).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To achieve the different crystal orientations, the n-channel transistor <b>12</b> is formed in a portion <b>20</b> of substrate <b>18</b>. As will be described below, the portion <b>20</b> is preferably epitaxially grown semiconductor material, the material having a crystal orientation that aligns to the crystal orientation the substrate <b>18</b>. In the preferred embodiment, substrate <b>18</b> is a (100) monocrystalline silicon substrate. Semiconductor <b>20</b> is, therefore, also (100) monocrystalline silicon and can be considered a portion of the substrate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The transistors <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are formed in portions of a semiconductor layer <b>22</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>22</b> preferably (although not necessarily) has a different crystal orientation from semiconductor material <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the semiconductor layer is (110) silicon (and the semiconductor body <b>20</b> is (100) silicon). In another embodiment, the semiconductor layer is (100) silicon and the semiconductor body <b>20</b> is (110) silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The semiconductor layer <b>22</b> is separated from the substrate <b>18</b> by an insulating layer <b>24</b>. The insulating <b>24</b> is preferably an oxide layer, sometimes referred to as a buried oxide. In other embodiments, other insulating materials such as nitrides, oxynitrides and high-k dielectric materials could alternatively be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the insulating layer <b>24</b> has an opening through which the semiconductor material <b>20</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The semiconductor region <b>20</b> is separated from semiconductor regions <b>22</b> by isolation regions <b>26</b>. Isolation regions <b>26</b> are preferably formed from an oxide (e.g., silicon dioxide) but other materials can alternatively be used. Due to the process used to form the isolation regions <b>26</b>, which will be described in greater detail below, the isolation regions can have a lateral dimension that is as small as the minimum lithographic dimension of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A preferred embodiment process for forming a structure of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-16</figref>. These figures illustrate one specific process. It is understood, however, that numerous variations and alternatives can be incorporated into the process flow. While the figures reference specific materials (e.g., (100) Si and (110) Si), it is also understood that other materials as discussed herein or otherwise recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art could alternatively be used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer <b>8</b> is provided. The SOI wafer <b>8</b> includes a substrate <b>18</b>, an insulating layer <b>24</b> that overlies substrate <b>18</b> and a semiconductor layer <b>22</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the substrate <b>18</b> comprises a (100) bulk silicon substrate. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>18</b> can comprise silicon of different crystal orientations, e.g., (110) or (111), or different semiconductor materials, such as silicon germanium, gallium arsenide.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The insulating layer <b>24</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>22</b> can be formed in a variety of ways. For example, insulating layer <b>24</b> can be deposited or grown over the surface of the substrate <b>18</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>22</b> can be bonded with the insulating layer <b>24</b> using a special bonding technique. For example, the semiconductor layer <b>22</b> (and possibly insulating layer <b>24</b>) is bonded or laminated to the substrate <b>18</b>. For example, a donor wafer that includes the silicon layer <b>22</b> can be bonded to a target wafer <b>18</b> that includes insulator <b>24</b>. During a wafer separation process, such as the Smartcut™ process, a splitting plane in one oxidized silicon wafer is defined by hydrogen implantation close beneath the oxide layer. Bonding of the donor wafer to the target wafer and subsequent separation at the pre-defined plane, results in a thin remaining layer of single crystalline silicon <b>22</b> on top of the insulating layer <b>24</b> and the underlying silicon substrate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A substrate illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can also be purchased as such. For example, bonded wafers with two different orientations are available from companies such as SEH America of Vancouver, Wash.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a hard mask layer <b>28</b> is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>22</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the hard mask layer <b>28</b> is an oxide layer formed by the decomposition of tetraethyloxysilane and is, therefore, often referred to as a TEOS layer. The TEOS layer <b>28</b> is preferably formed to a thickness of between about 50 nm and 500 nm, preferably about 200 nm. Other materials could be used for the hard mask. For example, the hard mask could be silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, boron doped oxide (BSG) or boron and phosphorous doped oxide (BPSG). The hard mask <b>28</b> can be one single layer or multi-layers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a resist layer <b>30</b> is formed over the hard mask layer <b>28</b>. The resist layer <b>30</b> can be any photoresist used in standard lithography processing. As also shown in the figure, the resist <b>30</b> is patterned to expose a portion of the hard mask layer <b>28</b>. The exposed portion of hard mask layer <b>28</b> can then be removed to expose a portion of the semiconductor layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the wafer after the photoresist <b>30</b> has been stripped.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the exposed portions of semiconductor layer <b>22</b> are removed using the remaining portions of the hard mask layer <b>28</b> as a mask. This removal can be done by aniosotropic etching. In an embodiment that is not illustrated, the hard mask layer <b>28</b> can be replaced with a photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the hard mask layer <b>28</b> may be thinned during removal of the portions of silicon layer <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that any remaining portions of the hard mask layer <b>28</b> can be removed. This removal can be performed, for example, by plasma etching.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, an insulating material <b>34</b> is formed where the portions of the semiconductor layer <b>22</b> were removed. In the preferred embodiment, an insulating layer <b>32</b> is deposited (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and planarized to be substantially co-planar with the upper surface of semiconductor layer <b>22</b>. For example, an oxide layer can be deposited using a high density plasma (HDP) process followed by a chemical mechanical polish (CMP) step. In alternate embodiments, the insulating material <b>32</b> can be an oxide formed by a different process or a different material such as a nitride or doped glass (e.g., fluorinated silica glass).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an insulating layer <b>36</b> is depositing over the wafer. In the preferred embodiment, the insulating layer <b>36</b> is the same material as insulator <b>34</b>, e.g., insulators <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> can both be silicon dioxide. As an example, the insulating layer <b>36</b> can be an HDP oxide layer (i.e., an oxide deposited using a high density plasma process). Other oxide deposition processes can alternatively be allowed. In other embodiments, the two layers can be different materials, such as combinations of the materials listed above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> illustrate the formation of isolation regions <b>26</b>. (The isolations regions <b>26</b> are formed from insulating regions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, which are renumbered to correspond with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.) As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a resist <b>38</b> is formed over the wafer and patterned to expose portions of isolation region <b>26</b> that overlie the semiconductor islands <b>22</b>. The exposed portions of the isolation region <b>26</b> can then be removed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After resist layer <b>38</b> is stripped, a second resist layer <b>40</b> is formed and patterned to expose portions of isolation region <b>26</b> over the substrate <b>18</b> where insulating layer <b>24</b> has been removed. Using the patterned resist layer <b>40</b> as a mask, the semiconductor substrate <b>18</b> is exposed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the structure after resist <b>40</b> has been stripped.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternate embodiment, a single resist layer can be patterned to create the openings shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>. This modification would save one mask step. In this case, an etch stop layer (not shown), such as silicon nitride when the isolation region <b>26</b> is an oxide, is preferably formed over layer <b>22</b> to protect the semiconductor while the etching process continues through the thicker portions of isolation region <b>26</b> that overlie the substrate <b>18</b>. Once the resist is removed, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, semiconductor regions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are epitaxially grown using semiconductor regions <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively, as a seed layers. In the preferred embodiment, silicon regions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are grown over silicon bodies <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. In this case, the semiconductor material of the bodies <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> are the same as the semiconductor material of the grown layers <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. In other embodiments, however, this need not be the case. For example, to form a strained semiconductor layer, a layer of silicon can be grown over a silicon-germanium body <b>18</b> and/or <b>22</b>, e.g., a silicon germanium substrate or a silicon-germanium layer over a substrate. In other examples, other combinations of materials are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the preferred embodiment, the insulating layer <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>; this layer is labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> as <b>26</b>) was formed to a thickness of between about 100 nm and 500 nm, preferably about 350 nm. In other embodiments, the thickness can be greater (e.g., up to about 2000 nm) or thinner (e.g., down to about 10 nm). The silicon regions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are preferably grown to about this same thickness. In a less preferred embodiment, the silicon <b>42</b>/<b>44</b> can be grown above the level of the isolation region <b>26</b> and a further insulator deposition (not shown) can be performed to fill the regions over the isolation region <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the top surface of the silicon regions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> is planarized to be substantially planar with the top surface of isolation regions <b>26</b>. The portions of the silicon layer <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> that remain between the isolation regions <b>26</b> can be used as active areas. While it is preferable that the active areas <b>20</b>/<b>22</b> and isolation regions <b>26</b> are co-planar, this is not required. The planarization step is preferably performed using a chemical-mechanical polish (CMP). Other planarization techniques, such as etch back, can alternatively be used. In an alternate embodiment, a thermal oxide (not shown) can be grown over the active areas <b>20</b>/<b>22</b> and then removed to get a fresh silicon surface. Other alternatives include the post thermal anneal to remove the defects and improve the top silicon layer quality.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can now be used as the starting point for device fabrication. For example, transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Other components such as diodes, resistors, capacitors can also be fabricated to form the desired circuits. It is noted that the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> varies from the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These differences are intended to demonstrate that the present invention is applicable in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An alternate embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> one of the active regions <b>20</b> is formed from an SOI wafer while the other regions <b>22</b> are formed on semiconductor layers that overlie the SOI. This embodiment is presented as an example of the wide variety of alternatives that can be encompassed by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description.
