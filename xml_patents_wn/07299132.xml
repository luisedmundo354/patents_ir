<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/595,814 entitled “Sub-Salt Pore Pressure Prediction,” filed Aug. 8, 2005 in the names of Colin Michael Sayers and Richard Anthony Birchwood, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Certain substances (e.g., salt, etc.) have low permeability, i.e., do not readily transmit fluids. In some cases, a low permeability substance may be located above a substance that is targeted by a drilling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary diagram of a drilling operation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the drilling operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided for exemplary purposes only and accordingly should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. For example, the drilling operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a seafloor drilling operation, but the drilling operation may alternatively be a land drilling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a drilling rig (<b>105</b>) is configured to drill into a formation (e.g., a formation below a seafloor (<b>110</b>)) using a drill bit (not shown) coupled to the distal end of a drill string (<b>125</b>). Specifically, the drill bit is used to drill a borehole (<b>130</b>) extending to a target substance (<b>120</b>). The target substance (<b>120</b>) may be hydrocarbon or a mineral resource targeted by a drilling operation. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a low permeability substance (<b>115</b>) may be located above the target substance (<b>120</b>). Thus, to reach the target substance (<b>120</b>), the borehole (<b>130</b>) may be required to pass through the low permeability substance (<b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When sediment of low permeability substance is buried or compacted, fluid may be trapped in pores within the resulting structure (i.e., within the low permeability substance itself and/or within substances beneath the low permeability substance (e.g., sand, etc.). Fluid trapped in this manner exerts pressure on the surrounding formation referred to as pore pressure. Formations in which pore pressure exceeds hydrostatic pressure at a given depth are referred to as overpressured.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When drilling in an overpressured formation, the mud weight (i.e., the weight of drilling fluids transmitted to the borehole) must be high enough to prevent the pore pressure from moving formation fluids into the borehole. In the worst case, formation fluids entering a borehole may result in loss of the well and/or injury to personnel operating the drilling rig. Accordingly, for safe and economic drilling, it is essential that the pore pressure be predicted with sufficient accuracy. In particular, it is beneficial to predict pore pressure pre-drill, i.e., either before any drilling has commenced and/or at a location that the drill bit has not yet reached.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, pre-drill pore pressure prediction is based on the use of pre-drill seismic velocities and a velocity-to-pore pressure transform calibrated using offset well data (i.e., data from other wells near the drilling site). However, in some cases (e.g., when drilling under salt), conventional pre-drill pore pressure predictions may not be sufficiently accurate. Further discussion of conventional pre-drill pore pressure prediction techniques can be found in Sayers C M, Johnson G M, and Denyer G., 2002, <i>“Pre-drill Pore Pressure Prediction Using Seismic Data,</i>” Geophysics, 67, 1286-1292.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Mud is used in drilling operations to cool the drill bit, to transport cuttings generated by the drilling operation to the surface, to prevent the influx of formation fluids into the borehole, and to stabilize the borehole. With respect to preventing the influx of formation fluids, the drilling operator must maintain the mud weight at or above the pore pressure. With respect to stabilizing the borehole, drilling operators adjust the mud weight (i.e., the density of the mud being used) to counter the tendency of the borehole to cave in. However, the drilling operator must be careful not to fracture the formation by using an excessively high mud weight.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, too high a mud weight may result in an unacceptably low drilling rate. Accordingly, the mud weight must be low enough to maintain an acceptable drilling rate and avoid fracturing the formation. In such cases, the allowable mud weight window (i.e., the range of allowable mud weights) may be small when drilling in overpressured formations. Specifically, the force exerted by the mud must fall within the range between the pore pressure (or the pressure to prevent a cave in, if higher than the pore pressure) and the pressure required to fracture the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, when drilling in overpressured formations, the number of required casing strings (i.e., structural supports inserted into the borehole) may be increased. Specifically, if a sufficiently accurate pre-drill pore pressure prediction is not available, additional casing strings may be inserted prematurely, to avoid the possibility of well control problems (e.g., influx of formation fluids) and/or borehole failure. Prematurely inserting casing strings may delay the drilling operation and/or reduce the size of the borehole and result in financial loss.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, embodiments of the invention provide a method and system for pre-drill pore pressure prediction. Specifically, pre-drill pore pressure is predicted using reference data, acoustic or seismic wave velocities associated with a pre-drill location, at least one stress-velocity relationship equation, and a stress-pressure relationship equation. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the pore pressure is iteratively predicted until a threshold condition is satisfied. A drilling operation associated with the pre-drill location is adjusted based on the predicted pore pressure.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Using equations (1)-(6), the following method may be used to obtain the stress sensitivity coefficients (i.e., α<sub>P</sub><sup>V</sup>, α<sub>P</sub><sup>h</sup>, α<sub>S</sub><sup>V </sup>, and α<sub>S</sub><sup>h</sup>). Initially, a common reference location (L<b>0</b>), a first location (L<b>1</b>), and a second location (L<b>2</b>) are selected. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the terms “first” and “second” are used herein solely to distinguish values associated with one location from values associated with another location. Accordingly, no order should be implied from the use of these terms. Continuing with the example, L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b> may be located at different depths within the offset well. In one embodiment of the invention, L<b>0</b> is located at the top of a formation in the offset well. Alternatively, L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b> may be located at a common depth but at different distances from the axis of the borehole of the offset well. For example, L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b> may be located at 10,000 feet below the seafloor, where L<b>0</b> is located on the borehole wall, L<b>1</b> is located 3 inches into the formation measured along a line perpendicular to the borehole axis, and L<b>2</b> is located 6 inches into the formation measured along a line perpendicular to the borehole axis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment of the invention, the formation at L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b> includes substantially similar physical properties (e.g., lithology, porosity, etc.). The similarity of physical properties may be verified using core data or logs (e.g., resistivity logs, neutron porosity logs, density logs, nuclearmagnetic resonance logs, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b> have been selected, ν<sub>P</sub>(σ<sub>V</sub>, σ<sub>h</sub>) and ν<sub>S</sub>(σ<sub>V</sub>, σ<sub>h</sub>) are obtained for each of the locations (i.e., L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, and L<b>2</b>). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the P-wave and S-wave velocities may be obtained using a look-ahead walkaway vertical seismic profile (VSP). In one embodiment of the invention, the VSP is a multi-azimuth walkaway VSP. Further discussion of multi-azimuth VSPs may be found in Leaney, W. S., Sayers, C. M., and Miller, D. E., 1999, <i>“Analysis of Multiazimuthal VSP Data for Anisotropy and AVO,</i>” Geophysics, 64, 1172-1180.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, P-wave and S-wave velocities may be obtained using a borehole sonic tool as described in Harrison, A. R., 1990, “<i>Acquisition and Analysis of Sonic Waveforms from a Borehole Monopole and Dipole Source and the Determination of Compressional and Shear Speeds and their Relation to Rock Mechanical Properties and Surface Seismic Data.</i>” SPE Paper No. 20557, 267-282. Additional methods for obtaining P-wave and S-wave velocities as functions of distance from the borehole axis are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,838,633 and 6,904,365. All of the aforementioned patents are commonly owned by the assignee of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the P-wave and S-wave velocities may be obtained using a multi-component seismic survey (e.g., a 3C survey, a 4C survey, etc.). For example, the multi-component seismic survey may be performed on land using P-wave and S-wave vibrators, P-wave and S-wave receivers, or any combination thereof. As another example, the multi-component seismic survey may be performed in a marine environment using P-wave and S-wave sensors on the seafloor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As another alternative, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the P-wave and S-wave velocities may be obtained using PP and SS reflections, PP and PS reflections (e.g., in cases when an S-wave receiver is available, but no S-wave source is available), any other similar type of method, or any combination thereof. Further, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the P-wave and S-wave velocities may be obtained by inverting amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) data associated with PP reflections. Similarly, in one or more embodiments of the invention, AVO data associated with PS reflections and SS reflections may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to the discussion of using equations (1)-(6) to determine the stress sensitivity coefficient, the pore pressure is obtained at each of the locations (i.e., L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>). As discussed above, pore pressure may be obtained using various downhole tools or numerical methods. In addition, the total stress, which is also expressed as a tensor, is also obtained for each location (i.e., L<b>0</b>, L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Using the pore pressure and the total stress at each of the locations, the effective stress at each of the locations may be determined. In one embodiment of the invention, the effective stress (σ) is defined as the difference between the total stress and the pore pressure expressed as a tensor. The aforementioned effective stresses (σ) along with equations (5) and (6) are then used to determine Δσ<sub>V </sub>and Δσ<sub>h </sub>at L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. The values of ν<sub>P</sub>(σ<sub>V</sub>, σ<sub>h</sub>), ν<sub>S</sub>(σ<sub>V</sub>, σ<sub>h</sub>), Δσ<sub>V</sub>, and Δσ<sub>h </sub>for L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are the used to create four equations (two equations corresponding to equation (1) and two equations corresponding to equation (2)). At this stage, there four equations and four unknowns (i.e., α<sub>P</sub><sup>V</sup>, α<sub>P</sub><sup>h</sup>, α<sub>S</sub><sup>V</sup>, and α<sub>S</sub><sup>h</sup>) and, accordingly, the equations may be rearranged and solved to obtain the values of α<sub>P</sub><sup>V</sup>, α<sub>P</sub><sup>h</sup>, α<sub>S</sub><sup>V</sup>, and α<sub>S</sub><sup>h</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment of the invention, equations (1) and (2) may be used in situations where the minimum horizontal stress and the maximum horizontal stress are equal or substantially the same.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that when S<sub>H </sub>and S<sub>h </sub>are not equal, there are two shear waves with different polarizations having different velocities.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one or more embodiments of the invention, the stress sensitivity coefficient(s) may be obtained by applying a micromechanical model to the reference data. For example, a micromechanical model may be used that accounts for the stress-dependence and orientation distribution of the contacts between grains (e.g., in a sand formation). Further discussion of micromechanical models may be found in Sayers, C. M., 2002, “<i>Stress</i>-<i>dependent elastic anisotropy of sandstones,</i>” Geophysical Prospecting, 50, 85-95, and Sayers, C. M. (1999) Stress-dependent seismic anisotropy of shales, Geophysics, 64, 93-98.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, the vertical stress may not be a principal stress. In such cases, more general forms of the equations (1) and (2) relating effective stress to the P-wave and S-wave velocities may be used. For example, equations (1) and (2) may include shear stress components or principal stress components that are not aligned parallel or perpendicular to the vertical axis (with respect to a gravity vector).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additional methods for obtaining stress sensitivity coefficient(s) are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,042,802; 6,351,991; 5,838,633; 5,619,475; 5,475,650; and 5,398,215. All of the aforementioned patents are commonly owned by the assignee of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the exemplary stress-pressure relationship in equations (1) and (2) relies on the fact that while vertically propagating P-waves are mostly sensitive to changes in the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of propagation, S-waves are sensitive to changes in both the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of propagation and the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of polarization. Further discussion of these underlying facts can be found in Sayers, C. M., 2004, “<i>Monitoring production</i>-<i>induced stress changes using seismic waves,” </i>74<sup>th </sup>SEG Annual Meeting, Extended Abstracts. Specifically, since the directions of propagation and polarization are approximately parallel for the P-wave and orthogonal for the S-wave, the combination of the P-wave and S-wave velocities allows perpendicular components of the effective stress to be determined separately, thus allowing a determination of the pore pressure, and principal stresses.</p>

In one embodiment of the invention, P-wave and/or S-wave velocities may be obtaining using multi-offset Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP), often referred to as a walkaway VSP. In such cases, the VSP may be acquired using shots arranged on a line designed to maximize the extraction of information about the principal stresses. A multi-offset, multi-azimuth VSP may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Continuing with discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one or more embodiments of the invention, in Step <b>315</b>, P-wave and/or S-wave velocities associated with a reference location may be obtained using one or more of the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In Step <b>320</b>, total stress values associated with the pre-drill location may be calculated, using a predicted pore pressure. Specifically, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the first time that Step <b>320</b> is performed, the predicted pore pressure may be obtained from an offset well, a computer simulation, or any other source. For example, the predicted pore pressure may be obtained using a velocity-to-pore-pressure transform on offset well data. Further discussion of velocity-to-pore-pressure transforms can be found in Eaton, “<i>The Equation for Geopressure Prediction from Well Logs,</i>” SPE 5544 (Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME, 1975) and Bowers, “<i>Pore Pressure Estimation from Velocity Data: Accounting for Pore</i>-<i>Pressure Mechanisms besides Undercompaction,</i>” SPE Drilling and Completion (June 1995) 89-95.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one or more embodiments of the invention, calculating total stress values may involve performing a finite element analysis that includes the pre-drill location and surrounding formations. For example, a finite element model used in the finite element analysis may include the pre-drill location and one or more locations in one or more offset wells. Performing the finite element analysis may also involve calculating a total stress variation across one or more depths (e.g., above, below, and/or around the low permeability substance) using the predicted pore pressure. For example, boundary stress conditions may be obtained from offset wells and used to estimate total stress values at the pre-drill location.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Initially, a reference location is selected.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With respect to the reference, the variables in equations (11)-(12) are defined as follows: ν<sub>P</sub>(S<sub>V</sub>, S<sub>h</sub>, p) is the P-wave velocity associated with the pre-drill location, and ν<sub>S</sub>(S<sub>V</sub>, S<sub>h</sub>, p) is the S-wave velocity associated with the pre-drill location; ν<sub>P</sub><sup>(0) </sup>is a reference P-wave velocity associated with the reference location; ν<sub>S</sub><sup>(0) </sup>is a reference S-wave velocity associated with the reference location; α<sub>P</sub><sup>V </sup>is the vertical compressional stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step <b>305</b>; α<sub>P</sub><sup>h </sup>is the horizontal compressional stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step <b>305</b>; α<sub>S</sub><sup>V </sup>is the vertical shear stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step <b>305</b>; α<sub>S</sub><sup>h </sup>is the horizontal shear stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step <b>305</b>; S<sub>ν</sub> is the total vertical stress; S<sub>h </sub>is the total horizontal stress; p is the pore pressure; the terms preceded by Δ represent the difference between values at the pre-drill location and the reference location; and α is the poroelastic coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Using equation (11) and/or equation (12) with values obtained in the previous steps, Δp may be determined. Δp may then be added to the pore pressure at the reference location to obtain the second predicted pore pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Continuing with discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one or more embodiments of the invention, in Step <b>330</b>, the predicted pore pressure used in Step <b>320</b> (hereinafter the “first” predicted pore pressure) may be compared with the predicted pore pressure calculated in Step <b>325</b> (hereinafter the “second” predicted pore pressure). Specifically, one or more metrics of the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures may be compared with one or more threshold difference values. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a threshold difference value may be a maximum value of the metric of differences indicating that the second predicted pore pressure is sufficiently accurate. In one embodiment of the invention, a second predicted pore pressure is determined to be sufficiently accurate when |(PP<b>1</b>−PP<b>2</b>)/PP<b>1</b>|≦0.001, where PP<b>1</b> denotes the first predicted pore pressure and PP<b>2</b> denotes the second predicted pore pressure. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that other values for the threshold difference value may be used and that other mathematical constructs for the metric of the differences may be used. The threshold difference value may correspond to any other value less than 1.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one or more embodiments of the invention, if the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures are greater than the threshold difference value in Step <b>330</b>, then in Step <b>335</b> the first predicted pore pressure is updated using the second predicted pore pressure. In this case, Step <b>320</b> is subsequently repeated using the first updated predicted pore pressure. In one or more embodiments of the invention, if Step <b>320</b>-<b>325</b> are repeated, current data gathered while drilling may be used (e.g., seismic wave velocities, stress data, etc.). For example, the current data may be gathered using measurements while drilling (MWD), logging while drilling (LWD), any other similar type of drilling data, or any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that using more current data and/or data from a location closer to the pre-drill location may improve the accuracy of the calculated total stress value. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that “updating” the first predicted pore pressure may simply imply that Step <b>320</b> is repeated using the predicted pore pressure calculated in Step <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one or more embodiments of the invention, Steps <b>320</b> and <b>325</b> may be iteratively performed (i.e., via Steps <b>330</b> and <b>335</b>) until the difference between the first and second predicted pore pressures are less than or equal to the threshold difference values in Step <b>330</b>. Said another way, Steps <b>320</b> and <b>325</b> may be repeated until the first and second predicted pore pressures have sufficiently converged (e.g., the difference between the first and second predicted pore pressure is ≦0.1%.).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one or more embodiments of the invention, if the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures are less than or equal to the threshold difference value(s) in Step <b>330</b>, then in Step <b>340</b> the drilling operation associated with the pre-drill location may be adjusted based on the second predicted pore pressure. Specifically, in one or more embodiments of the invention, adjusting the drilling operation may involve adjusting a drilling fluid density (i.e., increasing or decreasing the drilling fluid density as appropriate), adjusting a drilling trajectory (e.g., to avoid an overpressured area, to pass through a low-pressure area, etc.), optimizing the number of casing strings in the borehole (i.e., adding a casing string, delaying addition of a casing string, etc.), or any other similar type of adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment of the invention, if a proposed well trajectory is situated in the vicinity of a complex structure that perturbs the surrounding stress-field (e.g., salt) and the proposed well trajectory passes through a highly permeable formation (e.g., sand), then the pore pressure in the highly permeable formation may be determined using any of the available techniques for determining pore pressure in such a formation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, if shale (a low permeability substance) interfaces with a sand (a high permeability), then an offset well may be drilled in the shale and the pore pressure in the shale may be determined using, for example, acoustic or seismic velocities. The pore pressure in the shale may then be used to obtain the pore pressure in the sand using, for example, the centroid method. A particular version of the centroid method is described in the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Application with the serial number WO 2004/022905 and assigned to the assignee of the present application. Alternatives to the centroid method include numerical basin modeling. Once the pore pressure in the sand has been determined, the pore pressure may be used to validate the various stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment of the invention, wireline and/or logging while drilling (LWD) tools are used to obtain pore pressure measurements for a location in an offset well, where the location is in a sand and the sand extends to a pre-drill location. In such cases, the pore pressure at the pre-drill location may be estimated using the pore pressure obtained at the location in the offset well and information about the hydrostatic gradient (defined by the fluid density) between the location in the offset well and the pre-drill location. Once the pore pressure in the sand has been determined at the pre-drill location, the pore pressure may be used to validate the various stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment of the invention, downhole measurements obtained while drilling in the target borehole (i.e., the borehole whose trajectory intersects with the pre-drill location) may be used to update the stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location. These coefficients may then be used to predict the pore pressure ahead of the bit using seismic velocities or velocities obtained using a multi-offset VSP.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">One or more embodiments of the invention provide a means for accurately predicting a pre-drill pore pressure. Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the invention may prevent formation fluids from entering a borehole, thereby preventing damage to the well and/or personnel operating a drilling rig. Further, one or more embodiments of the invention may prevent the financial overhead of prematurely inserting casing strings.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a computer system (<b>400</b>) includes a processor (<b>402</b>), associated memory (<b>404</b>), a storage device (<b>406</b>), and numerous other elements and functionalities typical of today's computers (not shown). The computer (<b>400</b>) may also include input means, such as a keyboard (<b>408</b>) and a mouse (<b>410</b>), and output means, such as a monitor (<b>412</b>). The computer system (<b>400</b>) may be connected to a network (<b>414</b>) (e.g., a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, or any other similar type of network) via a network interface connection (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these input and output means may take other forms.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more elements of the aforementioned computer system (<b>400</b>) may be located at a remote location and connected to the other elements over a network. Further, the invention may be implemented on a distributed system having a plurality of nodes, where each portion of the invention (e.g., stress sensitivity coefficient calculator, total stress calculator, pore pressure calculator, etc.) may be located on a different node within the distributed system. In one embodiment of the invention, the node corresponds to a computer system. Alternatively, the node may correspond to a processor with associated physical memory. The node may alternatively correspond to a processor with shared memory and/or resources. Further, software instructions to perform embodiments of the invention may be stored on a computer readable medium such as a compact disc (CD), a diskette, a tape, a file, or any other computer readable storage device. In addition, in one embodiment of the invention, the predicted pore pressure (including all the pore pressures calculated using the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be displayed to a user via a graphical user interface (e.g., a display device).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.</p>
