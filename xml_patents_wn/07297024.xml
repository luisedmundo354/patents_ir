<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A metal-wrapped flash-memory-drive device has an integrated slim Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) connector that fits into a standard USB socket. The slim USB connector has 4 metal contacts on a circuit board that is encapsulated by a plastic case. Components are mounted onto the circuit board. A metal wrap conforms to the general shape of a plastic sub-assembly of the plastic case and a plastic cover that enclose the circuit board. The metal wrap can be bent around the plastic sub-assembly in a forming process, or can be pre-formed into a metal tube that the plastic sub-assembly is inserted into. Alignment holes in the metal wrap can fit over plastic stubs on the plastic sub-assembly, or friction can hold the metal wrap to the plastic sub-assembly. The plastic cover and case can be bonded together by molding, ultrasonically, with adhesive films, or using snaps to form the plastic sub-assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to reduced-size Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) connectors, and more particularly to flash-memory-drive cards having a metal body wrap.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Large, 1 G-Byte chips using flash-memory technologies with electrically-erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) are available. Small flash-memory cards have been designed that have a connector that can plug into a specialized reader, such as for compact-flash, secure-digital, memory stick, or other standardized formats.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, flash memory cards are being sold that contain a USB connector. Such USB-flash memory cards do not require a specialized reader but can be plugged into a USB connector on a personal computer (PC) or other hosting device. These USB-flash memory cards can be used in place of floppy disks and are known as USB key drives, USB thumb drives, and a variety of other names. These USB-flash cards can have a capacity of more than ten floppy disks in an area not much larger than a large postage stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a bottom view of assembly of a male slim USB connector that is integrated with a circuit-board substrate of a flash memory card. Flash memory chip <b>75</b> may be a 128 Mega-byte non-volatile chip or may have some other capacity. Controller chip <b>78</b> contains a flash-memory controller that generates signals to access memory locations within flash memory chip <b>75</b>. Controller chip <b>78</b> also contains a USB interface controller that serially transfers data to and from flash memory chip <b>75</b> over a USB connection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A USB connector may be formed on board <b>60</b>, which is a small circuit board with chips <b>75</b>, <b>78</b> mounted thereon. Multi-layer printed-circuit board (PCB) technology can be used for board <b>60</b>. Metal contacts carry the USB signals generated or received by controller chip <b>78</b>. USB signals include power, ground, and serial differential data D+, D−.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The USB flash-memory card is assembled from PCB board <b>60</b> and its components, and lower case <b>65</b>, which are sandwiched together to form the flash-memory card. The bottom surface of board <b>60</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Flash memory chip <b>75</b> and controller chip <b>78</b> are mounted on the reverse (bottom) side of board <b>60</b>, which can be a multi-layer PCB or similar substrate with wiring traces. The 4 USB contacts are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b> and are not visible in this bottom view. Since most components are mounted on the bottom side of board <b>60</b> opposite the top side with the USB metal contacts, board <b>60</b> does not need a plastic cover over its top side. This allows the flash-memory card to have a lower profile or even a co-planar top surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Extension <b>61</b> of board <b>60</b> has a width that approximately matches the width of the connector substrate and the metal wrap in a male USB connector, about 12.4 mm. Metal USB contacts (not visible) are formed on the top side of extension <b>61</b> to act as the USB metal contacts of the male slim USB connector. End <b>72</b> of board <b>60</b> is inserted into the female USB connector.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Lower case <b>65</b> also includes extended region <b>80</b>. LED <b>93</b> can be mounted on board <b>60</b>, such as on the bottom side with other components, or extending from an edge of board <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The width of the USB flash-memory drive may flare beyond extension <b>61</b>, causing a flared or T-shape to the device. This widening of the USB flash-memory device is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While traditional USB connectors have metal wraps around a connector substrate, USB flash-memory drives are often made from plastic housings. A USB flash-memory drive may have a metal wrap around extension <b>61</b>, but a plastic housing such as lower case <b>65</b> around for the remaining portion of the USB device. Having the metal-wrapped connector with the plastic housing may be aesthetically unappealing, and the plastic housing may be less durable than the metal-wrapped USB connector. The USB device may crack and fail due to strain at the metal-plastic interface or join between the metal-wrapped USB connector and the plastic housing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">What is desired is a metal-wrapped USB flash-memory device. A USB flash-memory device with a metal cover extending from the USB connector over the plastic housing is desirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention relates to an improvement in USB flash drives. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention as provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those with skill in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inventors have realized that a metal sheet may be wrapped around the plastic housing of a USB flash-memory device. The metal wrap may have the same cross-sectional area as the USB connector, allowing for a smooth-sided device without joints or strain interfaces between the USB connector and the plastic housing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-D</figref> show a narrow USB flash-memory device with a metal wrap. Flash memory chip <b>77</b> is a 128 Mega-byte non-volatile memory chip or may have a die with some other capacity and can be packaged in a variety of packages, such a BGA, small-outline, leadless, etc. Controller chip <b>79</b> contains a flash-memory controller that generates signals to access memory locations within flash memory chip <b>77</b>. Controller chip <b>79</b> also contains a USB interface controller that serially transfers data to and from flash memory chip <b>77</b> over a USB connection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Flash memory chip <b>77</b> can have a small area. For example, a chip having dimensions of 8.5 mm by 13 mm may be used for flash memory chip <b>77</b>. Since the narrowest dimension, 8.5 mm, is less than the width of the USB connector, 12.4 mm, flash memory chip <b>77</b> does not require a widening of board <b>60</b>. Instead, board <b>60</b> can be 12.4 mm wide for its entire length.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Multi-layer printed-circuit board (PCB) technology can be used for board <b>60</b>. Metal contacts carry the USB signals generated or received by controller chip <b>79</b>. USB signals include power, ground, and serial differential data D+, D−.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The USB flash-memory card is assembled from PCB board <b>60</b> and its components, case <b>68</b>, and cover <b>64</b>, which are sandwiched together to form the flash-memory card. The bottom surface of board <b>60</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Flash memory chip <b>77</b> and controller chip <b>79</b> are mounted on the reverse (bottom) side of board <b>60</b>, which can be a multi-layer PCB or similar substrate with wiring traces. The 4 USB contacts are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b> and are not visible in this bottom view.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Board <b>60</b> has a width that approximately matches the width of the connector substrate inside the metal wrap of a male USB connector, somewhat less than 12.4 mm. Metal USB contacts (not visible) are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b> to act as the USB metal contacts of the male slim USB connector.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">LED <b>38</b> can be mounted on board <b>60</b>, such as on the bottom side with other components, or extending from an edge of board <b>60</b>. A region of reduced thickness (not shown) or an opening may be formed in case <b>68</b> to create a light window for LED <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the top view of the USB memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The 4 USB contacts, metal contacts <b>42</b>, are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b>. A second flash-memory chip, memory chip <b>75</b>, is mounted on the bottom side of board <b>60</b>. Board <b>60</b> is covered by plastic cover <b>64</b> over its top side.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Board <b>60</b> has a width that approximately matches the width of the connector substrate in a male USB connector. Metal contacts <b>42</b> are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b> to act as the USB metal contacts of the male slim USB connector. End <b>72</b> of board <b>60</b> is inserted into the female USB connector.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Case <b>68</b> can have grooves in its sidewalls to accept board <b>60</b> during assembly. Board <b>60</b> can be attached to case <b>68</b> by adhesive or by snap fasteners, such as plastic snap pins or tabs in case <b>68</b> that fit through and lock into holes in board <b>60</b>. Adhesive could be a thermal-bond or another type. Supporting ridges <b>32</b> in case <b>68</b> are located under board <b>60</b> near metal contacts <b>42</b> to provide additional support to insertion end <b>72</b> which forms the USB connector.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once board <b>60</b> is inserted into case <b>68</b>, and cover <b>64</b> is attached, the assembly can be placed in an ultrasonic welding fixture and ultrasonic energy applied. The ultrasonic energy vibrates the parts at high frequency, causing heating at contact points such as ultrasonic ridges (not shown) that can be formed on case <b>68</b> or cover <b>64</b> at points of contact. These ridges melt under the ultrasonic energy, forming a plastic bonding between case <b>68</b> and cover <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a metal wrap being formed around the plastic USB assembly. Board <b>60</b> and cover <b>64</b> have been assembled into case <b>68</b> but are hidden from view by case <b>68</b>. Metal wrap <b>40</b> can be a metal sheet that is bent around case <b>68</b> by a forming process, such as using pressure and heat. Holes <b>26</b> in metal wrap <b>40</b> can be provided that fit over stubs <b>30</b> that protrude from case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> shows the final assembled USB device with the metal wrap. Metal wrap <b>40</b> has been pressed onto the outer surface of case <b>68</b> on the top and cover <b>64</b> on the bottom so that metal wrap <b>40</b> now conforms to the general shape of the plastic assembly of case <b>68</b> and cover <b>64</b>, which enclose board <b>60</b>. Stubs <b>30</b> on case <b>68</b> fit into holes <b>26</b> in metal wrap <b>40</b>, helping to align metal wrap <b>40</b> to case <b>68</b>. Additional holes can be provided, such as for the standard USB plug mechanism. End <b>72</b> of board <b>60</b> is visible in the open end of metal wrap <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Metal wrap <b>40</b> acts as both the metal wrap of the USB connector, and a metal covering of the plastic assembly (case <b>68</b> and cover <b>64</b>). Seam <b>22</b> where the two ends of metal wrap <b>40</b> meet can be located on the side rather than the top of case <b>68</b> for better visual appearance. Seam <b>22</b> can be a straight seam as shown, or can be a serrated or toothed seam.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref> show assembly using a plastic snap-together process with a metal tube wrap. In the bottom view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, board <b>60</b> is tilted at an angle to have its USB end inserted into case <b>68</b>. Then board <b>60</b> is pushed flat into case <b>68</b> and cover <b>66</b> is placed over board <b>60</b> to cover the large bottom opening in case <b>68</b>. LED <b>38</b> can be mounted on board <b>60</b>. Flash memory chip <b>77</b> and controller chip <b>79</b> are mounted to the bottom surface of board <b>60</b> and are protected by case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Protruding snaps <b>28</b> on cover <b>66</b> fit into snap groves <b>33</b> in case <b>68</b> when assembled. Cover <b>66</b> may fit inside case <b>68</b> as shown or may fit around the outside of case <b>68</b> in an alternative embodiment. Various types of plastic snaps <b>28</b> and mating snap grooves <b>33</b> may be formed on case <b>68</b> and cover <b>66</b>. Plastic snap tabs may be semi-flexible plastic extensions or protrusion tabs formed on the edges of cover <b>66</b> or case <b>68</b> and extend upward or downward. Snap grooves or holes may be formed on the peripheral edges of case <b>68</b> and match positions of plastic snap tabs in cover <b>66</b>, or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once board <b>60</b> is assembled into case <b>68</b> and cover <b>66</b> snapped in to form the plastic sub-assembly, the plastic sub-assembly is fitted into metal wrap tube <b>20</b>. Alignment holes <b>26</b> in metal wrap tube <b>20</b> can be provided that fit over stubs <b>30</b> that protrude from case <b>68</b> once the plastic sub-assembly is fitted into metal wrap tube <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, case <b>68</b> has a smaller top opening that exposes metal contacts <b>42</b> on the top surface of board <b>60</b> after assembly. Supporting ridges <b>32</b> are visible inside the smaller opening of case <b>68</b> and provide mechanical support to the USB connector formed from insertion end <b>72</b> of board <b>60</b> to prevent damage by rough usage.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A second flash memory chip <b>75</b> may be mounted on the top side of board <b>60</b> to increase memory storage capacity. The peripheral outline of cover <b>66</b> may be somewhat smaller than for case <b>68</b> so that cover <b>66</b> can fit inside case <b>68</b>. During assembly, when board <b>60</b> is placed inside case <b>68</b>, the edge of board <b>60</b> may be forced into grooves in the side walls of case <b>68</b>, which can be covered with adhesive or can have snap tabs that snap through holes in board <b>60</b> when board <b>60</b> is fully inserted into case <b>68</b>. This locks board <b>60</b> into case <b>68</b>. A variety of shapes can be used for plastic snap tabs and grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the plastic sub-assembly of case <b>68</b>, board <b>60</b>, and cover <b>66</b> is slid into one open end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b>. Snaps in cover <b>66</b> fit into snap groves <b>33</b> in case <b>68</b> when forming the plastic sub-assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment metal wrap tube <b>20</b> can be pre-formed, with seam <b>22</b> along the side edge rather than flat top <b>41</b> of metal wrap tube <b>20</b>. This seam placement has a better appearance. Seam <b>22</b> has a tooth arrangement in this embodiment, but could be a straight line or have some other shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the sub-assembly is fully inserted into metal wrap tube <b>20</b>, stubs <b>30</b> from case <b>68</b> snap into alignment holes <b>26</b> on metal wrap tube <b>20</b> to lock the plastic sub-assembly into metal wrap tube <b>20</b>. Flat top <b>41</b> can be a part of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> or can be an opening in metal wrap tube <b>20</b> that exposes case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The open end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> exposes metal contacts <b>42</b> on board <b>60</b>. Insertion end <b>72</b> of board <b>60</b> forms the substrate part of the USB connector, while the end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> forms the USB connector's metal wrap. Insertion end <b>72</b> can be inserted into a female USB socket, such as on a personal computer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The final assembly has metal on the outside, since metal wrap tube <b>20</b> covers the plastic sub-assembly of case <b>68</b>, board <b>60</b>, and cover <b>66</b>. At least one end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> is open to expose metal contacts <b>42</b> on board <b>60</b> to form the USB connector plug. The other end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> (hidden from view) can be open or can be closed. Metal wrap tube <b>20</b> may fully cover the plastic sub-assembly, or may only partially cover the plastic sub-assembly, such as by having one or more openings.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-C</figref> show a 1-step molding process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, board <b>60</b> has been assembled with flash memory chip <b>77</b> and controller chip <b>79</b> both mounted. LED <b>38</b> is also optionally mounted to board <b>60</b>, and metal contacts <b>42</b> are formed on the top side of board <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Assembled board <b>60</b> is placed in a molding fixture (not shown) and plastic is flowed into the fixture, around board <b>60</b>. After cooling, the molded device is removed from the molding fixture and any burrs and molding handle <b>84</b> are removed to reveal the sub-assembled device that has molded plastic casing <b>85</b> that surrounds board <b>60</b>. The molding fixture can prevent plastic from covering metal contacts <b>42</b> on board <b>60</b>, as shown in the bottom view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Plastic stubs <b>30</b> can be formed as part of the molding process that forms molded plastic casing <b>85</b>. These stubs <b>30</b> fit into alignment holes <b>26</b> on metal wrap tube <b>20</b> when molded plastic casing <b>85</b> is fitted into metal wrap tube <b>20</b>. Alternately, a metal sheet can be wrapped around molded plastic casing <b>85</b>, with the ends of the metal sheet joined together at seam <b>22</b>. Holes can be pre-cut in the metal sheet that align over stubs <b>30</b> during the forming process. Alignment holes <b>26</b> can be formed on either or both sides to match locations of stubs <b>30</b> in molded plastic casing <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the plastic sub-assembly of molded plastic casing <b>85</b> that encloses most of board <b>60</b> is slid into one open end of metal wrap tube <b>20</b>.</p>

Although board <b>60</b> is not covered by plastic cases, it is still protected by metal wrap tube <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an alignment hole on the side of the metal wrap tube. Side hole <b>44</b> is cut in the side metal wrap tube <b>20</b> and fits over a side stub on the side of plastic case <b>68</b>, molded plastic casing <b>85</b>, plastic casing <b>87</b>, or connector substrate <b>39</b>. Hole <b>46</b> can fit over a clip in end cap <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an alternative metal wrap tube with a metal end. Rather than use plastic end cap <b>34</b>, metal from metal wrap tube <b>20</b> can be bent and formed over the end to cover the end. End seam <b>38</b> is formed on the end where 2 extensions of metal wrap tube <b>20</b> meet. Alignment holes <b>26</b> can fit over stubs in the underlying plastic sub-assembly.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Lead-Free-Process Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The element lead (Plumbium, Pb) is indicated as a hazardous material. Legislatives would like to remove this material within a couple of years, such as from the European Union and Japan after January 2008 or earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The traditional USB plug which has plastic substrate during PCBA process will be shrunk and warped at a temperature of about 240° C. (peak temp of lead-free solder paste), therefore such a USB plug is not suitable for lead-free process.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The slim USB plug doesn't have the plastic substrate during PCBA process and uses a different PCB material to provide a better temperature resistance to the peak temp of 240° C. of the lead-free process. For lead-free processes, surface mount components as well as BGAs don't contain lead in their pins or balls. After the PCBA process, the plastic housing is added and assembled to finish the final product.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">ALTERNATE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Several other embodiments are contemplated by the inventors. For example controller chip <b>79</b> could be combined with flash memory chip <b>77</b> in a single BGA, small-outline, leadless, or other kind of package. Rather than use a chip package, the flash-memory die could be directly attached to board <b>60</b> with die-wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An adhesive film can be placed inside cover <b>66</b>, and the film can be placed inside case <b>68</b> before board <b>60</b> is fitted into case <b>68</b> and cover <b>66</b> attached and snapped into place. Protective backing from the films can be peeled off just before attachment, and double-sided adhesive films may be used. Adhesive films may be pressure-sensitive or heat-sensitive, but may not be used in all embodiments, such as when snaps are fully secure.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Rather than use a second molding step to add molded cover <b>56</b> to upper opening <b>83</b> of plastic casing <b>87</b>, this second molding step could be skipped. Metal wrap tube <b>20</b> could provide sufficient covering for upper opening <b>83</b>. Alignment holes <b>26</b> and stubs <b>30</b> may not be needed in all embodiments. Friction between metal wrap tube <b>20</b> and the plastic sub-assembly may be sufficient for holding metal wrap tube <b>20</b> onto the inner plastic parts.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additional holes, slots, and other features may be added to the metal wrap or plastic sub-assembly parts. For example, two rectangular USB holes may be added to the top of the USB connector and two more holes may be added to the bottom of the USB connector metal wrap tube near the plug end. These extra holes are present in many USB plugs.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Rather than use the USB device only for flash-memory storage, additional features may be added. For example, a USB music player may include a controller for playing audio from MP3 data stored in the flash memory. An audio jack may be added to the USB device to allow a user to plug in headphones to listen to the music. A wireless transmitter such as a BlueTooth transmitter may be added to the USB device to connect to wireless headphones rather than using the audio jack. Infrared transmitters such as for IrDA may also be added. A BlueTooth transceiver to a wireless mouse, PDA, keyboard, printer, digital camera, MP3 player, or other wireless device may also be added. The BlueTooth transceiver could replace the USB connector as the primary connector. A Bluetooth USB adapter device could have a USB connector, a RF (Radio Frequency) transceiver, a baseband controller, an antenna, a flash memory (EEPROM), a voltage regulator, a crystal, a LED (Light Emitted Diode), resistors, capacitors and inductors. These components may be mounted on the PCB before being enclosed into a plastic or metallic enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The bottom opening of case <b>68</b> may be enlarged so that case <b>68</b> is fully open to its perimeter on the bottom. Then cover <b>56</b> may be extended to cover this larger opening. Inserting board <b>60</b> into case <b>68</b> may be easier with the larger opening. The larger opening may also be used in other embodiments. Also, board <b>60</b> may not have a cover over it.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Rather than or in addition to snap tabs, adhesive can be used. Pressure or heat sensitive adhesive films can be attached to board <b>60</b> or to case <b>68</b> where bonding is desired. For example, an adhesive could be brushed on as a liquid or paste, or it could be a double-coated adhesive film such as 3M's 7953 film. A thermal bond film (TBF) such as 3M's TBF-668 could also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Once board <b>60</b> and case <b>68</b> are pressed together with board <b>60</b> in between, the adhesive can be cured by heating the assembly, by pressing the case and board together, or by allowing sufficient time for curing.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Board <b>60</b> could also be mounted over the tops of side walls of a lower case. In that variation the edges of board <b>60</b> are exposed rather than covered by case <b>68</b>. In some embodiments board <b>60</b> could be the same area or ever larger than case <b>68</b>, or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Snap-tabs with movable latching teeth or extensions or locking portions may also be used. Different thicknesses and dimensions can be substituted for the examples given. The narrow USB device may have a somewhat varying width, such as within +/−20% of the width at the insertion end.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Various design features such as supporting underside ribs or bumps can be added. A variety of materials may be used for the connector substrate, circuit boards, metal contacts, case, etc. Plastic cases can have a variety of shapes and may partially or fully cover different parts of the circuit board and connector, and can form part of the connector itself. Metal covers rather than plastic may be used in some embodiments. Various features can have a variety of shapes and sizes. Oval, round, square, rectangular, trapezoidal, and other shapes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The slim connector may be widened to accommodate extra metal contacts to become an extended-USB connector for future USB specification. Moreover, the width of the slim connector can be widened, and the height and metal contacts of the slim connector can be varied, making it into a general-purpose slim connector, for USB, extended-USB, PCI Express, mini PCI Express applications, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">There are 4 pins in the current USB pin out definition—VCC, GND, D+, and D−. VCC is the 5V power pin. GND is the ground pin and D+ and D− are the differential data I/O pins. For the USB 2.0 specification, data transfer rates are up to 480M bits/sec, and the power supply current is 500 mA. These might not meet future (or even some current) needs of speed and power associated with some USB devices, such as large flash memory cards.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Additional metal contacts can be added to the new connectors. These additional metal contacts can serve as power, ground, and/or I/O pins which are extensions to the USB specification, or as PCI Express (or mini PCI Express) specifications. Greater power capability can be obtained with (or without) additional power and ground pins (or by a higher power supply current of the existing power pin). Multiple power supplies can also be provided by the additional power and ground pins. The improved power supply capabilities allow more devices and/or more memory chips to be powered. Extra I/O pins can be added for higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds. The additional I/O pins can be used for multiple-bit data I/O communications, such as 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, 64, . . . bits. By adopting some or all of these new features, performance of flash memory cards/devices can be significantly improved. These additional pins could be located behind or adjacent to the existing USB pins, or in various other arrangements. The additional pins could be applied to male and female connectors. New types of flash memory cards/devices can be made with these new connectors, which have the additional pins.</p>
