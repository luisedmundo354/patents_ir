<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to the systems and methods of using a decision tree and stochastic process to score the cash transaction activity of each bank customer holding a direct-deposit-account (DDA) to forecast the financial behavior of each DDA holder to be a most likely and least likely candidates for cross sell, up sell, attrition, default, and fraud events. The DDA scoring process can be extended to forecast the most likely and least likely customers for specific retail incentives, and to forecast profitable and non-profitable account activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Banks are continuously trying to offer their customers additional products. One of the older techniques is to induce customers with savings account to open a certificate of deposit, or to induce customers retaining a certificate of deposit to participate in an investment fund at a higher interest rate. As an inducement to consider the cross sell offer, banks provide everything from a free toaster, to a fee set of Tupperware. The flaw with this technique is that no consideration is given to the customer's financial ability to maintain the cross sell products being offered.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the last decade banks have strength their retail cross sell marketing initiative by implementing demographic and lifestyle segmentation systems to better target and match cross sell products. These segmentation systems, breakdown a bank customer database into lifestyle categories, such as elite suburbs, urban core, country families, to rustic living. Each lifestyle category calculates the median age and income of the category population.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the segment is selected, various statistical models are applied to information stored in these segment classifications to generate a score that reflects the most likely and less likely to be a candidate for a specific bank or retail product. These statistical model ranges from linear and logistic regression to the new decision tree segmentation modeling techniques, like Chi-Square Automatic Interactive Detector (CHAID). The implementation of these classes of technology have contributed to growth in response rate from less than one-half percent a decade ago, to over two percent in today's bank cross sell world.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A deficiency found with these segmentation techniques, is no economic consideration is given to the amount of cash that flows through a customers direct-deposit, time-deposit, and loan accounts to match a customers financial ability to a specific bank initiative. Bank products are still offered as incentives, which in most cases, the bank customer has no interest or financial ability to support the bank product offered.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the credit card industry world, an economic scoring technique has been development that determines a credit card holders ability to make credit card payments. The FICO scoring algorithm uses a scoring model and mathematical tables to assign points for different pieces of information which best predict future credit card payment behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The FICO scoring algorithm has taught that by measuring and scoring the variation in payment history of credit card customers, that customer future payment ability can be forecast.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another invention that has taught the use of scoring to target the right bank customer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,415 issued to Shurling, et al., where each social security number (SSN) stored in a banks customer-information-file is assigned relationship points based on the number bank accounts tied to each SSN and the period each account has been help by the SSN. The length of time that the SSN has been active is considered in the relationship scoring process. Through the computer implementation of the relationship scoring system, the relationship point are summed for each SSN and match to a bank reward, lower interest rates to no service charges, being offered by the bank management for each level of relationship point accumulation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The deficiency with this invention is that no consideration is given to measuring and scoring the financial information stored in a bank's CIF. The number of bank account and years of longevity misses addressing the financial ability of the SSN holder.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Bank management is continuously pursuing better method to match customers to the right product to cross sell, and the right incentive to reward. With the establishment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the US Patriot Act, and Basel Accord, the forecasting of account performance, the forecasting of default events, the forecasting of account attrition and detection of account fraud has become a major focus of the bank industry. The systems and method available to date have failed to effectively forecast the financial variations of a direct-deposit-account holder to address these demands.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to a system and method for predicting the financial behavior of direct-deposit-account holder. The invention measures and score the flow of cash within a customer's demand-deposit, time-deposit, and loan accounts to predict the most likely and less likely candidates for cross sell, up sell, attrition, default and fraud consideration. By adding the cash transaction component to the demographic information for each customer, the invention can match and predict with a high degree of accuracy bank customer financial behavior variations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention can by implemented at any bank including, but not limited, a commercial bank, a savings bank, a savings and loan association, and a credit union, or any financial institution processing a demand-deposit account.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention extracts the cash datasets from the direct-deposit-account, and the time-deposit accounts, loans, debit and credit card activity related to DDA holder to build the predictive datasets. Next, the datasets are grouped into multidimensional array that establishes the significance of determining a customer's financial behavior. Each datasets in each multidimensional array is than normalized to produce a standard numeric convention. Based on the specific target variables established by the bank the multidimensional array are processed through a statistical decision tree algorithm to generate a weighted variable and predict segments that represents the based financial behavior match for the target variable established by the bank. The final step in the invention is to increase the accuracy of the prediction by processing the weighted variables through a stochastic process to generate the final probability and score that match each customer's financial behavior as related to the specific target variables establish by the bank.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The bank establishes the target variables for each target marketing initiative. Target parameters are classified into two groups: continuous and categorical variables. The continuous variable has numeric values such as 1, 2, 3.14, etc. A categorical variable has values that function as labels rather than numbers. A categorical variable for gender might use the value 1 for male and 2 for female. The actual magnitude of the value of the categorical variable is not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention extracts the DDA, Time-Deposit, and Loan account history of each customer holding a DDA from the banks customer-information-file (CIF). The account history is broken down by the beginning and end dates of each processing period. Normal this represents twelve periods. The next step in the invention process is to generate a decision tree for each processing period based on the target variables established by the bank. This multiple decision tree process establishes a financial behavioral pattern that is used to generate future financial behavior patterns for specific target variables.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The dataset value extracted by the invention for each bank processing period is converted to a normalized numeric convention to be used by the invention to process the predictive financial behavior of each customer. The target variables establish by the bank, the normalized cash variables extracted from the bank database, and the demographic variables are than processed by the statistical decision tree model for each processing period. The statistical decision tree model weights the value of each normalized cash variable from previous processing periods to forecast the financial behavior of each bank customer. These previous weighted variables assigned to the normalized cash variable, and demographic variables captured are used to generate the predictive customer segments that best match the target variables. An example of a decision tree model is illustrated.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To increase the accuracy of a predictive segments probability the content of the segment is processed repeatedly in a series that combines the output of each weighted function so that the total error of the prediction is minimized. This is classified as a stochastic process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A stochastic process X={X(t), tεT} is a collection of random variables. That is, for each t in the index set T, X(t) is a random variable. We often interpret t as time and call X(t) the state of the process at time t. The index set T can be countable set and we have a discrete-time stochastic process, or non-countable continuous set and we have a continuous-time stochastic process. Any realization of X is named a sample path, which can be discrete or continuous. A family is another description of an indexed collection, often used of a family of sets. In contrast to a set of elements, a family can contain an element more than once.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mathematically, the stochastic process can be described as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Predicted Target=<i>F</i>0<i>+B</i>1<i>*T</i>1(<i>X</i>)+<i>B</i>2*<i>T</i>2(<i>X</i>)+ . . . +<i>BM*TM</i>(<i>X</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where F<b>0</b> is the starting value for the series (the median target value for a regression model), X is a vector of “pseudo-residual” values remaining at this point in the series, T<b>1</b>(X), T<b>2</b>(X) are trees fitted to the pseudo-residuals and B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, etc. are coefficients of the tree node predicted values that are computed by the stochastic algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Graphically, a stochastic model can be represented like this:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002">
<img id="EMI-C00002" he="5.08mm" wi="37.76mm" file="US07296734-20071120-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first tree is fitted to the data. The residuals (error values) from the first tree are then fed into the second tree which attempts to reduce the error. This process is repeated through a chain of successive trees. The final predicted value is formed by adding the weighted contribution of each tree.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A further significant aspect of the invention of the management reports that shows the detail of each predictive segment, and the event probability.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the customer information file (<b>1</b>), and item processing/Check 21 files (<b>2</b>) reside in secure bank data processing center (<b>3</b>). The data processing center can be in the bank facility, or at a third party remote data processing center. The external network servers (<b>4</b>) that contain the invention reside on the bank premises. The extraction process is handled at the data processing center by putting the required datasets in either a comma-separated-values format, a meta-transport library, or through a XML query routine preformed by the external network server on the CIF database.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first step in the extraction sequence is to retrieve the demand deposit account (<b>5</b>) files required to calculate the wallet cash predictor (<b>6</b>). The next step is to extract the demand deposit account (DDA) fields required to calculate remaining cash predictor used by the invention, comprising, debit card amount processed by the DDA (<b>8</b>), household expense processed by the DDA (<b>9</b>), the DDA bank charges (<b>10</b>), and personal information (<b>11</b>) residing in the DDA.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">From the time deposit account fields (<b>12</b>) stored in the CIF database, the following fields are extracted, the time deposit amount (<b>13</b>), the interest earned monthly (<b>14</b>), the interest payment date (<b>14</b>), the maturity date of the time deposit (<b>15</b>), and personal information (<b>16</b>) residing in the time deposit account. The final extraction from the CIF database is the loan account fields (<b>17</b>), that include, the loan amount (<b>18</b>), the loan payment amount (<b>19</b>), the loan payment date (<b>19</b>), the loan maturity date (<b>20</b>), the personal information (<b>21</b>) residing in the loan account.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To complete the establishment of the cash predictors, the cash transaction activity occurring through the debit card (<b>22</b>) and credit card (<b>23</b>) held by the DDA holder, is extracted from the merchant service provider (<b>24</b>). The debit card transaction activity is sorting and grouped by merchant name, merchant usage location, total amount of the debit card purchases, and the total number of transaction that generate the total debit card purchases. The debit card purchases and number of transactions become part of the cash predictor array.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The final step in building the predictive information array for the invention is the capturing of the demographic data for each DDA holder. This data become the demographic predictor for the invention. The DDA holder's demographic data is extracted for the CIF database, third party external databases (<b>25</b>), and the merchant name and location from the debit and credit card transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At this point in the invention process, the cash predictors and demographic predictors are converted to standardized normalized predictor values (<b>26</b>). An illustration is converting the age of a DDA holder from a value of 42 to a normalized value of 0.42, or converting the income of a DDA holder from a value of $65,000 to a normalized value of 0.65. Tied to this normalization process handled by the invention, is the generation of the weighted variable (<b>27</b>) that correspond to the normalized predictive value. This process is handled by executing the decision tree and stochastic model (<b>28</b>) for each previous months of captured cash transaction activity. The output of this sequential process generates the weighing variable to be used to forecast the DDA predictive behavior segments based on the bank (<b>29</b>) or retail (<b>30</b>) target variables defined by the bank. Table below illustrate the weighted variable generated by this methodology.</p>
