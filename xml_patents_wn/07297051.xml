<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to clean grain conveying and tailings conveying in an agricultural combine, and more particularly, to a system which utilizes a common drive and conveyor apparatus for conveying of both clean grain and tailings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Agricultural combines typically have a rotary threshing or separating system for separating grain from larger elements of harvested crops, such as straw, stalks and the like. The grain and smaller elements of crop material, which can include, for instance, pod or cob fragments, typically fall from the separating system directly onto a vibratory cleaning system disposed therebelow, or, onto one or more conveyors for conveyance to the cleaning system. Reference Van Buskirk, U.S. Pat. No. 3,537,460 issued to International Harvester Company; and also Hall et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,884,994 issued to Deere and Company, both of which illustrate well known internal combine conveyor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The cleaning system typically includes sieves or shoes which are reciprocally moved, usually in the fore and aft directions, for cleaning or sifting the grain from tailings and material other than grain (MOG). Clean grain falling through the sieves drops onto one or more clean grain pans disposed therebelow, which pan or pans are typically inclined downwardly toward a sidewardly extending clean grain auger conveyor. The clean grain auger conveyor receives the clean grain and delivers it to an elevator which carries the clean grain up to a clean grain tank.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the vibration of the sieves, air is blown upwardly and rearwardly therethrough, so as to carry lighter elements of the MOG, or chaff, away. Heavier elements and tailings too large to fall through the sieves and too heavy to be blown away are carried by the vibrations rearwardly along the surfaces of the sieves so as to fall over the rear edges thereof, onto a tailings pan located below the rear edges. The tailings pan is located below the clean grain pan and is similarly inclined downwardly and forwardly, and extends to a sidewardly extending tailings auger conveyor, which carries the tailings to a tailings return conveyor operable for carrying the tailings upwardly, back to the cleaning or separating system of the combine, for reprocessing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To facilitate material flow along the clean grain pan and the tailings pan, in some combine models, those pans are connected to at least one of the sieves, so as to be correspondingly vibrated therewith. A problem that has arisen, however, with this arrangement, is that it is a burden on the drive which vibrates this assembly, so as to cause premature wear and failure of the drive. This arrangement is also costly and complex.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, what is sought is a conveyor arrangement for clean grain and tailings handling in a combine, which overcomes one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is disclosed is a clean grain and tailings conveying system for an agricultural combine, which overcomes one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a preferred aspect of the invention, what is disclosed is a clean grain and tailings conveying system for an agricultural combine, which includes a pan adapted to be fixedly mounted to a combine beneath a lowermost sieve of a cleaning system thereof. The pan includes a tailings receiving portion disposed below a peripheral edge portion of the sieve, for receiving tailings which fall downwardly from the edge portion during operation of the sieve, and a clean grain receiving portion disposed beneath the sieve for receiving clean grain which falls downwardly therethrough during the operation of the sieve. The pan includes at least one elongate collecting trough including a clean grain collecting portion which extends longitudinally through the clean grain receiving portion of the pan, and a tailings collecting portion which extends longitudinally through the tailings receiving portion, for separately receiving and collecting the clean grain and the tailings received by the pan. The system additionally includes a clean grain transfer conveyor in connection with the clean grain collecting portion of the collecting trough, and a tailings transfer conveyor in connection with the tailings collecting portion of the collecting trough. An elongate helical auger is supported in and extends longitudinally through the collecting trough, the auger being rotatable in a predetermined rotational direction about a longitudinally extending rotational axis, for simultaneously and separately conveying clean grain contained in the clean grain collecting portion of the collecting trough to the clean grain transfer conveyor, and tailings contained in the tailings collecting portion of the collecting trough to the tailings transfer conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an advantage of the conveying system of the invention, the pan, as well as the collecting conveyor and transfer conveyors, are supported separate of the cleaning system, and thus are not vibrated therewith, with the attendant disadvantages that can occur therefrom, as discussed above. Additionally, the clean grain and tailings processed by the conveying system of the invention are positively moved or conveyed, instead of relying on the past practice of using vibration and gravity for the movement thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As another preferred aspect of the invention, a plurality of the collecting troughs extend in side-by-side relation fore and aft along the pan, so as to effectively occupy substantially all of the area beneath the lowermost sieve of the cleaning system. And, as another preferred aspect of the invention, the clean grain transfer conveyor and the tailings transfer conveyor are disposed below and extend across the collecting troughs at spaced locations therealong. This enables the clean grain and tailings transfer conveyors to connect to a conventional clean grain elevator and tailings processing system of a combine. As still another preferred aspect of the invention, the pan can be inclined upwardly toward a location spaced beneath the peripheral edge portion of the sieve, so as to be capable of being accommodated in the lower region of a conventionally constructed combine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to still another preferred aspect of the invention, the auger extending through the collecting trough includes a helical flight extending therearound in a first rotational direction and disposed in the clean grain collecting portion of the collecting trough, and another helical flight extending around the auger in a second rotational direction and disposed in the tailings collecting portion of the collecting trough, such that when the auger is rotated, clean grain and tailings collected in the collecting trough will be conveyed in opposite directions toward the clean grain transfer conveyor and the tailings transfer conveyor, respectively. Further in this regard, additional auger flights can be provide in the respective clean grain and tailings portions, and directed in either rotational direction, as desired or required, for conveying clean grain and tailings to the transfer conveyors, for a particular application.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numbers refer to like parts, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an agricultural combine <b>10</b> is shown, including a clean grain and tailings conveying system <b>12</b> constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Combine <b>10</b> is of conventional, well known construction, including a feeder house <b>14</b> on a front end thereof, to which is connectable a header (not shown), operable for severing a swath of crops from a field as combine <b>10</b> is moved forwardly thereover, and conveying the severed crops to feeder house <b>14</b>. Feeder house <b>14</b> includes an internal conveying system (not shown), for conveying the crops upwardly and rearwardly into the body of combine <b>10</b>, into an inlet of a separating or threshing system <b>16</b> of the combine. Threshing system <b>16</b> generally includes a rotary rotor at least partially enclosed in a concave defining an arcuate space therebetween, and in which space the crop material is processed, for separating grain, and material other than grain (MOG), from straw, the straw being ejected rearwardly from the threshing system through the rear end of the combine for deposition on the field, in the well known manner. The grain and MOG will fall, and/or be conveyed, onto an upper sieve <b>18</b> of a cleaning system <b>20</b> located within the body of combine <b>10</b>, as denoted generally by arrows A, located below separating system <b>16</b>. Upper sieve <b>18</b> includes openings therethrough, which are sized for allowing the grain, and smaller elements of MOG, to fall therethrough onto a lower sieve <b>22</b> of cleaning system <b>20</b>. Lower sieve <b>22</b> will have smaller openings therethrough compared to upper sieve <b>18</b>, such that the sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> provide a progressive cleaning mechanism for separating clean grain from the MOG. The clean grain which falls through lower sieve <b>22</b> is desired to be collected and conveyed to a grain tank <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To facilitate the flow of the clean grain through sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, the sieves are vibrated or reciprocally moved, typically in a fore and aft direction, as denoted by arrow B. At the same time, air from a fan <b>26</b> is blown upwardly and rearwardly through sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>. The combination of this air flow and vibratory movement, results in the smaller grain being sifted through the sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, whereas lighter elements of the MOG, referred to also as chaff, are blown upwardly and rearwardly away from sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>. This chaff is either blown into an optional chaff spreader (not shown), which is operable for distributing the chaff over a desired swath of the field from which the crop is cut; or it is directed into an optional chopper (also not shown), for mixing with straw for chopping and distribution thereby; or it is directed downwardly onto the field through a rear opening of the combine, all in the well known manner. Larger elements of MOG which are unable to pass through upper sieve <b>18</b> are moved to the rear peripheral edge portion thereof by the vibratory movements thereof, and will fall therefrom, either onto the field therebelow, or chopped and/or spread. Typically, the sieves are adjusted, such that smaller elements of MOG, also referred to as tailings, which are still likely to contain grain, are allowed to pass through the upper sieve <b>18</b>, but not lower sieve <b>22</b>. On sieve <b>22</b>, the tailings are moved by the vibratory movements toward a rear peripheral edge portion <b>28</b> of sieve <b>22</b>, and fall thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, clean grain and tailings conveying system <b>12</b> of the invention is shown in association with various aspects of threshing system <b>16</b> and cleaning system <b>20</b>. More particularly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> are illustrated as being suspended from a structural frame <b>30</b> of combine <b>10</b> by pivoting support arms <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, respectively, for the reciprocal fore and aft movement, as denoted by arrow B, as effected by a suitable drive mechanism (not shown), in the well known manner. Clean grain and tailings conveying system <b>12</b>, in contrast, is illustrated as being fixedly connected or mounted to structural frame <b>30</b>, below lower sieve <b>22</b>, by brackets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, so as to be immovable relative to structural frame <b>30</b>. This is advantageous, as it eliminates the additional loading on cleaning system <b>20</b>, including on support arms <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and the drive mechanism therefor, which, as pointed out above, has been found to be a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> best illustrate the construction and operation of clean grain and tailings conveying system <b>12</b> of the invention. Conveying system <b>12</b> generally includes a pan <b>40</b> which is fixedly mounted to structural frame <b>30</b> by brackets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, so as to be located directly beneath lower sieve <b>22</b> of cleaning system <b>20</b>, including beneath peripheral edge portion <b>28</b> of lower sieve <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Pan <b>40</b> preferably includes a plurality or array of side-by-side elongate collecting troughs <b>42</b>, extending across the width of pan <b>40</b>, between opposite side edges <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> thereof, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Collecting troughs <b>42</b> preferably extend in the fore and aft direction, between a forward edge <b>48</b> of pan <b>40</b>, and a rear edge <b>50</b>. Each collecting trough <b>42</b> has a clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b>, located beneath those regions of lower sieve <b>22</b> through which clean grain is expected to fall, and a tailings receiving portion <b>54</b>, positioned directly beneath peripheral edge portion <b>28</b> of lower sieve <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> has an overall fore and aft extent, denoted by arrow D, and tailings receiving portion <b>54</b> has an overall fore and aft extent denoted by arrow E. The extent of clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> is further subdivided into a forward clean grain receiving region, generally having a fore and aft extent denoted D<b>1</b>, and a rear clean grain receiving region, having an extent D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in operation, as grain and MOG is flowing downwardly from threshing system <b>16</b> onto upper sieve <b>18</b>, denoted by arrows A, that sieve, and lower sieve <b>22</b>, are being reciprocally moved, as denoted by arrow B. Simultaneously, fan <b>26</b> is operated to generate upward and rearward air flows, denoted by arrows C, which blow through the openings through sieves <b>18</b> and <b>22</b>, to carry chaff rearwardly, away from cleaning system <b>20</b>, as denoted by arrow F. At the same time, tailings are allowed to pass through the openings of upper sieve <b>18</b>, but not those of lower sieve <b>22</b>. The tailings are moved by vibration rearwardly along the surface of lower sieve <b>22</b>, until they reach peripheral edge portion <b>28</b>, which is the rear edge of sieve <b>22</b>, where they fall therefrom, as denoted by arrow G. The tailings, denoted by arrow G, will fall onto tailings receiving portion <b>54</b> of pan <b>40</b>, which is located directly below edge portion <b>28</b>. Clean grain will be allowed to pass through lower sieve <b>22</b>, as denoted by arrows H, so as to fall onto clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> of pan <b>40</b>. Some of the clean grain will typically fall onto clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> in the forward region D<b>1</b>, and some will fall in the rear region D<b>2</b>. Here, it should be noted that a deflector shield <b>56</b> is disposed beneath the rear end portion of sieve <b>22</b>, to deflect clean grain which falls therethrough forwardly, so as to fall onto clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> of pan <b>40</b>, as opposed to tailings receiving portion <b>54</b> located below the rear end.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Pan <b>40</b> additionally preferably forms and includes a clean grain transfer conveyor trough <b>58</b> disposed below and in connection with clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b>, and a tailings transfer conveyor trough <b>60</b> disposed below and in connection with tailings receiving portion <b>54</b>. An elongate, helical auger <b>62</b> is supported in each collecting trough <b>42</b>, so as to extend longitudinally in the fore and aft direction therealong, continuously through both the clean grain receiving portion <b>52</b> and the tailings receiving portion <b>54</b>. Each auger <b>62</b> includes a first helical auger flight <b>64</b> extending in a first predetermined direction therearound through the forward clean grain receiving portion D<b>1</b> of pan <b>42</b>; and a second helical auger flight <b>66</b> extending in a second rotational direction therearound, opposite the first rotational direction, through the region D<b>2</b>, and through the tailings receiving portion <b>54</b>. Each auger <b>62</b> is connected to a drive mechanism operable for rotating it, here the mechanism being illustrated as including a bevel gear <b>70</b> on the rear end of auger <b>62</b>, which gear is enmeshed with a bevel gear <b>72</b> on a drive shaft <b>74</b> which extends sidewardly across the rear end of pan <b>40</b>, so as to jointly rotate augers <b>62</b>. Drive shaft <b>74</b> can be rotated by any suitable drive, such as, but not limited to, a belt, chain or shaft, in connection with a power plant of combine <b>10</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When augers <b>62</b> are rotated in a predetermined rotational direction, flights <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> will convey clean grain and tailings separately and simultaneously along collecting troughs <b>42</b>, and into clean grain transfer conveyor trough <b>58</b>, and tailings transfer conveyor trough <b>60</b>, as illustrated by arrows J and K, respectively. Clean grain transfer conveyor trough <b>58</b> contains a helical auger <b>76</b>, and tailings transfer conveyor trough <b>60</b> contains an auger <b>78</b>, which augers are rotatable in the conventional manner using suitable drives (not shown) for conveying the clean grain and tailings to a clean grain elevator (not shown) and a tailings return system (also not shown), as illustrated by arrows L and M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the well known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As a result of the clean grain and tailings conveying system of the invention as represented by the embodiment <b>12</b>, stresses on the support structure for the cleaning system and on the cleaning system itself, can be significantly reduced. And, clean grain and tailings generated by a cleaning system can be more positively distributed, respectively, to the clean grain tank and tailings return system, or other locations, efficiently, and effectively, which may provide increased throughput rates compared to use of gravity and vibration alone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the present invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that additions, deletions, substitutions, modifications and improvements can be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
