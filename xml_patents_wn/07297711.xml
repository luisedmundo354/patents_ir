<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotenergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, which originate in the central nervous system. These include diseases and conditions related to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotonergic Neuronal Systems, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. (1982), 221-247; Boullin D. J., Serotonin in Mental abnormalities (1978), 1, 316; Barchas J. et. al., Serotonin and Behavior (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotoriergic systems. Particularly, preferred are the compounds which have receptor specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al., The peripheral actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (1989), 246; Saxena P. R. et. al., Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990), supplement 7, 15).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HT<sub>1-7</sub>) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35 and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma et al, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-327 and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol., 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18, 1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that compounds that antagonize the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0168">Different polymorphs may be prepared by crystallization of compounds of general formula (I) under different conditions such as different solvents or solvent mixtures in varying proportions for recrystallization, various ways of crystallization such as slow cooling, fast cooling or a very fast cooling or a gradual cooling during crystallization. Different polymorphs may also be obtained by heating the compound, melting the compound and solidification by gradual or fast cooling, heating or melting under vacuum or under inert atmosphere and cooling under either vacuum or inert atmosphere. The various polymorphs may be identified by either one or more of the following techniques such as differential scanning calorimeter, powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, solid probe NMR spectroscopy and thermal microscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0169">Another aspect of the present invention comprises of a pharmaceutical composition, containing at least one of the compounds of the general formula (I), their derivatives, their analogs, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their geometric forms, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof as an active ingredient, together with pharmaceutically employed carriers, auxiliaries and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0170">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parental (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0171">The dose of the active compounds can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration, age and weight of patient, nature and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general formula (I) refers to the aforementioned factors.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0172">For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0173">For buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0174">The active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0175">The active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0176">For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0177">A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0178">Aerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or “puff” of aerosol contains 20 μg to 1000 μg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 μg to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.</p>
