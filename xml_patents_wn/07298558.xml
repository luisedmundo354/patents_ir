<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to color filters. More particularly, this invention relates to an electronically adjustable color filter that selectively combines filtered elements of light to create color light.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Color lighting systems are found in a variety of entertainment facilities, to include theaters, auditoriums, concert halls and stadiums. Regardless the size of the venue, in almost all instances a color lighting system is required or desired. The quality of the entertainment provided is often dependent, in part, on the quality of the color lighting system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aside from professional and amateur entertainment venues, theme parks and other such attractions use color light to enhance the experience of their customers. Private and public facilities, such as churches and museums, also have a need for variable color lighting. Further, sales oriented facilities and events, to include shopping malls and trade shows, rely on color lighting to help market products. Also, there are many scientific/engineering applications where discriminating color light is important. It is simply a fact of life that color lighting is part of almost every person's daily routine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, color light systems include a broad band, white light source, the output of which must be filtered to produce the desired color(s) of light. Often, the broadband light is unpolarized, and a portion of the light is reflected (“thrown away”) in a first, polarizing step. The loss of 50% or more of the incoming light at the onset reduces the intensity of the generated light, as well as the variations in color that may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many instances, color filtering includes the use of “color wheels”. Generally speaking, color wheels rely on the movement (rotation or otherwise) of color filters into and out of optical alignment with a transmitted white light. In many instances, the color filters are dichroic filters, which is to say they filter (reflect or absorb) light within one wavelength band and pass through all remaining light. The filters may be glass, gelatin, or other transparent/semi-transparent materials. Often, the number of possible color combinations is limited by the number of color filters that can be mounted into the color wheel. Further, the clarity of colors is affected by filter movement, alignment, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Absorption is the most prevalent means for filtering colored light. Unfortunately, absorbed light can generate significant quantities of heat which must be dissipated by the lighting system. Operational heating also limits the optical power of a system, as there is a direct correlation between optical power and absorbed heat. System cooling requirements typically require active (e.g. fans) or passive (e.g. cooling fins) cooling subsystems. In addition to heating concerns, standard color wheel systems include multiple moving, mechanical components. The process of changing colors is distracting to the audience. Also, moving parts impede or limit the response time/speed of a system, as well as reduce system reliability. In most instances, the useful operational life of a system is severely limited by reliability issues.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Pixilated color lighting systems are yet another lighting option found in the prior art. Unlike color wheel systems which are subtractive (filtering) in nature, pixilated systems are additive. Stated differently, pixilated systems achieve desired color combinations by adding colors together at a level unresolved by the naked human eye. Red, green and blue pixels produce an image on a screen, or alternatively direct color light to a designated region. Fiber optics or other delivery methods carry the colored light from light sources to the pixilated surface. Although operationally cooler, and void of multiple moving parts, pixilated systems are not without their limitations. A ⅔ decrease in light intensity results from the use of a broadband while light source and red, green and blue pixel elements. To obtain red, green and blue light from the broadband white light, the light must pass through a matrix of red, green and blue absorptive “dots”. On each dot or pixel, two of the three colors (i.e. green and blue on a red dot) are absorbed. Therefore, by converting the broadband white light to red, green, and blue, ⅔ of the light is lost in the conversion. This loss precedes any further losses associated with transmitting and mixing the light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to needing color light, venues such as theaters, theme parks and trade shows often desire to shape the color light to create various images. The methods used, e.g. gobos or reflective display devices, are often times separate from the color lighting system. Integration, therefore, of the color lighting system and the imaging generating device can be cumbersome and inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hence, there is a need for a color filter device and color filter system that overcome one or more of the limitations discussed above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electronic combinational color filter devices and color filter system herein disclosed advance the art and overcome problems articulated above by providing electronically adjustable wave plates and dichroic reflective filter elements to selectively generate light having a desired color.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, and by way of example only, in one embodiment an electronic combinational color filter is provided including: a plurality of wave plates structured and arranged to alter a polarization state of incoming light; a first plurality of dichroic reflective filters, each filter optically aligned with a corresponding wave plate to reflect a first element of the incoming light having a predetermined wavelength; a second plurality of dichroic reflective filters, each filter optically aligned with a corresponding wave plate to reflect a second element of the incoming light having a predetermined wavelength; and a polarizing beam splitter/combiner, positioned to split the incoming light into the first element of light and the second element of light, and to combine light reflected from the first plurality of dichroic reflective filters and the second plurality of dichroic reflective filters, to generate color light.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Before proceeding with the detailed description, it should be noted that the present teaching is by way of example, not by limitation. The concepts herein are not limited to use or application with one specific type of electronic combinational color filter device in a specific environment. Thus, although the instrumentalities described herein are for the convenience of explanation, shown and described with respect to exemplary embodiments, the principles herein may be equally applied in other types of electronic combinational color filter devices in a variety of different settings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an electronic combinational color filter device <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure. Color filter device <b>100</b> is a multi-color device, which is to say it filters several colors, at varying levels, to create a desired transmitted or output color light <b>102</b>. It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, that color filter device <b>100</b>, as well as the electronic combinational color filter devices disclosed below, may be used to filter a single color. Further, device <b>100</b> may be used for polarization spectrum control, which may include polarization spectrum control as a function of color. The primary advantages of the electronic combinational color filter devices disclosed herein, which include maximum light efficiency/use of light, independent color control, thermal stability, etc., are recognized regardless the number of separate colors and polarizations addressed by the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> is positioned to receive light <b>106</b> from a light source (not shown). In one embodiment, light <b>106</b> is broadband, white light, however, light <b>106</b> may be any type of light to include laser light, etc. Light <b>106</b> is subsequently split into a two light elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> by polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>, each element having a known polarization state. Specifically, light <b>106</b> is split into “s” polarized light <b>108</b>, which is reflected by polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>, and “p” polarized light <b>110</b>, which is transmitted by polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown, a plurality of wave plates, of which wave plates <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> are exemplary, are optically aligned with light element <b>108</b>. The wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may be controlled to alter the polarization state of light element <b>108</b>, therefore the wave plates may be referred to as “tunable”. Wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> may be any of a type well known in the art, to include but not limited to electro-optically tunable wave plates and/or mechanically rotated crystalline wave plates. By altering the voltage applied to a wave plate (e.g. wave plate <b>112</b>) the polarization of element <b>108</b> may be altered.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Positioned adjacent to, and sequentially following, each wave plate <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> is a dichroic reflective filter, e.g. filters <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>. In general, dichroic reflective filters reflect light in a select wavelength band. In one embodiment, dichroic reflective filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b> are cholesteric films, which is to say they reflect light having a wavelength in a select wavelength band and a discrete polarization state (e.g. left-hand polarized). As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, color filter device <b>100</b> may include multiple filters to filter a variety of colors, for example blue, green and red. Additional dichroic reflective filters, such as a yellow or a cyan filter, may be included in color filter device <b>100</b>, or alternatively they may be substituted for the filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two or more “wave plate-dichroic reflective filter” pairs may be “stacked” or positioned such that each pair is optically aligned with, and contacting, at least one other pair. As is discussed in greater detail below, it is not required, however, that the wave plates and dichroic reflective filters be in contact to be effective. Optical alignment and coupling, which may include the use of optical mirrors to redirect light, is a relevant factor, as further amplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A second set of wave plates <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> are optically coupled with light element <b>110</b>. As discussed above, light element <b>110</b> has an initial polarization state different from that of element <b>108</b>, i.e. a “p” polarization. Similar to wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b>, wave plates <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> are structured and arranged to electronically alter the polarization state of light element <b>110</b>. Varying the voltage applied to one or more of the wave plates <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> will modify or alter the polarization state of element <b>110</b>. The degree to which the polarization state is altered, and the manner in which it is altered, depends on the type of wave plate and the voltage applied. As with wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b>, wave plates <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> may be any of a type well known in the art, to include but not limited to, twisted nematic, dual frequency, cholesteric, and mechanically rotated crystal quartz wave plates</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Positioned adjacent to, and sequentially following, each wave plate <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> is a dichroic reflective filter, e.g. filters <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, dichroic reflective filters <b>130</b>-<b>134</b> are cholesteric films. As with filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b>, color filter device <b>100</b> may include multiple filters <b>130</b>-<b>134</b> addressing a variety of colors. In one embodiment, filters <b>130</b>-<b>134</b> address the same colors as filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b>. In yet another embodiment, one or more of the filters <b>130</b>-<b>134</b> address a color not addressed by filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, electronic combinational color filter device <b>100</b> receives light <b>106</b> from a light source (not shown) which may, or may not, be part of a color filter system. Polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> splits beam <b>106</b> into two elements, each element having a known polarization state, i.e. “s” and “p” polarization. In particular, a percentage of light <b>106</b> is split into light element <b>108</b>, wherein light element <b>108</b> is “s” polarized. The remaining percentage of light <b>106</b> is transmitted as light element <b>110</b>, wherein light element <b>110</b> is “p” polarized.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As light element <b>108</b> strikes wave plate <b>112</b>, a voltage is applied to wave plate <b>112</b>. The polarization state of light element <b>108</b> is subsequently altered. The degree of alteration depends on the voltage applied to wave plate <b>112</b>. In this way, wave plate <b>112</b> controls the polarization state or states of light element <b>108</b>. For example, as “s” polarized light element <b>108</b> contacts wave plate <b>112</b>, some portion of the polarization state of light element <b>108</b> is altered. In particular, some portion of light element <b>108</b> may be converted to a right or left-hand polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Light element <b>108</b> subsequently passes through wave plate <b>112</b> and contacts dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b>. Dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b> is positioned to reflect that portion of light element <b>108</b> having a wavelength within a known wavelength band. The predetermined wavelength corresponds to the wavelength of a single color, which is a wavelength of light in the visible, NIR, MWIR, etc. ranges of the Electromagnetic Spectrum (the “EM Spectrum”). If, for example, dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b> is intended to filter and control the color red, the wavelength of concern would be in the range of approximately 622-780 nanometers. If the color to filter is blue, the wavelength would be in the range of approximately 455-492 nanometers, and if it is green, the wavelength would be approximately 492-577 nanometers. All other light of element <b>108</b>, i.e. light having a different wavelength, is transmitted through dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As one part of light element <b>108</b> reflects off of filter <b>118</b>, for example all “blue” light, the “handness” of the reflected light changes, e.g. from right-hand polarized to left-hand polarized. As the reflected blue light, which is part of reflected light <b>123</b>, passes back through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>, that portion which is “p” polarized is transmitted through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>. The light becomes part of the color light <b>102</b> ultimately transmitted by color filter device <b>100</b>. All “s” polarized light is reflected in polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b>, and becomes part of the light <b>136</b> discarded by the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After passing through dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b>, the remaining light of element <b>108</b> subsequently passes through wave plate <b>114</b>. Similar to wave plate <b>112</b>, the polarization state of the light passing through wave plate <b>114</b> is altered. In this manner, wave plate <b>114</b> acts to control the polarization state(s) of the remaining light of light element <b>108</b>. Once again, the percentage of light altered depends upon the voltage applied to wave plate <b>114</b>. The remaining light of light element <b>108</b> then contacts dichroic reflective filter <b>120</b>, and that portion of light element <b>108</b> having a predetermined wavelength, is reflected. In this instance, dichroic reflective filter <b>120</b> operates to reflect light having a different wavelength of the EM spectrum than the light reflected by dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b>, for example green light. The polarization state of the reflected green light is “flipped” and all “p” polarized green light passing back through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> is transmitted, while all “s” polarized green light is reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The process of first passing a remaining portion of light of element <b>108</b> through a wave plate <b>116</b> to alter the polarization state, and then reflecting a portion of the modified light element <b>108</b> off a dichroic reflective filter <b>122</b>, repeats for a third time. The predetermined operational wavelength of dichroic reflective filter <b>122</b> is different than the wavelength of filter <b>118</b> and filter <b>120</b>, which is to say dichroic reflective filter <b>122</b> reflects light of a different color, for example the color red. As with the blue and the green light, the “red” portion of reflected light <b>123</b> having a “p” polarization state is transmitted and becomes part of the output light <b>102</b>. All “s” polarized light is reflected in the polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> to become part of discarded light <b>136</b>. The light reflected by dichroic reflective filters <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> combines with other light, as described in detail below, to form the transmitted, output light <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Concurrent with the selective modification of light element <b>108</b>, light element <b>110</b> travels along a different path toward a series of “wave plate-dichroic reflective filter” pairs. Initially, light element <b>110</b> is “p” polarized, however, the polarization state of the light element <b>110</b> changes in the operation of device <b>100</b>. The sequencing of the wave plates <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, and the dichroic reflective filters <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, optically aligned with light element <b>110</b> is substantially the same as that described for light element <b>108</b>. Stated differently, in at least one embodiment, dichroic reflective filter <b>130</b> operates to reflect light in the same wavelength band as dichroic reflective filter <b>118</b>. Similarly, dichroic reflective filters <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> reflect light in the same wavelength bands as dichroic reflective filters <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The reflected color light <b>135</b> of light element <b>110</b> ultimately consists of “s” and “p” polarized blue, green and red light. The “p” polarized light exits the polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> in the direction of the source of light <b>106</b>, wherein it becomes part of the light <b>136</b> discarded by the system and converted to heat. The “s” polarized light is reflected to become part of the color light <b>102</b> transmitted from electronic combinational color filter device <b>100</b>. The color of light <b>102</b> may be constantly modified by altering the voltages applied to various wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> and <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>. Furthermore, by separately controlling wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> and <b>124</b>-<b>128</b>, the output light <b>102</b> can be made to have a controllable polarization state, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to controlling the color of output light <b>102</b>, the polarization can be tailored as well. For example, by controlling wave plates <b>112</b>-<b>116</b> such that all of the reflected light <b>123</b> is “p” polarized, all of light <b>123</b> passes through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> and becomes part of output light <b>102</b>. Further, by controlling wave plates <b>124</b>-<b>128</b> such that all of reflected light <b>135</b> is “p” polarized, all of light <b>135</b> passes through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>104</b> as part of discarded light <b>136</b>. In this manner, output light <b>102</b> can be tailored to have only a “p” polarization. Alternatively, light <b>102</b> may be tailored to only have a “s” polarization state.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Considering this embodiment further, it is possible, for example, to tailor individual colors such that all of the blue light in output light <b>102</b> is “p” polarized, all of the red light in output light <b>102</b> is “s” polarized, and the green light in output light <b>102</b> is a combination of “s” and “p” polarized light. Depending on the integration of color filter device <b>100</b> with other systems and subsystems, this tailoring of color and polarization can be advantageous. It can be appreciated that the examples presented herein are for illustration purposes only, and other combinations of color and/or color-based polarization may be achieved by device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In yet another embodiment, filters <b>118</b>-<b>122</b> and <b>130</b>-<b>134</b> may be cholesteric filters or films. In this embodiment, all light within a specific wavelength band (e.g. all “red” light), having a predetermined polarization state (e.g. right-hand polarized), will be reflected by the cholesteric filters corresponding to that wavelength band (e.g. filters <b>122</b> and <b>134</b> for the color red). As shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, all other light in the wavelength band of interest passes through color filter device <b>104</b>. The same may be said for the “blue” and “green” color light, such that the light exiting device <b>104</b>, along the same paths as light elements <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> (light <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> respectively), is a combination of all three colors. In this embodiment, the light <b>136</b> discarded by device <b>100</b> and converted into heat may therefore be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, yet another embodiment of the present disclosure is depicted. Electronic combinational color filter device <b>200</b> includes a polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b> optically aligned with incoming light <b>204</b>. In at least one embodiment, light <b>204</b> is broadband, white light. Light <b>204</b> is subsequently split into two light elements <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, each having a known polarization state, i.e. a “s” polarization and a “p” polarization, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optically aligned with light element <b>206</b> is a plurality of dichroic reflective filters <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>. Likewise, a plurality of dichroic reflective filters <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> are optically aligned with light element <b>208</b>. As shown, dichroic reflective filters <b>216</b>-<b>220</b> are also oriented substantially parallel to dichroic reflective filters <b>210</b>-<b>214</b>. Of note, in the embodiment presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sequencing of dichroic reflective filters <b>210</b>-<b>214</b> is identical to that of dichroic reflective filters <b>216</b>-<b>220</b> respectively. For example, if the dichroic reflective filter <b>210</b>, aligned with light element <b>206</b>, reflects blue light (light having a wavelength in the band of approximately 455-492 nanometers), then the dichroic reflective filter <b>216</b>, aligned with light element <b>208</b>, will also reflect light in this wavelength band. Further, if dichroic reflective filter <b>212</b> reflects light falling within the wavelength band of 492-577 nanometers (green light), dichroic reflective filter <b>218</b> will also operate to reflect green light. Finally, if dichroic reflective filter <b>214</b> (aligned with light element <b>206</b>) reflects red light (622-780 nanometers), dichroic reflective filter <b>220</b> (aligned with light element <b>208</b>) also reflects red light.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an electronically controllable wave plate, e.g. wave plate <b>222</b>, is optically coupled to a “pair” of dichroic reflective filters operating over a specified wavelength band (e.g filters <b>210</b> and <b>216</b> which operate to reflect blue light). In addition to wave plate <b>222</b>, wave plate <b>224</b> is optically coupled to filters <b>212</b> and <b>218</b>, and wave plate <b>226</b> is optically coupled to filters <b>214</b> and <b>220</b>. In this manner, the wave plates <b>222</b>-<b>226</b> are structured and arranged to alter the polarization state of both the first element of light <b>206</b> and the second element of light <b>208</b>. Each dichroic reflective filter <b>210</b>-<b>220</b> also operates on both elements of light <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, to reflect all or some portion of each element <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> having a wavelength corresponding to the operational wavelength band of a given filter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular, in the operation of color filter device <b>200</b>, incoming light <b>204</b> is split by polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b> into the first element of light <b>206</b> having a “s” polarization, and the second element of light <b>208</b> having a “p” polarization. The first element of light <b>206</b> is reflected toward a first dichroic reflective filter <b>210</b>, wherein light having a wavelength within a specified wavelength band (e.g. approximately 455-492 nanometers or “blue” light) is reflected toward wave plate <b>222</b>. All other light of element <b>206</b> passes through filter <b>210</b>. The reflected blue light <b>228</b> strikes and passes through wave plate <b>222</b>. In doing so, the polarization state of all or a portion of light <b>228</b> is altered or modified. All of light <b>228</b> reflects off a mirror <b>230</b> positioned on the back side of wave plate <b>222</b>, and is directed toward dichroic reflective filter <b>216</b>. Dichroic reflective filter <b>216</b> also reflects light having a wavelength within a specified wavelength band (e.g. a wavelength in the wave band corresponding to blue light). The reflected light <b>232</b> is directed toward polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>, wherein that portion of light <b>232</b> having a “s” polarization is reflected to become part of output light <b>234</b>. The portion of light <b>232</b> which is “p” polarized, by virtue of the alteration induced by wave plate <b>222</b>, transmits through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The remaining light <b>236</b>, passing through dichroic reflective filter <b>210</b>, contacts a second dichroic reflective filter <b>212</b>, wherein light having a wavelength in the wave band 492-577 nanometers (“green” light) is reflected toward a second wave plate <b>224</b>. Reflected green light <b>238</b> strikes and passes through wave plate <b>224</b>. In doing so, the polarization state of light <b>238</b> is altered or modified. All of light <b>238</b> reflects off a mirror <b>240</b> positioned on the back side of wave plate <b>224</b>, and is directed toward dichroic reflective filter <b>218</b>. Dichroic reflective filter <b>218</b> reflects light having a wavelength within a specified wavelength band (e.g. green light). The reflected light <b>242</b> is directed toward polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>, wherein that portion of light <b>242</b> having a “s” polarization is reflected to become part of output light <b>234</b>. The portion of light <b>242</b> which is “p” polarized, by virtue of the alteration induced by wave plate <b>224</b>, transmits through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The process disclosed above repeats for a third time. The remaining light <b>244</b>, passing through dichroic reflective filter <b>212</b>, contacts a third dichroic reflective filter <b>214</b>, wherein light having a wavelength in the wave band of approximately 622-780 nanometers, i.e. “red” light, is reflected toward a third wave plate <b>226</b>. Reflected red light <b>246</b> strikes and passes through wave plate <b>226</b>. In doing so, the polarization state of light <b>246</b> is altered or modified. All of light <b>246</b> reflects off a mirror <b>248</b> positioned on the back side of wave plate <b>226</b>, and is directed toward dichroic reflective filter <b>220</b>. Dichroic reflective filter <b>220</b> reflects light having a wavelength within a specified wavelength band (e.g. red light). The reflected light <b>250</b> is directed toward polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>, wherein that portion of light <b>250</b> having a “s” polarization is reflected to become part of output light <b>234</b>. The portion of light <b>250</b> which is “p” polarized, by virtue of the alteration induced by wave plate <b>226</b>, transmits through polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A similar process occurs with light element <b>208</b>.

Similarly, the “green” light portion <b>256</b> of light element <b>208</b> is reflected by dichroic reflective filters <b>218</b> and <b>212</b>, as well as altered by wave plate <b>224</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a result of the alteration of light elements <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, output light <b>234</b> is a combination of both “s” and “p” polarized light, The discarded light <b>251</b> is also a combination of both polarization states, and is typically directed back toward the light source (not shown), wherein light <b>251</b> is ultimately converted to heat that must be dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can be appreciated that the colors of blue, green and red disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are exemplary.

It can further be appreciated that each wave plate <b>222</b>-<b>226</b> may be individually addressed with a desired voltage. In this way, the amount of blue, green and red light resulting from light element <b>206</b>, as well as the amount of color light resulting from light element <b>208</b>, may be individually tailored and controlled for each color.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is presented. As such, the operation of electronic combinational color filter device <b>300</b> is similar to that of color filter device <b>200</b> as well. As shown, color filter device <b>300</b> includes a plurality of wave plates, i.e. wave plates <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>. Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however, each wave plate <b>302</b>-<b>306</b> is coupled to the same, single mirror <b>308</b> positioned to reflect all of the light exiting from all wave plates <b>302</b>-<b>306</b> (e.g. blue light <b>310</b>), as well as to reflect all light toward all wave plates <b>302</b>-<b>306</b> (e.g. blue light <b>312</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, a set <b>314</b> of dichroic reflective filters includes a “blue” light filter <b>316</b>, a “green” light filter <b>318</b>, and a “red” light filter <b>320</b>. Similarly, a set <b>322</b> of dichroic reflective filters includes filters for the colors blue (filter <b>324</b>), green (filter <b>326</b>) and red (filter <b>328</b>). In at least one embodiment, the dichroic reflective filters <b>316</b>-<b>320</b> and <b>324</b>-<b>328</b> are twisted nematic cells or films. In yet another embodiment, the filters <b>316</b>-<b>320</b> and <b>324</b>-<b>328</b> are cholesteric filters. A polarizing beam splitter/combiner <b>330</b> is positioned to receive incoming light <b>332</b>, which may be a broadband light, and split the light <b>332</b> into a first element <b>334</b> and a second element <b>336</b>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, element <b>334</b> is “s” polarized, and element <b>336</b> is “p” polarized.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Operationally, color filter device <b>300</b> functions in much the same way as color filter device <b>200</b>. Blue, green and red light from two light elements (<b>334</b> and <b>336</b>) is reflected by dichroic reflective filters (<b>316</b>-<b>320</b> and <b>324</b>-<b>328</b> respectively), altered by wave plates (<b>302</b>-<b>306</b>), reflected by a mirror (<b>308</b>), and reflected once again by the dichroic reflective filters (<b>324</b>-<b>328</b> and <b>316</b>-<b>320</b> respectively). As the altered light (e.g. blue light <b>338</b> and blue light <b>340</b>) enters polarizing beam splitter <b>330</b>, that portion of each color of altered light which is “s” polarized is reflected, and that portion which is “p” polarized is transmitted. As a result of the operation of color filter device <b>300</b>, color light <b>342</b>, transmitted by color filter device <b>300</b>, is a controlled combination of “s” and “p” polarizations, as well as a combination of blue, green and red light. Discarded light <b>344</b> is typically directed back toward the light source (not shown). As with color filter device <b>200</b>, wave plates <b>302</b>-<b>306</b> are driven by an applied voltage to ultimately control the amount of blue, green, and red light combined to make color light <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In at least one embodiment, filters <b>316</b>-<b>320</b> and <b>324</b>-<b>328</b> may be cholesteric filters.

System <b>400</b> may include a light source <b>402</b>. An electronic combinational color filter device <b>404</b> is optically aligned with light source <b>402</b>. Color filter device <b>404</b> may be any of several embodiments, the specific details of which are encompassed in the present disclosure and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. A chromaticity monitor or color detector <b>406</b> is oriented to measure the chromaticity of a light <b>408</b> ultimately transmitted by system <b>400</b>. The chromaticity of the transmitted light <b>408</b> is communicated to a controller <b>410</b>, via an electrical wire <b>412</b>, for further processing and use. Alternatively, chromaticity monitor <b>406</b> may simply record the characteristics of the transmitted light <b>408</b>, and communicate the recorded data to controller <b>410</b>, wherein the chromaticity of light <b>408</b> can be calculated. Of note, chromaticity monitor <b>406</b> may be employed with any or all of the embodiments disclosed in the present application. Also, chromaticity monitor <b>406</b> may include a polarizing beam splitter and two color sensors, such that color monitoring is also accomplished on the basis of polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Chromaticity data is used to determine what adjustments, if any, should be made to the wave plates of the color filter device <b>404</b> by controller <b>410</b>. Adjustments, in the form of varying voltages selectively applied to the wave plates, are used to tune or modify the color of transmitted light <b>408</b>. The electrical current applied to the wave plates is carried via electrical lines, e.g. lines <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>. All of the components (e.g. light source <b>402</b>, color filter <b>404</b>, etc.) may be contained within a housing <b>418</b>. Alternatively, depending on the operational use of system <b>400</b>, some components may be mounted outside housing <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A color lighting system, such as system <b>400</b>, may include one or more spatial light modulators for creating a tailored color image. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, one such modulator is a gobo <b>500</b>. As shown in FIG. <b>5</b>., the gobo <b>500</b> may be used to block a portion (not shown) of transmitted color light <b>502</b>, while allowing other portions (<b>504</b>, <b>506</b> and <b>508</b>) of color light <b>502</b> to pass through. The creative tailoring of gobo <b>500</b> allows color images having structure and form to be transmitted by system <b>400</b>. It can be appreciated that gobo <b>500</b> is exemplary of gobo devices well known in the art, and that the specific shape, structure and design of a gobo will vary with each desired image.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Yet another modulator for creating a tailored color image having structure and/or shape is a reflective display device <b>600</b>. A reflective display device, such as device <b>600</b>, is a pixilated device. Each pixel, e.g. pixel <b>602</b>, can either reflect or not reflect light striking the pixel <b>602</b>, depending on an electronic signal sent to the pixel by a controller, e.g. controller <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The reflectivity of a pixel <b>602</b> may be constantly changed to vary the image ultimately displayed by the reflective display device <b>600</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, certain pixels may reflect light <b>604</b> transmitted by a electronic combinational color filter device <b>606</b>, e.g. reflected light <b>608</b> and <b>610</b>, while the reflectivity of other pixels (e.g. pixel <b>602</b>) is set to zero. In one embodiment, reflective display device <b>600</b> is a digital light processor having a plurality of mirrored pixels. In at least one other embodiment, reflective display device <b>600</b> includes a plurality of “liquid crystal-on-silicon” pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A reflective display device <b>600</b> may, therefore, actively create any color image that can be created using a gobo. Further, device <b>600</b> can quickly and efficiently change the projected image without having to physically (mechanically) move components, i.e. the gobo. The gobo and reflective display device presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> respectively, are simplified for understanding. It can be appreciated that actual modulators may be more complex, with many more smaller pixels, more intricate details, etc.</p>
