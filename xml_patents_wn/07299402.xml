<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of reverse link power control for a reverse packet data channel in a wireless communication system allows a mobile station to autonomously change its data transmission rate. The mobile station transmits packet data over a reverse packet data channel having a data rate variant transmit power level that varies based on a transmit data rate on the packet data channel. The mobile station further transmits control signals over a reverse control channel associated with the reverse packet data channel. The transmit power level of the reverse control channel is such that the transmit power level does not vary with the transmit data rate on the packet data channel. The radio base station measures the strength of the received signals on the reverse control channel, compares the measured strength to a power control set point, and generates a power control signal responsive to the comparison of the control signal to the power control set point.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Code division multiple access (CDMA) systems are interference-limited systems. Since all mobile stations operate at the same frequency, internal interference generated within the system plays a critical role in determining system capacity and voice quality. The transmit power from each mobile station is controlled to limit interference while maintaining desired performance objectives, e.g., bit error rate (BER), frame error rate (FER), capacity, dropped-call rate, coverage, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One technique used in CDMA systems to reduce interference is power control. Power control is used on the reverse link in CDMA systems to control the power of signals received at each base station from the mobile stations. The purpose of power control in conventional CDMA systems is to ensure that each mobile station served by a particular base station approximately provides the minimal required signal strength required to ensure its Quality of Service (QoS). In conventional CDMA systems, system capacity is maximized if the transmit power level of each mobile station is controlled so that its signals arrive at the base station receiver with the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In third generation (3G) CDMA systems that allow variable data rates, the received power of mobile stations operating at the same data rate should be the same, although the received power of mobile stations operating at different data rates may be different because higher data rates require higher transmission power to maintain signal quality standards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a mobile station moves within the network, the channel conditions change continuously due to fast and slow fading, shadowing, number of users, external interference, and other factors. Power control algorithms dynamically control the transmit power on the reverse link to maintain a minimum required SNR at the base station under all conditions. Both open loop and closed loop power control are used for power control on the reverse link. In open loop control, the mobile station monitors the received signal strength on the forward link and varies its transmit power inversely in proportion to the measured signal strength. However, fading sources in mobile radio systems require much faster power control than is possible with open loop control. Fast power control may therefore be provided by the closed loop power control mechanism. In closed loop power control, the base station measures the strength of the pilot signal from the mobile station, computes the SNR, and sends power control commands to the mobile station directing the mobile station to either increase or decrease its transmit power depending on the received SNR. The power control commands typically comprise power control bits (PCBs), which are sent at a rate of 800 bps. A bit value of “1” directs the mobile station to decrease its transmit power. A bit value of “0” directs the mobile station to increase its transmit power. In conventional CDMA systems, the traffic channels have a fixed power offset from the pilot channel, so controlling the power of the pilot channel effectively controls the transmit power of the traffic channels as well.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Revision D of the cdma2000 standard includes a high-speed reverse link traffic channel. Mobile stations may transmit at a variable rate on the reverse link traffic channel. The cdma2000 standard specifies the rates at which the mobile station may transmit. Associated with each rate level is a pilot reference level and power offset that varies depending on the data transmission rate to ensure that the received pilot strength is sufficient to support that data transmission rate. As described above, the inner loop power control mechanism for cdma2000 operates by maintaining the received SNR of the reverse pilot channel at some predetermined level, referred to herein as the power control set point. Thus, when the mobile station changes its data transmission rate, the base station needs to adjust the power control set point.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In systems where the base station controls and schedules the data transmission rate of the mobile station, the base station can account for the different pilot reference levels to perform inner loop power control. In this case, the mobile station negotiates with the base station so that the base station can select the appropriate data transmission rate for the mobile station based on the mobile station's desired data transmission rate and the reverse link load. Allowing the mobile station to autonomously select its data transmission rate on the reverse traffic channel would avoid the negotiation process between the base station and the mobile station. However, if the mobile station autonomously changes its data transmission rate such that a new pilot reference level is transmitted by the mobile station, the sudden change in the received strength of the pilot signal at the base station would disrupt the inner loop power control mechanism unless the base station was notified of the rate change in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has been proposed that the mobile station transmit a rate indication to the base station before it changes its data transmission rate so that the base station can account for differences in pilot signal levels at different rates. Such a proposal includes a complicated signaling scheme to ensure that the base station detects the rate indication before the mobile station transmits data frames at the new data transmission rate. However, the signaling required results in significant delays between the time that the mobile station selects a data transmission rate and the time that it is allowed to transmit at the selected rate. Given that channel conditions and the availability of communication resources change with time, the mobile station needs to select a data transmission rate conservatively to ensure that this system has sufficient communication resources when it starts transmitting at the selected rate. The need to be conservative in rate selection means that the system is not functioning as efficiently as possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention relates to a method of closed loop power control. Each mobile station transmitting on the reverse traffic channel transmits a reference signal used for power control on a data rate invariant overhead channel. The data rate invariant overhead channel may, for example, be a reverse packet data control channel in a CDMA system. The radio base station (RBS) compares the strength of the reference signal to a power control set point and generates a power control signal responsive to the comparison for transmission to the mobile station. The power control signal may comprise, for example, power control bits transmitted on a forward fundamental channel or a forward common power control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The overhead channel that serves as the power control reference may be encoded to enable detection of bit errors at the RBS. For example, the mobile station may encode the overhead channel with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code. The RBS may decode the overhead channel and determine a frame error rate associated with the overhead channel. The frame error rate may be used in an outer power control loop to adjust the power control set point for the inner power control loop.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the invention, a method of controlling a reverse link power of a mobile station in a wireless communication network comprises receiving a control signal from the mobile station that includes one or more codewords repeated at a desired power control rate, determining quality metrics corresponding to the repeated codewords, generating reverse link power control commands based on comparing the quality metrics to a power control set points, and transmitting the reverse link power control commands to the mobile station. The quality metrics may be correlation metrics obtained by comparing each repeated codeword to respective ones in a set of possible codewords.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, a mobile station may transmit a reverse control channel that is divided into a plurality of slots having a slot timing corresponding to a desired power control rate. The mobile station encodes first control information to derive a first codeword. The first codeword is repetitively transmitted in successive slots of a control frame. The mobile station may further transmit error detection bits generated on the first control information to enable detection of frame errors at the receiver. The mobile station may encode the error detection bits to obtain a second codeword having a number of symbols equal to the number of slots in a frame. The second codeword may be used to encode each frame by applying each code symbol of the second codeword to a corresponding slot.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The radio base station separately decodes each slot of the control frame and determines a power control metric for each slot. In one exemplary embodiment, the RBS coherently correlates each slot with a set of possible slot-level codewords to obtain a correlation metric for each codeword, and selects one of the correlation metrics as a power metric for inner loop power control. For example, the selected correlation metric may correspond to the maximum likelihood codeword. The error detection code allows the RBS to detect frame errors and to compute a frame error rate. The RBS may adjust a power control set point based on the frame error rate.</p>

The MCU <b>101</b> inserts signaling messages into the transmitted signals and extracts signaling messages from the received signals. MCU <b>101</b> acts on signaling messages received from the RBS <b>24</b> as set forth in the communication protocol. When the user enters commands via the keypad and display <b>191</b>, <b>192</b> and/or microphone <b>193</b> of the user interface <b>190</b>, the commands are passed to the MCU <b>101</b> for action.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A plurality of mobile stations <b>100</b> send packet data to the RBS <b>24</b> over a reverse link traffic channel, which in the exemplary embodiment described herein is a Reverse Packet Data Channel (R-PDCH). RBS <b>24</b> controls the transmit power level of the mobile stations <b>100</b> using closed loop power control. The closed loop power control mechanism includes an inner power control loop and an outer power control loop. In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, power measurements for inner loop power control are made on an overhead channel, such as the Reverse Packet Data Control Channel (R-PDCCH). In contrast, conventional systems make power measurements on the Reverse Pilot Channel (R-PICH). In the exemplary embodiment, the R-PICH is still used for channel estimation. In the exemplary embodiment, the transmit power of the mobile station <b>100</b> on the R-PDCCH is data rate invariant and serves as a power reference for all other reverse link channels. The transmit power on the R-PDCCH does not vary with the data transmission rate, but only in response to changes in channel conditions. Alternatively, the control channel transmit power varies in a known relationship with the transmit data rate of the reverse packet data channel. The transmit power of the mobile station <b>100</b> on the R-PICH and R-PDCH and other reverse link channels is determined relative to the R-PDCCH. The channel gains of the R-PDCH and R-PICH relative to the R-PDCCH may be fixed, or may vary depending on the data transmission rate of the mobile station <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inner power control loop adjusts the mobile station transmit power to maintain a signal quality metric associated with the R-PDCCH as close as possible to a targeted power control set point. The outer loop power control mechanism adjusts the power control set point for a given mobile station <b>100</b> depending on frame error rate (FER) or some other performance metric. As will be described in greater detail below, the R-PDCCH is protected by a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code and may also be used for outer loop power control.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To perform inner loop power control, the RBS <b>24</b> compares the signal quality metric to a power control set point. The RBS <b>24</b> transmits a power control bit (PCB) to the mobile station <b>100</b> depending on the outcome of the comparison. If the signal quality metric is above the power control set point, the RBS <b>24</b> transmits a “1.” Conversely, if the signal quality metric is below the power control set point, the RBS <b>24</b> transmits a “0.” A PCB having a value of “1” is interpreted by the mobile station <b>100</b> as a command to decrease its transmit power level by δ dB. Similarly, a PCB having a value of “0” is interpreted by the mobile station <b>100</b> as a command to increase its transmit power by δ dB. Thus, the mobile station <b>100</b> adjusts its transmit power up or down by δ dB responsive to each power control bit. In some embodiments, the power metric may be compared to upper and lower thresholds, and the RBS <b>24</b> may send a command to the mobile station <b>100</b> to hold its current transmit power if the power metric is between the upper and lower thresholds. The RBS <b>24</b> transmits power control bits (PCBs) to the mobile station <b>100</b> on a fundamental channel or, if there is no assigned fundamental channel, a forward common power control channel (F-CPCCH).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because the relationship between signal quality metric and frame error rate may be non-linear, the RBS <b>24</b> may adjust the power control set point depending on factors such as vehicle speed and channel conditions. In general, performance as measured by FER varies with changing vehicle speed. Thus, the outer power control loop at the RBS <b>24</b> periodically adjusts the set point to maintain the signal quality as measured by the FER at a desired target FER value. For outer loop power control, the RBS <b>24</b> measures the FER of the R-PDCH.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mobile stations <b>100</b> may autonomously change their data transmission rate on the R-PDCH depending on channel conditions. The permissible data transmission rates, referred to herein as rate levels, are specified by the standard. To support high data rates, the pilot reference level needs to be increased to improve channel estimation. Increasing the pilot reference level may be accomplished by increasing the mobile transmit power on the R-PICH or by transmitting on a reverse secondary pilot channel (R-SPICH). Unlike prior art systems, increasing the transmit power on the R-PICH does not disrupt inner loop power control because power measurements are made on the R-PDCCH. By using a data rate invariant control channel to perform inner loop power control, the power control set point will be the same for all rate levels and the mobile station <b>100</b> can change rate levels autonomously without disrupting the inner loop power control by the RBS <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the encoding of the R-PDCCH in one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The R-PDCCH frame in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is 10 ms in length and is divided into a plurality of power control slots. The slot timing corresponds to a desired power control rate. In one exemplary embodiment, the frame is divided into 8 power control slots and each power control slot is 1.25 ms in length. Thus, the RBS <b>24</b> power controls the mobile station <b>100</b> at a rate of 800 Hz. In a preferred embodiment, the frame length of the R-PDCCH is the same as the R-PDCH. Each slot carries a 24-bit codeword, such as a 24bit Walsh code, as shown at A. The slot-level codeword is repeated in each power control slot. The polarity of each power control slot is determined by a frame-level codeword equal in length to the number of power control slots in a frame as shown at B. The polarity of each power control slot forms an element of the frame-level codeword. The final frame is a composite of the repeated slot-level codeword and the frame-level codeword as shown at C.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates in more detail the structure of the exemplary R-PDCCH. The exemplary R-PDCCH frame carries control information needed to demodulate the corresponding R-PDCH frame transmitted during the same frame duration and information relating to rate increase requests. The control information comprises a Reverse Data Rate Indicator (R_RATE_IND) to specify the data rate and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for the R-PDCH, a Mobile Station Status Indicator (MS_STATUS_IND) to indicate when the mobile station <b>100</b> is capable and ready to transmit at a higher rate, and a Reverse Link ARQ Identifier Sequence Number (RAI_SN) to indicate when a new encoder packet transmission has begun.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A 16-ary code generator <b>200</b> maps the R_RATE-IND to one of sixteen possible value. The resulting 4-bit value is input to a CRC encoder <b>202</b> along with the 1-bit MS_STATUS_IND and 1-bit RAI_SN. The CRC encoder generates a 3-bit CRC codeword. The generator polynomial for the CRC encoder <b>202</b> is g(x)=x<sup>3</sup>+x<sup>2</sup>+1. The 3-bit CRC codeword and 1-bit RAI_SN or MS_STATUS_IND are output by the CRC encoder <b>202</b> to a 16-ary bio-orthogonal encoder <b>204</b>. The bi-orthogonal encoder <b>204</b> maps the 4-bit sequence (CRC+RAI_SN or MS_STATUS_IND) to one of sixteen possible codewords. The codeword output from the bi-orthogonal encoder <b>204</b> is a 100 sps sequence and is used as the frame-level codeword. Each element of the frame-level codeword corresponds to one power control slot and determines the polarity of the corresponding power control slot.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A 24-ary Hadamard encoder <b>206</b> maps the R_RATE_IND and MS_STATUS_IND or RAI_SN to a 24-ary Walsh codeword. The 24-ary Walsh codeword output by the Hadamard encoder <b>206</b> comprises the slot level codeword. The Walsh codeword output from the Hadamard encoder <b>206</b> is repeated by a repeater <b>208</b> at the desired power control rate. The output of the Hadamard encoder <b>206</b> is a 100 sps symbol sequence, which is increased to 800 sps by the repeater <b>208</b>. The 800 sps sequence output from the repeater <b>208</b> is combined with the 100 sps sequence output from encoder <b>204</b> in combiner <b>210</b>, and a Walsh cover is applied to the combined sequence by spreader <b>212</b>. Because each power control slot is separately decodable by the RBS <b>24</b>, the RBS <b>24</b> can coherently correlate the slot-level codeword to obtain a correlation metric with a phase reference. Further, because each frame is protected by a CRC, outer loop power control can be performed on the R-PDCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Those skilled in the art should appreciate that encoder <b>206</b> in general produces a first codeword that is repeated on a per slot basis to effect a desired repetition rate, e.g., a desired power control rate. While it is described as a Hadamard-based encoder, it may of course be configured according to different coding operations. By way of example, encoder <b>206</b> comprises one of a Hadamard encoder, a bi-orthogonal encoder, or a complementary orthogonal encoder. Similarly, it should be understood that encoder <b>204</b> in general produces a second codeword that is combined in a desired manner with the first codeword and that the encoding operations of encoder <b>204</b> can be configured as needed or desired. By way of non-limiting example, encoder <b>204</b> can be configured as an orthogonal encoder, complementary or otherwise, or configured as a bi-orthogonal encoder. Regardless, in one or more exemplary embodiments, the second codeword has a number of symbols equal to the number of repetitions of the first codeword, and each symbol of the second codeword is applied to a respective repetition of the first codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, first control information related to the R-PDCH, e.g., rate and status information, can be encoded to form the first codeword, which is then repeated at the desired slot rate. Further, second control information, e.g., other status/activity information, can be encoded to form the second codeword, which then is applied to the first codeword. As indicated, the second codeword also may include encoded error detection information, such as CRC data, that can be used at the base station to detect “frame” errors or the like for the R-PDCCH. As explained herein, such error detection serves as one basis for making outer loop power adjustments, while the slot-repeated first codeword provides a basis for high-rate inner loop power control.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary power control procedure. The RBS <b>24</b> receives reverse link samples during one power control slot (block <b>300</b>). The received samples include pilot samples and R-PDCCH samples. The RBS <b>24</b> generates channel estimates based on the received pilot samples (block <b>302</b>). The received pilot samples may be filtered with a causal filter, such as a Weiner filter. If y represents the vector of the received pilot symbols and x represents the vector of the true pilot symbols, the causal filtering may be performed according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>{circumflex over (x)}=<i>R</i><sub>xy</sub><i>R</i><sub>yy</sub><sup>−1</sup><i>y,</i>  Eq. 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where R<sub>xy </sub>is the cross-covariance matrix of the received pilot symbol vector y and R<sub>yy </sub>is the auto-covariance matrix of the received pilot symbol vector. The cross-covariance matrix R<sub>xy </sub>may be computed according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sub>xy</sub>=E{xy<sup>H</sup>}  Eq. 2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The auto-covariance matrix R<sub>yy </sub>may be computed according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sub>yy</sub>=E{yy<sup>H</sup>}  Eq. 3<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The filter may be fixed or may be adaptive. A simple, fixed filter design should take into account the worst-case Doppler spread, e.g., the Wiener solution corresponding to 5% normalized Doppler spread.
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The channel estimate provides a phase reference for coherent power estimation. In the exemplary embodiment, the channel gain of the R-PICH may vary relative to the R-PDCCH. In this case, the channel estimates should be normalized to obtain relative magnitudes for the pilot samples (block <b>304</b>). In other embodiments, the channel gain of the pilot channel R-PICH may be fixed relative to the R-PDCCH and the normalization step is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The normalized channel estimates and R-PDCCH are input to a slot-level decoder <b>350</b>, which may be part of the reverse link processing circuits <b>44</b>. The normalization can simply use, {circumflex over (x)}/∥{circumflex over (x)}∥, which is the vector of the pilot samples divided by its norm. The sample vector of the R-PDCCH samples corresponding to one power control slot is multiplied element by element by a channel estimate vector to adjust the phase of the sample vector. The decoder <b>350</b> then coherently correlates the sample vector with each possible slot-level codeword (block <b>306</b>) and selects the largest correlation metric as the power estimate (block <b>308</b>). The correlation metric is obtained by computing the product of the sample vector and codeword vector. The power estimate is input to the inner-loop decision process (block <b>312</b>), which generates a power control bit for transmission to a mobile station <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Following each power control slot, the RBS <b>24</b> determines if the end of a frame has been reached (block <b>310</b>). If not, the process described above repeats until the end of the frame is reached. When the end of a frame is reached (block <b>310</b>), the frame-level decoder <b>360</b> decodes the frame-level codeword (block <b>314</b>), performs a CRC check (block <b>316</b>) to determine if there is a frame error (block <b>314</b>), and computes a frame error rate (FER) (block <b>318</b>). Frame-level decoder <b>360</b> may be part of the reverse link processing circuits <b>44</b>. The FER may be used to perform outer-loop power control. If so, the FER is input to an outer-loop power control process (block <b>320</b>), which may adjust the power control set-point used by the inner-loop power control process (block <b>312</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary procedure <b>400</b> for inner loop power control. The RBS <b>24</b> receives the signal quality metric (e.g., the correlation metric) from the slot level decoder <b>350</b> (block <b>402</b>) and compares the signal quality metric to a power control set point (block <b>404</b>). Based on the comparison, the RBS <b>24</b> determines the power control bit (block <b>406</b>) to send to the mobile station <b>100</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the R-PDCCH provides the power reference for all other reverse link channels. Therefore, the mobile station <b>100</b> adjusts the transmit power on the R-PDCCH responsive to the PCB and then applies the appropriate offset to determine the transmit powers for the other reverse link channels.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary procedure <b>500</b> for outer loop power control. The FER computed by the frame-level decoder <b>360</b> is input to the outer loop power control process <b>320</b> (block <b>502</b>). The outer loop power control function <b>360</b> compares the computed FER to a target (blocks <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>). If the FER is less than the target (block <b>504</b>), the RBS <b>24</b> increases the power control set point (block <b>508</b>). Conversely, if the FER is greater than the target (block <b>506</b>), the RBS <b>24</b> decreases the power control set point (block <b>510</b>). The procedure ends after the adjustment is made (block <b>512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary power adjustment procedure <b>600</b> implemented by the mobile station <b>100</b> after a rate increase. The procedure <b>600</b> begins when the mobile station <b>100</b> either autonomously changes its data transmission rate, or is commanded to adjust its rate by the RBS <b>24</b>. After the mobile station <b>100</b> changes its data transmission rate (block <b>602</b>), the mobile station <b>100</b> determines the reference level of the R-PDCCH for the new rate (block <b>604</b>) and adjusts the channel gains of the R-PICH, R-PDCH, and other reverse link channels relative to the R-PDCCH (block <b>606</b>). Once the channel gains relative to the R-PDCCH are determined, the mobile station <b>100</b> adjusts the transmit power of the R-PICH, R-PDCH and other reverse link channels (block <b>608</b>) based on the R-PDCCH power and the channel gains. The procedure ends (block <b>610</b>) after all adjustments are made.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By using the received power of the R-PDCCH for inner loop power control, the mobile station <b>100</b> can autonomously change its data transmission rate without the need to signal the RBS <b>24</b> before it can begin transmitting at the selected rate. The elimination of signaling delays will allow the mobile station <b>100</b> to more rapidly respond to changes in channel conditions and result in more efficient use of the reverse traffic channel. Further, the present invention does not require allocation of resources for a secondary pilot channel. The present invention may nevertheless be of some benefit even when a secondary pilot channel is used because the code structure of the R-PDCCH will improve the quality of the SNR estimates used for inner loop power control.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention may, of course, be carried out in other ways than those specifically set forth herein without departing from essential characteristics of the invention.
