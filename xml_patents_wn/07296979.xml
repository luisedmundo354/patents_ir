<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to stable supports. In particular, this invention relates to stable supports employing a vacuum.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many instances where a stable support is required to ensure that the object or device being supported remains fixed with respect to a table or other sturdy structure. For example, laboratory equipment and measurement equipment, such as a three-dimensional digitizer, are usually required to remain fixed with respect to a sturdy object or the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One common method of ensuring stability of an apparatus has been physically bolting the apparatus to a table or floor. However, this method requires permanently altering the table or floor and makes repositioning difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another method of ensuring stability of an apparatus employs a high-strength magnet to fix the apparatus to a ferromagnetic surface, such as a steel table. This provides a strong sturdy support and is easily repositionable, but requires that a ferromagnetic surface be available.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-discussed and other drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by a vacuum support comprising a vacuum plate having a top surface and a bottom surface, the vacuum plate having a mechanical stop extending from the bottom surface; a seal extending along a periphery of the bottom surface, the vacuum plate and the seal defining a vacuum space; and a vacuum source in communication with the vacuum space. Upon attaching the vacuum plate to a mounting surface by reducing pressure in the vacuum space, the stop is in engagement with the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above discussed and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and drawings representing the preferred embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An exemplary vacuum adapter <b>10</b> is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This vacuum adapter comprises a high strength vacuum plate <b>16</b> having a plurality (e.g., at least three) mechanical solid stops or feet <b>22</b>, and a seal <b>18</b> formed of rubber or synthetic elastomeric material. The seal <b>18</b> extends beyond the bottom of vacuum plate <b>16</b> to define a vacuum space beneath the bottom surface of the vacuum plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While relative dimensions and strengths of materials may vary depending upon the application, it is preferred that vacuum plate <b>16</b> comprise a high strength material. Aluminum is a preferred material for combining low weight, corrosion resistance, and strength. For example, vacuum plate <b>16</b> may include a 6061-T6 jig aluminum plate, which is a high tensile strength aluminum alloy used in the aerospace industry. While a cloverleaf configuration is shown, the shape is not critical. The vacuum plate <b>16</b> may be a round plate approximately eight inches (20.3 cm) in outside diameter with a vertical profile of one and a quarter inches (3.2 cm). Seal <b>18</b> is disposed in a groove formed in the bottom surface of vacuum plate <b>16</b>. Vacuum plate <b>16</b> includes a recess underneath to increase the volume of space between vacuum plate <b>16</b> and the mounting surface. Furthermore, a hole is drilled through vacuum plate <b>16</b> and tapped for mounting vacuum gauge <b>35</b> (discussed in more detail below). The surface of vacuum plate <b>16</b> may be left as raw aluminum, or it may be covered by a plastic housing <b>14</b> formed of impact-resistant plastic attached via about four holes (not shown) drilled and tapped into vacuum plate <b>16</b> to accept mounting screws (not shown) securing the plastic housing. The plastic housing covers all vacuum components discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As a suction is applied between vacuum plate <b>16</b> and a solid non-permeable mounting surface (not shown), feet <b>22</b> provide stability to the vacuum plate <b>16</b> by preventing the plate from moving with respect to the surface as would be the case if seal <b>18</b> was relied upon to support vacuum plate <b>16</b>. Steel plate <b>24</b>, preferably a one-half inch thick (1.3 cm) SS416 steel alloy plate having a 3 inch (7.6 cm) diameter, is bolted or otherwise securely attached to vacuum plate <b>16</b>. More preferably, the surface of steel plate <b>24</b> is ground and passivated to reduce oxidation. For example, steel plate <b>24</b> may be attached with bolts (not shown) extending into four holes drilled into vacuum plate <b>16</b> radially about the center thereof. Corresponding holes formed into steel plate <b>24</b> are tapped to accept the bolts. A recess <b>26</b>, e.g., having a 3 inch (7.6 cm) diameter to accept steel plate <b>24</b> is formed in vacuum plate <b>16</b> to assist in centrally positioning the apparatus over steel plate <b>24</b>. Recess <b>26</b> may be machined into the top surface of vacuum plate <b>16</b> or other means may be employed. A vacuum gauge <b>35</b> provides visual indication of the status of the vacuum between vacuum plate <b>16</b> and the surface to which adapter <b>10</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A number of methods may be used for generating the vacuum. First, a pump <b>30</b>, such as hand pump or electrically motorized pump may be provided. Such hand pumps and motorized pumps are generally known in the art and are generally available. The vacuum plate <b>16</b> includes an internal path so that the pump <b>30</b> is in fluid communication with the vacuum space beneath the vacuum plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a second embodiment, a source of compressed air is applied through a venturi, which is then used to draw a vacuum from the vacuum space below the vacuum plate <b>16</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a source <b>40</b> of compressed air that is directed via line <b>42</b> to a pressure regulator <b>44</b> and venturi <b>46</b> which may be positioned within housing <b>14</b>. Pressure regulator <b>44</b>, and venturi <b>46</b> are enclosed within housing <b>14</b>, which includes a slip fitting for connecting an air supply hose to the internal vacuum components. As compressed air is applied to venturi <b>46</b>, a low-pressure region is developed at the neck of the venturi which includes a port that extends to a one-way valve <b>48</b> and then to the vacuum space between vacuum plate <b>16</b> and the surface. Air is then exhausted at exhaust port <b>56</b>. This mechanism provides a very reliable and inexpensive source of vacuum. As an example, a “P-5 Mini Chip” venturi manufactured by PIAB (Täby, Sweden) generates about 25-26 inches (63.5-66 cm) of mercury with 0.68 cubic feet (19 liters) per minute at 55 pounds per square inch (380 KPa). Pressure regulator <b>44</b> is, for example, a miniature regulator such as those available from Wilkerson Corporation (Englewood, Colo.). Pressure regulator <b>44</b> controls the air inflow to optimize the performance of venturi <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a third embodiment, an external vacuum pump is placed in communication with the vacuum space below the vacuum plate <b>16</b> via a vacuum hose and external connection. A one-way valve as described above may be integrated with adapter <b>10</b> to prevent air from leaking into the device after the vacuum is drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, a user places the vacuum adaptor on a non-porous sturdy surface such as a granite table, operates the pump or apply compressed air as discussed above to evacuate the vacuum space until the required vacuum is reached. Vacuum gauge <b>35</b>, preferably a center back mounted gauge having a 2″ diameter gauge face, may be used to determine when the proper vacuum level is achieved at which point the pump or compressed air is disengaged. The user may then attach a device <b>8</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, having magnet mount <b>5</b> to adapter <b>10</b> by inserting the magnetic chuck into recess <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While any device may be used with vacuum adapter <b>10</b>, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, device <b>8</b> is a portable coordinate measurement machine that includes a base <b>60</b> having magnet mount <b>5</b> at the bottom thereof. A jointed, articulated arm <b>62</b> extends upwardly from base <b>60</b> and terminates at a measurement probe <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To release adapter <b>10</b>, a miniature on/off ball valve (not shown) may be used. A three-way valve with the third port open to the atmosphere will release the plate when the valve is turned off, thereby placing the vacuum in communication with the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another embodiment of a stable support will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In this embodiment, vacuum plate <b>16</b> is formed of a ferromagnetic material, preferably ferromagnetic steel, e.g., 416 stainless steel, which is one of the most magnetic steels. Thus, a separate steel plate for attaching a magnetic base is not required. A recess <b>26</b> has a flat surface therein for receiving a magnet from the object or device being supported. Vacuum plate <b>16</b> also includes a circumferential rim <b>72</b> extending around rubber seal <b>18</b> in place of the feet <b>22</b> within the seal as shown in the previous embodiment. Note that, a solid rim and/or discrete feet may be used, either within the seal or external thereof, to support the vacuum plate <b>16</b> when a vacuum is established in the vacuum space between vacuum plate <b>16</b> and the mounting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Seal <b>18</b> is retained on the lower side <b>78</b> of vacuum plate <b>16</b> by a retaining means such as interlocking retention collars <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> formed on the seal and vacuum plate <b>16</b>, respectively. Alternatively, other interlocking structures may be used. In addition or alternatively to such interlocking structures, the upper surface of inner collar <b>77</b> is attached to lower surface <b>78</b> using a suitable adhesive (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Seal <b>18</b> includes a flexible portion <b>84</b> that extends radially from the retaining means to sealing surface <b>82</b>. Flexible portion <b>84</b> allows the sealing surface <b>82</b> to become sealingly engaged with the mounting surface. Specifically, the pressure differential above and below the flexible portion <b>84</b> causes a downward pressure to be applied to sealing surface <b>82</b> sufficient to maintain a vacuum within seal <b>18</b>. While flexible portion extends radially outward from retaining means to sealing surface <b>82</b>, the retaining means could also be circumferentially disposed around sealing surface <b>82</b>, such that the flexible portion extends radially inward from the retaining means to sealing surface <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A seal rim <b>86</b> projects toward and approaches the inside surface of rim <b>72</b> to improve the appearance of the underside of vacuum adapter <b>16</b> and to prevent foreign objects from entering the space above flexible portion <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the vacuum is produced using a hand pump <b>60</b> that is external to vacuum plate <b>16</b> and connected thereto by a vacuum hose <b>62</b>. An internal conduit provides fluid connection between the hose <b>62</b> and the vacuum space beneath vacuum plate <b>16</b>. A quick disconnect <b>64</b> is provided between vacuum hose <b>62</b> and vacuum plate <b>16</b>. Hand pump <b>60</b> includes a vacuum meter <b>35</b> and is available, for example, from TRI-ESS Sciences, part V183. In operation, vacuum hose <b>62</b> is connected to vacuum plate <b>16</b> and lever handle <b>66</b> is repeatedly operated until vacuum gauge <b>35</b> indicates the required amount of gauge pressure. Once the required amount of vacuum is achieved, and is found to be stable, i.e., not leaking, vacuum adapter <b>10</b> is ready to be utilized as a stable support. When it is required that vacuum adapter <b>10</b> be moved to a new location or removed from the support surface, a pressure release valve (not shown) on hand pump <b>60</b> is operated to relieve the vacuum thereby enabling easy removal of vacuum adapter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While preferred embodiments have been shown and described, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the one-way valve may be eliminated which would require continuously operating the vacuum source, e.g., continuously applying compressed air <b>40</b> to said venturi during use of adapter <b>10</b> thereby ensuring that the vacuum is maintained within vacuum plate <b>16</b>. Many other such modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustration and not limitation.</p>
