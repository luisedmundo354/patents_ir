<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains generally to robotic arms, and more particularly, to wrist assemblies for robotic arms of the type useful in wafer processing equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern semiconductor processing systems include cluster tools that integrate a number of process chambers together in order to perform several sequential processing steps without removing the substrate from the highly controlled processing environment. These chambers may include, for example, degas chambers, substrate pre-conditioning chambers, cooldown chambers, transfer chambers, chemical vapor deposition chambers, physical vapor deposition chambers, and etch chambers. The combination of chambers in a cluster tool, as well as the operating conditions and parameters under which those chambers are run, are selected to fabricate specific structures using a specific process recipe and process flow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the cluster tool has been set up with a desired set of chambers and auxiliary equipment for performing certain process steps, the cluster tool will typically process a large number of substrates by continuously passing them, one by one, through a series of chambers or process steps. The process recipes and sequences will typically be programmed into a microprocessor controller that will direct, control and monitor the processing of each substrate through the cluster tool. Once an entire cassette of wafers has been successfully processed through the cluster tool, the cassette may be passed to yet another cluster tool or stand alone tool, such as a chemical mechanical polisher, for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of a fabrication system of the type described above is the cluster tool disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,337 (Kroeker et al.), and reproduced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> herein. The magnetically coupled robot disclosed therein is equipped with robotic arms having a frog-leg type construction that are adapted to provide both radial and rotational movement of the robot blade within a fixed plane. The radial and rotational movements can be coordinated or combined to allow for pickup, transfer and deliver of substrates from one location within the cluster tool to another location. For example, the robotic arm may be used to move substrates from one processing chamber to an adjacent chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of the integrated cluster tool <b>10</b> of Kroeker et al. Substrates are introduced into, and withdrawn from, the cluster tool <b>10</b> through a cassette loadlock <b>12</b>. A robot <b>14</b> having a blade <b>17</b> is located within the cluster tool <b>10</b> to transfer the substrates from one process chamber to another. These process chambers include cassette loadlock <b>12</b>, degas wafer orientation chamber <b>20</b>, preclean chamber <b>24</b>, PVD TiN chamber <b>22</b> and cooldown chamber <b>26</b>. The robot blade <b>17</b> is illustrated in the retracted position in which it can rotate freely within the chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A second robot <b>28</b> is located in transfer chamber <b>30</b> and is adapted to transfer substrates between various chambers, such as the cooldown chamber <b>26</b>, preclean chamber <b>24</b>, CVD Al chamber (not shown) and a PVD AlCu processing chamber (not shown). The specific configuration of chambers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is designed to provide an integrated processing system capable of both CVD and PVD processes in a single cluster tool. A microprocessor controller <b>29</b> is provided to control the fabricating process sequence, conditions within the cluster tool, and the operation of the robots <b>14</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of the magnetically coupled robot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shown in both the retracted and extended positions. The robot <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes a first strut <b>81</b> rigidly attached to a first magnet clamp <b>80</b> and a second strut <b>82</b> rigidly attached to a second magnet clamp <b>80</b>′. A third strut <b>83</b> is attached by a pivot <b>84</b> to strut <b>81</b> and by a pivot <b>85</b> to a wafer blade <b>86</b>. A fourth strut <b>87</b> is attached by a pivot <b>88</b> to strut <b>82</b> and by a pivot <b>89</b> to wafer blade <b>86</b>. The structure of struts <b>81</b>-<b>83</b>, <b>87</b> and pivots <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>89</b> form a “frog leg” type connection of wafer blade <b>86</b> to magnet clamps <b>80</b>,<b>80</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When magnet clamps <b>80</b>,<b>80</b>′ rotate in the same direction with the same angular velocity, then the robot also rotates about axis x in this same direction with the same velocity. When magnet clamps <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>′ rotate in opposite directions with the same absolute angular velocity, then there is no rotation of assembly <b>14</b>, but instead there is linear radial movement of wafer blade <b>86</b> to a position illustrated by dashed elements <b>81</b>′-<b>89</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A wafer <b>35</b> is shown being loaded on wafer blade <b>86</b> to illustrate that the wafer blade can be extended through a wafer transfer slot <b>810</b> in a wall <b>811</b> of a chamber <b>32</b> to transfer such a wafer into or out of the chamber <b>32</b>. The mode in which both magnet clamps <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>′ rotate in the same direction at the same speed can be used to rotate the robot from a position suitable for wafer exchange with one of the adjacent chambers <b>12</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a position suitable for wafer exchange with another of these chambers. The mode in which both magnet clamps <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>′ rotate with the same speed in opposite directions is then used to extend the wafer blade into one of these chambers and then extract it from that chamber. Some other combination of clamp rotation can be used to extend or retract the wafer blade as the robot is being rotated about axis x.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To keep wafer blade <b>86</b> directed radially away from the rotation axes x, an interlocking mechanism is used between the pivots or cams <b>85</b>, <b>89</b> to assure an equal and opposite angular rotation of each pivot. The interlocking mechanism may take on many designs. One possible interlocking mechanism is a pair of intermeshed gears <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> formed on the pivots <b>85</b> and <b>89</b>. These gears are loosely meshed to minimize particulate generation by these gears. To eliminate play between these two gears because of this loose mesh, a weak spring <b>94</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be extended between a point <b>95</b> on one gear to a point <b>96</b> on the other gear such that the spring tension lightly rotates these two gears in opposite directions until light contact between these gears is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although robots of the type depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,337 (Kroeker et al.) have many desirable features, robots of this type also have some shortcomings. In particular, it has been found that robots of this type often exhibit excessive wear in the wrist <b>85</b>′, <b>89</b>′ and elbow <b>84</b>′, <b>88</b>′ joints. This problem results in excessive maintenance requirements and interruptions to the manufacturing process. There is thus a need in the art for a robotic assembly which requires less maintenance and exhibits less wear in these areas. These and other needs are met by the devices and methodologies disclosed herein and hereinafter described.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aforementioned needs are met by the devices and methodologies disclosed herein. In particular, after careful investigation, it has now been found that, in conventional robotic arms of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the hub assembly can move out of concentricity with its piece parts and force the lower arm to roll away from the rotating hub axis. For example, in some known robotic arm configurations, the hub to which the arm is attached contains three concentric rings. The top and bottom rings in this configuration house bearings and are attached to the arm, and the middle ring houses one or more rare earth magnets for the magnetic coupling drive. In use, these rings can deviate from concentricity, thus causing the aforementioned roll.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a frog-leg construction such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, this roll is transferred along the beam of the lower arm such that the arm is now out of parallelism with the second half of the frog arm. This condition induces stress within the wrist, elbow and hub assemblies, causing premature wear and adding abnormal motions in the z-direction (the direction perpendicular to the plane in which the arms extend and retract) as the arm is in motion. The devices and methodologies disclosed herein provide a means for compensating for this roll, thus eliminating such premature wear and allowing the robotic arm to operate properly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one non-limiting embodiment of the lower portion of a robotic arm made in accordance with the teachings herein. Some of the details of the robotic arm have been eliminated for simplicity of illustration. The robotic arm <b>101</b> comprises a hub <b>103</b>, a first segment <b>105</b> which is attached to one or more rotating rings or columns in the hub, and a second segment <b>107</b> which is attached to the first segment by way of a pin <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first segment <b>105</b> and second segment <b>107</b> are fastened together with a set of bolts <b>111</b> which mate with a set of threaded apertures (not shown) provided in the second element <b>107</b>. The throughput for the bolts in the first segment is sufficiently larger than the bolt itself such that the first element can rotate slightly around the axis of the pin <b>109</b> when the bolt is sufficiently loosened and when the arm is subjected to roll. Preferably, this rotation is within the range of ±2° which, though small, is sufficient to relieve the stress that would otherwise be placed on the wrist and elbow assemblies. Hence, the two-part construction of the lower arm depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> allows a rotation to occur to compensate for the out-of-axis roll and to keep the entire arm balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one particular means by which roll (and the accompanying stress) may be compensated for, one skilled in the art will appreciate that this objective may be achieved through a number of different means. For example, the first and second segments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> could be connected across a bearing assembly which permits limited rotation of these segments with respect to each other. It will thus be appreciated that these various means are within the scope of the present invention. Thus, although particular embodiments of the devices and methodologies disclosed herein have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
