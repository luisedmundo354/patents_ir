<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of fabricating semiconductor devices including circuit elements, such as field effect transistors (FETs), and, in particular, to a method and system for improved control of the manufacturing process of circuit elements to more reliably stabilize an electrical property of the completed devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The dimensions of modern integrated circuits are steadily shrinking, while at the same time providing both improved device performance and circuit density. Both advantages are mainly obtained by steadily shrinking the feature sizes of the individual field effect transistor elements, such as MOS transistors, whereby critical dimensions, i.e., minimum feature sizes that can be reproducibly printed onto the substrate, are currently approaching the 0.1 μm range, and further reductions are anticipated in the future. The formation of modern ultra-high density integrated circuits may require approximately 500 individual process steps, wherein one of the most critical steps is the formation of the gate electrode of the field effect transistors. The gate electrode controls, upon application of a suitable control voltage such as 2-3 volts or even less in modern CPUs, the current flow through a channel that forms below a thin gate insulation layer separating the gate electrode from the underlying semiconductor region. Generally, the gate electrode is designed to have a width dimension on the order of micrometers and less and a length dimension, also referred to as gate length, currently on the order of 0.1 μm. This gate length, which represents the distance between the highly doped source and drain regions of the field effect transistor, significantly affects the device performance with respect to signal propagation time and current flow from the source to the drain. Trimming the gate length down to a size of about 0.1 μm necessitates an enormous effort to establish an appropriate lithography technique and a sophisticated etch trim method, wherein any deviation from a target value of the gate length significantly contributes to a variation of the electrical properties of the completed transistor element. In particular, the on-current and the off-current, i.e., the current that flows when a conductive channel is formed between the source and the drain region and the current that flows when the conductive channel is not formed, as well as the switching speed, are greatly influenced by the gate length.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a reduced gate length leads to an increased on-current and to an increased switching speed of the transistor element. At the same time, however, the off-current, i.e., the undesired leakage current, also increases with a smaller gate length owing to an increased electrical field in the vicinity of the gate electrode. Accordingly, a reduced gate length compared to the target value, although improving speed of the transistor element, may result in a lower yield of the completed transistor elements due to the increased and thus intolerable leakage current. On the other hand, an increased gate length compared to the target value enhances the transistor characteristics with respect to leakage current, but entails a lower on-current and a lower speed of the transistor. As a consequence, circuit designers have to take into account the variation of the electrical properties of the individual transistor elements owing to manufacturing tolerances in forming elements of critical dimensions, thereby posing constraints on the performance of the entire circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a consequence, process engineers are making great efforts to develop process control strategies to reduce fluctuations of the individual process steps as much as possible to achieve a high performance of the end product. To this end, so-called advanced process control (APC) methods are steadily being designed and enhanced, in which typically pre-process inline data and post-process inline data are analyzed and used to control the process under consideration with minimal time delay, preferably on a run-to-run basis. However, at least some important device characteristics, such as operational speed, depend on a plurality of process steps, wherein a slight deviation in some of the processes, although well within a tight process window for each process, may still result in a significant deviation of the desired behavior of the device, for instance in terms of speed, yield, reliability and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above problems, a need exists for an enhanced control scheme to more efficiently control product parameters and electrical properties such as the on-current and the off-current, the switching speed and the like during fabrication of the field effect transistors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, the present invention is directed to a technique that enables the reduction of process variations in a process sequence by providing a “supervising” control scheme that may re-adjust the control activity in one or more processes of the process sequence. The supervising control scheme may include information relating one or more product parameters to inline measurement data used to control individual processes so that the supervising control scheme may compensate for even slight variations of the process sequence on the basis of this information, thereby providing the potential for selecting tighter margins for one or more key product parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a method of controlling a product parameter of a circuit element comprises performing a first controlled manufacturing process on the basis of first process measurement data to form a first pre-form of the circuit element. Moreover, a second controlled manufacturing process is performed on the basis of second process measurement data to form a second pre-form of the circuit element. Finally, the second controlled manufacturing process is controlled on the basis of the first process measurement data and a correlation of the first and second measurement data with the product parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to still a further embodiment of the present invention, a method of controlling a product parameter of a circuit element comprises performing a first manufacturing process that is controlled by a first APC application to form a first pre-form of the circuit element. The method further comprises performing a second manufacturing process that is controlled by an APC application to form a second pre-form of the circuit element. Moreover, the second manufacturing process is controlled on the basis of the first APC application and second APC application and product measurement data indicative of the product parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another illustrative embodiment of the present invention, a multi-step APC control system comprises a first APC controller configured to control a first manufacturing process and a second APC controller configured to control a second manufacturing process. The system further comprises a control unit connected to the first and second APC controllers, wherein the control unit is configured to determine a compensated target value for the second APC controller on the basis of measurement data used by the first APC controller and sensitivity information relating the measurement data to a product parameter of a circuit element formed by at least the first and second manufacturing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention will now be described with reference to the attached figures. Although the various regions and structures of a semiconductor device are depicted in the drawings as having very precise, sharp configurations and profiles, those skilled in the art recognize that, in reality, these regions and structures are not as precise as indicated in the drawings. Additionally, the relative sizes of the various features and doped regions depicted in the drawings may be exaggerated or reduced as compared to the size of those features or regions on fabricated devices. Nevertheless, the attached drawings are included to describe and explain illustrative examples of the present invention. The words and phrases used herein should be understood and interpreted to have a meaning consistent with the understanding of those words and phrases by those skilled in the relevant art. No special definition of a term or phrase, i.e., a definition that is different from the ordinary and customary meaning as understood by those skilled in the art, is intended to be implied by consistent usage of the term or phrase herein. To the extent that a term or phrase is intended to have a special meaning, i.e., a meaning other than that understood by skilled artisans, such a special definition will be expressly set forth in the specification in a definitional manner that directly and unequivocally provides the special definition for the term or phrase.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, the present invention is based on the finding that any variation of the gate length during the complex process steps for forming a gate electrode of a field effect transistor may be compensated, at least partially, by one or more subsequent process steps in which process parameters can reliably and reproducibly be re-adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the individual process steps in a typical process flow for forming a circuit element such as a field effect transistor, for instance in the form of a MOS transistor, will briefly be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a first process step <b>110</b>, also referred to as a shallow trench isolation (STI), describes a manufacturing stage in which shallow trench isolations <b>111</b>, for example comprised of silicon dioxide, are formed in a semiconductor substrate <b>112</b> to define an active region <b>113</b> in which a field effect transistor is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, a process step <b>120</b>, also referred to as a channel implant, indicates a manufacturing stage in which the substrate <b>112</b> is exposed to a beam of ions <b>121</b> to implant a specified dopant concentration within the active region <b>113</b> that is appropriate to achieve the required channel characteristics, in terms of charge carrier concentration, mobility and the like, of the field effect transistor to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thereafter, in step <b>130</b>, also referred to as gate formation, a gate insulation layer <b>131</b> is formed on the active region <b>113</b> and a gate electrode <b>132</b> is patterned on the gate insulation layer <b>131</b> from a polysilicon layer. The gate electrode <b>132</b> defines a width direction (not shown) perpendicular to the drawing plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>and a length direction in the drawing plane and substantially parallel to the surface of the active region <b>113</b>. An extension of the gate electrode <b>132</b> in the length direction, as indicated by the arrows <b>133</b>, is also referred to as a gate length.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, in a process step <b>140</b>, a spacer element <b>141</b>, which is also often referred to as a spacer <b>0</b>, is formed adjacent to the gate electrode <b>132</b> at the sidewalls thereof. The spacer element <b>141</b> is comprised of a dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. Typically, forming the spacer element <b>141</b> includes blanket depositing the dielectric material and subsequently removing the dielectric material by a selective anisotropic etching process, wherein the initial layer thickness of the dielectric material and/or the step coverage of the dielectric material over the gate electrode <b>132</b> and/or the over-etch time, i.e., the etch time after the dielectric material has been substantially completely removed on top of the gate electrode <b>132</b> and the surface portions of the active region <b>113</b> spaced apart from the gate electrode <b>132</b>, determine a final maximum extension <b>142</b> of the spacer element <b>141</b>, i.e., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a footprint of the spacer element <b>141</b> in the length direction. Usually, the process parameters for depositing the dielectric material, adjusting the step coverage and performing the anisotropic etching are relatively well-known and well-controllable so that the maximum extension <b>142</b> of the spacer element <b>141</b> may be well-adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, in step <b>150</b>, an ion implantation is carried out, indicated by the arrows <b>151</b>, with a moderate dose and with an appropriate type of ion to form doped regions <b>152</b>, also referred to as extensions, adjacent to the gate electrode <b>132</b>. This is sometimes referred to as an extension implant process. It should be noted that the spacer element <b>141</b> acts as an implantation mask during the implantation step and thus influences the implantation profile of the lightly doped regions <b>152</b>. It is also to be noted that while the spacer element <b>141</b> acts as an implantation mask, it does not prevent all implanted ions from migrating into the region below the spacer element <b>141</b> as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. The reason for this is that the ions are subjected to diffusion once they have penetrated the active region <b>113</b>, especially as a heat treatment is performed later to activate any implanted ions and to partially re-crystallize the lattice structure of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, in step <b>160</b>, a second spacer element <b>161</b>, also referred to as spacer <b>1</b>, is formed adjacent to the sidewalls of the gate electrode <b>132</b>, wherein the second spacer element <b>161</b> may or may not be formed of the same material as the spacer element <b>141</b> and formation of the second spacer element <b>161</b> may include substantially the same process steps as is explained with reference to the spacer element <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step <b>170</b>, also referred to as SD implant, an ion implantation process is carried out, indicated by the arrows <b>171</b>, to form source and drain regions <b>172</b> in the active region <b>113</b>. As with the spacer element <b>141</b>, the second spacer element <b>161</b> also acts as an implantation mask to reduce the number of ions entering the region below the second spacer element <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step <b>180</b>, as previously explained, a heat treatment is performed to activate the implanted ions within the extension regions <b>152</b> and the drain and source regions <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thereafter, further processes, such as forming a metal silicide on the gate electrode <b>132</b> and the drain and source regions <b>172</b>, may follow to obtain a completed field effect transistor <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For evaluating the product parameters including the electrical characteristics of the field effect transistor <b>182</b>, at least one of the following properties may be measured: production yield, reliability, that is life time during specified stress conditions, the on-current (drive current), the off-current, the rise and fall time when a corresponding signal is applied to the gate electrode, that is the switching time, and the frequency of an oscillator in which one or more field effect transistors <b>182</b> form a part of the oscillator. In this respect, it should be noted that, regarding the above-indicated electrical properties and other product characteristics, such as yield and reliability, PMOS transistors substantially behave like NMOS transistors with the exception that the transistor on-current of the PMOS transistor is smaller than that of an NMOS transistor of comparable transistor size owing to the different type of charge carriers. Accordingly, although the process flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>and in the following figures is described with reference to an NMOS transistor, the discussion is also valid for PMOS transistors and complementary transistor pairs when the difference in on-current of the various transistor types is taken into consideration. For example, experimental data for complementary transistor pairs may be evaluated by defining a switching speed that is the minimum speed of the NMOS transistor and the PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In conventional process strategies, typically metrology steps are performed at selected points of the above-described manufacturing sequence <b>100</b>. For example, the step <b>130</b> for forming the gate electrode may include a preceding measurement step, for instance in order to obtain measurement readings concerning a resist feature used to etch the gate electrode <b>132</b>. After etching the gate electrode <b>132</b> a post-etch measurement may be performed to determine the actual gate length <b>133</b>. Based on these measurement results and an appropriate control model, the step <b>130</b> may be controlled by an APC scheme to ensure a high yield of the process step <b>130</b> even for ever-decreasing process window margins. Corresponding process control strategies are employed for at least some of the processes of the sequence <b>100</b>. It turns out, however, that even slight deviations from the target values in at least some highly sensitive processes of the individual processes of the sequence <b>100</b> may result in noticeable deviations in product parameters and in final electrical tests. The present invention is based on the concept that deviations in electrical and other product parameters may be compensated for or at least reduced on the basis of measurement data of a first controlled process and measurement date of a second controlled process downstream of the first process, wherein, additionally, corresponding sensitivity data, representing a correlation between measurement data and electrical or other product parameters, are used to at least “supervise” the second controlled process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>schematically illustrates a corresponding control scheme <b>190</b>, which may be implemented in the form of a system including any appropriate hardware, such as computers, controllers, microprocessors, communication lines and the like, wherein, as an illustrative example, a first process may be represented by the step <b>130</b> and a second process downstream of the first process may be represented by the RTA step <b>180</b>. It should be appreciated that the control scheme <b>190</b> may be used in combination with any other processes that are considered effective to reduce product specific parameter fluctuations. In particular, the control scheme <b>190</b> may include more than two individual processes. Referring to the illustrative embodiment describing a reduction in parameter fluctuation by controlling an RTA parameter target value on the basis of gate length variations and appropriate sensitivity data, the control scheme <b>190</b> thus comprises the gate formation process <b>130</b> and the RTA process <b>180</b>, wherein, in particular, the process <b>130</b> includes a post-process metrology step <b>135</b> that produces post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a</i>. The process <b>130</b> may further include a pre-process metrology step <b>136</b> creating corresponding pre-process measurement data <b>136</b><i>a</i>. The process <b>130</b> may be controlled by a first APC application <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similarly, the process <b>180</b> may in some embodiments include a post-process metrology step <b>185</b> generating post-process measurement data <b>185</b><i>a</i>. The process <b>180</b> may also include a pre-process metrology step <b>186</b> that creates pre-process measurement data <b>186</b><i>a</i>. The process <b>180</b> may be controlled by a second APC application <b>187</b>. It should be appreciated that the metrology steps <b>135</b> and/or <b>136</b> and/or <b>185</b> and/or <b>186</b> and thus the correspondingly generated measurement data may not necessarily directly relate to the circuit element under consideration, i.e., in the present example the gate electrode <b>132</b> and the completed transistor <b>182</b>, but may alternatively or additionally concern tool specific parameters and the like. For instance, the second APC application <b>187</b> may mainly be based on tool parameters regarding the temperature and ambient conditions as pre- and post-process measurement data <b>186</b><i>a</i>, <b>185</b><i>a </i>to provide a desired diffusion behavior. It is also to be noted that any pre- and post-process measurement data may be gathered with one or more additional process steps performed between the measurement and the actual process, which is controlled based on the measurement data.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, the scheme <b>190</b> comprises a “multi-step” APC application <b>191</b> that communicates with the application <b>137</b> and that receives the post-process measurement data <b>136</b><i>a</i>. The APC application <b>191</b> is also configured to communicate with the application <b>187</b> and to control the application <b>187</b>. In a particular embodiment, controlling the application <b>187</b> is accomplished by establishing an updated target value and supplying the same to the application <b>187</b>. The multi-step application <b>191</b> may also communicate, indicated as <b>192</b>, with other APC applications or with external sources. In particular, the multi-step application <b>191</b> may receive, via the communication <b>192</b>, sensitivity data or data indicative of the relation between one or more product parameters and one or more process parameters of the processes <b>130</b> and <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, respective sensitivity data may be stored or created within the multi-step application <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operative principle of the multi-step application <b>191</b> is based on the concept that a set of product parameters {right arrow over (P)} including electrical parameters is interrelated to a set of inline measurement data {right arrow over (p)}, such as one or more of the pre- and post-measurement data <b>135</b><i>a</i>, <b>136</b><i>a</i>, <b>185</b><i>a</i>, <b>186</b><i>a</i>, by the sensitivities {right arrow over (S)} quantifying the dependence of the measurement data on the product parameters. The parameters, the measurement data and the sensitivities may mathematically be treated as vectors and matrices and the above interrelation may be expressed by the following Equation 1:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>{right arrow over (P)}=P(1 . . . n) . . . product parameters<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Based on Equation 1, an expected deviation {right arrow over (P)}<sub>Delta </sub>of the product parameters {right arrow over (P)} may be obtained by a comparison of the inline measurement data {right arrow over (p)} with respective target values {right arrow over (P)}<sub>T </sub>of the inline measurement data {right arrow over (p)}. This is shown in the following Equation 2:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>{right arrow over (p)}</i><sub>T</sub><i>=p</i><sub>T</sub>(1 <i>. . . m</i>) . . . inlinetargets<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hence, the deviation of the measurement data {right arrow over (p)} from the target values {right arrow over (P)}<sub>T </sub>may be obtained by using Equation 2. Then, new, compensated or updated target values {right arrow over (P)}<sub>T,compensated </sub>may be determined as a function f of the sensitivities {right arrow over (S)}, the inline target values {right arrow over (p)}<sub>T </sub>and the inline measurement data {right arrow over (p)}, as is expressed in the following Equation 3:

</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The compensated target values {right arrow over (p)}<sub>T,compensated </sub>may then be used to control the upstream APC application to compensate for or reduce fluctuations in the product parameters under consideration.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows representative measurement results obtained from a plurality of field effect transistors, such as the transistor <b>182</b>, that have been formed on a plurality of separate substrates. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the vertical axis represents the switching speed of the field effect transistors, whereas the horizontal axis represents the gate length of the respective field effect transistors. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two differing target values A and B for the gate length <b>132</b> have been established in accordance with process variations to obtain “high” speed (hot) substrates, thereby taking a loss in yield and reliability, and to obtain “low” speed (cold) candidates with improved yield and reliability, thereby taking a loss in performance. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> it is observable that the gate length of the various field effect transistors varies strongly for the processed substrates with significant concentrations at the cold target value B and the hot target value A. The dependence of the switching speed, representing here an electrical parameter, on the gate length <b>132</b> may be described as a linear function C, although other interrelations may be used if considered appropriate. A goal of the control scheme <b>191</b> in this illustrative embodiment may thus be directed at reducing the “distance” in performance of the products represented by the target values A and B, or at least reducing the deviation in the electrical parameter and other parameters of “hot” and “cold” products. That is, devices in the region D, i.e., devices exhibiting high reliability, however at reduced speed, may be processed in the RTA process <b>180</b> with a compensated target value to speed up these devices. The devices in the region E exhibiting high speed, however at significantly reduced reliability and yield, may be processed in the RTA treatment <b>180</b> with a corresponding target value to slow down the devices. Devices in the region F may be “shifted” to obtain “hot” devices or “cold” devices, depending on process requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since the gate length <b>132</b> and other parameters can be measured within the production line, the information contained in the measurement results may be used in subsequent process steps to adjust other process parameters to compensate for variations of electrical properties of the field effect transistors caused by the gate length variations. According to the above-identified multi-step APC application <b>191</b>, process parameters of process steps following the gate formation step <b>130</b> may be controlled such that, in the final device, the product parameters of interest remain within a specified range. This holds true for any interrelated controlled processes, in which the effect of one process with respect to a product parameter of interest may, at least to some degree, be influenced in one or more downstream processes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">One basic mechanism of an illustrative embodiment relating the process steps <b>130</b> and the RTA step <b>180</b> that may be used in reducing the variation of the electrical property of the field effect transistor will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a schematic cross-sectional view of three variations of a field effect transistor <b>182</b> is depicted. For convenience, the same numeration is adhered to as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. In the left part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first variation of the field effect transistor <b>182</b> is illustrated. The gate electrode <b>132</b> exhibits the gate length <b>133</b> and the distance between the extension regions <b>152</b> defines a channel length or an effective gate length <b>134</b>. Generally, the effective gate length <b>134</b> is less than the gate length <b>133</b> due to an overlap <b>138</b> of the extension regions <b>152</b> with the gate electrode <b>132</b>. It is, however, the effective gate length <b>134</b> that, among others, has a remarkable impact on the electrical characteristics of the field effect transistor <b>182</b>. It is thus possible to control a variation of the effective gate length <b>134</b> that will be obtained, according to the conventional process flow <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in conformity with a variation of the gate length <b>133</b> when the RTA process <b>180</b> is performed without being controlled on the basis of the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the conventional process flow, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the maximum extension <b>142</b> of the spacer element <b>141</b> is maintained substantially constant, that is, only a randomly distributed, slight variation occurs. As previously discussed, the process parameters, and thus the complete process steps for forming the spacer element <b>141</b>, are well-established and the formation of the spacer element <b>141</b> is accordingly highly reproducible with only moderate variations. As a consequence, the overlap <b>138</b> of the extension regions <b>152</b> with the gate electrode <b>132</b> will exhibit approximately the same minor variations as the maximum extension <b>142</b> of the spacer element <b>141</b> since this maximum extension <b>142</b> substantially determines the masking effect of the spacer element <b>141</b> during the implant <b>150</b>. The effective gate length <b>138</b> may be significantly influenced by the RTA step <b>180</b> in that, for instance, the temperature is varied to control the average diffusion distance of the dopants in the lateral (and of course in the vertical) dimension. In the variation shown in the left portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the measured gate length <b>133</b> is smaller than a predefined target value of the gate length and consequently the RTA temperature may correspondingly be reduced to substantially obtain a desired effective gate length <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the center portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second variation of the field effect transistor <b>182</b> is depicted, wherein the measured gate length <b>133</b> is substantially equal to the desired gate length, and thus the effective gate length <b>134</b> is substantially equal to a desired target value for a specified target value of the RTA process <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a third variation of the field effect transistor <b>182</b> in which the gate length <b>133</b> exceeds the desired gate length after the gate formation step <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, the RTA temperature in the RTA process <b>180</b> is correspondingly increased so that the effective gate length <b>134</b> is substantially equal to the desired effective gate length, thereby, however, also increasing the overlap <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Due to the varying overlap <b>138</b>, when adapting the RTA process <b>180</b> to the process variations of the step <b>130</b>, in some embodiments, the sensitivity of the RTA process parameter may be determined by simulation and/or experimental data, wherein also the varying overlap <b>138</b> may be taken into account as the overlap <b>138</b> causes a parasitic capacitance in the transistor <b>182</b>, which affects transistor performance. Thus, varying the RTA target value to achieve a substantially constant effective gate length <b>134</b> may, in some embodiments, be appropriate, whereas, in other embodiments, a more complex non-linear relation between the gate length <b>133</b> and the effective gate length <b>134</b> may be used. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for the transistor <b>182</b> at the right-hand side, the effective gate length <b>134</b> may be reduced to take into consideration the increased parasitic capacitance caused by the increased overlap <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a typical process flow of the control scheme <b>190</b> based on the processes <b>130</b> and <b>180</b> may comprise the following steps. After forming the gate electrode <b>132</b>, the gate lengths <b>133</b> of at least some of the gate electrodes formed in step <b>130</b> are determined by measurement and are input into the APC application <b>137</b> and the multi-step APC application <b>191</b> that is operatively connected to process tools (not shown) used in step <b>130</b>. As is well known, the gate length may be measured, for example, optically by means of a scatterometer or any other appropriate means that is usually provided within the production line. The measurement results of the gate length are then entered as the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>into multi-step APC application <b>191</b>, which is configured to output compensated target values for one or more process parameters for adjusting process tools involved in performing the RTA process <b>180</b>. For instance, the target value for the maximum RTA temperature may be communicated to the APC application <b>187</b> together with substrate specific information so that the APC application <b>187</b> may identify the one or more substrates that also created the corresponding post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is to be noted that the measured gate lengths, i.e., the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>obtained in step <b>130</b> do not necessarily need to be correlated directly with the compensated target value for the RTA temperature, but may, in one illustrative embodiment, be correlated directly with the tool parameters controlling the RTA process <b>180</b>. That is, the feed forward control provided by the multi-step APC application <b>191</b> may supply a control signal to the respective process tool, such as a laser tool, an RTA oven and the like, whereby a specific type of control signal is assigned to a measured gate length value or a certain range of measurement values. A corresponding correlation may be provided, for example, in the form of one or more tables and/or by calculation when a mathematical representation for the correlation has been established. Moreover, in other embodiments, the correlation between the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the finally used target RTA temperature may be selected so that, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an allowable range of gate lengths is defined in advance for a change of the target RTA temperature. For instance, for post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>within the areas centered around the “hot” target gate length A and the “cold” target gate length B, no change of the target RTA temperature may be determined, while for measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>within the ranges E, F and D, compensated target values may be obtained on the basis of previously established sensitivities, as is also explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. An illustrative embodiment for determining compensated target values for the ranges D, E and F will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Using a range of the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>without providing compensated target values for the RTA temperature may be advantageous in view of control loop stabilization, as the values for the product parameter(s) under consideration, i.e., in the present example, the device speed, may exhibit a certain variation for a given gate length, as may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, in other embodiments, various other control strategies may be selected, such as correlating the amount of change of the target RTA temperature to further post- and pre-process measurement data obtained from processes upstream and/or downstream of the process <b>130</b>. For example, corresponding sensitivities may be established with respect to the correlation between the product parameter(s) under consideration and the post-process measurement data of the channel implant <b>120</b> and/or the extension implant <b>150</b> and/or the spacer <b>0</b> process <b>140</b>, and the like. In this case, the variations of the product parameter under consideration, i.e., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the transistor speed, may, at least to a certain degree, be identified as being caused by one or more of the other processes so that the product parameter under consideration may more efficiently be confined to a desired value as is for instance represented by the fit curve C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one particular embodiment, the sensitivity of the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a</i>, i.e., the gate length measurement data, and the sensitivity of the RTA process with respect to the transistor speed may be selected as linear functions. In this respect, it should be appreciated that the sensitivity of the RTA may be considered as depending on the measurement data <b>185</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>186</b><i>a </i>to be in conformity with the above-given definition of the sensitivity S. That is, the temperature actually used or actually selected at the RTA tool may be considered as post-process measurement data and pre-process measurement data, respectively, so that the corresponding sensitivity may describe a corresponding linear correlation, in this particular embodiment, between the actually used RTA temperature, the post-process measurement data <b>185</b><i>a</i>, or the temperature adjusted at the RTA tool, the pre-process measurement data <b>186</b><i>a</i>. Moreover, the control scheme <b>190</b> in the multi-step APC application <b>191</b> may, in one embodiment, in view of enhanced control stability, be based on the condition that the RTA process <b>180</b> be controlled between a predefined range. That is, a maximum and a minimum threshold may be selected for the amount of variation of the target RTA temperature value supplied to the APC application <b>187</b> by the multi-step application <b>191</b>. In another embodiment, a step-wise constant model for determining a compensated RTA target value in response to the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>may be selected, wherein the step width and the step height may be obtained empirically and may, in some embodiments, be adjusted in accordance with measurement results of the product parameter under consideration. Similarly, the respective sensitivities and the functional relationship for determining the compensated target value (Equation 3) may be adapted or updated on the basis of such measurement data. In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to “dampen” the control activity of the multi-step application <b>191</b> on the APC application <b>187</b>, for instance, by introducing a corresponding damping factor or damping function.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to Equation 4, an illustrative control strategy as may be implemented in the multi-step application <b>191</b> is provided, in which some of the features specified above are combined to achieve a high stability in the feed-forward loop established by the control scheme <b>190</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Herein DF represents the deviation of the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a</i>, here denoted as CD, from the respective target value, CDTarget, that is, DF corresponds to {right arrow over (p)}<sub>Delta </sub>in Equation 3. CD_Deadband represents a range of measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>for which, in the present embodiment, no compensation of the RTA target temperature is desired, as is previously explained. CD_Damping represents a damping factor as explained above to adapt the effect of the additional control of the multi-step application <b>191</b>. S<sub>CD </sub>and S<sub>RTA </sub>represent the corresponding sensitivities of the measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>185</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>186</b><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, the sensitivities are provided as single numbers. DT<sub>exact </sub>represents the compensated target value and thus corresponds to {right arrow over (p)}<sub>T,compensated </sub>of Equation 3. Hence, DT<sub>exact </sub>represents the function f({right arrow over (S)}, {right arrow over (p)}<sub>T</sub>, {right arrow over (p)}) of Equation 3. In the next step of Equation 4, the compensated target value DT<sub>exact </sub>is converted into a form that may be advantageous in view of control stability and feasibility. In this embodiment, the linear function DT<sub>exact</sub>, except for the deadband, is divided into discrete steps as is discussed above to obtain the function DT<sub>round</sub>, wherein the step width is determined by the value RTA_Discretization.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the last step of Equation 4, a maximum control effect may be defined, which is, in the present embodiment, realized by the introduction of an upper and a lower limit for the compensation of the target value of the RTA. Hereby, RTA_MaxAdjust represents a maximum deviation from a non-compensated target value, that is, from a target value as is provided by the APC application <b>187</b> without being controlled by the superordinate multistep application <b>191</b>. Hence, the value DT<sub>used </sub>is obtained which may represent the compensated target value supplied to the APC application <b>187</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating the above-described control scheme <b>190</b>, wherein DT<sub>used </sub>on the vertical axis is plotted versus the difference CD of the post-process measurement data <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding target value.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Based on the control scheme <b>190</b> as described in Equation 4 and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a plurality of substrates have been processed corresponding to the process sequence <b>100</b>, wherein the process control of a part of the substrates was performed in a conventional manner, i.e., without the provision of the multi-step application <b>191</b> while the other part was subjected to the control scheme <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows results of measurements with respect to one product parameter, in the present example the operating speed of the transistors, wherein the curves C<sub>old </sub>and H<sub>ot </sub>depict the conventionally processed substrates, whereas the curves MC<sub>old </sub>and MH<sub>ot </sub>represent the substrates processed using the multi-step application <b>191</b>. As is evident from the data, the speed distribution is significantly tighter for the curves MC<sub>old </sub>and MH<sub>ot</sub>, that is, the variation around a central speed (HOT or COLD) is tightened and the center values of the respective distributions MH<sub>ot</sub>, and MC<sub>old </sub>are closer to their target values A and B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically depicts a further product parameter, that is, production yield, for the two different speed target values HOT and COLD. Here, it is evident that production yield for the substrates controlled under the scheme <b>191</b> (MC<sub>old</sub>) have only a slight decrease in yield for the benefit of higher speed compared to the conventionally produced substrates (C<sub>old</sub>), while the substrates (MH<sub>ot</sub>) show significantly increased production yield compared to the conventional substrates (H<sub>ot</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, a significant improvement compared to the conventional APC control strategy is achieved. It may readily be appreciated that the control scheme <b>190</b> may be implemented in any desired form, for instance as a stand-alone equipment connected to the APC applications included in the sequence <b>100</b> in any hardware and/or software representation. In other cases, the APC applications and the multi-step application <b>191</b> may be provided as a combined hardware and/or software application, for instance as part of a superior facility management system.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Moreover, the control scheme <b>190</b> may be applied on a single substrate basis, that is, the compensated target value for the destiny APC application may be determined for each substrate, based on corresponding measurement data related to this substrate. In other embodiments, measurement data may be obtained from one or more substrates and may be used in their entirety, for instance by averaging the same, to control a plurality of subsequent substrates based on the entirety of data, thereby providing a common compensated target value for the plurality of substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the sensitivities used may be provided in more complex relations rather than assuming a linear dependence. For example, well-known fit algorithms may be employed to obtain a relation between measurement data of the electrical parameter under consideration and the post-process measurement data. The obtained fit curve may then be made discrete to define a vector representation to allow enhanced handling of the sensitivity in the control scheme <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As a result, the present invention provides an enhanced control technique in which conventional APC control strategies of single processes may be enhanced by a superior APC application that controls one or more individual processes to obtain a synergetic effect with respect to one or more product parameters such as speed, yield, reliability and the like. The superior APC application controls, on the basis of measurement data of at least one upstream process, at least one downstream process to compensate for or reduce variations of the at least one upstream process. In one particular embodiment, the at least one downstream process includes an RTA process and the at least one upstream process includes the formation of a gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein. For example, the process steps set forth above may be performed in a different order. Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown, other than as described in the claims below. It is therefore evident that the particular embodiments disclosed above may be altered or modified and all such variations are considered within the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the protection sought herein is as set forth in the claims below.</p>
