<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a §371 national stage filing of PCT/EP02/09942 filed 5 Sep. 2002.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to novel compounds and their use as pharmaceuticals, particularly as Raf kinase inhibitors for the treatment of neurotraumatic diseases, cancer chronic neurodegeneration, pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Raf protein kinases are key components of signal transduction pathways by which specific extracellular stimuli elicit precise cellular responses in mammalian cells. Activated cell surface receptors activate ras/rap proteins at the inner aspect of the plasma-membrane which in turn recruit and activate Raf proteins. Activated Raf proteins phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2. In turn, activated MEKs catalyse phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of activated MAPK are known which directly or indirectly contribute to the cellular response to environmental change. Three distinct genes have been identified in mammals that encode Raf proteins; A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) and isoformic variants that result from differential splicing of mRNA are known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inhibitors of Raf kinases have been suggested for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g. histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and pancreatic and breast carcinoma; also in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia and also after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery and/or during childbirth; also in chronic neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; also in the treatment of pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">We have now found a group of novel compounds that are inhibitors of Raf kinases, in particular inhibitors of B-Raf kinase.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the invention there is provided compounds of formula (I):</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be appreciated that for use in medicine the salts of the compounds of formula (I) should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in <i>J. Pharm. Sci</i>., 1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Other salts e.g. oxalates, may be used, for example in the isolation of compounds of formula (I) and are included within the scope of this invention.</p>

Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Compounds of formula (I) are furan, pyrrole and thiophene derivatives which may be readily prepared, using procedures well-known to those skilled in the art, from starting materials which are either commercially available or can be prepared from such by analogy with well-known processes. For instance see, W. Friedrichsen (p351, furans), R. J. Sundberg (p119, pyrroles) and J. Nakayama (p607, thiophenes) in <i>Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II</i>, volume 2, series eds. A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. V. Scriven.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Typically, compounds of this invention may be prepared by a sequential transition metal catalysed cross-coupling procedure on a 2,3-dihalo heterocycle, as shown in Scheme 1; this is particularly applicable for furan or thiophene derivatives, i.e. when either X<sub>1 </sub>or X<sub>2 </sub>are O or S. For example, Suzuki coupling of pyridine-4-boronic acid with 2,3-dibromofuran-5-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester (1) preferentially results in the formation of the 2-(4-pyridyl) derivative (2). Subsequent Suzuki reaction with an indanone boronic acid derivative (3, wherein PG is O, N—OMe or another ketone protecting group) then generates the derivative (4). Thereafter, the ester group may be converted into an amide group using appropriate conventional functional group interconversion procedures and the group PG converted into an hydroxyimino group as in (5). It will also be appreciated, to one skilled in the art, that the above cross-coupling reactions may be carried out in reverse order giving access to the regioisomeric heterocycles (6).</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0155">Activity of human recombinant B-Raf protein was assessed in vitro by assay of the incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate to recombinant MAP kinase kinase (MEK), a known physiologic substrate of B-Raf. Catalytically active human recombinant B-Raf protein was obtained by purification from Sf9 insect cells infected with a human B-Raf recombinant baculovirus expression vector. To ensure that all substrate phosphorylation resulted from B-Raf activity, a catalytically inactive form of MEK was utilised. This protein was purified from bacterial cells expressing mutant inactive MEK as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-kdMEK).

<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Neuroprotective Properties of B-Raf Inhibitors in Rat Hippocampal Slice Cultures</heading>
<p id="p-0156" num="0159">Organotypic cultures provide an intermediate between dissociated neuronal cell cultures and in-vivo models of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The majority of glial-neuronal interactions and neuronal circuitry are maintained in cultured hippocampal slices, so facilitating investigation of the patterns of death among differing cell types in a model that resembles the in vivo situation. These cultures allow the study of delayed cellular damage and death 24 hours, or more, post-insult and permit assessment of the consequences of long-term alterations in culture conditions. A number of laboratories have reported delayed neuronal damage in response to OGD in organotypic cultures of the hippocampus (Vornov et al., <i>Stroke</i>, 1994, 25, 57-465; Newell et al., <i>Brain Res</i>., 1995, 676, 38-44). Several classes of compounds have been shown to protect in this model, including EAA antagonists (Strasser et al., <i>Brain Res</i>., 1995, 687, 167-174), Na channel blockers (Tasker et al., <i>J. Neurosci</i>., 1992, 12, 98-4308) and Ca channel blockers (Pringle et al., <i>Stroke</i>, 1996, 7, 2124-2130). To date, relatively little is known of the roles of intracellular kinase mediated signalling pathways in neuronal cell death in this model.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0160">Method: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using the method of Stoppini et al., <i>J. Neurosci. Methods</i>, 1995, 37, 173-182. Briefly, 400 micron sections prepared from hippocampi of 7-8 day postnatal Sprague Dawley rats are cultured on semiporous membranes for 9-12 days. OGD is then induced by incubation in serum and glucose-free medium in an anaerobic chamber for 45 minutes. Cultures are then returned to the air/CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for 23 hours before analysis. Propidium iodide (PI) is used as an indicator of cell death. PI is non toxic to neurones and has been used in many studies to ascertain cell viability. In damaged neurons PI enters and binds to nucleic acids. Bound PI shows increased emission at 635 nm when excited at 540 nm. One PI fluorescence image and one white light image are taken and the proportion of cell death analysed. The area of region CA1 is defined from the white light image and superimposed over the PI image. The PI signal is thresholded and area of PI damage expressed as a percentage of the CA1 area. Correlation between PI fluorescence and histologically confirmed cell death has been validated previously by Niss1-staining using cresyl fast violet (Newell et al., <i>J. Neurosci</i>., 1995, 15, 7702-7711).</li>
