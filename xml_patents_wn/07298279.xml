<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to the field of equipment monitoring systems and more particularly to a system for monitoring the engagement of an end-cap on an open-end line.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Environmental regulatory agencies around the world have enacted numerous rules and regulations governing the release of gaseous emissions into the environment. The unintended release of gaseous pollutants into the environment, often referred to as “fugitive emissions,” can create significant concerns. Such emissions are often associated with the operation of industrial facilities, such as electric power plants and petroleum refineries. Pumps, compressors and other machines that operate under pressure are especially susceptible to fugitive emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Open-ended lines are frequently used for a wide variety of applications in a number of industrial environments. In many cases, open-ended lines are employed as sampling ports that can be used to conveniently draw samples from process equipment. In other situations, open-ended lines are used as vents downstream of pressure relief systems or valves. In these and other applications, open-ended lines are susceptible to fugitive emissions. Faulty valve seats or incompletely closed vales can result in leakage through the open end. To prevent fugitive emissions from open-ended lines, regulators encourage the use of blinds, caps, plugs or additional valves on the open-ended line.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although generally effective, such preventative modifications are nonetheless capable of failing. Accordingly, rigorous leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs must be followed. In the past, LDAR programs have placed particular emphasis on detecting the source of fugitive emissions after a leak has occurred. In most cases, a portable emission detector is used to periodically examine pieces of equipment that are susceptible to leakage. While effective at identifying the source of an emission, standard periodic evaluation cannot be relied upon to accurately determine when the leak first occurred or what volume of emissions were leaked over time. Furthermore, periodic monitoring for fugitive emissions is not well suited to forecast equipment failures that may lead to fugitive emissions. It is to these and other deficiencies in the prior art that the preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes an emission prevention system for use on an open-ended line. The emission prevention system preferably includes an end-cap configured for engagement on the open-ended line and a proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is preferably configured to detect a change in the extent of engagement between the end-cap and the open-ended line. Another aspect of the present invention includes a method of monitoring the engagement of an end-cap connected to an open-ended line. The method preferably includes the steps of measuring the engagement between the end-cap and the open-ended line with a proximity sensor, producing a position signal representative of the engagement between the end-cap and the open-ended line and transmitting the position signal to an operator terminal. In yet another aspect, a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a monitoring network for monitoring a plurality of sealed open-ended lines.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shown therein is a perspective view of an open-ended line <b>100</b> with an attached end-cap <b>102</b>. The open-ended line <b>100</b> may be used for a wide variety of applications in a number of industrial environments. In many cases, the open-ended line <b>100</b> is used as a sampling port that can be used to conveniently draw samples from process equipment. The end-cap <b>102</b> is generally used to prevent fugitive emissions from exiting the open-ended line <b>100</b>. As used herein, the term “end-cap” will refer to any cap, blind, plug, seal or other block used to seal an open-ended line. It will be understood that the utility of the preferred embodiments will find utility in a variety of installations, applications and industrial environments. Such additional applications may include, for example, tamper-alert security systems for water treatment facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown therein is a top view of the open-ended line <b>100</b> with a cross-sectional view of the end-cap <b>102</b>. The open-ended line <b>100</b> preferably includes a threaded end portion <b>104</b>. The end-cap <b>102</b> preferably includes a threaded socket <b>106</b> that is configured for threaded engagement with the threaded end portion <b>104</b>. The threaded engagement of end-caps on open-ended lines is well known in the art. To prevent the end-cap <b>102</b> from being removed from the open-ended line <b>100</b> when disengaged, the end-cap <b>102</b> optionally includes a cable tie <b>108</b> tethered to the open-ended line <b>100</b>. Unless otherwise specified, the open-ended line <b>100</b> and end-cap <b>102</b> are constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a monitoring device <b>110</b>. The monitoring device <b>110</b> is generally configured to detect and report a movement in or change in position between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the sensor <b>112</b> is an inductive proximity sensor that is capable of producing a “position signal” representative of the extent to which the end-cap <b>102</b> is threaded onto the open-ended line <b>100</b>. The monitoring device <b>110</b> and the end-cap <b>102</b> collectively form a monitoring system <b>114</b>. In a presently preferred application, the monitoring system <b>114</b> is used as an emission detection system. It will be understood, however, that the monitoring system <b>114</b> can be used for additional and alternative applications, such as, for example, as a tamper-detection security system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an alternate preferred embodiment, the sensor <b>112</b> is configured to provide an absolute signal (i.e., “on/off”) based on a predetermined threshold level of engagement. Suitable inductive proximity sensors are available from a variety of sources, including the Honeywell Corporation of Morristown, N.J. It will be understood that other types of proximity sensors, such as capacitive or ultrasonic sensors, could be used as an alternative to inductive proximity sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Depending on the requirements of specific applications, the monitoring device <b>110</b> may include additional components and functionality. For example, the monitoring device <b>110</b> optionally includes a communications module <b>116</b>. If used, the communications module <b>116</b> is operably connected to the sensor <b>112</b> and configured to transmit information from the sensor <b>112</b>. As discussed below, the communications module <b>116</b> may also be configured to receive and transmit information from other emission prevention devices as part of a larger monitoring network.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With these components, the monitoring system <b>114</b> is capable of monitoring the engagement of the end-cap <b>102</b> on the open-ended line <b>100</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the monitoring functionality is accomplished by measuring the engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b> with the proximity sensor <b>112</b>. The proximity sensor <b>112</b> then produces a “position signal” representative of the engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b>. The position signal is then preferably transmitted to an operator terminal for processing and observation. To preserve power, the monitoring device <b>110</b> can be configured to measure the engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b> on a periodic basis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an alternate preferred embodiment, the position signal is only transmitted to the operator terminal if a change in the engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b> is detected by the proximity sensor <b>112</b>. To detect a change in engagement over time, it may be necessary to calibrate the proximity sensor <b>112</b> with an “initial signal” that represents satisfactory engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b>. Once calibrated, the monitoring device <b>110</b> is preferably configured to transmit the position signal to the operator terminal if the end-cap becomes less than satisfactorily engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain applications, it may be necessary to separately identify unique monitoring systems <b>114</b> within a larger network. In a presently preferred embodiment, each monitoring system <b>114</b>, proximity sensor <b>112</b> or end-cap <b>102</b> is assigned an electronic identifier. The electronic identifier can then be paired with the position signal transmitted from the monitoring system <b>114</b>. In this way, input from multiple monitoring systems <b>114</b> can be differentiated and separately examined by automated controls or human operators.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the first preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the monitoring system <b>114</b> is configured with the monitoring device <b>110</b> secured inside the end-cap <b>102</b> in a position adjacent the threaded socket <b>106</b>. In this position, the monitoring device <b>110</b> is designed to detect the presence of the threaded end portion <b>104</b> of the open-ended line <b>100</b> within the threaded socket <b>106</b>. Because the monitoring device is housed inside the end-cap <b>102</b>, the preferred embodiment of the monitoring system <b>114</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is well suited for use on newly manufactured end-caps.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the monitoring device <b>110</b> is retained in a bore <b>118</b> that extends from the external surface of the end-cap <b>102</b> to a location proximate the threaded socket <b>106</b>. This configuration facilitates installation of the monitoring device <b>110</b> in the end-cap <b>102</b> without compromising the seal provided by the threaded socket <b>106</b>. Additionally, wired leads or antenna can be connected to the monitoring device <b>110</b> through the bore <b>118</b>. It will be understood that the configuration and installation of the monitoring device <b>110</b> within the end-cap <b>102</b> may vary depending on the particular requirements and specifications provided by the manufacturers of the selected components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shown therein is a top view of a second preferred embodiment of the monitoring system <b>114</b> installed on the open-ended line <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the end-cap <b>102</b> includes an integral flange <b>120</b>. The monitoring device <b>110</b> is secured with a movable fastener <b>122</b> to the open-ended line <b>100</b> in a position external to the end-cap <b>102</b>. Once the end-cap <b>102</b> has been installed, the monitoring device <b>110</b> can be adjusted with the movable fastener <b>122</b> into a position proximate the flange <b>120</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> is then configured to detect an initial distance between the monitoring device <b>110</b> and the flange <b>120</b>. In the event the end-cap <b>102</b> begins to disengage, the sensor <b>112</b> produces a “position signal” indicative of the change in position. Because the monitoring device <b>110</b> can be easily installed on an existing system without significant modification to the end-cap <b>102</b>, the alternate preferred embodiment disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is advantageous for retrofit applications.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The presently preferred embodiments of the monitoring system <b>114</b> have been disclosed as having an end-cap <b>102</b> that has a female threaded socket <b>106</b>. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, however, that the monitoring system <b>114</b> might alternatively make use of a plug that includes a male threaded portion manufactured to engage an open-ended line with a female receptacle. In such alternate embodiments, the monitoring device <b>110</b> could be either located on the open-ended line to detect the engagement of the plug or installed on the plug to detect the presence of the open-ended line.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shown therein is a functional representation of a first preferred embodiment of a monitoring network <b>200</b>. The monitoring network <b>200</b> includes a plurality of monitoring systems <b>114</b>, a receiver <b>202</b>, a receiver interface <b>204</b> and an operator terminal <b>206</b>. It will be understood that the monitoring devices <b>110</b> may be positioned internal to the end-caps <b>102</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), external to the end-caps <b>102</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or some combination of internally and externally positioned monitoring devices <b>110</b>. The monitoring network <b>200</b> is preferably constructed by connecting electrical wiring <b>208</b> between the sensors <b>112</b> and the receiver <b>202</b>. A separate communications module <b>116</b> may not be required to transfer information from the sensors <b>112</b> to the receiver <b>202</b>. Although electrical wiring <b>208</b> is presently preferred, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that alternative forms of wiring, such as, for example fiber optic cable, are also encompassed within the scope of this preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, the sensors <b>112</b> provide the receiver <b>202</b> with real time or periodic information about the engagement of the end-caps <b>102</b> on the open-ended lines <b>100</b>. This information is passed from the receiver <b>202</b> through the receiver interface <b>204</b> to the operator terminal <b>206</b>. In the event that an end-cap <b>102</b> starts to disengage or becomes completely disengaged from the associated open-ended line <b>100</b>, a notification is presented at the operator terminal <b>206</b>. In this way, corrective action can be taken as soon as the equipment failure occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, shown therein is a functional representation of a second preferred embodiment of a monitoring network <b>300</b>.

The monitoring network <b>300</b> is preferably configured as a wireless network in which signals from the sensors <b>112</b> are transmitted to the receiver <b>302</b> by the communications module <b>116</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For use in the monitoring network <b>300</b>, the communications module <b>116</b> preferably includes a wireless transmitter (not separately shown) that is configured to deliver a signal from the sensor <b>112</b> to the receiver <b>302</b> over a direct wireless transmission. In the event that the thread engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and open-ended line <b>100</b> changes, a notification is presented at the operator terminal <b>306</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, each monitoring device <b>110</b> is given a unique identification that accompanies the transmission of a position signal to the receiver <b>302</b>. Suitable wireless electronics are available from numerous sources, including Crossbow Technology, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, shown therein is a functional representation of a third preferred embodiment of the monitoring network <b>400</b>, which is configured as a cellular, ad hoc wireless network.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For use in the monitoring network <b>400</b>, each communications module <b>116</b> preferably includes a small computer, or “mote,” that is operably connected to the sensor <b>112</b>. Each mote preferably includes a small battery, a processor, memory, an onboard operating system and a bi-directional radio component. Each mote is preferably configured to send and receive signals from nearby motes or a nearby field receiver. When clustered together, the motes create a flexible, low-power network between the associated monitoring systems <b>114</b>. Suitable motes are available from Crossbow Technology, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a particularly preferred embodiment, each monitoring device <b>110</b> is given a unique identification that accompanies the transmission of information from the monitoring device <b>110</b>. The monitoring devices <b>110</b> are preferably configured to send position signals representative of the engagement between the end-cap <b>102</b> and the open-ended line <b>100</b> to the field receiver <b>402</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the monitoring device <b>110</b> is configured to only send a signal to the field receiver <b>402</b> in the event the end-cap <b>102</b> moves relative to the open-ended line <b>100</b>.
