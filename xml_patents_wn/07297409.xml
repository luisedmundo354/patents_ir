<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">There is substantial commercial interest in the use of multilayer, weatherable polymeric materials in various product forms such as sheets, films, shaped products, thermoformed articles, packaging, and architectural products, as well as coatings. Many different plastics are used as the base layer, or substrate, in these products in order to take advantage of particular physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. The upper layer, often referred to as the topcoat, often functions to protect the base layer or layers, for example to maintain gloss and shine. However, curing and aging of the layers can result in a color shift, often described as yellowing. This color shift may be observed immediately upon manufacture, or gradually over time. When a white or light colored finish is desired, yellowing of the upper layer is aesthetically undesirable to consumers. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for weatherable compositions, particularly upper coats, that provide protection to an underlying substrate, and that do not appreciably yellow during use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A weatherable, multilayer composition comprises a upper layer comprising a polymer system consisting essentially of a cycloaliphatic polyester resin, and an additive composition comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a low volatility hydroxyphenyl-triazine or -pyrimidine UV absorber; an intermediate layer comprising a polymer system consisting essentially of a cycloaliphatic polyester, and optionally an additive composition comprising TiO<sub>2</sub>, dyes, pigments, or special effects additives; and a polymeric substrate wherein the intermediate layer is disposed between, and in intimate contact with the upper layer and the substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been unexpectedly found by the inventors hereof that a weatherable, non-yellowing multilayer composition maybe achieved by using specific formulations for the various layers as disclosed herein. An upper layer (most commonly a upper coat) comprises a cycloaliphatic polyester resin, and an additive composition comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a low volatility hydroxyphenyl-triazine or -pyrimidine UV absorber. An intermediate layer comprises a cycloaliphatic polyester resin and optionally, additives including titanium dioxide (hereinafter referred to as TiO<sub>2</sub>), as well as dyes, pigments, and/or special surface effect additives. These two layers are disposed on a polymeric substrate, which preferably comprises polycarbonate and TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cycloaliphatic polyesters are preferred for use in the upper and intermediate layers, as they are characterized by optical transparency and improved weatherability when compared to many substrate compositions alone. Preferably, they also have improved chemical resistance and low water absorption when compared to the base substrate layer alone. In addition, cycloaliphatic polyester layers may also have melt compatibility with the substrate resin, allowing easy recycling of the multilayer structures through simple re-melting of the multilayer article and reforming one of the layers as a combination of the substrate and the cycloaliphatic layer. This attribute is in contrast to other layers known in the art, such as chlorinated polyolefins, which react upon re-melting to cause degradation of the base substrate layer resin, particularly if the base substrate layer resin is a high melting condensation polymer like polycarbonate as is used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cycloaliphatic polyesters suitable for use herein can be defined in many ways, including by method of preparation. For example, suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters may be prepared by reaction of a diol with a dibasic acid or derivative thereof, provided that at least a portion of the diol and/or the acid is cycloaliphatic. The diols useful in the preparation of suitable polyester resins are straight chain, branched, or cycloaliphatic, with straight chain or branched alkane diols containing at least 2 carbon atoms, and at most 12 carbon atoms on average. Examples of suitable diols include, but are not limited to, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol (i.e., 1,2- and 1,3-propylene glycol), butane diol (i.e., 1,3- and 1,4-butane diol), diethylene glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propane diol,2-ethyl, 2-methyl, 1,3-propane diol, 1,3- and 1,5-pentane diol, di-propylene glycol, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, triethylene glycol, 1,10-decane diol, mixtures of the foregoing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of preferred diols include dimethanol-bicyclo-octane, and dimethanol decaline. Most preferred diols are in general cycloaliphatic diols or chemical equivalents thereof, in particular 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol or a chemical equivalent thereof. In the instance when the preferred cycloaliphatic diol can contain a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers, a cis to trans ratio of at least about 1 to 4 cis/trans, and at most about 4 to 1 trans is preferred, a cis/trans ratio of about 1 to 3 cis/trans being most preferred. Also, chemical equivalents of diols include esters, such as dialkylesters, diaryl esters, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As mentioned above, suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters may be prepared by reaction of a diol with a dibasic acid or derivative. Di-acids (dibasic acids) useful in the preparation of suitable cycloaliphatic polyester resins have at least two carboxyl groups, each of which is attached to a saturated carbon in a saturated ring. A preferred diacid is 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and most preferred is trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid as further explained above. Other examples of suitable cycloaliphatic acids include decahydro-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, norbornene dicarboxylic acids, and bicyclo-octane dicarboxylic acids and salts thereof. Linear aliphatic diacids are useful herein provided the polyester has at least one monomer containing a cycloaliphatic ring. Examples of linear aliphatic diacids include, but are not limited to succinic acid, adipic acid, dimethyl succinic acid, azelaic acid and the like. Various mixtures of diacid and diols are also suitable for use herein to produce suitable cycloaliphatic polyesters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids and chemical equivalents thereof can be prepared, for example, by the hydrogenation of cycloaromatic diacids and corresponding derivatives such as isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid of naphthalenic acid in a suitable solvent. This process may also include preparation with water and/or acetic acid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using suitable catalysts such as rhodium supported on a suitable carrier of carbon or alumina, as disclosed in Friefelder et al., <i>Journal of Organic Chemistry, </i>31, 34-38 (1966); U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">During hydrogenation, two or more isomers of cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids may be obtained, in which the carboxylic acid groups are in both the cis- and trans-positions. The cis- and trans-isomers can be separated by crystallization with or without a solvent, for example, n-heptane, or by distillation. Cis-isomers tend to provides better blending; however, trans-isomers tend to have higher melting and crystallization temperatures, either of which may be preferred depending on the end use. As such, mixtures of the cis- and trans-isomers of cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids are also useful herein. When a mixture of isomers and/or more than one diacid is used, a copolyester or a mixture of two polyesters may also be used as the cycloaliphatic polyester resin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Chemical equivalents of these diacids include esters, alkyl esters, dialkyl esters, diaryl esters, anhydrides, acid chlorides, acid bromides, and the like.

When used in the form of a film the substrate has a thickness greater than about 0.5 mil, preferably greater than about 2 mils, most preferably greater than about 5 mils on average, and a thickness less than about 70 mils, preferably less than about 50 mils, most preferably less than about 30 mils on average.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The compositions used to manufacture each layer (or the substrate) may be formed by techniques known in the art, for example melt blending the ingredients in powder or granular form, extruding the blend and comminuting into pellets or other suitable shapes; or dry mixing the ingredients, followed by mixing in the melted state in an extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method of processing the compositions into films can be carried out by conventional film extrusion techniques, for example, by melting the different materials of the different layers in separate extruders and conveying those materials to a die where these different materials are combined into a film with a layered structure. Also included are blow molding and injection molding of the various layers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The compositions unexpectedly provide an enhanced combination of weatherability and heat aging properties, particularly as to yellowing or discoloration and gloss. Articles comprising the above-described composition accordingly have a change color (expressed in dE) of less than about 3, preferably less than about 2, and most preferably less than about 1.5 after 3000 hours of weathering according to the ISO4892-2A protocol. The compositions furthermore have a gloss (measured at an angle of 60 degrees) of more than about 60%, preferably more than about 70%, and more preferably more than about 80% and a change in gloss of less than about 20%, preferably less than about 15%, and more preferably less than about 10% after 3000 hours of weathering according to the ISO4892-2A protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternatively, articles comprising the above-described composition have a change in color (expressed in dE) of less than about 2, preferably less than about 1.5, and most preferably less than about 1 after heat aging at 80° C. for three months. The compositions furthermore have a gloss (measured at an angle of 60 degrees) of more than about 75%, preferably more than about 80%, and more preferably more than about 85% and have a change in gloss of less than about 15%, preferably less than about 10%, and more preferably less than about 5% after heat aging at 80° C. for three months.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The weatherable compositions are suitable for a wide variety of uses, for example in automotive applications such as body panels, cladding, and mirror housings; in recreational vehicles including such as golf carts, boats, and jet skies; and in applications for building and construction, including, for example, outdoor signs, ornaments, and exterior siding for buildings.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Evaluation of the above samples is presented in Table 2 below. Weathering was evaluated using ISO4892-2A. Heat aging was evaluated by placing the sample in an air circulation oven at 80° C. for three months. These tests were then followed by evaluation of gloss, gloss retention (dGloss) and color measurements. Gloss values were measured using ASTM D523 at a measurement angle of 60 degrees. The color test measures color of the weathered sample using a Cielab System, expressed in L, a and b values. The color change dE is calculated from the L, a and b values measured before and after the weathering test.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Example 1 clearly demonstrates the benefits of the multilayer composition disclosed herein. Under the test conditions, Example 1 demonstrates an increased level of weatherability and heat aging than would be expected by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the comparative examples. Specifically, UV2 package protects better against color shift than UV1, (compare e.g. sample 2 with samples 1, 3 and 6, and compare sample 4 with samples 5 and 7.) The presence of polycarbonate in the upper layer also leads to a larger color shift (compare sample 2 with sample 4, and compare samples 1 and 3 with samples 5, and 7).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The composition of the intermediate layer between the upper layer and the base substrate layer also affects color shift and gloss retention, wherein PCCD alone demonstrates an unexpected improvement compared to PCCD/PC and PC alone (compare samples 1 with samples 3, 5, 6 and 7). This is true even though gloss retention of the top layer is thought to be related to erosion phenomena at the exposed surface, which phenomena would not be expected to be affected by the composition of the intermediate layer.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition, although PCCD has a glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of about 60° C., unexpectedly the heat aging characteristics at 80° C. of Example 1 are superior to Sollx, which has a T<sub>g </sub>of about 145° C., as well as an upper layer of acrylic.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, the compositions disclosed herein provide for weatherable finishes, and in particular outer finishes that provide protection to an underlying surface or base substrate. Such compositions aid in maintaining gloss and shine, and furthermore do not appreciably yellow during use.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
