<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The image quality of a display device using a bottom gate TFT is improved. In particular, fluctuation in luminance is controlled and the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit is compensated by suppressing a change in amount of current flowing through an EL element which is caused by a change in surrounding temperature while the device is in use. A monitoring EL element is provided in addition to a pixel portion EL element. The monitoring EL element constitutes a temperature compensation circuit together with a buffer amplifier and the like. A current is supplied to the pixel portion EL element through the temperature compensation circuit. This makes it possible to keep the amount of current flowing through the pixel portion EL element constant against a change in temperature, and to control the fluctuation in luminance. An input signal is subjected to time base expansion to perform sampling with accuracy.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electronic display device fabricated by forming EL (electroluminescence) elements on a substrate, specifically, to an EL display device using a semiconductor element (an element formed from a semiconductor thin film). The invention also relates to electronic equipment employing the EL display device as a display unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The EL element herein includes both an element that utilizes light emission from a singlet exciton (fluorescence) and an element that utilizes light emission from a triplet exciton (phosphorescence).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Development of EL display devices having an EL element as a self-luminous element is flourishing in recent years. The EL display devices are also called organic EL displays (OELDS) or organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The EL display devices are self-luminous unlike liquid crystal display devices. The EL element is structured such that an EL layer is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes (an anode and a cathode). The EL layer usually has a laminate structure. Typical example thereof is a laminate structure consisting of a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transportation layer which has been proposed by Tang, et al. of Eastman Kodak Company. This structure is very high in light emission efficiency, and is employed by almost all of EL display devices currently under development.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other examples of the structure of the EL layer include a laminate structure consisting of an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transportation layer which are layered in this order, and a laminate structure consisting of an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transportation layer and an electron injection layer which are layered in this order. The light emitting layer may be doped with a fluorescent pigment or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this specification, all layers that are formed between an anode and a cathode are collectively called an EL layer. Therefore the EL layer includes all of the above hole injection layer, hole transportation layer, light, emitting layer, electron transportation layer and electron injection layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A pair of electrodes (a cathode and an anode) applies a given voltage to the EL layer structured as above, whereby carrier recombination takes place in the light emitting layer to cause the layer to emit light. The voltage applied between two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) of an EL element is herein referred to as EL driving voltage. An EL element emitting light is herein expressed as an EL element being driven. A light emitting element composed of an anode, an EL layer and a cathode herein will be referred to as EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing a multi-gray scale EL display device. The display device shown here is of the type that obtains gray scale by inputting a digital signal into a source signal line driving circuit and uses a digital gray scale method. Particularly the case of using time division gray scale method for varying the luminance by controlling the period of time during which a pixel emits light will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The EL display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has a pixel portion <b>101</b> and a source signal line driving circuit <b>102</b> and a gate signal line driving circuit <b>103</b> which are arranged in the periphery of the pixel portion <b>101</b>. The pixel portion and the driving circuits are composed of thin film transistors (hereinafter referred to as TFTs) formed on a substrate. An external switch <b>116</b> for controlling the EL driving voltage is connected to the pixel portion <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The source signal line driving circuit <b>102</b> includes, basically a shift register <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a latch (A) <b>102</b><i>b </i>and a latch (B) <b>102</b><i>c</i>. The shift register <b>102</b><i>a </i>receives input of a clock signal (CLK) and a start pulse (SP). The latch (A) <b>102</b><i>b </i>receives input of digital data signals (denoted by VD in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) whereas the latch (B) <b>102</b><i>c </i>receives input of latch signals (denoted by S_LAT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The digital data signals VD to be inputted to the pixel portion <b>101</b> are generated in a time division gray scale data signal generating circuit <b>114</b>. This circuit converts video signals that are analog signals or digital signals containing image information into the digital data signals VD for time division gray scale. The circuit <b>114</b> also generates a timing pulse or the like that is necessary for time division gray scale display.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Typically, the time division gray scale data signal generating circuit <b>114</b> includes means for dividing one frame period into a plurality of sub-frame periods in accordance with n bit gray scale (n is an integer of 2 or greater), means for selecting either a writing period or a display period in each of the plural sub-frame periods, and means for setting the length of the display period.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pixel portion <b>101</b> is structured generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the pixel portion <b>101</b> is provided with gate signal lines (G<b>1</b> to Gy) to which a selecting signal is inputted and source signal lines (also called data signal lines) (S<b>1</b> to Sx) to which a digital data signal is inputted. The digital data signal refers to a digital video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The pixel portion also has power supply lines (V<b>1</b> to Vx) parallel to the source signal lines (S<b>1</b> to Sx). The electric potential of the power supply lines (V<b>1</b> to Vx) is called a power supply electric potential. Wirings (Vb<b>1</b> to Vby) are provided in parallel with the gate signal lines (G<b>1</b> to Gy). The wirings (Vb<b>1</b> to Vby) are connected to the external switch <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A plurality of pixels <b>104</b> are arranged in matrix in the pixel portion <b>101</b>. One of the pixels <b>104</b> is enlarged and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference symbol <b>1701</b> denotes a TFT functioning as a switching element (hereinafter referred to as switching TFT). <b>1702</b> denotes a TFT functioning as an element for controlling a current supplied to an EL element <b>1703</b> (current controlling element) (The TFT will be called a driving TFT). Designated by <b>1704</b> is a capacitor storage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The switching TFT <b>1701</b> has a gate electrode connected to a gate signal line <b>1705</b> that is one of the gate signal lines (G<b>1</b> to Gy) to which a gate signal is inputted. The switching TFT <b>1701</b> has a source region and a drain region one of which is connected to a source signal line <b>1706</b> and the other of which is connected to a gate electrode of the driving TFT <b>1702</b> and to the capacitor storage <b>1704</b>. The source signal line <b>1706</b> is one of the source signal lines. (S<b>1</b> to Sx) to which a digital data signal is inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The driving TFT <b>1702</b> has a source region and a drain region one of which is connected to a power supply line <b>1707</b> and the other of which is connected to the EL element <b>1703</b>. The power supply line <b>1707</b> is one of the power supply lines (V<b>1</b> to Vx). The capacitor storage <b>1704</b> is connected to the power supply line <b>1707</b> that is one of the power supply lines (V<b>1</b> to Vx).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The EL element <b>1703</b> is composed of an anode, a cathode, and an EL layer interposed between the anode and the cathode. When the anode is connected to the source region or the drain region of the driving TFT <b>1702</b>, the anode serves as a pixel electrode whereas the cathode serves as an opposite electrode. On the other hand, when the cathode is connected to the source region or the drain region of the driving TFT <b>1702</b>, the cathode serves as the pixel electrode whereas the anode serves as the opposite electrode. The electric potential of the opposite electrode is herein called an opposite electric potential. The difference in electric potential between the opposite electrode and the pixel electrode generates the EL driving voltage, which is applied to the EL layer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The opposite electrode of the EL element <b>1703</b> is connected to the external switch <b>116</b> through one of the wirings (Vb<b>1</b> to Vby). (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.) Next, driving the multi-gray scale EL display device in accordance with the time division gray scale method will be described. The description given here takes as an example the case where n bit digital video signals are inputted to obtain display in 2<sup>n </sup>gray scales.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a timing chart thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">First, one frame period is divided into n sub-frame periods (SF<sub>1 </sub>to SF<sub>n</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A period during which one image is displayed using all of the pixels in the pixel portion is defined as one frame period (F). Here, one frame period is set to about 1/60 second. With the period set to this long, human eyes do not recognize flicker in animated images displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As the number of gray scales is increased, the number of sub-frame periods in one frame period also increases and the driving circuits (the source signal line driving circuit and the gate signal line driving circuit), the source signal line driving circuit in particular, has to be driven at a higher frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each sub-frame period is divided into a wiring period (Ta) and a display period (Ts). The writing period is a period for inputting signals into all of the pixels in one sub-frame period. The display period (also called a lights-on period) is a period for choosing whether or not the EL element emits light so that an image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The EL driving voltage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to the EL driving voltage of the EL element when the EL element is caused to emit light. To elaborate, the EL driving voltage of the EL element in the pixel which is designated to emit light is in the level that does not cause the EL element to emit light, e.g., 0 V, during the writing period. During the display period, on the other hand, the EL driving voltage thereof is in the level that allows the EL element to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The opposite electric potential is controlled by the external switch <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. During the writing period, the opposite electric potential is kept at the same level as the power supply electric potential. On the other hand, the opposite electric potential is changed in the display period so as to generate an electric potential difference between the opposite electric potential and the power supply electric potential which causes the EL element to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Detailed descriptions will be given first on the writing period and the display period of the respective sub-frame periods using the reference symbols in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Then time division gray scale display will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, a gate signal is inputted to the gate signal line G<b>1</b> to turn every switching TFT <b>1701</b> connected to the gate signal line G<b>1</b> ON.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this specification, a TFT being turned ON means that the gate voltage of the TFT is changed to make the source-drain thereof conductive.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Then the writing period is started and digital data signals are inputted to the source signal lines (S<b>1</b> to Sx). At this point the opposite electric potential is kept at the same level as the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines (V<b>1</b> to Vx). The digital data signals contain information of ‘0’ or ‘1’. The digital data signals of ‘0’ and ‘1’ are signals having Hi voltage and Lo voltage, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The digital data signals inputted to the source signal lines (S<b>1</b> to Sx) are inputted to the gate electrode of each driving TFT <b>1702</b> through each switching TFT <b>1701</b> that has been turned ON. The capacitor storage <b>1704</b> also receives input of a digital data signal to hold it in.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Selecting signals are successively inputted to the gate signal lines G<b>2</b> to Gy to repeat the above operation until all of the pixels receive input of the digital data signals and the inputted digital data signals are held in the respective pixels. A period it takes for the digital data signals to be inputted to all of the pixels in each sub-frame period is the writing period.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After inputting the digital data signals to all of the pixels, every switching TFT <b>1701</b> is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A TFT being turned OFF means that the gate voltage of the TFT is changed to make the source-drain thereof unconductive.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thereafter, the external switch <b>116</b> connected to the opposite electrode is used to change the electric potential difference between the opposite electric potential and the power supply electric potential to a degree that causes the EL element to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When a digital data signal has information of ‘0’, the driving TFT <b>1702</b> is turned OFF and the EL element <b>1703</b> does not emit light. When a digital data signal has information of ‘1’ on the other hand, the driving TFT <b>1702</b> is turned ON. Then the pixel electrode of the EL element <b>1703</b> is kept at the power supply electric potential and the EL element <b>1703</b> emits light. In this way, information contained in a digital data signal determines whether the EL element emits light or not. Every pixel whose EL element is designated to emit light is simultaneously lit up, and the lit-up pixels together form an image. A period during which the display by the pixels lasts is the display period.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The writing periods (Ta<sub>1 </sub>to Ta<sub>n</sub>) in the n sub-frame periods (SF<sub>1 </sub>to SF<sub>n</sub>) have the same length. The sub-frame periods SF<sub>1 </sub>to SF<sub>n </sub>have display periods Ts<sub>1 </sub>to Ts<sub>n</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For instance, the length of the display periods may be set so as to satisfy the relation Ts<sub>1</sub>:Ts<sub>2</sub>:Ts<sub>3</sub>: . . . :Ts<sub>(n−1)</sub>:Ts<sub>n</sub>=2<sup>0</sup>:2<sup>−1</sup>:2<sup>−2</sup>: . . . :2<sup>−(n−2)</sup>:2<sup>−(n−1)</sup>. Display of desired gray scales within the range of 2<sup>n </sup>gray scales can be obtained through combinations of the display periods.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, given pixels are lit up for the period Ts<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Then, a writing period is started again so that all the pixels receive digital data signals to start the display period. Subsequently, one of the display periods Ts<sub>1 </sub>to Ts<sub>(n−1</sub>) is started. Here, given pixels are lit up for the period Ts<sub>(n−1)</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The same operation is repeated for the remaining (n−2) sub-frame periods, so that the display periods Ts<sub>(n−2)</sub>, Ts<sub>(n−3)</sub>, and Ts<sub>1 </sub>are sequentially set and given pixels are lit up during each of the sub-frame periods.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One frame period is completed when n sub-frame periods have come and gone. The cumulative length of the display periods during which a pixel is lit up determines the gray scale of the pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the luminance is 100% when n=8 and the pixel in question emits light in all display periods. When the pixel emits light only in the display periods Ts<sub>1 </sub>and Ts<sub>2</sub>, the luminance is 75%. If the pixel is designated to emit light during the display periods Ts<sub>3</sub>, Ts<sub>5 </sub>and Ts<sub>8</sub>, the luminance may be 16%.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An object of the present invention is to improve the image quality of an EL display device, in particular, an EL display device using a bottom gate TFT. The object will be detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the time division gray scale method described above is employed, the amount of current flowing into an EL element in a pixel is desirably kept constant throughout the display period of each sub-frame period. In actuality, however, the amount of current varies depending on the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a graph showing the temperature characteristic of the EL element. The axis of abscissa shows the applied voltage that is applied between two electrodes of the EL element. The axis of ordinate shows the amount of current flowing into the EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One can tell from this graph how much current flows into the EL element when a voltage is applied between the electrodes of the EL element at a certain temperature. Temperature T<sub>1 </sub>is higher than temperature T<sub>2</sub>, which is higher than temperature T<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The graph shows that the same level of voltage applied between the electrodes of the EL element in the pixel portion does not always cause the same amount of current to flow through the EL element; the amount of current flowing into the EL element may increase as the temperature of the EL layer rises, depending on the temperature characteristic of the EL element.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus the amount of current flowing through the EL element in the pixel portion varies depending on the temperature at which the EL display device is used (hereinafter referred to as surrounding temperature), whereby the luminance of the EL element in the pixel portion is changed. Therefore the accuracy in gray scale display cannot be maintained, contributing to impaired reliability of EL display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, current consumption is increased when the amount of current flowing through the EL element is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another object of the present invention is to control those change in luminance and increase in power consumption of the EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, bottom gate TFTs have the following two problems.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Problem one is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In bottom gate TFTs, side walls of a gate electrode has to be gentle because, according to the manufacturing process, an insulating film and a semiconductor thin film are to be formed thereon. Therefore, the width of the gate electrode (gate length) in bottom gate TFTs cannot be as small as the width of a gate electrode (gate length) in top gate TFTs, where side walls of the gate electrode are not required to be so gentle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Problem Two is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In bottom gate TFTs, a gate electrode is formed under a semiconductor thin film that is to be used as a source region and a drain region and hence the semiconductor thin film is convexed. If a polycrystalline film such as a polysilicon film is used as the convex semiconductor thin film, the crystallinity of the film is inferior to that of a polycrystalline film formed on a flat surface, and characteristics such as an electric field effect mobility (mobility) are also poor.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Because of these problems, the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit composed of a bottom gate TFT is inferior to the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit composed of a top gate TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a display device that has a large display screen as well as a large number of pixels satisfying the VGA standard or higher, there are needed many source signal lines and high-speed operation. High-speed operation is also necessary in the case that the time division gray scale method described above is employed and a plurality of sub-frame periods are provided. Accordingly, the operation speed is insufficient especially in a source signal line driving circuit that uses a bottom gate TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To sum up the objects of the present invention, the invention aims at providing a display device which is capable of controlling the change in luminance and increase in current consumption of an EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature, and which can obtain a larger screen, higher definition and more gray scales despite the inferior frequency characteristic of a source signal line driving circuit that is composed of a bottom gate TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In order to attain the above objects, an EL element for monitoring the temperature (hereinafter referred to as monitoring EL element) is provided in an EL display device. One electrode of the temperature monitoring EL element is connected to a constant current generator. The temperature characteristic of the monitoring EL element is utilized to keep the amount of current flowing into an EL element of a pixel constant. Furthermore, a video signal is subjected to time base expansion so as to give margin to sampling of the video signal in a source signal line driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hereinafter, structures of the present invention are described.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the present invention, there is provided a display device comprising a plurality of EL elements of a plurality of pixels and a monitoring EL element, characterized in that the temperature characteristic of the monitoring EL element is used to reduce a change in amount of current flowing through the plural EL elements due to temperature change.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The structure of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Reference symbol <b>501</b> denotes a power supply line. The power supply line herein corresponds to a wiring for providing one electrode of an EL element (not shown) in a pixel portion with a given electric potential in response to a digital data signal inputted to a source signal line. In this specification, the electric potential of the power supply line is called a power supply electric potential.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Reference symbol <b>502</b> denotes a buffer amplifier, <b>503</b>., a monitoring EL element, and <b>504</b>, a constant current generator. One electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> is connected to the constant current generator <b>504</b>, so that a constant amount of current flows through the monitoring EL element <b>503</b>. When the temperature of an EL layer of the EL element changes, the amount of current flowing into the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> does not change but instead the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the constant current generator <b>504</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and an EL element in each pixel are manufactured such that the relation of the amount of current flowing into the element to the level of voltage applied between two electrodes of the element is the same for both the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and the pixel EL element at the same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Here, an electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the power supply line <b>501</b> is an anode if an electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> is an anode. On the other hand, if the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> is a cathode, the electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the power supply line <b>501</b> is a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">An electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is not connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> and an opposite electrode of the pixel portion EL element are given here almost the same electric potential.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The buffer amplifier <b>502</b> has two input terminals and one output terminal. One of the input terminals is a non-inversion input terminal (+) and the other is an inversion input terminal (−). The electric potential of one electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> is given to the non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier <b>502</b>. The output terminal of the buffer amplifier is connected to the power supply line <b>501</b>. The non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The buffer amplifier is a circuit for preventing load such as wiring capacitance of the power supply line <b>501</b> from changing the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the constant current generator <b>504</b>. Accordingly, the electric potential given to the non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> is outputted from the output terminal without being changed by load such as wiring capacitance of the power supply line <b>501</b> to be given as the power supply electric potential to the power supply line <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Therefore the power supply electric potential changes such that the amount of current flowing into the EL element is kept constant even when the surrounding temperature changes to change the temperature of the EL layers of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and of the pixel portion EL element. This prevents the change in luminance and increase in current consumption due to a change in surrounding temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">According to this embodiment mode, the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> may be formed on the same substrate as the pixel portion or on an IC chip. The same applies to the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and the constant current generator <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The monitoring EL element <b>503</b> may be included in the pixel portion or may be provided separately from the pixel portion.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment Mode 2</heading>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In the case where high-speed operation is required, as a measure to make up the insufficient frequency characteristic of a bottom gate TFT, a source signal line driving circuit composed of the bottom gate TFT is divided into several blocks. Each of the blocks simultaneously processes signals associated with some source signal lines, thereby increasing the processing speed of the source signal line driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">A description given first is of a case in which the source signal line driving circuit is driven with the circuit divided into several blocks while employing the time division gray scale method described in the example of prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a schematic diagram of the source signal line driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The source signal line driving circuit is divided into blocks associated with outputs to k source signal lines. Specifically, a latch (A) and a latch (B) each consist of m blocks (the latch (A) has a latch (A), 1 to a latch (A), m, and the latch (B) has a latch (B), 1 to a latch (B), m). Each block consists of k latch circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">A digital data signal VD inputted from the external is divided into k parts.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The digital data signal VD divided into k parts is obtained by using an external time division signal generating circuit to convert a digital video signal into a signal for the time division gray scale display described above, subjecting to time base expansion a signal of a writing period in each sub-frame period of the converted signal, and converting the expanded signal into a parallel signal for the respective signals associated with the k source signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">A circuit for conducting the time base expansion is provided separately from and outside of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">In response to a signal from a shift register, the block latch (A), 1 simultaneously samples the k parts of the digital data signal VD which are associated with the outputs to the k source signal lines. Similarly, the rest of the blocks of the latch (A) (the latch (A), 2 to the latch (A), m) are selected in order until the k parts of the digital data signal VD which are associated with the outputs to all source signal lines S_<b>1</b> to S_mk are held in the latch (A). Thereafter, a latch pulse is inputted to the latch (B). Upon input of the latch pulse, the signals held in the blocks of the latch (A) are inputted to the latch (B) all at once, and outputted to the source signal lines S_<b>1</b> to S_mk.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">As described above, it takes about 1/k time for the shift register of the source signal line driving circuit to process if the source signal line driving circuit is divided, as compared with the case where the source signal line driving circuit is not divided.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">It is effective also in other driving methods than the time division gray scale method to convert a digital video signal to be inputted to the source signal line driving circuit into a parallel signal for the respective signals associated with the k source signal lines and to simultaneously process the signals associated with the k source signal lines so that the source signal line driving circuit can operate with a margin.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">It is thus possible to provide a display device which has a source signal line driving circuit composed of a bottom gate TFT and is yet capable of obtaining a larger screen, higher definition and more gray scales.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Embodiment Modes 1 and 2 can be carried out in combination without restriction.</p>

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and an EL element (not shown) in each pixel are manufactured such that the relation of the amount of current flowing into the element to the level of voltage applied between two electrodes of the element is the same for both the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and the pixel EL element at the same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Here, an electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the power supply line <b>501</b> is an anode if an electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> is an anode. On the other hand, if the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> is a cathode, the electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the power supply line <b>501</b> is a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">An electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is not connected to the buffer amplifier <b>502</b> and an opposite electrode of the pixel portion EL element are given here almost the same electric potential.</p>

One of the input terminals is a non-inversion input terminal (+) and the other is an inversion input terminal (−).

<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The buffer amplifier is a circuit for preventing load such as wiring capacitance of the power supply line <b>501</b> from changing the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the constant current generator <b>504</b>.

<p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a detailed circuit diagram of the adder circuit according to this embodiment. The adder circuit <b>505</b> has a first resister <b>521</b>, a second resister <b>522</b>, an adder circuit power supply <b>525</b> and a non-inversion amplifier circuit <b>520</b>.

<p id="p-0253" num="0252">With the above structure, the power supply electric potential changes such that the amount of current flowing into the pixel portion EL element is kept constant even when the surrounding temperature changes to change the temperature of the EL layers of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> and of the pixel portion EL element. Therefore the luminance of the pixel portion EL element can be kept constant irrespective of a change in surrounding temperature of the EL display device.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The presence of the adder circuit <b>505</b> eliminates the need to set the electric potential of the power supply line <b>501</b> (power supply electric potential) to the same level as the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>503</b> which is connected to the constant current generator <b>504</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0260" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a case of manufacturing the buffer amplifier from a TFT that has the same structure as a TFT in a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The buffer amplifier is composed of TFTs <b>1901</b> to <b>1909</b>, a capacitor <b>1910</b>, constant current generators <b>1911</b> and <b>1912</b>, and power supply lines <b>1930</b> and <b>1931</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The description given here takes as an example the case in which the TFTs <b>1901</b>, <b>1902</b>, <b>1906</b> and <b>1909</b> are n-channel TFTs whereas the TFTs <b>1903</b> to <b>1905</b> and the TFTs <b>1907</b> and <b>1908</b> are p-channel TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The electric potential of the power supply line <b>1930</b> at this point is set higher than the electric potential of the power supply line <b>1931</b>. The electric potential of the power supply line <b>1931</b> is 0 V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but it is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The polarity of the TFTs according to this embodiment is not limited to the above. That is, any of the TFTs <b>1901</b> to <b>1909</b> can choose an n-channel TFT or a p-channel TFT. However, the TFTs <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b> constituting a differential amplifier <b>1921</b> have to have the same polarity and almost the same characteristics. Also, the TFTs <b>1903</b> and <b>1904</b> constituting a current mirror circuit <b>1922</b> have to have the same polarity and almost the same characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The operation of this buffer amplifier will be detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">A description will be made of the differential amplifier <b>1921</b> that is composed of the TFTs <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Source regions of the TFTs <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b> connected to each other are connected to the constant current generator <b>1911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">There is a difference between an electric potential inputted to a gate electrode of the TFT <b>1901</b> which corresponds to a non-inversion input terminal of an operation amplifier and an electric potential inputted to a gate electrode of the TFT <b>1902</b> which corresponds to an inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier. The electric potential difference makes the amount of current flowing between a drain and a source of the TFT <b>1901</b> different from that of the TFT <b>1902</b>. The currents in the TFTs <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b> are denoted by i<b>1</b> and i<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">The current mirror circuit <b>1922</b> is composed of the TFTs <b>1903</b> and <b>1904</b>. Source regions of the TFTs <b>1903</b> and <b>1904</b> are both connected to the power supply line <b>1930</b>. A drain region of the TFT <b>1904</b> and a gate electrode thereof are connected to each other. A gate electrode of the TFT <b>1903</b> is connected to the gate electrode of the TFT <b>1904</b>, and hence the gate electrodes of the two TFTs have the same electric potential. Accordingly, the amount of current flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT <b>1903</b> is the same as the amount of current flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT <b>1904</b>. This means that a current i<b>3</b> has to be inputted to the current mirror circuit <b>1922</b>. The current i<b>3</b> corresponds to the difference between the currents i<b>1</b> and i<b>2</b> respectively flowing through the TFTs <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b> of the differential amplifier <b>1921</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The current i<b>3</b> is supplied from the capacitor <b>1910</b>. The supply of the current i<b>3</b> increases an electric potential difference V<b>1</b> between electrodes of the capacitor <b>1910</b>.

<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The source ground amplifier circuit <b>1923</b> is composed of the TFT <b>1905</b>.

A current i<b>4</b> is supplied from the power supply line <b>1930</b> in accordance with the electric potential difference V<b>1</b>. The constant current generator <b>1912</b> only generates a constant current i<b>0</b>. A current i<b>5</b> corresponding to the difference between the current i<b>4</b> and the current i<b>0</b> is therefore inputted to a source follower buffer circuit <b>1924</b>. The current i<b>5</b> is increased in accordance with the amplified electric potential difference V<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">The source follower buffer circuit <b>1924</b> is composed of the TFTs <b>1906</b> and <b>1907</b>. The current i<b>5</b> inputted from the source ground amplifier circuit <b>1923</b> is inputted to a gate electrode of the TFT <b>1906</b>. With the input current i<b>5</b>, the gate electric potential of the TFT <b>1906</b> is raised to increase a current i<b>6</b> flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT <b>1906</b>. As a result, a larger amount of current than in the buffer amplifier is outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">When an output terminal of the buffer amplifier and the inversion input terminal thereof are connected to each other here, the buffer amplifier operates such that the electric potential of the output terminal obtains the same level as the electric potential of the non-inversion input terminal.

<p id="p-0276" num="0275">This embodiment describes a method of simultaneously manufacturing TFTs for a pixel portion of a display device according to the present invention and TFTs for driver circuit portions that are provided in the periphery of the pixel portion. To simplify the description, a CMOS circuit that is a basic unit of a driver circuit is illustrated as the driver circuit portions.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A to 19E</figref>, gate electrodes <b>502</b> to <b>505</b> are first formed from a chromium film on a glass substrate <b>501</b>. A silicon oxynitride film (an insulating film of SiOxNy) is used to form a gate insulating film <b>507</b> on the gate electrodes. On the gate insulating film <b>507</b>, an amorphous silicon film is formed and crystallized by laser annealing. The crystallized film is patterned to form semiconductor films <b>508</b> to <b>511</b> that are crystalline silicon films. The steps up through this point can be carried out with known materials and known techniques. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Next, insulating films <b>512</b> to <b>515</b> are formed from a silicon oxide film on the semiconductor films <b>508</b> to <b>511</b>. The semiconductor films are doped with phosphorus or arsenic through the insulating films. A known technique can be used as the doping method. As a result, n type impurity regions <b>516</b> to <b>519</b> are formed. The n type impurity regions <b>516</b> to <b>519</b> contain phosphorus or arsenic in a concentration of 1×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Using the gate electrodes <b>502</b> to <b>505</b> as masks, the insulating films <b>512</b> to <b>515</b> are patterned by back side exposure to form insulating films (channel protection films) <b>520</b> to <b>523</b>. In this state, doping of phosphorus or arsenic is again conducted by a known technique. As a result, n type impurity regions <b>524</b> to <b>531</b> are formed. The n type impurity regions <b>524</b> to <b>531</b> contain phosphorus or arsenic in a concentration of 1×10<sup>17 </sup>to 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Then resist masks <b>532</b> and <b>533</b> are formed to conduct doping of boron by a known technique. As a result, p type impurity regions <b>534</b> to <b>537</b> are formed. The p type impurity regions <b>534</b> to <b>537</b> contain boron in a concentration of 3×10<sup>20 </sup>to 5×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. Although the p type impurity regions <b>534</b> to <b>537</b> have already been doped with phosphorus or arsenic, now that they are doped with boron in a concentration 3 times the phosphorus or arsenic concentration or more, the conductivity of the regions <b>534</b> to <b>537</b> is shifted from n type to p type completely. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The resist masks <b>532</b> and <b>533</b> are then removed, and a first interlayer insulating film <b>538</b> having a laminate structure of a silicon oxide film and a silicon oxynitride film is formed. A contact hole is formed in the first interlayer insulating film <b>538</b> to form wirings <b>539</b> to <b>544</b> in which a molybdenum film and a tungsten film are layered. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Thereafter, a second interlayer insulating film <b>545</b>, a pixel electrode <b>546</b>, banks <b>547</b><i>a </i>and <b>547</b><i>b</i>, an EL layer <b>548</b>, a cathode <b>549</b> and a protective film <b>550</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. A light emitting device having the sectional structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is thus completed.</p>

<p id="p-0285" num="0284">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, reference numeral <b>4010</b> is a substrate, reference numeral <b>4011</b> is a pixel portion, reference numeral <b>4012</b> is a source signal side driver circuit, and reference numeral <b>4013</b> is a gate signal side driver circuit. The driver circuits are connected to external equipment, through an FPC <b>4017</b>, via wirings <b>4014</b> and <b>4016</b>. Reference numeral <b>4015</b> is a wiring for the power source supply line.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A covering material <b>6000</b>, a sealing material (also referred to as a housing material) <b>7000</b>, and an airtight sealing material (a second sealing material) <b>7001</b> are formed so as to enclose at least the pixel portion, preferably the driver circuits and the pixel portion, at this point.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a cross sectional structure of the EL display device of the present invention. A driver circuit TFT <b>4022</b> (note that a CMOS circuit in which an n-channel TFT and a p-channel TFT are combined is shown in the figure here), a pixel portion TFT <b>4023</b> (note that only a driver TFT for controlling the current flowing to an EL element is shown here) are formed on a base film <b>4021</b> on a substrate <b>4010</b>. The TFTs may be formed using a known structure (a top gate structure or a bottom gate structure).</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">After the driver circuit TFT <b>4022</b> and the pixel portion TFT <b>4023</b> are completed, a pixel electrode <b>4027</b> is formed on an interlayer insulating film (leveling film) <b>4026</b> made from a resin material. The pixel electrode is formed from a transparent conducting film for electrically connecting to a drain of the pixel TFT <b>4023</b>. An indium oxide and tin oxide compound (referred to as ITO) or an indium oxide and zinc oxide compound can be used as the transparent conducting film. An insulating film <b>4028</b> is formed after forming the pixel electrode <b>4027</b>, and an open portion is formed on the pixel electrode <b>4027</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">An EL layer <b>4029</b> is formed next. The EL layer <b>4029</b> may be formed having a lamination structure, or a single layer structure, by freely combining known EL materials (such as a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transporting layer, and an electron injecting layer). A known technique may be used to determine which structure to use. Further, EL materials exist as low molecular weight materials and high molecular weight (polymer) materials. Evaporation is used when using a low molecular weight material, but it is possible to use easy methods such as spin coating, printing, and ink jet printing when a high molecular weight material is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">In embodiment 4, the EL layer is formed by evaporation using a shadow mask. Color display becomes possible by forming emitting layers (a red color emitting layer, a green color emitting layer, and a blue color emitting layer), capable of emitting light having different wavelengths, for each pixel using a shadow mask. In addition, methods such as a method of combining a charge coupled layer (CCM) and color filters, and a method of combining a white color light emitting layer and color filters may also be used. Of course, the EL display device can also be made to emit a single color of light.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">After forming the EL layer <b>4029</b>, a cathode <b>4030</b> is formed on the EL layer. It is preferable to remove as much as possible any moisture or oxygen existing in the interface between the cathode <b>4030</b> and the EL layer <b>4029</b>. It is therefore necessary to use a method of depositing the EL layer <b>4029</b> and the cathode <b>4030</b> in an inert gas atmosphere or within a vacuum. The above film deposition becomes possible in embodiment 4 by using a multi-chamber method (cluster tool method) film deposition apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Note that a lamination structure of a LiF (lithium fluoride) film and an Al (aluminum) film is used in embodiment 3 as the cathode <b>4030</b>. Specifically, a 1 nm thick LiF (lithium fluoride) film is formed by evaporation on the EL layer <b>4029</b>, and a 300 nm thick aluminum film is formed on the LiF film. An MgAg electrode, a known cathode material, may of course also be used. The wiring <b>4016</b> is then connected to the cathode <b>4030</b> in a region denoted by reference numeral <b>4031</b>. The wiring <b>4016</b> is an electric power supply line for imparting a predetermined voltage to the cathode <b>4030</b>, and is connected to the FPC <b>4017</b> through a conducting paste material <b>4032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In order to electrically connect the cathode <b>4030</b> and the wiring <b>4016</b> in the region denoted by reference numeral <b>4031</b>, it is necessary to form a contact hole in the interlayer insulating film <b>4026</b> and the insulating film <b>4028</b>. The contact holes may be formed at the time of etching the interlayer insulating film <b>4026</b> (when forming a contact hole for the pixel electrode) and at the time of etching the insulating film <b>4028</b> (when forming the opening portion before forming the EL layer). Further, when etching the insulating film <b>4028</b>, etching may be performed all the way to the interlayer insulating film <b>4026</b> at one time. A good contact hole can be formed in this case, provided that the interlayer insulating film <b>4026</b> and the insulating film <b>4028</b> are the same resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">A passivation film <b>6003</b>, a filling material <b>6004</b>, and the covering material <b>6000</b> are formed covering the surface of the EL element thus made.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">In addition, the sealing material <b>7000</b> is formed between the covering material <b>6000</b> and the substrate <b>4010</b>, so as to surround the EL element portion, and the airtight sealing material (the second sealing material) <b>7001</b> is formed on the outside of the sealing material <b>7000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The filling material <b>6004</b> functions as an adhesive for bonding the covering material <b>6000</b> at this point. PVC (polyvinyl chloride), epoxy resin, silicone resin, PVB (polyvinyl butyral), and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) can be used as the filling material <b>6004</b>. If a drying agent is formed on the inside of the filling material <b>6004</b>, then it can continue to maintain a moisture absorbing effect, which is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Further, spacers may be contained within the filling material <b>6004</b>. The spacers may be a powdered substance such as BaO, giving the spacers themselves the ability to absorb moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">When using spacers, the passivation film <b>6003</b> can relieve the spacer pressure. Further, a film such as a resin film can be formed separately from the passivation film <b>6003</b> to relieve the spacer pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Furthermore, a glass plate, an aluminum plate, a stainless steel plate, an FRP (fiberglass-reinforced plastic) plate, a PVF (polyvinyl fluoride) film, a Mylar film, a polyester film, and an acrylic film can be used as the covering material <b>6000</b>. Note that if PVB or EVA is used as the filling material <b>6004</b>, it is preferable to use a sheet with a structure in which several tens of aluminum foil is sandwiched by a PVF film or a Mylar film.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">However, depending upon the light emission direction from the EL element (the light radiation direction), it is necessary for the covering material <b>6000</b> to have light transmitting characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Further, the wiring <b>4016</b> is electrically connected to the FPC <b>4017</b> through a gap between the sealing material <b>7001</b> and the substrate <b>4010</b>. Note that although an explanation of the wiring <b>4016</b> has been made here, the wirings <b>4014</b> and <b>4015</b> are also electrically connected to the FPC <b>4017</b> by similarly passing underneath the sealing material <b>7001</b> and sealing material <b>7000</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In addition, the filling material <b>6004</b> is formed so as to cover the EL element. The filling material <b>6004</b> also functions as an adhesive for bonding the covering material <b>6000</b>.

If a drying agent is provided on the inside of the filling material <b>6004</b>, then it can continue to maintain a moisture absorbing effect, which is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Further, spacers may be contained within the filling material <b>6004</b>. The spacers may be a powdered substance such as BaO, giving the spacers themselves the ability to absorb moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">When using spacers, the passivation film <b>6003</b> can relieve the spacer pressure. Further, a film such as a resin film can be formed separately from the passivation film <b>6003</b> to relieve the spacer pressure.</p>

Note that if PVB or EVA is used as the filler material <b>6004</b>, it is preferable to use a sheet with a structure in which several tens of aluminum foil is sandwiched by a PVF film or a Mylar film.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">However, depending upon the light emission direction from the EL element (the light radiation direction), it is necessary for the covering material <b>6000</b> to have light transmitting characteristics.</p>

The frame material <b>6001</b> is bonded by the sealing material (which functions as an adhesive) <b>6002</b>. It is preferable to use a light hardening resin as the sealing material <b>6002</b> at this point, but provided that the heat resistance characteristics of the EL layer permit a thermal hardening resin may also be used. Note that it is preferable that the sealing material <b>6002</b> be a material which, as much as possible, does not transmit moisture and oxygen.

<p id="p-0316" num="0315">A more detailed cross sectional structure of a pixel portion is shown here in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">A switching TFT <b>3502</b> formed on a substrate <b>3501</b> is manufactured by using a known method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. A single gate structure is used in embodiment 6. Note that although a single gate structure is used in embodiment 6, a double gate structure, a triple gate structure, and a multi gate structure possessing a greater number of gates may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">A single gate structure of the driver TFT <b>3503</b> is shown in the figures in embodiment 6, but a multi-gate structure in which a plurality of TFTs are connected in series may also be used. In addition, a structure in which a plurality of TFTs are connected in parallel, effectively partitioning into a plurality of channel forming regions, and which can perform radiation of heat with high efficiency, may also be used. Such structure is effective as a countermeasure against deterioration due to heat.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In this embodiment, an explanation is given in the case that the switching TFT and the driver TFT are both n-channel TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The driver TFT <b>3503</b> is formed by a known method. The drain wiring <b>35</b> of the switching TFT <b>3502</b> is connected electrically to the gate wiring <b>37</b> of the driver TFT <b>3503</b>. The drain wiring <b>40</b> of the driver TFT <b>3503</b> is connected to the cathode <b>43</b> of EL element. Furthermore, a source region <b>34</b> of the driver TFT <b>3503</b> is connected to an electric power supply line (not shown in the figures), and a constant voltage is always applied.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">A leveling film <b>42</b> from an insulating resin film is formed on the switching TFT <b>3502</b> and the driver TFT <b>3503</b>. It is extremely important to level the step due to the TFTs using the leveling film <b>42</b>. An EL layer formed later is extremely thin, so there are cases in which defective light emissions occur. Therefore, to form the EL layer with as level a surface as possible, it is preferable to perform leveling before forming a pixel electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Furthermore, reference numeral <b>43</b> denotes a pixel electrode (EL element cathode) made from a conducting film with high reflectivity, and this is electrically connected to a drain region <b>40</b> of the driver TFT <b>3503</b>. It is preferable to use a low resistance conducting film, such as an aluminum alloy film, a copper alloy film, and a silver alloy film, or a laminate of such films. Of course, a lamination structure with another conducting film may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">In addition, a light emitting layer <b>45</b> is formed in the middle of a groove (corresponding to a pixel) formed by banks <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b</i>, which are formed by insulating films (preferably resins). Note that only one pixel is shown in the figures here, but the light emitting layer may be divided to correspond to each of the colors R (red), G (green), and B (blue). A π-conjugate polymer material is used as an organic EL material. Polyparaphenylene vinylenes (PPVs), polyvinyl carbazoles (PVKs), and polyfluoranes can be given as typical polymer materials.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Note that there are several types of PPV organic EL materials, and materials recorded in Schenk, H., Becker, H., Gelsen, O., Kluge, E., Kreuter, W., and Spreitzer, H., “Polymers for Light Emitting Diodes,” Euro Display Proceedings, 1999, pp. 33–7, and in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 10-92576, for example, may be used. The entire disclosures of these article and patent are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">As specific light emitting layers, cyano-polyphenylene vinylene may be used as a red light radiating luminescence layer, polyphenylene vinylene may be used as a green light radiating luminescence layer, and polyphenylene vinylene or polyalkylphenylene may be used as a blue light radiating luminescence layer. The film thicknesses may be between 30 and 150 nm (preferably between 40 and 100 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">However, the above example is one example of the organic EL materials which can be used as luminescence layers, and it is not necessary to limit use to these materials. An EL layer (a layer for emitting light and for performing carrier motion for such) may be formed by freely combining light emitting layers, electric charge transporting layers, and electric charge injecting layers.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">For example, embodiment 6 shows an example of using a polymer material as a light emitting layer, but a low molecular weight organic EL material may also be used. Further, it is possible to use inorganic materials such as silicon carbide, as an electric charge transporting layer or an electric charge injecting layer. Known materials can be used for these organic EL materials and inorganic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">An anode <b>47</b> is then formed on the light emitting layer <b>45</b> from a transparent conducting film. The light generated by the light emitting layer <b>45</b> is radiated toward the upper surface (toward the reverse direction to the substrate on which is formed TFT) in embodiment 6, and therefore the anode must be transparent to light. An indium oxide and tin oxide compound, or an indium oxide and zinc oxide compound can be used for the transparent conducting film. However, because it is formed after forming the low heat resistance light emitting and hole injecting layers, it is preferable to use a material which can be deposited at as low a temperature as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">An EL element <b>3505</b> is complete at the point where the anode <b>47</b> is formed. Note that what is called the EL element <b>3505</b> here is formed by the pixel electrode (cathode) <b>43</b>, the light emitting layer <b>45</b>, and the anode <b>47</b>. The pixel electrode <b>43</b> is nearly equal in area to the pixel, and consequently the entire pixel functions as an EL element. Therefore, the light emitting efficience is extremely high, and a bright image display becomes possible. In addition, a second passivation film <b>48</b> is then formed on the anode <b>47</b> in embodiment 6.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">It is preferable to use a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film as the second passivation film <b>48</b>. The purpose of this is the isolation of the EL element from the outside, and this is meaningful in preventing degradation due to oxidation of the organic EL material, and in controlling gaseous emitted from the organic EL material. The reliability of the EL display device can thus be raised Note that n-channel TFTs and p-channel TFTs may be used for the driver TFT. However, in a case the anode of the EL element is an opposite electrode and the cathode of the EL element is a pixel electrode, it is preferable that the driver TFT be an n-channel TFT. Note that it is possible to implement the constitution of embodiment 6 by freely combining it with the constitutions of any of embodiments 1 to 5.</p>

<p id="p-0370" num="0369">In the amorphous semiconductor, a large quantity of trap level is present, and at the same time, the amorphous semiconductor forms a large quantity of interface levels at an interface at which the amorphous semiconductor contacts other layers. As a consequence, the EL element can emit light at a low voltage, and at the same time, an attempt can be made to provide a high luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">Besides, a dopant (impurity) is added to the organic EL layer, and the color of light emission of the organic EL layer may be changed. This dopant includes DCM1, nile red, lubren, coumarin 6, TPB and quinaquelidon.</p>

<p id="p-0373" num="0372">This embodiment gives a description on a case of manufacturing an EL display device in accordance with the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> is a top view of an active matrix substrate with an EL element formed and enclosed thereon. Regions <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> and <b>803</b> sectioned by dotted lines are a source signal line driving circuit, a gate signal line driving circuit and a pixel portion, respectively. Reference symbol <b>804</b> denotes a covering member, <b>805</b>, a first sealing member, and <b>806</b>, a second sealing member. A filler <b>807</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>) is provided in a space between the active matrix substrate and the covering member within the surrounding first sealing member <b>805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">Denoted by <b>808</b> is a connection wiring for transmitting signals to be inputted to the source signal line driving circuit <b>801</b>, the gate signal line driving circuit <b>802</b> and the pixel portion <b>803</b>. The wiring receives a video signal, a clock signal and the like from an FPC (flexible printed circuit) <b>809</b> that-serves as a terminal for connecting the display device with external equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> is cut along the line A–A′ and the sectional view thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the pixel portion <b>803</b> and the source signal line driving circuit <b>801</b> are formed on a substrate <b>800</b>. The pixel portion <b>803</b> is comprised of a plurality of pixels each having a TFT <b>851</b> that controls the amount of current flowing into an EL element (driving TFT), a pixel electrode <b>852</b> that is electrically connected to a drain region of the TFT <b>851</b>, and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">In this embodiment, the driving TFT <b>851</b> is a p-channel TFT. The driving TFT will be described as a representative of TFTs that constitute the pixel portion. A CMOS circuit in which an n-channel TFT <b>853</b> and a p-channel TFT <b>854</b> are combined complementarily will be described as a representative of TFTs that constitute the source signal line driving circuit <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">Each pixel has, under the pixel electrode <b>852</b>, one of a color filter (R) <b>855</b>, a color filter (G) <b>856</b> and a color filter (B) (not shown). The color filter (R) is a color filter for extracting red light, the color filter (G) is a color filter for extracting green light, and the color filter (B) is a color filter for extracting blue light. The color filter (R) <b>855</b> is provided in a red light emitting pixel, the color filter (G) <b>856</b> is provided in a green light emitting pixel, and the color filter (B) is provided in a blue light emitting pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">The first thing given as an effect of these color filters is that the purity of emitted light is improved in terms of color. For example, the EL element of a red light emitting pixel emits red light (toward the pixel electrode side in this embodiment) and the emitted red light passes through the color filter for extracting red light to gain an improved purity of red color. The same applies to cases of green light and blue light.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">In a conventional structure where a color filter is not used, visible light can enter from the outside of the EL display device to excite a light emitting layer of an EL element and to make the color of emitted light different from the desired color. On the other hand, when a color filter is used as in this embodiment, only a specific wavelength of light is allowed to enter an EL element. Thus the inconvenience of EL element being excited by external light can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">There have been proposed some structures that include using a color filter. The EL element used in these conventional cases is one that emits white light. With the EL element emitting white light, red light is extracted by cutting other wavelengths of light, which invites lowering of luminance. On the other hand, this embodiment in which red light emitted from an EL element passes through the color filter for extracting red light does not lower the luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The pixel electrode <b>852</b> is formed from a transparent conductive film and functions as an anode of the EL element. An insulating film <b>857</b> is formed on each side of the pixel electrode <b>852</b>, and a light emitting layer <b>858</b> for emitting red light and a light emitting layer <b>859</b> for emitting green light are further formed. Though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a light emitting layer for emitting blue light is formed in a pixel adjacent to the pixel having the light emitting layer <b>859</b>. Thus color display is obtained by pixels emitting red light, green light and blue light. Needless to say, the pixel having the light emitting layer for emitting blue light is provided with the color filter for extracting blue light.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">Other than organic materials, inorganic materials can be used as the EL material. The light emitting layer may be used in combination with one or more of an electron injection layer, an electron transportation layer, a hole transportation layer and a hole injection layer to form a laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">A cathode <b>860</b> of the EL element is formed on the light emitting layers from a light-shielding conductive film. The cathode <b>860</b> is shared by all the pixels, and is electrically connected to the FPC <b>809</b> through the connection wiring <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Then the first sealing member <b>805</b> is formed using a dispenser or the like, a spacer (not shown) is sprayed, and the covering member <b>804</b> is bonded. The filler <b>807</b> is filled into a region surrounded by the active matrix substrate, the covering member <b>804</b> and the first sealing member <b>805</b> by vacuum injection.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">In this embodiment, the filler <b>807</b> is doped in advance with barium oxide as a hygroscopic substance <b>861</b>. Although the filler is doped with the hygroscopic substance in this embodiment, it may be contained in the filler in chunks dispersed throughout the filler. Alternatively, though not shown, the hygroscopic substance may be used as a material for the spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">The filler <b>807</b> is then cured by irradiation of ultraviolet light or by heating. Thereafter, an opening (not shown) formed in the first sealing member <b>805</b> is closed. After closing the opening in the first sealing member <b>805</b>, the connection wiring <b>808</b> is electrically connected to the FPC <b>809</b> with a conductive material <b>862</b>. The second sealing member <b>806</b> is placed so as to cover the exposed portion of the first sealing member <b>805</b> and a part of the FPC <b>809</b>. The second sealing member <b>806</b> can be formed from the same material as the first sealing member <b>805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">The EL element is enclosed in the filler <b>807</b> in accordance with the method described above, whereby the EL element is completely shut out from the outside and moisture and substances promoting oxidation of the organic material, such as oxygen, can be prevented from entering the EL element from the outside. Thus an EL display device of high reliability can be manufactured.</p>

<p id="p-0392" num="0391">A pixel portion <b>901</b> is comprised of a plurality of pixels each having a TFT <b>902</b> that controls the amount of current flowing into the EL element (driving TFT), a pixel electrode <b>903</b> that is electrically connected to a drain region of the TFT <b>902</b>, and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">In this embodiment, an n-channel TFT is used for the driving TFT <b>902</b> in the pixel portion <b>901</b>. The drain of the driving TFT <b>902</b> is electrically connected to the pixel electrode <b>903</b>, which is formed from a light-shielding conductive film.

<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Another feature of this embodiment is that a color filter (R) <b>905</b>, a color filter (G) <b>906</b> and a color filter (B) (not shown) are formed in the covering member <b>804</b>.

<p id="p-0400" num="0399">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a temperature compensation circuit <b>701</b> is composed of a constant current generator <b>704</b>, a monitoring EL element <b>703</b> and a buffer amplifier <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">An output of the constant current generator <b>704</b> is connected to one electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>703</b> and to an input terminal of the buffer amplifier <b>702</b>.

<p id="p-0402" num="0401">The output of the temperature compensation circuit <b>701</b> is connected to a power supply line <b>705</b>, which gives an electric potential to a pixel electrode of an EL element (not shown) in a pixel through the source-drain of a driving TFT (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">The constant current generator <b>704</b> is composed of an amplifier <b>706</b>, a variable resister <b>707</b> and a transistor <b>708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">The transistor <b>708</b> is a p-channel TFT in the description given in this embodiment but the transistor is not limited thereto. The polarity of this transistor may be of an n-channel TFT or of a p-channel TFT. Alternatively, the transistor may be a bipolar transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">The transistor <b>708</b> has a source region connected to an inversion input terminal (−) of the amplifier <b>706</b> and to the variable resister <b>707</b>, and has a drain region connected to an output terminal of the constant current generator <b>704</b>. A gate electrode of the transistor <b>708</b> is connected to an output terminal of the amplifier <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">A constant voltage V<b>2</b> is inputted to a non-inversion terminal (+) of the amplifier <b>706</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0408" num="0407">The monitoring EL element <b>703</b> connected to the constant current generator <b>701</b> operates so as to cause a constant current generated by the constant current generator <b>701</b> to flow. If there is a change in surrounding temperature while the display device is in use, the amount of current flowing through the monitoring EL element <b>703</b> does not change. Instead, the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the constant current generator <b>704</b> is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">The monitoring EL element <b>703</b> and an EL element in a pixel are manufactured such that the relation of the amount of current flowing into the element to the level of voltage applied between two electrodes of the element is the same for both the monitoring EL element <b>703</b> and the pixel EL element at the same temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">The electric potential of an electrode of the monitoring EL element <b>703</b> which is not connected to the constant current generator <b>704</b> and to a non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier <b>702</b> is set to the same level as the electric potential of an opposite electrode of the EL element in each pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">In the temperature compensation circuit, an electrode of a pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier has to be an anode if the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the output of the buffer amplifier and to the constant current generator is an anode. On the other hand, in the temperature compensation circuit, the electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier has to be a cathode if the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the output of the buffer amplifier and to the constant current generator is a cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">A case in which the anode of the monitoring EL element is connected to the constant current generator <b>704</b> and the buffer amplifier <b>702</b> is considered here in this embodiment. In this case, the pixel electrode of the pixel EL element is an anode.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">In order to cause a current to flow into the monitoring EL element, an electric potential V<b>1</b> is set to a level higher than an input electric potential V<b>2</b>. The electric potential V<b>1</b> is the electric potential of the terminal of the variable resister <b>707</b> which is not connected to the transistor <b>708</b> and to the non-inversion input terminal of the amplifier <b>706</b>. The input electric potential V<b>2</b> is the electric potential inputted to the non-inversion input terminal of the amplifier <b>706</b>.

<p id="p-0414" num="0413">When the electric potential V<b>3</b> of the anode of the monitoring EL element <b>703</b> is changed to change the voltage between the two electrodes thereof, the electric potential of the anode of the pixel EL element is similarly changed to change the voltage between the two electrodes thereof. This change in voltage works to cause a constant current provided by the constant current generator <b>704</b> at the surrounding temperature to flow also into the pixel portion EL element. In this way, the pixel portion EL element receives a constant current irrespective of a change in surrounding temperature and emits light of constant luminance.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">The structure of the constant current generator is not limited to the structure of <b>704</b>, but a constant current generator circuit of any known structure can be employed without restriction.</p>

<p id="p-0417" num="0416">This embodiment shows results of measuring a change in luminance of a pixel EL element in a display device of the present invention which is caused by a change in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a graph showing the measurement results. In the graph, the axis of ordinate shows the luminance (cd/m<sup>2</sup>) and the axis of abscissa shows the temperature (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">The results shown are of the case where the temperature compensation circuit structured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">The graph also shows results of measuring a change in luminance of a pixel EL element due to a temperature change in a display device that does not have a temperature compensation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">In the case where no temperature compensation circuit is provided, the luminance of an EL element is increased as the temperature rises. On the other hand, in the case of using the temperature compensation circuit, the luminance of an EL element is almost constant irrespective of the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">The present invention thus can prevent the change in luminance of a pixel portion EL element in a display device due to a temperature change by using a temperature compensation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">The invention is also advantageous in the following point. The EL layer constituting the EL element is formed mainly from organic compounds and degradation thereof is a problem required to be solved. Comparing the case in which a pixel EL element emits light upon receiving a constant current flowing between the electrodes of the element with the case in which a pixel EL element emits light upon receiving a constant voltage applied between the electrodes of the element, lowering of luminance due to the degradation of EL element is less in the former case. Therefore inputting a constant current into a pixel EL element in order to cause the element to emit light as in this embodiment is capable of limiting the lowering of luminance due to the degradation of its EL layer.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">Thus can be obtained a display device in which the luminance of a pixel EL element is not changed by a change in surrounding temperature and the luminance is lowered less when the EL element is degraded.</p>

<p id="p-0434" num="0433">Conventional EL display devices have problems such as fluctuation in luminance and increased current consumption, for the amount of current flowing into an EL element is changed by a change in surrounding temperature while the devices are in use depending on the temperature characteristic of the EL element even if the voltage applied to the EL element is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">Also, a source signal line driving circuit composed of a bottom gate TFT is a hindrance for a display device to obtain a larger screen and more gray scales because of its poor frequency characteristic and resulting slow operation.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">The present invention employs the above structures to keep the amount of current flowing into a pixel portion EL element constant against a change in temperature. The invention also gives a margin to sampling of a video signal in the source signal line driving circuit by subjecting the video signal to time base expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">In this way, the invention can provide a display device which can prevent the change in luminance and increase in current consumption of the EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature and which can obtain a larger screen, higher definition and more gray scales by compensating the frequency characteristic of a source signal line driving circuit that is composed of a bottom gate TFT.</p>
