<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/721,494 filed on Nov. 25, 2003, which issued on Nov. 7, 2006 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,131,565.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to injection molded solder systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to devices and methods for feeding solder to injection molded solder systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Injection molded solder (IMS) systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,244,143, 5,971,058, and 6,231,333, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the content of each of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto. IMS systems are used for filling cavities in a graphite mold with molten solder that will be subsequently transferred and attached to a variety of electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, IMS systems include a reservoir for molten solder, which is disposed over an injection plate or head. The injection plate is disposed over a graphite mold. The graphite mold when filled with solder, is in turn, disposed over a workpiece, such as a multi-layer ceramic substrate. The cavities in the graphite mold are aligned with the desired electrical contact locations on the substrate. To fill the graphite mold, molten solder is forced under gas pressure and/or drawn via vacuum from the reservoir through the injection head and into the mold cavities, which are later transferred to form electrical pathways on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to properly form the desired electrical pathways, each cavity in the graphite mold is filled with molten solder during each molding cycle. In prior IMS systems, it has been necessary to interrupt the molding process between cycles to manually insert solder into the reservoir. For example, in molds having two thousand 20 mil holes the equivalent of a six inch length of 0.125 inches in diameter solder wire is required to fill the mold for each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it is desired to continuously operate IMS systems and, thus, it has been determined by the present application that a need exists for devices and methods that continuously and automatically feed solder to the reservoir of such IMS systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Devices and methods are provided for automatically feeding solder, in a solid state, to a reservoir of molten solder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Devices and methods that automatically feed solid solder wire to a reservoir of liquid solder in fluid communication with an injection molding solder head are also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a solder feeding device having a reservoir, a drive unit, a first lead, and a second lead is provided. The reservoir melts solid solder wire into molten solder, while the drive unit selectively feeds the solid solder wire into the reservoir. The first and second leads are in electrical communication with the drive unit. The first lead is positioned in the reservoir so that it electrically communicates with the second lead through the molten solder when the molten solder reaches a triggering level, but so that it does not electrically communicate with the second lead when the level is below the triggering level. The drive unit feeds the solid solder wire into the reservoir based upon a state of electrical communication between the first and second leads.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other embodiments, the solder feeding device includes a reservoir, a drive unit, a control circuit, and a pair of leads. The reservoir melts a solid solder wire into molten solder and is fluidly connectable to an injection molded solder system. The drive unit selectively feeds the solid solder wire into the reservoir. The control circuit has an open state and a closed state and can control the drive unit to feed the solid solder wire into the reservoir based on the open state or the closed state. The pair of leads are in electrical communication with the control circuit. The control circuit is in the closed state when the pair of leads are in electrical communication with one another. Conversely, the control circuit is in the open state when the pair of leads are not in electrical communication with one another. The pair of leads electrically communicate with one another through the molten solder when the molten solder fills the reservoir to a triggering level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still other embodiments, a method of feeding solid solder wire to a reservoir of molten solder is provided. The method includes positioning a first lead in the reservoir so that the first lead electrically communicates with a second lead through the molten solder when a level of the molten solder is at least equal to a triggering level and so that the first lead does not electrically communicate with the second lead when the level is below the triggering level; activating a drive unit to feed the solid solder wire to the reservoir when the molten solder in the reservoir is below the triggering level; and deactivating the drive unit when the molten solder in the reservoir is at and above the triggering level.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above-described and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to the drawings and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a solder feed device according to the present disclosure is illustrated by way of reference numeral <b>10</b>. Device <b>10</b> has a drive unit <b>12</b>, a control circuit <b>14</b>, and a first lead <b>16</b>, and a second lead <b>18</b>. The first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are in electrical communication with control circuit <b>14</b>, which is in electrical communication with drive unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Drive unit <b>12</b> can be, for example, a Freehand Industrial Solder Feeder commercially available from Schurman Products Inc. Of course, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for drive unit <b>12</b> to be any solder driving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Control circuit <b>14</b> is configured to selectively activate and deactivate drive unit <b>12</b> based on input from first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. When activated, feed unit feeds solid solder wire <b>20</b> to a solder reservoir <b>22</b> of an injection molded solder (IMS) system. For example, solder reservoir <b>22</b> can supply molten solder <b>24</b> to an IMS injection head <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In use, reservoir <b>22</b> is filled to a triggering level <b>28</b> of molten solder <b>24</b>. Reservoir <b>22</b> can be filled to triggering level <b>28</b> by, for example, activating drive unit <b>12</b> to feed solid solder wire <b>20</b> into the reservoir. Reservoir <b>22</b> is maintained at a temperature sufficient to melt solid solder wire <b>20</b> into molten solder <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, reservoir <b>22</b> can include a heater <b>30</b>, such as a resistance wire. Thus, any solid solder wire <b>20</b> touching molten solder <b>24</b> in reservoir <b>22</b> will also melt. As this action continues, the level of molten solder <b>24</b> in reservoir <b>22</b> will rise.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Solid solder wire <b>20</b> is fed into reservoir <b>22</b> until the level of molten solder <b>24</b> reaches triggering level <b>28</b>. At triggering level <b>28</b>, first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are both in electrical communication or contact with molten solder <b>24</b>. Namely, device <b>10</b> uses molten solder <b>24</b> as a conductive medium to selectively place first lead <b>16</b> and second lead <b>18</b> in electrical communication with one another when the level of the molten solder reaches triggering level <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> can have a terminal end <b>32</b> positioned in reservoir <b>22</b> at triggering level <b>28</b>. In an alternate embodiment, second lead <b>18</b> can have its terminal end <b>32</b> positioned in reservoir <b>22</b> below triggering level <b>28</b>, while first lead <b>16</b> can have its terminal end <b>32</b> positioned at triggering level <b>28</b>. In both examples, the conductive properties of molten solder <b>24</b> in reservoir <b>22</b> places first lead <b>16</b> in electrical communication with second lead <b>18</b> when the level of the molten solder reaches triggering level <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Control circuit <b>14</b> acts as a switch for drive unit <b>12</b> depending on the state of contact among first lead <b>16</b>, second lead <b>18</b> and molten solder <b>24</b>. Control circuit <b>14</b> has a relay <b>34</b>, a contact <b>36</b>, and a source of control power <b>38</b>. Control circuit <b>14</b> selectively applies and removes control power <b>38</b> to/from drive unit <b>12</b>. Drive unit <b>12</b> feeds solid solder wire <b>20</b> to reservoir <b>22</b> when control power <b>38</b> is applied by control circuit <b>14</b>. Conversely, drive unit <b>12</b> stops feeding solid solder wire <b>20</b> to reservoir <b>22</b> when control power <b>38</b> is removed by control circuit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, contact <b>36</b> can be a normally closed contact. Here, control circuit <b>14</b> is closed when molten solder <b>24</b> is in electrical communication with both first lead <b>16</b> and second lead <b>18</b>. Relay <b>34</b> opens the normally closed contact <b>36</b> when control circuit <b>14</b> is closed to remove control power <b>38</b> from drive unit <b>12</b>. However, control circuit <b>14</b> is opened when molten solder <b>24</b> is no longer in electrical communication with both first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Relay <b>34</b> returns contact <b>36</b> to its normally closed position when control circuit <b>14</b> is opened, which provides control power <b>38</b> to drive unit <b>12</b>. In this example, control circuit <b>14</b> activates drive unit <b>12</b> to feed solid solder wire <b>20</b> to reservoir <b>22</b> unless molten solder <b>24</b> is in contact with first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternately, contact <b>36</b> can be a normally open contact. When molten solder <b>24</b> drops below triggering level <b>28</b>, control circuit <b>14</b> is opened, which causes relay <b>34</b> to close the normally open contact <b>36</b>. Closing of contact <b>36</b> applies control power <b>38</b> to drive unit <b>12</b> and feeds solid solder wire <b>20</b> into reservoir <b>22</b>. When molten solder <b>24</b> reaches triggering level <b>28</b>, control circuit <b>14</b> is closed, which causes relay <b>34</b> to return contact <b>36</b> to its normally open position and, thus, remove control power <b>38</b> from drive unit <b>12</b>. In this example, control circuit <b>14</b> only activates drive unit <b>12</b> to feed solid solder wire <b>20</b> to reservoir <b>22</b> when molten solder <b>24</b> is not in contact with first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this manner, solder feed device <b>10</b> uses the conductive nature of molten solder <b>24</b> to cause control circuit <b>14</b> to activate/deactivate drive unit <b>12</b> so that the level of molten solder in reservoir <b>22</b> is maintained at triggering level <b>28</b>. It has been determined that using the conductive material properties of molten solder <b>24</b> allows for quick, accurate, and inexpensive volume measurement. For example, the conductivity of molten solder <b>24</b>, as used by controlling circuit <b>14</b>, is unaffected by the high temperature and volatile environment in reservoir <b>22</b>. Further, the conductivity of molten solder <b>24</b>, as used by controlling circuit <b>14</b>, is unaffected by the any potential skins or oxides that can form on the surface of the molten solder.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, solder feed device <b>10</b> can have a cap <b>40</b> positioned over reservoir <b>22</b>. Cap <b>40</b> can maintain first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in position in reservoir <b>22</b>. Thus, first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are maintained in reservoir <b>22</b> such that terminal end <b>32</b> of the highest of the two leads is located at a depth consistent with the triggering level <b>28</b>. Cap <b>40</b> can be formed of an electrically non-conductive material having resistance to the high temperature environment of reservoir <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, cap <b>40</b> is formed of a high temperature polyamide commercially available from E.I. Dupont and sold under the tradename VESPEL. Alternately, cap <b>40</b> can be formed of an electrically conductive material having resistance to the high temperature environment of reservoir <b>22</b>. In this example, first and second leads <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are insulated from cap <b>40</b> by an insulation (not shown) disposed between the cap and the leads.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, cap <b>40</b> can have a feed guide <b>42</b>. Feed guide <b>42</b> guides solid solder wire <b>20</b> from drive unit <b>12</b> into reservoir <b>22</b> through cap <b>40</b>. For example, guide <b>42</b> can mitigate instances of kinking or bending in solid solder wire <b>20</b> as the solid solder wire is fed into reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reservoir <b>22</b> is in fluid communication with injection head <b>26</b>. Head <b>26</b> is in turn in fluid communication with a mold <b>44</b>, which will subsequently transfer molten solder <b>24</b> to a substrate (not shown) via a plurality of mold cavities <b>46</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, molten solder <b>24</b> is forced from reservoir <b>22</b> to mold cavities <b>46</b> via a pressure assist. For example, cap <b>40</b> can have a pressure port <b>48</b> for inducing a positive pressure within reservoir <b>22</b>. Pressure port <b>48</b> can be configured to induce a positive pressure of about 5 pounds per square inch in reservoir <b>22</b>. Of course, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for pressure port <b>48</b> to be included in cap <b>40</b>, a reservoir sidewall, a reservoir bottom, and any combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reservoir <b>22</b> is sealed to ensure that the positive pressure induced in reservoir <b>22</b> through port <b>48</b> urges molten solder from the reservoir into mold cavities <b>46</b>. For example, solder feed device <b>10</b> can have a clamp <b>50</b> and a gasket <b>52</b>, as well as a solder seal <b>54</b> and a solder seal retainer <b>56</b>. Clamp <b>50</b> secures cap <b>40</b> over reservoir <b>22</b>, while gasket <b>52</b> prevents pressure induced in the reservoir via port <b>48</b> from exiting between the cap and the reservoir. Of course, other means of sealing cap <b>40</b> and reservoir <b>22</b> are contemplated by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Solder seal <b>54</b> forms a seal between feed guide <b>42</b> and solid solder wire <b>20</b>. Solder seal retainer <b>56</b> secures solder seal <b>54</b> to cap <b>40</b>. Since solder seal <b>54</b> seals around solid solder wire <b>20</b> as the solid solder wire is being fed to reservoir <b>22</b>, the solder seal forms a sliding seal with the solid solder wire. Preferably, solder seal <b>54</b> applies minimal friction to solid solder wire <b>20</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, solder seal <b>54</b> has a tapered edge <b>58</b> that minimizes the contact area between the solder seal and solid solder wire <b>20</b>. Solder seal <b>54</b> can be made of a material sufficient to withstand the high temperature environment of reservoir <b>22</b>, while having a sufficiently low coefficient of friction to minimize drag on solid solder wire <b>20</b> as it is fed into the reservoir. For example, solder seal <b>54</b> can be formed of a Teflon coated temperature resistant polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, solder feed device <b>10</b> continuously and automatically maintains the triggering level <b>28</b> of molten solder <b>24</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>. Further, solder feed device <b>10</b> maintains the desired pressure within reservoir <b>22</b> while feeding solid solder wire <b>20</b> into the reservoir. In this manner, solder feed device <b>10</b> allows the associated IMS system to be operated at a faster speed, without periodic stoppages to refill the reservoir, and/or with reduced operator assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alternate exemplary embodiment of a solder feed device <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First lead <b>16</b> is positioned in reservoir <b>22</b> so that its terminal end <b>32</b> is located at triggering level <b>28</b>. Thus, first lead <b>16</b> is in electrical communication with molten solder <b>24</b> when the molten solder is at triggering level <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Second lead <b>18</b> is also in electrical communication with molten solder <b>24</b> when the molten solder is at triggering level <b>28</b>. Second lead <b>18</b> is in contact with solid solder wire <b>20</b> and the solid solder wire is fed into reservoir <b>22</b> until the solid solder wire contacts molten solder <b>24</b>. In this manner, second lead <b>18</b> is in electrical communication with molten solder <b>24</b> through contact between the solid solder wire <b>20</b> and the molten solder. Thus, solder feed device <b>10</b> uses solid solder wire <b>20</b> itself to place second lead <b>18</b> in electrical communication with molten solder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Second lead <b>18</b> is illustrated by way of example positioned in feed guide <b>42</b> in electrical communication with solid solder wire <b>20</b>. However, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for second lead <b>18</b> to be located anywhere in solder feed device <b>10</b> provided that the second lead is in electrical communication with solid solder wire <b>20</b>. For example, second lead <b>18</b> can be positioned in reservoir <b>22</b>, drive unit <b>12</b>, as well as other locations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Solder feed device <b>10</b> of this embodiment also finds use with the control circuit <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to selectively apply control power <b>38</b> to drive unit <b>12</b>. Again, control circuit <b>14</b> acts as a switch for drive unit <b>12</b> depending on the state of contact among first lead <b>16</b>, second lead <b>18</b> and molten solder <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, solder feed device <b>10</b> is depicted by way of example having a vacuum assist system. Here, molten solder <b>24</b> is drawn from reservoir <b>22</b> to mold cavities <b>46</b> via a vacuum assist. For example, injection head <b>26</b> can have a vacuum port <b>60</b> for inducing a negative pressure in mold <b>44</b> and mold cavities <b>46</b>. The negative pressure in mold cavities <b>46</b> draws molten solder <b>24</b> from reservoir <b>22</b> into the mold cavities. In this example, the head space in reservoir <b>22</b> (e.g., the area above molten solder <b>24</b>) is substantially ambient pressure, while negative pressure in mold cavities <b>46</b> draws molten solder <b>24</b> from reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be recognized that reservoir <b>22</b> is illustrated by way of example without the seals present in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Here, the vacuum assist renders sealing of reservoir unnecessary. However, it is contemplated that reservoir <b>22</b> have both the vacuum assist as well as the pressure assist described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, solder feed device <b>10</b> continuously and automatically maintains the triggering level <b>28</b> of molten solder <b>24</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>. Further, solder feed device <b>10</b> maintains the desired vacuum within cavities <b>46</b> while feeding solid solder wire <b>20</b> into the reservoir. In this manner, solder feed device <b>10</b> allows the associated IMS system to be operated at a faster speed, without periodic stoppages to refill the reservoir, and/or with reduced operator assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be recognized that solder feed device <b>10</b> is illustrated by way of example having first lead <b>16</b>, as well as second lead <b>18</b> when necessary, mounted in reservoir <b>22</b> through cap <b>40</b>. Of course, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for the leads to be mounted in reservoir <b>22</b> in any desired manner such that triggering level <b>28</b> is maintained. For example, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for either of the leads to be mounted through cap <b>40</b>, a reservoir sidewall, a reservoir bottom, and any combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should also be recognized that solder feed device <b>10</b> is illustrated by way of example having two leads mounted in reservoir <b>22</b> in the pressure assisted IMS system and one lead mounted in reservoir <b>22</b> in the vacuum assisted IMS system. Of course, it is contemplated by the present disclosure for the two-lead and one-lead embodiments to find equal use in either the vacuum and/or the pressure assisted IMS systems.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It has been found that the use of molten solder <b>24</b> as both the dispensed liquid and the measuring medium provides solder feed device <b>10</b> with a simple, in-expensive solution to maintaining the triggering level <b>28</b> in reservoir <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The terms “first”, “second”, “third”, “upper”, “lower”, and the like may be used herein to modify various elements. These modifiers do not imply a spatial, sequential, or hierarchical order to the modified elements unless specifically stated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the present disclosure has been described with reference to one or more exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the disclosure without departing from the scope thereof.
