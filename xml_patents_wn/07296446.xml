<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The casing (<b>10</b>) is composed of a bottom case and a top case and has a proximal end, a distal end and a receiving space defined between the bottom case and the top case. The top case has a surface and an opening (<b>100</b>) defined through the surface of the top case. The receiving space has a first chamber (<b>11</b>), a second chamber (<b>12</b>), a third chamber (<b>13</b>), a fourth chamber (<b>14</b>) and a fifth chamber (<b>15</b>) formed in sequence. The first chamber (<b>11</b>) has a cave (<b>110</b>) formed transversely in the casing (<b>10</b>) near the proximal end of the casing (<b>10</b>). The second chamber (<b>12</b>) has two sides and two slots (<b>120</b>) respectively defined at the two sides of the second chamber (<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lock cylinder (<b>20</b>) is mounted in the chamber (<b>11</b>) and comprises a stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) and a locking bar (<b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) is securely held inside the first chamber (<b>11</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and comprises an end surface, a center hole (<b>230</b>), multiple bores (<b>231</b>), multiple tumbler pins (<b>232</b>) and tumbler springs (<b>233</b>). The central hole is defined through the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>). The bores (<b>231</b>) are formed separately in the end surface. The tumbler pins (<b>232</b>) and tumbler springs (<b>233</b>) are mounted in the bores (<b>231</b>). The locking bar (<b>21</b>) is mounted rotatably in the first chamber (<b>11</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>), extends through the center hole (<b>230</b>) in the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) and comprises a latching end, an active rod (<b>211</b>), an active cylinder (<b>22</b>) and an actuated end. The latching end is protruding out of the center hole (<b>230</b>) in the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) and has a through hole (<b>210</b>). The through hole (<b>210</b>) is formed transversely in the latching end. The active rod (<b>211</b>) is mounted in the through hole (<b>210</b>) with two ends protruding out of the through hole (<b>210</b>). The active cylinder (<b>22</b>) is formed radially on the locking bar (<b>21</b>), is coaxial with the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) and comprises an outer surface, a flange (<b>220</b>) and multiple pin holes (<b>222</b>). The flange (<b>220</b>) is formed longitudinally on the outer surface of the active cylinder (<b>22</b>) and is mounted movably in the cave (<b>110</b>) of the chamber (<b>11</b>) to limit the rotating range of the locking bar (<b>21</b>). The pin holes (<b>222</b>) are formed longitudinally through the active cylinder (<b>22</b>) around the locking bar (<b>21</b>). Each pin hole (<b>222</b>) has a bolt (<b>223</b>) mounted slidably in the pin hole (<b>222</b>) and corresponding to and pushed by one of the tumbler pins (<b>232</b>). The actuated end of the locking bar (<b>21</b>) has a notch (<b>221</b>) longitudinally formed in the actuated end.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The active tube (<b>30</b>) is mounted slidably in the second chamber (<b>12</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and has a first end, a second end, two sides, two bosses (<b>32</b>) and two notches (<b>31</b>). The two bosses (<b>32</b>) are formed respectively at the two sides and near the second end of the active tube (<b>30</b>). Each boss (<b>32</b>) is mounted slidably in one of the slots (<b>120</b>) of the second chamber (<b>12</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>), so that the active tube (<b>30</b>) can only move axially along the second chamber (<b>12</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>). The two notches (<b>31</b>) are defined in the first end of the active tube (<b>30</b>) opposite to the latching end of the locking bar (<b>21</b>) and respectively correspond to the ends of the active rod (<b>211</b>). The notches (<b>31</b>) can receive the ends of the active rod (<b>211</b>) and each notch (<b>31</b>) has an inclined plane. The inclined planes of the notches (<b>31</b>) slidably contact with the active rod (<b>211</b>) when the locking bar (<b>21</b>) is rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wheel (<b>40</b>) is mounted rotatably in the third chamber (<b>13</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and has a center, a hole (<b>42</b>) with an inner surface, and multiple teeth (<b>43</b>) formed around the inner surface of the hole (<b>42</b>). The hole (<b>42</b>) is formed through the center of the wheel (<b>40</b>). In addition, the wheel (<b>40</b>) has a rough surface (<b>41</b>) extending out of the opening (<b>100</b>) of the top case to facilitate a user rotating the wheel (<b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The active bracket (<b>50</b>) is slidably mounted rotatably in the fourth chamber (<b>14</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and has an outer wall, a first end, a second end, a head (<b>52</b>) and a mounting hole (<b>51</b>). The first end of the active bracket (<b>50</b>) abuts the second end of the active tube (<b>30</b>). The head (<b>52</b>) is formed on the second end of the active bracket and has multiple active teeth (<b>53</b>). The active teeth (<b>53</b>) extend on the outer wall of the active bracket (<b>50</b>) and correspond to and selectively engage the teeth (<b>43</b>) in the wheel (<b>40</b>). The mounting hole (<b>51</b>) is non-circular and is formed axially through the active bracket (<b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the resilient element (<b>60</b>) is mounted in the fourth chamber (<b>14</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and has an end. The end of the resilient element (<b>60</b>) pushes the active bracket (<b>50</b>) to slide along the fourth chamber (<b>14</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and to engage the teeth (<b>43</b>) with the active teeth (<b>53</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The securing axle (<b>70</b>) is mounted rotatably in the fifth chamber (<b>15</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>) and has a threaded end (<b>72</b>), an active end and a mounting portion (<b>71</b>). The threaded end (<b>72</b>) extends out of the casing (<b>10</b>). The mounting portion (<b>71</b>) is formed on the securing axle (<b>70</b>) near the active end and is non-circular in cross section to be mounted securely in the mounting hole (<b>51</b>) of the active bracket (<b>50</b>) and to allow the securing axle (<b>70</b>) rotating simultaneously with the active bracket (<b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The associated key (<b>80</b>) has a tubular operating portion with an opening end and an inner surface, a protrusion (<b>81</b>) and multiple key cutouts. The protrusion (<b>81</b>) is formed on the inner surface to buckle with the notch (<b>221</b>) of the locking bar (<b>21</b>) to make the key (<b>80</b>) rotating simultaneously with the locking bar (<b>21</b>). The key cutouts are formed along the opening end in different sizes determined by the positions and lengths of the bolts (<b>223</b>) in the lock cylinder (<b>20</b>). The associated key (<b>80</b>) can hold around the actuated end of the locking bar (<b>21</b>) and engages with the bolts (<b>223</b>). Then the bolts (<b>223</b>) are pushed respectively by the key cutouts. Such the bolts (<b>223</b>) and the tumbler pins (<b>232</b>) are pushed to an interface between the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>), the active cylinder (<b>22</b>), the locking bar (<b>21</b>) and the active rod (<b>211</b>) can rotate relative to the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>) when the associated key (<b>80</b>) is turned.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the active bracket (<b>50</b>) is pushed by the resilient element (<b>60</b>), the end of the active bracket (<b>50</b>) opposite to the head (<b>52</b>) can push the active tube (<b>30</b>) to move axially close to the proximal end of the casing (<b>10</b>) in the second chamber (<b>12</b>) of the casing (<b>10</b>). The user can use the associated key (<b>80</b>) to rotate the locking bar (<b>21</b>) and the active rod (<b>211</b>) relative to the stationary cylinder (<b>23</b>). When the active rod (<b>211</b>) rotates and slides along the inclined planes of the notches (<b>31</b>) in the active tube (<b>30</b>), the active tube (<b>30</b>) and the active bracket (<b>50</b>) may move gradually toward the lock cylinder (<b>20</b>) at the same time. Eventually, the active teeth (<b>53</b>) engages with the teeth (<b>43</b>) in the wheel (<b>40</b>). When the active teeth (<b>53</b>) engages with the teeth (<b>43</b>), rotating the wheel (<b>40</b>) simultaneously rotates the active bracket (<b>50</b>) and the securing axle (<b>70</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the operational cable (<b>82</b>) has two ends, one of the ends is fixed with the lock assembly of the present invention, and the other end has a loop (<b>820</b>). When an article (such as a notebook computer) having a corresponding threaded hole needs to be secured in a certain position, the lock assembly passes through the loop (<b>820</b>) of the cable (<b>82</b>) to tie the cable (<b>82</b>) to a stationary facility. Then the key (<b>80</b>) is inserted and turned to engage the active teeth (<b>53</b>) and the teeth (<b>43</b>). Then the wheel (<b>40</b>) is rotated to screw the threaded end (<b>72</b>) of the securing axle (<b>70</b>) into the corresponding threaded hole of the article. After the securing axle (<b>70</b>) is screwed into the article, the key (<b>80</b>) is turned to disengage the active teeth (<b>53</b>) from the teeth (<b>43</b>). Then the securing axle (<b>70</b>) disengages with the wheel (<b>40</b>) and may remain in the article. Therefore, the article can be effectively fastened in a certain position.</p>
