<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming device, such as a display using an electron beam and, more specifically, to an image forming device including spacers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A known image forming device using an electron emitter is a flat display panel. The known flat display panel comprises an electron source substrate including a plurality of cold cathode electron emitters and an anode substrate including an anode electrode and phosphors. The electron source substrate and anode substrate are disposed parallel to each other. A vacuum is generated between the electron source substrate and the anode substrate. Generally known cold cathode electron emitters are surface-conduction type emitters, field electron emission (FE) type emitters, and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type emitters. The flat display panel including known cold cathode electron emitters is light-weight and has a large display area compared to other widely used CRTs. Moreover, the flat display panel is brighter and is capable of displaying higher quality images compared to other flat display panels using liquid crystal and flat display panels such as plasma displays and electroluminescent displays.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the above-described image forming device comprises a face plate and a rear plate facing each other. The face plate is the display surface for displaying an image. The face plate includes a metal back, which receives an acceleration voltage V<sub>a</sub>, and a fluorescent film. The rear plate is the electron source for generating light from the phosphors. The rear plate includes cold cathode electron emitters and wires, wherein the wires electrically connect the electron emitters and run in the longitudinal and horizontal directions. Sidewalls seal the circumference of the face plate and the rear plate, forming a vacuum vessel. Spacers are interposed between the face plate and the rear plate to maintain the plates apart from each other at a predetermined distance and to support the plates against atmospheric pressure. The spacers are usually interposed between and are in contact with the conductor of the rear plate (e.g., the wires in the horizontal direction) and the electrode on the face plate (e.g., the metal back) (for example, refer to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,614,781 and 5,742,117 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 08-180821).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such an image forming device, sometimes the spacers emit a secondary electron when a part of an electron beam or a reflected electron strikes the surface. This secondary electron generates an electric potential in the area where the secondary electron was emitted from. Accordingly, the electric potential distribution at the spacer and the vicinity is distorted. As a result, not only the trajectory of the electron beam becomes unstable but also an electric discharge will occur inside the image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To prevent electrical charging of the spacers, the spacers may be formed of an insulating substrate covered with a high-resistance film, which is capable of preventing electrical charging. This method of preventing electrical charging is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,614,781 and 5,742,117 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 08-180821.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors propose a more preferable method for preventing electrical charging of spacers in which spacers formed of an insulating substrate covered with a high-resistance film are disposed intermittently in contact with the conductors on the rear plate (refer to Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-136741).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when the contact area of the spacer actually in contact with the conductor is small in comparison with the surface area (including the contact area) that faces the conductor, electrical currents are converged (or, in other words, current crowding occurs) at the edge of the contact area. This current crowding occurs, for example, when the spaces contact the conductors intermittently, as described above, or when the thickness (width) of the planer spacers is greater than the width of the conductors in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the latter case in which the contact area of a spacer <b>1020</b> contacting a conductor (horizontal wire <b>1013</b>) on a rear plate <b>1015</b> or an electrode (metal back <b>1019</b>) on a face plate <b>1017</b> is smaller than the area of the surface including the contact area. In such a case, current crowding occurs at the edges of the contact area (points b in the drawing). Due to current crowding, heat is generated locally at the points b and the vicinity. Therefore, depending on the type of material used for a high-resistance film <b>1001</b>, the property of the film (such as resistance) may change when the high-resistance film <b>1001</b> is used for a long period of time (i.e., when V<sub>a </sub>is applied for a long period of time). As a result, the electric field in the vicinity of the spacer <b>1020</b> is distorted, causing the formed images to be distorted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also illustrates an insulating substrate <b>1000</b>, a fluorescent film <b>1018</b>, a longitudinal wire <b>1014</b>, and an insulating layer <b>1021</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Current crowding that occurs at some of the edges of the high-resistance film even when the high-resistance film is disposed on the edge of the spacer, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, is known to be caused by the relationship of electric properties between the high-resistance film on the side of the spacer, the film on the edge of the spacer, and the conductor in contact with the spacer in addition to the above-described case in which the contact area of the spacer is only partially in contact with the rear plate or the face plate contact. When the entire end surface of the spacer is a contact area, it is desired to effectively use the entire high-resistance film on the end surface as a current path.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention has taken into consideration the above mentioned problems, and its main object is to provide a panel for an image forming device, such as a planer display panel including cold cathode electron emitters, in which images are not distorted even when the panel is used for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, a spacer has a first high-resistance film on an exposed surface and a second high-resistance film on a surface contacting a rear plate or a face plate. When this spacer contacts the rear plate or the face plate through a third high-resistance film, local current crowding is prevented from occurring at the contact area and the vicinity of the high-resistance films. As a result, a local change in resistance at the contact area of the high-resistance film can be prevented. Accordingly, an image forming device capable of stably maintaining an excellent image having high brightness for a long period of time is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An image forming device comprises a rear plate having a conductor set to a low voltage, a face plate having an electrode set to a high voltage, the face plate facing the rear plate, and a spacer electrically connected to the conductor and the electrode. The spacer comprises an insulating substrate having a first end surface facing the rear plate, a second end surface facing the electrode, and side surfaces connecting the first end surface and the second end surface, a first high-resistance film covering the side surfaces of the insulating substrate, and a second high-resistance film covering at least one of the first end surface and the second end surface of the insulating substrate and having a sheet resistance greater than or equal to a sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film. In the image forming device, the spacer and the conductor and the electrode are electrically connected via a third high-resistance film interposed between the conductor or the electrode and the second high-resistance film. Moreover, the resistivity ρ<sub>2 </sub>and the film thickness t<sub>2 </sub>of the second high-resistance film and the resistivity ρ<sub>3 </sub>and the film thickness t<sub>3 </sub>of the third high-resistance film satisfy the formulae below:</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A planer display panel according to embodiments of the image forming device of the present invention will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a planer display panel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also partially illustrates the inner structure of the planer display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a rear plate <b>115</b>, a sidewall <b>116</b>, and a face plate <b>117</b> form an airtight container that maintains a vacuum inside the display panel. The inside of the airtight container is a vacuum of about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa. To prevent the airtight container from being damaged by atmospheric pressure or unexpected shock, a spacer <b>120</b> is provided as part of an atmospheric pressure-resistant structure. The spacer <b>120</b> is fixed in an area outside the image display area by a spacer support member <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the rear plate <b>115</b>, a N×M number of cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b> is provided (here, N and M represent a positive integer greater or equal to 2, and the number of cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b> is determined in accordance with the required number of display pixels). The N×M cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b> are arranged in a simple matrix with M horizontal wires <b>113</b> and N longitudinal wires <b>114</b>. The intersections of the horizontal wires <b>113</b> and the longitudinal wires <b>114</b> are insulated by insulating layers <b>121</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, the cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b> are surface-conduction electron emitters arranged in a simple matrix. The present invention, however, is not limited to this, and other electron emitters such as field emission (FE) or metal-insulator-metal (MIM) electron emitters may also be used. Furthermore, the arrangement is not limited to a simple matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional schematic view of one of the cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b> according to this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the rear plate <b>115</b>, one of the horizontal wires <b>113</b>, one of the longitudinal wires <b>114</b>, element electrodes <b>105</b>, conductive thin films <b>106</b>, an electron emitting portion <b>107</b>, and a carbon film <b>104</b>. The electron emitting portion <b>107</b> is prepared by electric forming and electric activation. The carbon films <b>104</b> are deposited on the conductive thin films <b>106</b> in the vicinity of the electron emitting portion <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fluorescent film <b>118</b> is provided on the face plate <b>117</b>. The display panel according to this embodiment is a color display. Thus, the fluorescent film <b>118</b> includes phosphors of the three primary colors used for a CRT, i.e., red, green, and blue. For example, the different-colored phosphors are arranged in stripes as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Black conductors <b>110</b> are interposed between the stripes of the phosphors. The arrangement of the phosphors of the three different colors is not limited to the stripe pattern illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Instead, the phosphors may have a delta arrangement or any other arrangement that is in accordance with the arrangement of the cold cathode electron emitters <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To prepare a monochrome display panel, the fluorescent film <b>118</b> is composed of phosphors of a single color. In such a case, the black conductors <b>110</b> are not necessarily required.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A known metal back <b>119</b> used for a CRT is attached to the side of the fluorescent film <b>118</b> opposite from the face plate <b>117</b>. The metal back <b>119</b> functions as an anode electrode for applying an electron beam acceleration voltage V<sub>a</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional schematic view of the spacer <b>120</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and its vicinity. The components that are the same as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are indicated by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The spacer <b>120</b> is prepared by depositing a first high-resistance film <b>101</b> and a second high-resistance film <b>102</b> on the surface of a insulating substrate <b>100</b>. The first and second high-resistance films <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> prevent electrical charging. The number of spacers included in a display panel and their intervals, which are determined by the number of spacers required for resisting the atmospheric pressure, are disposed in the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first high-resistance film <b>101</b> is a film covering the sides of the insulating substrate <b>100</b>. The first high-resistance film <b>101</b> has a resistivity of ρ<sub>1 </sub>and a film thickness of t<sub>1</sub>. The second high-resistance film <b>102</b> is a film covering the first or second end surfaces of the spacer <b>120</b>. The second high-resistance film <b>102</b> has a resistivity of ρ<sub>2 </sub>and a film thickness of t<sub>2</sub>. The insulating substrate <b>100</b> of the spacer <b>120</b> may be quartz glass, glass with a decreased amount of impurities such as sodium, soda lime glass, or ceramics material such as alumina. The material used for the insulating substrate <b>100</b> preferably should have a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of the materials used to form the airtight container.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first high-resistance film <b>101</b> and the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> may be made of different materials and/or may have different thicknesses or, instead, may be made of substantially the same material having substantially the same thickness. In the latter case, ρ<sub>1 </sub>substantially equals ρ<sub>2 </sub>and t<sub>1 </sub>substantially equals t<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The spacer <b>120</b> is electrically connected to the fluorescent film <b>118</b> and the metal back <b>119</b> on the inside of the face plate <b>117</b> and to the horizontal wires <b>113</b>, the longitudinal wires <b>114</b>, and the insulating layer <b>121</b> on the inside of the rear plate <b>115</b> via a third high-resistance film <b>103</b> deposited on the second high-resistance film <b>102</b>. The third high-resistance film <b>103</b> has a resistivity of ρ<sub>3 </sub>and a film thickness of t<sub>3</sub>. In this embodiment, the spacer <b>120</b> is a thin plate and is disposed parallel the horizontal wires <b>113</b> and electrically connected to the horizontal wires <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second high-resistance film <b>102</b> and the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> having the structures described above should preferably satisfy the condition represented by Formulae 4 (which is the same formula as Formulae 1 mentioned above) below:</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Formulae 4 indicate that current crowding is prevented more effectively when the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> of the spacer <b>120</b> contacts the rear plate <b>115</b> or the face plate <b>117</b> via the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) compared to when the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> of the spacer <b>120</b> directly contacts the rear plate <b>115</b> or the face plate <b>117</b> without the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In other words, local current crowding on the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> can be alleviated when Formulae 4 are satisfied. In this way, quality (resistance) of the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> can be prevented from being altered locally due to a long-term application of a voltage. Furthermore, image distortion caused by the change in film quality at the spacer <b>120</b> and its vicinity can be prevented. Prevention of local current crowding according to the present invention will now be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The current flow in the display panel having a structure according to the present invention and the current flow in a structure not according to the present invention are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is schematic view of the current flow at the edge of the spacer in the display panel according to the present invention. In comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic view of the current flow at the edge of a spacer in a display panel not having a third high-resistance film <b>103</b>. In comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic view of the current flow at the edge of the spacer in the display panel wherein the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film is smaller than the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film. The same components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> are represented by the same reference numerals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> include a spacer substrate (insulating substrate) <b>2100</b>, a first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>, a second high-resistance film <b>2102</b>, a third high-resistance film <b>2103</b>, a wiring electrode <b>2113</b>, and a current crowding region <b>2130</b>. The arrows in the drawings represent the flow of electricity. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> at the edge of the spacer <b>2100</b> flows toward the wiring electrode <b>2113</b> via a pathway in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> having the smallest resistance because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is greater than or equal to the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>. As a result, the current flows through a pathway having the shortest distance to the wiring electrode, as illustrated in the schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Consequently, this current flow generates a current crowding region <b>2130</b>. In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> disperses in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> at the edge of the spacer <b>2100</b> because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is smaller than the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>. More specifically, since the difference in sheet resistance causes the voltage drop in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> to be smaller than the voltage drop in the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>, the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> appears to function as an electrode and, thus, the electric current disperses in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b>. Consequently, as illustrated in the schematic view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the electric current disperses uniformly within the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b>, and current crowding is alleviated compared to the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. However, a current crowding region <b>2130</b> is still present. On the other hand, in the case of the structure according to the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is greater than or equal to the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>, and the relationship between the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> and the third high-resistance film <b>2103</b> satisfies the above-mentioned Formulae 4. Hence, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> is slowly dispersed in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b>. More specifically, since the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> and the third high-resistance film <b>2103</b> have a relationship represented by Formulae 4, even though the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> does not function as an electrode for the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is greater than or equal to the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b>, the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> appears to function as an electrode for the third high-resistance film <b>2103</b>. Hence, the current flowing from the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> to the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is dispersed in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> while receiving a downward force in the Y direction. Therefore, current crowding due to a sudden dispersion, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, does not occur. Moreover, unlike the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, current crowding does not occur even though the current is dispersed in the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> and flows through a pathway having the shortest distance from the third high-resistance film <b>2103</b> to the wires. The reason the relationship between the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> and the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> is defined by using sheet resistance is because the important components of the currents flowing through the first high-resistance film <b>2101</b> and the second high-resistance film <b>2102</b> are the components orthogonal to the thickness directions of the first high-resistance film and the second high-resistance film.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, Formulae 4 are explained.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The electric potential difference in the thickness direction of the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> is used as an index for current crowding. This will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of one of points a and the vicinity indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are represented by the same reference numerals as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The electric potential between two points a and a′ on a line extending orthogonally from the rear plate <b>115</b> or the face plate <b>117</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and passing through the edge point of the contact area of the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> and the horizontal wire <b>113</b> is measured. When the potential difference is large, the current flow in the thickness direction of the film (i.e., Y direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is large. Therefore, excessive current crowding occurs at the edge of the contact area. On the other hand, when the potential difference is small, the current flow in the film surface direction (i.e., X direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is great. Therefore, current crowding at the edge of the contact area is moderate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph indicating the proportion of the potential difference of a-a′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (corresponding to a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is provided) to the potential difference of the same points a-a′ for a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is not provided. This proportion is dependent on the resistivity ratio (ρ<sub>3</sub>/ρ<sub>2</sub>). The values for each different film thickness ratio (t<sub>3</sub>/t<sub>2</sub>) are plotted on separate lines representing each film thickness ratio. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the resistivity ratio (ρ<sub>3</sub>/ρ<sub>2</sub>), and the vertical axis represents the proportion of the potential difference (the potential difference of a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is provided compared to a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is not provided).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The area near 100% in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents conditions in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is mostly ineffective for preventing current crowding. The points representing the relationship between the resistivity ratio and the film thickness observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when the proportion of the potential difference clearly starts to decrease from 100% (i.e., the critical points (inflection points) where the proportion starts to suddenly decrease) are extracted and re-plotted as a graph of resistivity ratio (vertical axis) over film thickness ratio (horizontal axis), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph representing a condition in which current crowding can be prevented by using the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> at the edge of the contact area. The condition represented here satisfies Formulae 4.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as the proportion of current crowding (the ratio of the potential differences of a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is provided to a case in which the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is not provided) approaches 0%, a double-digit improvement in current crowding prevention is observed. The points representing the relationship between the resistivity ratio and the film thickness observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when the decrease in the proportion of the potential difference suddenly becomes moderate as 0% is approached (i.e., the critical points (inflection points) where the decrease in proportion slows down) are extracted and re-plotted on a graph of resistivity ratio (vertical axis) over film thickness ratio (horizontal axis), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. By plotting the relationship between the film thickness (horizontal axis) and the resistivity ratio (vertical axis), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> represents the conditions in which current crowding is effectively prevented (improved) by the use of the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The conditions represented here substantially satisfy Formulae 5 below (which is the same as Formulae 2). This is preferable because when Formulae 5 are satisfied, current crowding is mostly prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The thickness of the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) should preferably be in the range from 10<sup>−8 </sup>m to 10<sup>−5 </sup>m. Although the resistance depends on the surface energy of the material, the adhesiveness of the film to the substrate, and the substrate temperature, in general, when the thickness of the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is 10<sup>−8 </sup>m or more, the film is formed in patches. Therefore the resistance becomes unstable and difficult to reproduce. When the film thickness is 10<sup>−5 </sup>m or more, film stress is increased, causing an increase in the possibility of the film being peeled off. Moreover, when the film thickness is 10<sup>−5 </sup>m or more, more time is required for deposition and, thus, productivity decreases. Accordingly, by taking into consideration these upper and lower limits, it is concluded that the preferable film thickness ratio t<sub>3</sub>/t<sub>2 </sub>of the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> to the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is between 0.001 and 1,000.

The sheet resistance of the spacer <b>120</b> is set in a preferable range according to the ability of preventing electrical charging and electric power consumption. When the ability of preventing electrical charging is taken into consideration, it is preferable for the sheet resistance to be 10<sup>14 </sup>Ω/sq or lower. The lower limit of the sheet resistance depends on the shape of the spacer <b>120</b> and the voltage applied to the spacer <b>120</b>. However, the sheet resistance should preferably be at least 10<sup>7 </sup>Ω/sq. Similarly, the preferable resistivity for the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> and the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> is determined from the upper and lower limits of the film thickness. The resistivity of the second high-resistance film <b>102</b> and the third high-resistance film <b>103</b> should preferably be in the rage of 0.1 to 10<sup>8 </sup>Ωm.
