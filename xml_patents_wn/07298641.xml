<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to reconfigurable semiconductor storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Traditionally, integrated circuit (IC) devices such as custom, semi-custom, or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices have been used in electronic products to reduce cost, enhance performance or meet space constraints. However, the design and fabrication of custom or semi-custom ICs can be time consuming and expensive. The customization involves a lengthy design cycle during the product definition phase and high Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs during manufacturing phase. In the event of finding a logic error in the custom or semi-custom IC during final test phase, the design and fabrication cycle has to be repeated. Such lengthy correction cycles further aggravate the time to market and engineering cost. As a result, ASICs serve only specific applications and are custom built for high volume and low cost applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another type of semi custom device called a Gate Array customizes modular blocks at a reduced NRE cost by synthesizing the design using a software model similar to the ASIC. The missing silicon level design verification results in multiple spins and lengthy design iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In recent years there has been a move away from custom or semi-custom ICs towards field programmable components whose function is determined not when the integrated circuit is fabricated, but by an end user “in the field” prior to use. Off the shelf, generic Programmable Logic Device (PLD) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) products greatly simplify the design cycle. These products offer user-friendly software to fit custom logic into the device through programmability, and the capability to tweak and optimize designs to optimize silicon performance. The flexibility of this programmability is expensive in terms of silicon real estate, but reduces design cycle and upfront NRE cost to the designer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">FPGAs offer the advantages of low non-recurring engineering costs, fast turnaround (designs can be placed and routed on an FPGA in typically a few minutes), and low risk since designs can be easily amended late in the product design cycle. It is only for high volume production runs that there is a cost benefit in using the more traditional approaches. Compared to PLD and FPGA, an ASIC has hard-wired logic connections, identified during the chip design phase. ASIC has no multiple logic choices and no configuration memory to customize logic. This is a large chip area and cost saving for the ASIC. Smaller ASIC die sizes lead to better performance. A full custom ASIC also has customized logic functions which take less gate counts compared to PLD and FPGA configurations of the same functions. Thus, an ASIC is significantly smaller, faster, cheaper and more reliable than an equivalent gate-count PLD or FPGA. The trade-off is between time-to-market (PLD and FPGA advantage) versus low cost and better reliability (ASIC advantage). The cost of Silicon real estate for programmability provided by the PLD and FPGA compared to ASIC determines the extra cost the user has to bear for customer re-configurability of logic functions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Multi-input and multi-output digital logic systems are classified into combinational and sequential logic. Combinational logic has no memory and the outputs reflect a function solely of present inputs. Sequential logic is implemented by inserting memory into the logic path. This allows present input states as well as past input and past output states to determine the present output. In sequential logic the logic output and logic inputs can be stored and re-used as inputs at a later time point. Many such logic systems include clocks, preset and clear signals and are classified into synchronous and asynchronous systems. A storage element is used to store information about the previous condition of the sequential logic system. The most common bistable circuit in use is a multivibrator, or commonly called flip-flop. In a sequential circuit, these flip-flops can be by passed to facilitate combinational logic. Flip-flops contain two inverting gates cross-coupled in a positive feed back to assume one of two stable output states. There are many types of flip-flops available for use: SR, JK, Clocked JK, T, D with and without Preset and Clear options. They provide a pair of complementary outputs and contain one or more inputs that can cause the output state to change. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram of three basic flip-plops: SR in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, JK in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The complementary outputs are customarily labeled Q and Q′ (not Q). The inputs are labeled S, R, J, K or D in each of the respective flip-flops. The user application determines the best option for the flip-flop in the logic design.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A flip-flop has a present state and a next state. The present state means the state of Q output in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at the time input signals are applied or changed. The next state means the state of Q output after the flip-flop has reacted to the inputs signals. The transient time taken for the flip-flop to stabilize is carefully avoided in the logic design. Each flip-flop has a well defined sequence for its output behavior in response to input signals. This next state sequence differs from one flip-flop to another and can be characterized by a Characteristic Equation, State Graph, Truth Table, and Karnaugh Map. Examples of characteristic equations and truth tables for some of the flip-flops in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the undesired states in SR flip-flop are removed in the JK flip-flop, while the D flip-flop has only a single input and an output reflecting that input.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A master-slave flip-flop is a structure where input and output terminals are kept disjoint. A common arrangement is to cascade two flip-flops and clock data in complementary signals. The master flip-flop captures data from inputs on one phase of the clock, while the slave flip-flop captures data from the master flip-flop in the opposite phase of the clock.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Existing PLD and FPGA architectures utilizing flip-flops are discussed in Hartmann U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,986, Carter U.S. Pat. No. 4,706,216, Turner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,768, Norman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,161, Freemann U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,302, ElGamal et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,459, Freemann et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,488,316 &amp; 5,343,406, Trimberger et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,422, Cliff et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,173, Couts-Martin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,211, Mendel U.S. Pat. No. 6,275,065 and Young et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,808. These have flip-flops embedded in basic the logic elements of an FPGA fabric or the macro-cells of a PLD fabric. FPGA's and PLD's are constructed with a repetitive pattern consisting of these basic building blocks. A routing block is programmed to define inputs and outputs to the logic blocks, while the logic block performs a specific logic function. Such a logic block described in Ref-<b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which has a built in fixed D-flip-flop. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, elements <b>301</b>, <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> are 2:1 MUX's controlled by one input signal. Element <b>304</b> is an OR gate while <b>305</b> is a D-Flip-Flop. Eight inputs feed the logic block. All two-input, most 3-input and some 4-input variable functions are realized in the logic block and latched to the D-Flip-Flop. The Flip-Flop in itself offers no configurable capability. Most FPGA's and PLD's referenced earlier have a similar built-in D Flip-Flop inside the logic block. An AND, NOR gate realization of a clocked D-Flip-Flop with Preset and Clear functions is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, element <b>401</b> is an inverter, <b>402</b> and <b>403</b> are 2-input AND gates and <b>404</b> and <b>405</b> are 3-input NOR gates. This can be customized by the user only with the logic content available in that and neighboring logic elements. Overall logic capacity is thus reduced from configuring flip-flops outside of what is provided by the manufacturer and the available logic density for the application is drastically reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Kaplinsky U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,612, Orgill et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,744, Kelem U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,417 and Fifield et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,925 have discussed programmability with respect to latches, registers and flip-flops. These implementations are either very high in Silicon area, or provide little flexibility for user change. A useful measure of a programmable circuit is the gate comparison to an equivalent specific application circuit. In most programmable devices, after the user has finalized the logic design, it is rarely or never changed. For these designs, a conversion from programmable to application specific is highly desirable. The referenced usages do not lend to an easy economical conversion. An inexpensive, single configurable storage device that will allow the user the flexibility in picking the most desired flip-flop type from a variety of choices is highly desirable for programmable logic applications. Such a design should also lend to an easy application specific design conversion to the user, preserving the original timing characteristics of the circuit during the conversion.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, a configurable storage device comprising: a storage circuit including at least one output and at least one input capable of changing said output in a well defined response sequence; and a configuration circuit including at least one memory element to control a portion of said storage circuit; and a programmable means of altering said storage circuit response sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Implementations of the above aspect may include one or more of the following. A storage device is a bistable circuit. Most common device is a multivibrator, or flip-flop. A flip-flop has two inverting gates cross coupled to provide two stable states. A flip-flop has a pair of complementary outputs. It has one or more inputs that can cause these output state to change. The storage device stores data and has the ability to “remember” past history. Many types of flip-flops are used in IC circuits. Most common types include SR, JK, D, clocked SR, clocked JK and D flip-flops. Flip-flops have a present state and a next state. For each flip-flop type, the output response sequence to input changes are well defined. This well defined response sequence is represented by a characteristic truth table, or a characteristic equation, or Karnaugh map or a next state graph. The storage device comprises a storage circuit consisting of CMOS transistors that include AND, NAND, OR, NOR and pass-gate type logic structures. Configurable means include configuration circuits. Configuration circuits have memory elements and access circuitry to change memory data. Each memory element can be a transistor or a diode or a group of electronic devices. The memory elements can be made of CMOS devices, capacitors, diodes on substrate. The memory elements can be made of thin film devices such as thin film transistors (TFT), capacitors and diodes. The memory element can be selected from the group consisting of volatile or non volatile memory elements. The memory element can also be selected from the group of fuses, antifuses, SRAM cells, DRAM cells, optical cells, metal optional links, EPROMs, EEPROMs, flash, magnetic and ferro-electric elements. One or more redundant memory elements can be provided for controlling the same circuit block. The memory element can generate an output signal to control logic gates. The logic gates can be a pass-gate logic element, AND array, NOR array, a MUX or a Look-Up-Table (LUT). These programmable logic gates may be integrated into flip-flop functionality. Programming these logic via their controlling memory may allow the user programmability to alter the flip-flop response sequence between pre-selected options such as D, SR, JK, T, clocked-SR and clocked-JK. Each response sequence is then well characterized by the memory bit pattern for the programmable gates in the storage circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a second aspect, A method of forming a configurable storage device comprising: fabricating one or more storage circuits on a substrate; and fabricating a configuration circuit including one or more memory elements substantially above the storage circuits to control a portion of said storage circuits; and fabricating an interconnect layer substantially above said storage circuits and said memory circuits to provide routing to storage circuits and memory circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Implementations of the above aspect may include one or more of the following. Storage circuitry fabrication may adhere to a basic logic process capable of making CMOS transistors. The transistors are formed on P-type substrate, N-type substrate, epi-substrate or SOI substrate wafers. The configuration circuits may be formed above the logic transistors. This may be achieved by inserting a thin-film transistor module at contact layer of the logic process. The thin-film transistor outputs may be directly coupled to CMOS gates on substrate to provide logic control. Buried contacts may be used to make these connections. The contacts may be filled with doped poly-silicon, Titanium-Tungsten, Tungsten Silicide, or some other refractory metal. Memory elements may be constructed also with TFT transistors, capacitors and diodes. The TFT layers may be restricted for only configuration circuits, not used for logic signal lines. Metal layers above the TFT layers may be used for all the routing for the storage device, and configuration device. All signal paths may utilize wires and storage circuitry with no impact from TFT layers used for configuration circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a third aspect, a method of forming a semiconductor device, comprising: fabricating one or more storage circuits on a substrate; and selectively fabricating either a memory circuit or a conductive pattern substantially above the storage circuits to control a portion of said storage circuits; and fabricating an interconnect and routing layer substantially above the storage circuits and memory circuits to connect storage circuits and one of the memory circuits or the conductive pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Implementations of the above aspect may further include one or more of the following. The memory element can be selected from the group consisting of volatile or non volatile memory elements. The memory can be implemented using a TFT process technology that contains one or more of Fuses, Anti-fuses, DRAM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash, Ferro-Electric, optical, magnetic and SRAM elements. Configuration circuits may include thin film elements such as diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitor. The process implementation is possible with any memory technology where the programmable element is vertically integrated in a removable module. The configuration circuit includes a predetermined conductive pattern in lieu of memory elements to control the programmable logic in the storage circuits. Multiple memory bits exist to customize logic functions. Each memory bit pattern has a corresponding unique conductive pattern to duplicate the same customized logic function. Circuit performance of the logic function is not affected by the choice of logic control: memory elements or conductive pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Implementations of the above aspects may include one or more of the following. The storage device constitutes fabricating a VLSI IC product. The IC product is re-programmable in its initial stage with turnkey conversion to an ASIC. The IC has the end ASIC cost structure and FPGA re-programmability. The IC product offering occurs in two phases: the first stage is a generic FPGA that has re-programmability containing a programmable module, and the second stage is an ASIC with the entire programmable module replaced by 1 to 2 customized hard-wire masks.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A series product families can be provided with a modularized programmable element in an FPGA version followed by a turnkey custom ASIC with the same base die with 1-2 custom masks. The vertically integrated programmable module does not consume valuable silicon real estate of a base die. Furthermore, the design and layout of these product families adhere to removable module concept: ensuring the functionality and timing of the product in its FPGA and ASIC canonicals. These IC products can replace existing PLD and FPGA products and compete with existing Gate Arrays and ASIC's in cost and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An easy turnkey customization of an ASIC from an original smaller cheaper and faster PLD or FPGA would greatly enhance time to market, performance, and product reliability.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Definitions: The terms wafer and substrate used in the following description include any structure having an exposed surface with which to form the integrated circuit (IC) structure of the invention. The term substrate is understood to include semiconductor wafers. The term substrate is also used to refer to semiconductor structures during processing, and may include other layers that have been fabricated thereupon. Both wafer and substrate include doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial semiconductor layers supported by a base semiconductor or insulator, SOI material as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art. The term conductor is understood to include semiconductors, and the term insulator is defined to include any material that is less electrically conductive than the materials referred to as conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term module layer includes a structure that is fabricated using a series of predetermined process steps. The boundary of the structure is defined by a first step, one or more intermediate steps, and a final step. The resulting structure is formed on a substrate. The term configuration circuit includes one or more configurable elements and connections that can be programmed for controlling one or more circuit blocks in accordance with a predetermined user-desired functionality. The configuration circuit includes the memory element and the access circuitry, herewith called memory circuitry, to modify said memory element. Configuration circuit does not include the logic gate controlled by said memory element. In one embodiment, the configuration circuit includes a plurality of memory circuits to store instructions to configure an FPGA. In another embodiment, the configuration circuit includes a first selectable configuration where a plurality of memory circuits is formed to store instructions to control one or more circuit blocks. The configuration circuits include a second selectable configuration with a predetermined conductive pattern formed in lieu of the memory circuit to control substantially the same circuit blocks. The memory circuit includes elements such as diode, transistor, resistor, capacitor, metal link, among others. The memory circuit also includes thin film elements. In yet another embodiment, the configuration circuits include a predetermined conductive pattern, via, resistor, capacitor or other suitable circuits formed in lieu of the memory circuit to control substantially the same circuit blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term “horizontal” as used in this application is defined as a plane parallel to the conventional plane or surface of a wafer or substrate, regardless of the orientation of the wafer or substrate. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction as defined above. Prepositions, such as “on”, “side”, “higher”, “lower”, “over” and “under” are defined with respect to the conventional plane or surface being on the top surface of the wafer or substrate, regardless of the orientation of the wafer or substrate. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A point to point connection can be made utilizing pass-gate logic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows exemplary programmable pass-gate logic realization. A transistor <b>510</b> connects one input I<sub>1 </sub>to one output O<sub>1</sub>. Multiple inputs can be connected to multiple outputs with a plurality of pass-gate logic elements. The transistor <b>510</b> can be a PMOS or an NOMS transistor, but NMOS is preferred due to its higher conduction. The gate voltage S<b>0</b> on NMOS transistor <b>510</b> gate electrode determines an ON or OFF connection. That logic level is generated by a configuration circuit <b>520</b> coupled to the gate of NMOS transistor <b>510</b>. The pass-gate logic connection requires the configuration circuitry to generate signal S<b>0</b> with sufficient voltage levels to ensure off and on conditions. For an NMOS pass-gate, S<b>0</b> having a logic level one completes the point to point connection, while a logic level zero keeps them disconnected. In addition to using only an NMOS gate, a PMOS gate could also be used in parallel to make the connection. The configuration circuit <b>520</b> needs to then provide complementary outputs (S<b>0</b> and S<b>0</b>′) to drive NMOS and PMOS gates making the connection. Configuration circuit <b>520</b> contains a memory element. This memory element can be configured by the user to select the polarity of S<b>0</b>, thereby selecting the status of the connection. The memory element can be volatile or non-volatile. In volatile memory, it could be DRAM, SRAM, Optical or any other type of a memory device. In non-volatile memory it could be fuse, anti-fuse, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash, Ferro-Electric, Magnetic or any other kind of memory device. The output S<b>0</b> can be a direct output coupled to the memory bit, or a derived output from the configuration circuitry. An inverter can be used to restore S<b>0</b> signal level to achieve full rail to rail voltage levels.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The memory element in the configuration circuit can be one of any number of possibilities. A few of these possibilities will be discussed next to illustrate the concept of this invention. A volatile six transistor SRAM based configuration circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The SRAM memory bit can be any one of 6-transistor, full CMOS, R-load or TFT PMOS load to name a few. Two inverters <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> connected back to back forms the memory element. This memory element is latch. Power and ground terminals for the inverters are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Access NMOS transistors <b>603</b> and <b>604</b>, and access wires GA, GB, BL and BS provide the means to configure the memory element. Applying zero and one on BL and BS respectively, and raising GA and GB high enables writing zero into device <b>603</b> and one into device <b>604</b>. The output S<b>0</b> delivers a logic one. Applying one and zero on BL and BS respectively, and raising GA and GB high enables writing one into device <b>603</b> and zero into device <b>604</b>. The output S<b>0</b> delivers a logic zero. The SRAM construction may allow applying only a zero signal at BL or BS to write data into the latch. The SRAM latch will hold the data state as long as power is on. When the power is turned off, the SRAM bit needs to be restored to the previous state from an outside permanent memory. In the literature for programmable logic, this second non-volatile memory is also called configuration memory. The SRAM configuration circuit controlling logic pass-gate is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The S<b>0</b> output directly driven by the memory element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> drives the pass-gate gate electrode. In addition to S<b>0</b> output and the latch, power, ground, data in and write enable signals in <b>620</b> constitutes the SRAM configuration circuit. Write enable circuitry includes GA, GB, BL, BS signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An anti-fuse based configuration circuit is shown next in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Configuration circuit <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> can be replaced with the anti-fuse circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, output level S<b>0</b> is generated from node X which is coupled to signals VA and VB via two anti-fuses <b>750</b> and <b>760</b> respectively. Node X is connected to a programming access transistor <b>770</b> controlled by gate signal GA and drain signal BL. A very high programming voltage is needed to blow the anti-fuse capacitor. This programming voltage level is determined by the anti-fuse properties, including the dielectric thickness. Asserting signal VA very high, VB low (typically ground), BL low and GA high (Vcc to pass the ground signal) provides a current path from VA to BL through the on transistor <b>770</b>. A high voltage is applied across anti-fuse <b>750</b> to pop the oxide and short the terminals. Similarly anti-fuse <b>760</b> can be programmed by selecting VA low, VB very high, BL low and GA high. Only one of the two anti-fuses is blown to form a short. When the programming is done, BL and GA are returned to zero, isolating node X from the programming path. VA=Vss (ground) and VB=Vcc (power) is applied to the two signal lines. Depending on the blown fuse, signal S<b>0</b> will generate a logic low or a logic high signal. This is a one time programmable memory device. Node X will be always connected to VA or VB by the blown fuse regardless of the device power status. Signals GA and BL are constructed orthogonally to facilitate row and column based decoding to construct these memory elements in an array.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an EEPROM non-volatile configuration circuit. Configuration circuit <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> can be replaced with the EEPROM circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, node <b>840</b> is a floating gate. This is usually a poly-silicon film isolated by an oxide all around. It is coupled to the source end of programming transistor <b>820</b> via a tunneling diode <b>830</b>. The tunneling diode is a thin dielectric capacitor between floating poly and substrate silicon with high doping on either side. When a large programming (or erase) voltage Vpp is applied across the thin dielectric, a Fowler-Nordheim current flows through the oxide. The tunneling electrons move from electrical negative to electrical positive voltage. Choosing the polarity of the applied voltage across the tunneling dielectric, the direction of electron flow can be reversed. Multiple programming and erase cycles are possible for these memory elements. As the tunneling currents are small, the high programming voltage (Vpp) can be generated on chip, and the programming and erase can be done while the chip is in a system. It is hence called in system programmable. An oxide or dielectric capacitor <b>810</b> couples the floating gate (FG) to a control gate (CG). The control gate CG can be a heavily doped silicon substrate plate or a second poly-silicon plate above the floating poly. The dielectric can be oxide, nitride, ONO or any other insulating material. A voltage applied to CG will be capacitively coupled to FG node <b>840</b>. The coupling ratio is designed such that 60-80 percent of CG voltage will be coupled to FG node <b>840</b>. To program this memory element, a negative charge must be trapped on the FG <b>840</b>. This is done by applying Vpp voltage on CG, ground voltage on PL and a sufficient high (Vcc) on RL. CG couples a high positive voltage onto FG <b>840</b> creating a high voltage drop across diode <b>830</b>. Electrons move to the FG <b>840</b> to reduce this field. When the memory device is returned to normal voltages, a net negative voltage remains trapped on the FG <b>840</b>. To erase the memory element, the electrons must be removed from the floating gate. This can be done by UV light, but an electrical method is more easily adapted. The CG is grounded, a vey high voltage (Vpp+more to prevent a threshold voltage drop across <b>820</b>) is applied to RL, and a very high voltage (Vpp) is applied to PL. Now a low voltage is coupled to FG with a very high positive voltage on the source side of device <b>820</b>. Diode <b>830</b> tunneling removes electrons of FG. This removal continues beyond a charge neutral state for the isolated FG. When the memory device is returned to normal voltages, a net positive voltage remains trapped on the FG <b>840</b>. Under normal operation RL is grounded to isolate the memory element from the programming path, and PL is grounded. A positive intermediate voltage Vcg is applied to CG terminal. FG voltage is denoted S<b>0</b>. Under CG bias, S<b>0</b> signal levels are designed to activate pass-gate logic correctly. The circuit block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be utilized in configuration circuit <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, and in place of configuration block <b>520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to perform the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">These configuration circuits can be used to realize many programmable logic functions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an EEPROM non-volatile memory element in the implementation of a P-Term in NAND-NOR logic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows two mirrored outputs P1 and P2. For output P1, an AND gate <b>932</b> comprised of a pull-up device receives signals from pass transistors <b>922</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>928</b> and <b>930</b> for the pull-down function. The pass transistor <b>922</b> is controlled by block <b>920</b> shown in the dashed circle, while the pass transistor <b>928</b> is controlled by a similar block <b>926</b> shown inside the dashed circle. These blocks <b>920</b> and <b>926</b> show the configuration circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Blocks <b>920</b> and <b>926</b> can be replaced by any one of configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to realize this logic function. Pass transistors <b>922</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>928</b>, <b>930</b> and the AND gate <b>932</b> show the logic block of the PLD. The logic block is not affected by the choice of the configuration circuit. This voltage output level applied to the gate of device <b>922</b> is designed to turn the device off or on.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another logic function realized by these configuration circuits is a programmable MUX. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows a programmable 2:1 MUX, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows two 2:1 programmable MUX's. In the MUX in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, two pass-gates <b>1001</b> and <b>1002</b> allow two inputs I<b>1</b> and I<b>2</b> to be connected to output O. A configuration circuit <b>1020</b> having two complementary control signal outputs S<b>0</b> and S<b>0</b>′ provides the programmability. When S<b>0</b>=1, S<b>0</b>′=0, I<b>1</b> is coupled to O. When S<b>0</b>=0, S<b>0</b>′=1, I<b>2</b> is coupled to O. With one memory element inside <b>1020</b>, one input is always coupled to the output. If two bits were provided inside <b>1020</b>, two mutually exclusive outputs S<b>0</b> and S<b>1</b> could be generated by <b>1020</b>. That would allow neither I<b>1</b> nor I<b>2</b> to be coupled to O, if such a requirement exists in the logic design. The two MUX's in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> operate with a single memory element in configuration circuit <b>1040</b>. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, one of I<b>0</b> and I<b>1</b> is connected to O<b>1</b> while one of I<b>2</b> and I<b>3</b> is connected to O<b>2</b>. In one memory state I<b>0</b> and I<b>2</b> are selected, while in the opposite state I<b>1</b> and I<b>3</b> are selected. Both configuration circuits <b>1020</b> and <b>1040</b> can be any one of circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. It could also be a similarly constructed configuration circuit with DRAM, EPROM, Flash, fuse-links, ferro-electric, magnetic, optical or any other memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">SRAM memory technology has the advantage of not requiring a high voltage to configure memory. The SRAM based switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> containing the SRAM memory circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> utilizes 6 extra configuration transistors, discounting the pass-gate <b>610</b>, to provide the programmability. That is a significant overhead compared to application specific circuits where the point to point connection can be directly made with metal. Similarly other programmable memory elements capable of configuring pass-gate logic also carry a high silicon foot print. A cheaper method of constructing a vertically integrated SRAM cell is described in application Ser. No. 10/413,810 entitled “Semiconductor Latches and SRAM Devices”, filed on Apr. 14, 2003 and list as inventor Mr. R. U. Madurawe, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the configuration circuit is built on thin-film semiconductor layers located vertically above the logic circuits. The SRAM memory element, a thin-film transistor (TFT) CMOS latch, comprises two lower performance back to back inverters formed on two semiconductor thin film layers, substantially different from a first semiconductor single crystal substrate layer and a gate poly layer used for logic transistor construction. This latch is stacked above the logic circuits for slow memory applications with no penalty on Silicon area and cost. This latch is adapted to receive power and ground voltages in addition to configuration signals. The two programming access transistors for the TFT latch are also formed on thin-film layers. Thus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, all six configuration transistors shown in <b>620</b> are constructed in TFT layers, vertically above the pass transistor <b>610</b>. Transistor <b>610</b> is in the conducting path of the connection and needs to be a high performance single crystal Silicon transistor. This vertical integration makes it economically feasible to add an SRAM based configuration circuit at a very small cost overhead to create a programmable solution. Such vertical integration can be extended to all other memory elements that can be vertically integrated above logic circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A new kind of a programmable logic device utilizing thin-film transistor configurable circuits is disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/267,484 entitled “Methods for Fabricating Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits”, application Ser. No. 10/267,483 entitled “Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits”, and application Ser. No. 10/267,511 entitled “Field Programmable Gate Array With Convertibility to Application Specific Integrated Circuit”, all of which were filed on Oct. 8, 2002 and list as inventor Mr. R. U. Madurawe, the contents of which are incorporated-by-reference. The disclosures describe a programmable logic device and an application specific device fabrication from the same base Silicon die. The PLD is fabricated with a programmable memory module, while the ASIC is fabricated with a conductive pattern in lieu of the memory. Both memory module and conductive pattern provide identical control of logic circuits. For each set of memory bit patterns, there is a unique conductive pattern to achieve the same logic functionality. The vertical integration of the configuration circuit leads to a significant cost reduction for the PLD, and the elimination of TFT memory for the ASIC allows an additional cost reduction for the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an implementation of vertically integrated circuits, where the configuration memory element is SRAM. First, silicon transistors <b>1150</b> are deposited on a substrate. A module layer of removable SRAM memory cells <b>1152</b> are positioned above the silicon transistors <b>1150</b>, and a module layer of interconnect wiring or routing circuit <b>1154</b> is formed above the removable memory cells <b>1152</b>. To allow this replacement, the design adheres to a hierarchical layout structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the SRAM cell module is sandwiched between the single crystal device layers below and the metal layers above electrically connecting to both. It also provides through connections “A” for the lower device layers to upper metal layers. The SRAM module contains no switching electrical signal routing inside the module. All such routing is in the layers above and below. Most of the programmable element configuration signals run inside the module. Upper layer connections to SRAM module “C” are minimized to Power, Ground and high drive data wires. Connections “B” between SRAM module and single crystal module only contain logic level signals and replaced later by Vcc and Vss wires. Most of the replaceable programmable elements and its configuration wiring is in the “replaceable module” while all the devices and wiring for the end ASIC is outside the “replaceable module”. In other embodiments, the replaceable module could exist between two metal layers or as the top most layer satisfying the same device and routing constraints. This description is equally applicable to any other configuration memory element, and not limited to SRAM cells.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Fabrication of the IC also follows a modularized device formation. Formation of transistors <b>1150</b> and routing <b>1154</b> is by utilizing a standard logic process flow used in the ASIC fabrication. Extra processing steps used for memory element <b>1152</b> formation are inserted into the logic flow after circuit layer <b>1150</b> is constructed. A full disclosure of the vertical integration of the TFT module using extra masks and extra processing is in the incorporated by reference applications discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">During the customization, the base die and the data in those remaining mask layers do not change making the logistics associated with chip manufacture simple. Removal of the SRAM module provides a low cost standard logic process for the final ASIC construction with the added benefit of a smaller die size. The design timing is unaffected by this migration as lateral metal routing and silicon transistors are untouched. Software verification and the original FPGA design methodology provide a guaranteed final ASIC solution to the user. A full disclosure of the ASIC migration from the original FPGA is in the incorporated by reference applications discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ASIC migration of the point to point connection in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> and the 2:1 MUX in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the gate input signal to pass-gate <b>1210</b> has two possible conductive pattern connections: connection <b>1230</b> to Vss and connection <b>1240</b> to Vcc. The connections are made in metal or contacts between metal in the data base. Based on the S<b>0</b> output state being 0 or 1 of a memory pattern to map into a conductive pattern, either Vss or the Vcc connection is chosen. For each memory bit state, only one conductive pattern connection is made. Similarly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, pass-gate <b>1201</b> has conductive pattern options to Vss and Vcc at nodes <b>1231</b> and <b>1241</b> respectively. Pass-gate <b>1202</b> has conductive pattern options to Vss and Vcc at nodes <b>1232</b> and <b>1242</b> respectively. One of I<b>0</b> or I<b>1</b> can be connected to O from this option. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the point to point connection is identical between the two configuration options: memory element and conductive pattern. The signal delay through these pass-gate connections also remains identical, independent of the control option.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a second embodiment for the conductive pattern, the pass-gate <b>1210</b> drain is shorted to source in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> by a metal wire when S<b>0</b>=1. Wire resistance is reduced by eliminating pass-gate <b>1210</b> ON resistance from the signal path. When S<b>0</b>=0, the pass-gate is left connected to Vss. The signal delay will be altered between the conducting pattern and memory options. That change can be emulated in the FPGA by raising only memory Vcc, raising S<b>0</b> voltage to reduce <b>1210</b> ON resistance. This may be desirable to users who need higher performance in the ASIC and ensure no other timing violations.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the third module layer is formed substantially above the first and second module layers, wherein interconnect and routing signals are formed to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers. Alternatively, the third module layer can be formed substantially below the first and second module layer with interconnect and routing signals formed to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers. Alternatively, the third and fourth module layers positioned above and below the second module layer respectively, wherein the third and fourth module layers provide interconnect and routing signals to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In yet another embodiment of a programmable multi-dimensional semiconductor device, a first module layer is fabricated having a plurality of circuit blocks formed on a first plane. The programmable multi-dimensional semiconductor device also includes a second module layer formed on a second plane. A plurality of configuration circuits is then formed in the second plane to store instructions to control a portion of the circuit blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As the discussions demonstrate, memory controlled pass transistor logic elements provide a powerful tool to make switches. The ensuing high cost of memory can be drastically reduced by the 3-dimensional integration of configuration elements and the replaceable modularity concept for said memory. These advances allow designing a storage element containing a generic flip-flop that can be configured by the user to any type without utilizing additional Logic Elements. For example a generic flip-flop may be configured by the user to be D, SR, JK, clocked SR, clocked JK, or T type.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">One embodiment of a new programmable multi function flip-flop is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The multi-purpose flip-flop is designed with a storage circuit to perform the flip-flop function and a configuration circuit for the user to program one flip-flop from a variety of available options. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the configuration circuit include five (S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b>) memory elements to configure the flip-flop to SR, JK, clocked SR, Clocked JK, D and T flip-flop. The configurable flip-flop discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,744 has no memory elements. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the configuration circuit can be any one of the previously shown options as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Any other memory element adapted to providing the functionality described under those sections can also be used in this flip-flop design. The control signal levels (denoted S<b>0</b> for the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) from said five bits in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are also denoted S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> in this discussion. Table-1 describes the programmable means of altering the flip-flop type by configuring the memory bits. The bubbles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> represent any number of possible configuration circuits. Such possible options include circuits discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A preferred option is the 6T-SRAM cell based configuration circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. Elements <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>, <b>1303</b> and <b>1304</b> are 2:1 MUXs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. These MUXs are grouped in pairs <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b> and pair <b>1303</b>, <b>1304</b> and constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> to function with only one memory element for both MUX's. As marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, one input in the 2:1 MUX is at logic 1 or at voltage Vcc. Element <b>1308</b> is a CMOS inverter capable of inverting the J-input shown. Elements <b>1309</b> and <b>1310</b> are 3-input AND gates. Elements <b>1311</b> and <b>1312</b> are 3-input NOR gates. They are all assumed to be full-CMOS for this discussion. The two NOR gates are cross-coupled to provided a positive feed-back. Elements <b>1305</b>, <b>1306</b> and <b>1307</b> are NMOS pass-gate logic transistors. There are 6 more NMOS pass-gate logic transistors embedded in the four 2:1 MUXs <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>, <b>1303</b> and <b>1304</b>. Storage device has two complementary outputs Q and Q′. The feed-back in the NOR gates ensure data stability. The inputs have multiple options and are labeled J (=S), K (=R), D, T, CLK, Preset and Clear. Preset and Clear signals are active low. They need to be asserted to logic zero to activate logic. One of Preset=0 or Clear=0 signals sets flip-flop Q=1 or Q=0 respectively for all flip-flop types. The clock (CLK) is active high. Configuration circuit outputs S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> at logic “1” or logic “0” govern the conditions of the pass-gates. The NMOS pass gate is “on” or “off” when the logic output is “1” or “0” respectively. There are 11 NMOS pass-gat controlled by 5 memory elements in the configuration circuit to configure this generic flip-flop.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the S<b>0</b> bit controls the T input, or Clock input signal. When S<b>0</b>=1, the T input goes through to AND gates <b>1309</b> and <b>1310</b> to enable clocking. When S<b>0</b>=0 the T or Clock input is disabled. This input is selected by the user for a T flip flop or as the Clock input for clocked flip flops. Row-<b>3</b> in Tab-<b>1</b> shows other bit configuration to activate a T flip-flop. J and K inputs to AND gates are disabled by setting S<b>2</b>=0 and selecting logic 1. The inverter is disabled by S<b>4</b> bit. Q and Q′ feedbacks are provided to AND gates <b>1309</b> and <b>1310</b> respectively with S<b>3</b> bit. When the T-input is low, AND gates <b>1309</b> and <b>1310</b> are forced to output logic-0, which provide don't care input states for the NOR gates. Clear and Preset also inputs logic-0 to the NOR gates when not asserted. When T-input goes high, Q will flip from its original state creating a toggle response to the T-input.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the S<b>1</b> bit allows K input to get to input AND gate <b>1309</b>. When S<b>1</b>=1 the K input is selected to AND gate <b>1309</b>. When S<b>1</b>=0 the K input is disconnected. The S<b>2</b> bit selects either J and K inputs or logic-1 inputs. When S<b>2</b>=1, the input MUX's <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b> select J and K as inputs, while when S<b>1</b>=0, the input MUX's <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b> select logic-1 as the inputs. Similarly S<b>3</b> bit controls the Q and Q′ (not Q) feed-backs in MUX's <b>1304</b> and <b>1303</b> respectively. The feed-back is disabled by setting S<b>3</b>=0. The MUX <b>1303</b> and <b>1304</b> outputs feed into to AND gates <b>1310</b> and <b>1309</b> respectively. S<b>3</b>=0 selects logic-1 that act as don't care inputs to AND gates. S<b>3</b>=1 allows the Q and Q′ feed backs to AND gate inputs. The bit S<b>4</b> allows conversion to D flip-flop. When S<b>4</b>=1, J (now equal to D) is fed to AND gate <b>1310</b>, while K-input is disabled by S<b>1</b>, and inverted J input is fed to AND gate <b>1309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in Tab-<b>1</b>, all flip-flop types can be realized by configuring the 5 memory bits. The user does not have to use extra logic from adjacent logic blocks to configure the flip-flop, allowing a wide degree of user flexibility in logic design. The D-flip flop shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has 22 transistors. Discounting SRAM configuration circuit transistors, the multi-purpose flip-flop in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> has 37 transistors. All 37 transistors belong to the storage circuit. Additional 15 transistors are 2 extra PMOS transistors (in 3-input AND gates), and 13 extra NMOS transistors (8 in the 2:1 MUX's, 3 in NMOS pass-gates and 2 in the 3-input AND gates). The layout area can be kept under 1.5× of the area of D-flip flop in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> due to compact NMOS layout rules in spite of 1.7× increase in transistor count. In addition to the 37 gates, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> also has 5 extra 6T-SRAM elements taking up 30 extra transistors for configuration circuit. This programmable multi-purpose flip-flop would have taken 67 extra transistors on a non stackable SRAM process technology, making the 3× Si cost prohibitive for any practical application. Under the new techniques disclosed in this invention, those 30 extra configuration transistors in a 3D integration occupy the same area as the 37 storage transistors of the multi-purpose flip-flop, causing no additional area and cost penalty.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">NMOS pass-gate logic realization has two disadvantages. Passing Vcc (logic 1) is degraded due to threshold voltage drop across the NMOS. As a result, the input AND gates do not receive full Vcc signal level which may cause slightly higher power consumption. This can be overcome with CMOS pass-gates or by running the TFT SRAM Vcc level in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> higher than the logic Vcc level by an amount equal to the body-effect adjusted threshold voltage of logic NMOS transistor. This allows logic NMOS gate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to pass full Vcc, improving both performance and power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of a multi purpose generic flip-flop. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, elements <b>1409</b>, <b>1410</b>, <b>1411</b> and <b>1412</b> are all 3-input NAND gates. Preset and Clear are active low asynchronous signals to set and reset the flip-flop independent of the clock signal. Clock (T or CLK) is an active high signal. All popular flip-flops can be derived from this generic flip-flop by programming the bit-pattern as shown in Table-1. The configuration circuits and memory elements to realize this flip-flop can be any one of the possible circuits described in the body of this discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Both flip-flops shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has a unique bit pattern for the chosen flip-flop type. That bit pattern identifies output levels S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> and S<b>4</b> needed for configuration. Those levels can be mapped to a conductive pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. Once the user identifies the flip-flop of choice in the programmable logic application, the same flip-flop can be mapped to the application specific application using this conductive pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The TFT process technology consists of creating NMOS &amp; PMOS poly-silicon transistors. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the module insertion is after the substrate device gate poly etch and the ILD film is deposition. In other embodiments the insertion point may be after M<b>1</b> and the ILD is deposition, prior to V<b>1</b> mask, or between two metal definition steps.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">After gate poly of regular transistors are patterned and etched, the poly is salicided using Nickel &amp; RTA sequences. Then the ILD is deposited, and polished by CMP techniques to a desired thickness. In the shown embodiment, the contact mask is split into two levels. The first C<b>1</b> mask contains all contacts that connect latch outputs to substrate transistor gates and active nodes. Then the C<b>1</b> mask is used to open and etch contacts in the ILD film. Ti/TiN glue layer followed by W-Six plugs, W plugs or Si plugs may be used to fill the plugs, then CMP polished to leave the fill material only in the contact holes. The choice of fill material is based on the thermal requirements of the TFT module.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Then, a first P<b>1</b> poly layer, amorphous or crystalline, is deposited by LPCVD to a desired thickness as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.1</figref>. The P<b>1</b> thickness is between 50 A and 1000 A, and preferably 250 A. This poly layer P<b>1</b> is used for the channel, source, and drain regions for both NMOS and PMOS TFT's. It is patterned and etched to form the transistor body regions. In other embodiments, P<b>1</b> is used for contact pedestals. NMOS transistors are blanket implanted with P− doping, while the PMOS transistor regions are mask selected and implanted with N− doping. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.2</figref>. The implant doses and P<b>1</b> thickness are optimized to get the required threshold voltages for PMOS &amp; NMOS devices under fully depleted transistor operation, and maximize on/off device current ratio. The pedestals implant type is irrelevant at this point. In another embodiment, the V<sub>T </sub>implantation is done with a mask P− implant followed by masked N− implant. First doping can also be done in-situ during poly deposition or by blanket implant after poly is deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Patterned and implanted P<b>1</b> may be subjected to dopant activation and crystallization. In one embodiment, RTA cycle is used to activate &amp; crystallize the poly after it is patterned to near single crystal form. In a second embodiment, the gate dielectric is deposited, and buried contact mask is used to etch areas where P<b>1</b> contacts P<b>2</b> layer. Then, Ni is deposited and salicided with RTA cycle. All of the P<b>1</b> in contact with Ni is salicided, while the rest poly is crystallized to near single crystal form. Then the unreacted Ni is etched away. In a third embodiment, amorphous poly is crystallized prior to P<b>1</b> patterning with an oxide cap, metal seed mask, Ni deposition and MILC (Metal-Induced-Lateral-Crystallization).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Then the TFT gate dielectric layer is deposited followed by P<b>2</b> layer deposition. The dielectric is deposited by PECVD techniques to a desired thickness in the 30-200 A range, desirably 70 A thick. The gate may be grown thermally by using RTA. This gate material could be an oxide, nitride, oxynitride, ONO structure, or any other dielectric material combination used as gate dielectric. The dielectric thickness is determined by the voltage level of the process. At this point an optional buried contact mask (BC) may be used to open selected P<b>1</b> contact regions, etch the dielectric and expose P<b>1</b> layer. BC could be used on P<b>1</b> pedestals to form P<b>1</b>/P<b>2</b> stacks over C<b>1</b>. In the P<b>1</b> salicided embodiment using Ni, the dielectric deposition and buried contact etch occur before the crystallization. In the preferred embodiment, no BC is used.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Then second poly P<b>2</b> layer, 300 A to 2000 A thick, preferably 500 A is deposited as amorphous or crystalline poly-silicon by LPCVD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.3</figref>. P<b>2</b> layer is defined into NMOS &amp; PMOS gate regions intersecting the P<b>1</b> layer body regions, C<b>1</b> pedestals if needed, and local interconnect lines and then etched. The P<b>2</b> layer etching is continued until the dielectric oxide is exposed over P<b>1</b> areas uncovered by P<b>2</b> (source, drain, P<b>1</b> resistors). The source &amp; drain P<b>1</b> regions orthogonal to P<b>2</b> gate regions are now self aligned to P<b>2</b> gate edges. The S/D P<b>2</b> regions may contact P<b>1</b> via buried contacts. NMOS devices are blanket implanted with LDN N− dopant. Then PMOS devices are mask selected and implanted with LDP P− dopant as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.4</figref>. The implant energy ensures full dopant penetration through the residual oxide into the S/D regions adjacent to P<b>2</b> layers.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A spacer oxide is deposited over the LDD implanted P<b>2</b> using LTO or PECVD techniques. The oxide is etched to form spacers. The spacer etch leaves a residual oxide over P<b>1</b> in a first embodiment, and completely removes oxide over exposed P<b>1</b> in a second embodiment. The latter allows for P<b>1</b> salicidation at a subsequent step. Then NMOS devices &amp; N+ poly interconnects are blanket implanted with N+. The implant energy ensures full or partial dopant penetration into the 100 A residual oxide in the S/D regions adjacent to P<b>2</b> layers. This doping gets to gate, drain &amp; source of all NMOS devices and N+ interconnects. The P+ mask is used to select PMOS devices and P+ interconnect, and implanted with P+ dopant as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.5</figref>. PMOS gate, drain &amp; source regions receive the P+ dopant. This N+/P+ implants can be done with N+ mask followed by P+ mask. The V<sub>T </sub>implanted P<b>1</b> regions are now completely covered by P<b>2</b> layer and spacer regions, and form channel regions of NMOS &amp; PMOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">After the P+/N+ implants, Nickel is deposited over P<b>2</b> and salicided to form a low resistive refractory metal on exposed poly by RTA. Un-reacted Ni is etched as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.6</figref>. This 100 A-500 A thick Co-salicide connects the opposite doped poly-<b>2</b> regions together providing low resistive poly wires for data. In one embodiment, the residual gate dielectric left after the spacer prevents P<b>1</b> layer salicidation. In a second embodiment, as the residual oxide is removed over exposed P<b>1</b> after spacer etch, P<b>1</b> is salicided. The thickness of Ni deposition may be used to control full or partial salicidation of P<b>1</b> regions. Fully salicided S/D regions up to spacer edge facilitate high drive current due to lower source and drain resistances.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">An LTO film is deposited over P<b>2</b> layer, and polished flat with CMP. A second contact mask C<b>2</b> is used to open contacts into the TFT P<b>2</b> and P<b>1</b> regions in addition to all other contacts to substrate transistors. In the shown embodiment, C<b>1</b> contacts connecting latch outputs to substrate transistor gates require no C<b>2</b> contacts. Contact plugs are filled with tungsten, CMP polished, and connected by metal as done in standard contact metallization of IC's as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15.7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A TFT process sequence similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> can be used to build complementary Gated-FET thin film devices. Compared with CMOS devices, these are bulk conducting devices and work on the principles of JFETs. A full discussion of these devices are provided in application Ser. No. 10/413,808 entitled “Insulated-Gate Field-Effect Thin Film Transistors”, filed on Apr. 14, 2003 and list as inventor Mr. R. U. Madurawe, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The process steps facilitate the device doping differences between MOSFET and Gated-FET devices, and simultaneous formation of complementary Gated-FET TFT devices.
