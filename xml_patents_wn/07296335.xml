<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to techniques for manufacturing hard disk drives. More particularly, the invention provides a method and system for repairing a magnetic head slider for a head gimbal assembly using an ultrasonic source. Other sources may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A hard disk drive (HDD) for data storage adapts a magnetoresistive thin film element (MR Head) to perform data read/write operations. The MR Head is bonded onto a flexure gimbal and then connected to a flex circuit using solder or gold ball bonding for data transmission. A suspension provides a platform for this architecture forming a Head Gimbal Assembly, HGA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the manufacture of an HGA, if it is determined that the electrical property of the magnetic head slider is unacceptable, it is desirable to remove the magnetic head slider and salvage the suspension to minimize material loss. As the areal density of a hard disk drive increases, the magnetic head slider is also reduced in its size from nano- (50%), to pico- (30%), and to femto- (20%) scale dimensions, the detaching process of magnetic head slider becomes an increasingly difficult challenge. In a prior art technique, mechanical cutting using a cutter blade was suggested if gold ball bonding was used. For solder ball bonding, the detachment may employ the use of heat to melt the solder and removal by vacuum suction. As the size of the magnetic head slider gets smaller and the gimbal stiffness continues to decrease, there is a need for less contact and less intrusive techniques to detach a magnetic head slider.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the above, it is seen that an improved technique for manufacturing a hard disk drive is highly desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method for reworking a head gimbal assembly (HGA) according to the present invention includes positioning a probe in contact with or near to a slider component that is connected to a gimbal. An ultrasonic excitation is applied to the probe to create a reciprocating action. The reciprocating action creates mechanical stress in the connection between the slider and the gimbal to which the slider is mechanically mounted. The slider is thereby detached from the HGA.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, a specific embodiment of the present invention illustrates a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes holding (e.g., via a support member) a head gimbal assembly (HGA) <b>100</b> comprising a magnetic head slider <b>112</b>, which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly <b>100</b>. Preferably, the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> is maintained on the support member by an adhesive material <b>114</b>. A gold, or solder, ball bond <b>116</b> provides an electrical connection to a gimbal <b>102</b>. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the method according to the specific embodiment of the present invention includes contacting a probe member <b>202</b> coupled to an ultrasonic transducer unit <b>200</b> to a portion of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member <b>202</b> such that the probe member <b>202</b> oscillates at a frequency greater than about 1 k Hz in a linear motion having a spatial displacement of less than 0.03 mm as the probe member <b>202</b> is in contact within a vicinity of the portion of the magnetic head slider <b>100</b>. The method includes causing a repetitive pushing action upon the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> using the oscillation of the probe member <b>202</b> while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring for a moment to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the probe member <b>202</b> can be arranged in a parallel relation to the trace interconnect to which the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> is in electrical contact. Since the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> is typically mounted in a substantially parallel relation to the trace interconnect, the pushing action of the probe member <b>202</b> is maximally delivered to overcome the adhesion force of the adhesive <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the pushing action will cause separation of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> from the head gimbal assembly <b>100</b>. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the probe member <b>202</b> is maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20° C. to about 60° C. during the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The detachment employs high frequency ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> providing linear motion with a spatial displacement in the order of less than 30 micrometers. By bringing the probe member <b>202</b> of the transducer <b>200</b> to come into contact or near contact (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>) with the magnetic head slider <b>112</b>, the probe can move the magnetic head slider in a back and forth motion with a small displacement at a high frequency in the order of thousands of times per second. This small movement at high frequency creates a significant strain energy which can break away the ball bond <b>116</b> and the adhesive <b>114</b> underneath.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, another specific embodiment of the present invention is shown of a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes a support member <b>300</b> schematically represented in the figure as an object that resembles a clamp, but which will be understood to represent any suitable support/holding structure for performing the described operation. The support member <b>300</b> supports the head gimbal assembly (HGA) <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the HGA <b>100</b> includes the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly via the adhesive <b>114</b>. Preferably, the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> is also supported on the support member <b>300</b>. The method includes contacting the probe member <b>202</b> of the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to a portion of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member <b>202</b> such that the probe member oscillates at a frequency greater than a predetermined frequency. The range of motion of oscillation of the probe member <b>202</b> has a spatial displacement of less than a predetermined distance as the probe member is in contact within a vicinity of the portion of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> that is being supported via the support member <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the method includes a repetitive pushing action against the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> using the oscillation of the probe member <b>202</b> while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member. The repeated pushing action overcomes the adhesion force of the adhesive <b>114</b> and causes separation of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> from the head gimbal assembly <b>100</b>. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>, yet another specific embodiment of the present invention is shown of a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes holding (e.g., via a support member such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>) the HGA <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, the HGA <b>100</b> includes the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly via the adhesive <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the method includes contacting the probe member <b>202</b> of the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to a portion of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the probe member <b>202</b> can be brought near to the slider <b>112</b>. This arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member <b>202</b> such that the probe member oscillates at a frequency greater than a predetermined frequency. The range of motion of oscillation of the probe member <b>202</b> has a spatial displacement of less than a predetermined distance so that the probe member <b>202</b> alternates between contacting and not-contacting the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> as the probe member reciprocates back and forth against the magnetic head slider.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the oscillations cause repetitive pushing action against the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> using the oscillation of the probe member <b>202</b> while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer <b>200</b> to the probe member. The repeated pushing action overcomes the adhesion force of the adhesive <b>114</b> and causes separation of the magnetic head slider <b>112</b> from the head gimbal assembly <b>100</b>. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer.</p>
