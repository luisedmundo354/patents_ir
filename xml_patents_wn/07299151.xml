<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The embodiments described below pertain to methods and systems for measuring various dimensions of a microdevice during processing. The microdevice can comprise various components which are processed to produce a functional microdevice. Some forms of microdevice processing can add and/or remove material to a base substrate material to form a functional microdevice. The described embodiments can allow dimensions such as thicknesses of the various materials to be determined. Some embodiments allow such dimensions to be determined during processing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment a removal process can be utilized to form a feature through a substrate having one or more layers positioned thereon. Measuring substrate material remaining between the feature and the layers can allow the feature to be completed through the substrate with a decreased risk of damaging the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Several examples are described for forming a microdevice comprising a fluid-ejecting device. In these examples the fluid-ejecting device comprises an ink jet print head. One or more processing steps can be used to form a feature in the substrate of the ink jet print head. Various processing steps can be utilized to increase a depth of the feature until it passes entirely through the substrate's thickness. The various components described below may not be illustrated accurately as far as their size is concerned. Rather, the included figures are intended as diagrammatic representations to illustrate to the reader various inventive principles that are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Examples of particular feature size, shape, and arrangement are depicted herein. However any type of feature size and geometry may be fabricated using the inventive methods and apparatuses described herein. In addition, while the described embodiments herein describe and discuss ink jet print cartridges, the inventive methods and apparatuses described herein can be used in order to fabricate other microdevices.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this particular embodiment substrate <b>300</b> comprises silicon which either can be doped or undoped. Other substrate materials can include, but are not limited to, glass, aluminum oxide, gallium arsenide, quartz, fused silica, indium phosphide, or other material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Substrate thicknesses (in the z-direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can have any suitable dimensions that are appropriate for substrates' intended applications. In some embodiments substrate thicknesses taken relative to the z-direction can range from less than 100 microns to more than 2000 microns. One exemplary embodiment can utilize a substrate that is approximately 675 microns thick. Though a single substrate is discussed herein, other suitable embodiments may comprise a substrate that has multiple components during assembly and/or in the finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example one such embodiment may employ a substrate having a first component and a second sacrificial component which is discarded at some point during processing. In this particular embodiment, one or more thin-film layers <b>314</b> are positioned over substrate's second surface <b>303</b>. In at least some embodiments a barrier layer <b>316</b> and an orifice plate or orifice layer <b>318</b> are positioned over the thin-film layers <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment one or more thin-film layers <b>314</b> can comprise one or more electrical insulating layers such as oxides or nitrides, conductive traces (not shown) and electrical components such as resistors <b>320</b> and transistors (not shown). Individual resistors can be controlled selectively via the electrical traces. Thin-film layers <b>314</b> also can define in some embodiments, at least in part, a wall or surface of multiple fluid-feed passageways <b>322</b> through which fluid can pass. Barrier layer <b>316</b> can define, at least in part, multiple firing chambers <b>324</b>. In some embodiments barrier layer <b>316</b> may define, alone or in combination with thin-film layers <b>314</b>, fluid-feed passageways <b>322</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Laser machining provides just one suitable embodiment for removing substrate material. Alternatively or additionally to laser machining, other embodiments can utilize one or more of a wet etching apparatus, a dry etching apparatus, and an apparatus configured to mechanically remove substrate material such as an abrasive jet apparatus and a sawing apparatus, among others.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various exemplary embodiments can utilize one or more mirrors <b>414</b>, galvanometers <b>416</b> and/or lenses <b>418</b> to direct laser beam <b>408</b> at first surface <b>302</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments laser beam <b>408</b> can be focused in order to increase its energy density to machine the substrate more effectively. In these exemplary embodiments the laser beam can be focused to achieve a desired geometry where the laser beam contacts the substrate <b>300</b><i>a</i>. In this embodiment laser beam <b>408</b> is directed at substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>from a direction sufficient to contact first surface <b>302</b><i>a </i>before contacting second surface <b>303</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Processing system <b>402</b> also includes a substrate measuring means which in this embodiment comprises reflectometer <b>422</b>. In this embodiment the reflectometer comprises a base unit <b>430</b> and a test arm or optical launch <b>432</b>. Base unit <b>430</b> can contain a reference arm, not specifically shown, but described below. In this embodiment test arm <b>432</b> comprises a fiber optic <b>434</b> extending between base unit <b>430</b> and a terminal end or fiber tip <b>436</b>. A focusing lens <b>438</b> may be positioned between the fiber tip <b>436</b> and the substrate <b>300</b><i>a</i>. In this embodiment fiber tip <b>436</b> and/or lens <b>438</b> can be positioned by an adjustable stage <b>440</b> for relative movement between the fiber tip/lens and substrate <b>300</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Reflectometer <b>422</b> can generate data that can be used for measuring a dimension of substrate <b>300</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the reflectometer is configured to generate data relating to a thickness of substrate material indicated generally at e and extending between second surface <b>303</b><i>a </i>and feature <b>404</b>. In some embodiments fiber optic <b>434</b> can have a length sufficient to position fiber tip <b>436</b> proximate substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>while allowing base unit <b>430</b> to be positioned sufficiently far enough from substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>to be protected from contaminations generated during processing. The reference arm can be adjusted to have an optical length identical to or preferably zero to 10 cm less than the test arm. Further, in this embodiment test arm <b>432</b> is positioned below second surface <b>303</b><i>a </i>to measure a dimension of the substrate. In such a configuration the substrate can protect the test arm from debris created during laser processing when compared to a measuring device positioned on the side of the substrate from which the processing is occurring. Though a single substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>is depicted for ease of explanation, many embodiments can employ a wafer or similar structure comprising multiple substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reflectometer <b>422</b> can be configured to generate optical energy or light of a desired wavelength. A wavelength can be selected to which the object under test, in this case substrate <b>300</b><i>a</i>, is transparent, or only slightly absorbing to an extent that sufficient optical energy is transmitted through substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>for acceptable reflectometer operation. Simultaneously some of the light is sent to the test arm <b>432</b> and ultimately to substrate <b>300</b><i>a </i>and some of the light is sent to the reference arm. Of the light directed toward the substrate, varying amounts are reflected back toward the fiber tip <b>436</b>. From the fiber tip, the reflected light is transmitted back to base unit <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the reference arm a mirror is translated in space at the end of the reference arm effectively changing the optical length of the reference arm. When the optical length of the reference arm equals that of the optical length to a reflection source in the test arm <b>432</b>, a fringe burst is measured whose strength is recorded along with the mirror position. The differential distance of the mirror recorded for each fringe burst provides the differential optical path length (differential optical path length=c*delta time/ngr where ngr is the group index of the light in that medium and c is the velocity of the light in a vacuum. Group index is defined to be the ratio of the propagation velocity of a light pulse in a vacuum relative to the velocity of propagation of a pulse in the medium) for the device under test <b>300</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The strength of the fringe burst is indicative of the strength of the reflection within the device under test <b>300</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment light l is selected to have a wavelength to which barrier layer <b>316</b><i>b </i>and substrate <b>300</b><i>b </i>are transparent. Some embodiments can utilize light having a center wavelength above about 1000 nanometers (nm) for these particular barrier layer and substrate materials. This particular embodiment utilizes light having a wavelength of about 1310 nm with a full-width at half maximum bandwidth of about 60 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As light l travels away from fiber tip <b>436</b><i>b </i>portions of light or photons are reflected back into the fiber tip <b>436</b><i>b</i>.

The reflected light can be converted to data for determining substrate dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Among other conditions, relatively large amounts of light l are reflected when the light encounters an interface of two materials having different indices of refraction. For example air has an index of refraction of about 1.0 while the polymer barrier layer <b>316</b><i>b </i>has a higher index of refraction. A relatively large amount of light reflects at the air to barrier interface indicated generally at <b>502</b> and represented generally by peak <b>503</b>. Similarly, the barrier layer has a different index of refraction than silicon which is about 3.5. As such, a relatively large amount of light l reflects from this interface indicated generally at <b>504</b> and represented generally by peak <b>505</b>. Further, light l encounters another interface <b>506</b> at bottom surface <b>500</b> of feature <b>404</b><i>b </i>that is represented generally by peak <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The data depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>can be utilized to determine a physical or metric dimension of a print head material. For example the measured differential optical path length of a medium can be divided by the group index of light in the medium at the known source center wavelength such as 1310 nm and multiplied by the group index in air at the known source center wavelength such as 1310 nm to determine the metric thickness of the medium. A thickness of substrate material e<sub>1 </sub>can be determined utilizing the group index of the light in the silicon, the group index of light in air, and the reflectometer data indicating differential optical path length between peak <b>505</b> and peak <b>507</b>.

In this particular embodiment laser beam <b>408</b><i>c </i>removes substrate material to form the feature. Alternatively or additionally other substrate removal techniques can be utilized. Interfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>606</b><i>a</i>, and <b>608</b><i>a </i>correspond to peaks <b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>614</b><i>a</i>, <b>616</b><i>a </i>and <b>618</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d</i>.

In contrast, peak <b>618</b><i>a </i>is shifted left toward peak <b>616</b><i>a </i>relative to peak <b>616</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>.

This data can provide additional information. For example if the data of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>indicates that substrate thickness t equals 675 microns and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>indicates thickness e<sub>1 </sub>is 185 microns then 490 microns of material was removed to form feature <b>404</b><i>c</i>. If laser beam <b>408</b><i>c </i>made 30 passes over substrate <b>300</b><i>c </i>then laser beam <b>408</b><i>c </i>is removing an average of 16.33 microns of substrate material per pass. Such information can be utilized to control a processing system such as processing system <b>402</b><i>a </i>described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>e</i>-<b>6</b><i>f </i>illustrate a subsequent process step where additional substrate material is removed. Peaks <b>616</b><i>b</i>, <b>618</b><i>b </i>corresponding to interfaces <b>606</b><i>b</i>, <b>608</b><i>b </i>respectively, indicate that region <b>501</b><i>c </i>has a thickness e<sub>2 </sub>of 30 microns.

For example in one embodiment where design parameters indicate that the laser machining process should leave a substrate thickness e of 20-33 microns defining feature <b>404</b><i>c </i>the data regarding thickness e and substrate removal per laser pass can be utilized to determine a number of additional laser passes.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other embodiments may utilize the reflectometer data to control the removal process. For example, when the reflectometer data indicates that thickness e reaches a predetermined value such as 30 microns, the controller can cause the laser source to generate laser beam <b>408</b><i>c </i>at a lower power that removes less substrate material per pass so that a more precise thickness parameter can be achieved. Maintaining more precise parameters can contribute to print head quality and uniformity. For example some print head fabrication processes may want to remove as much substrate material with laser beam <b>408</b><i>c </i>as possible without breaking through the substrate's second surface <b>303</b><i>c</i>. If the laser beam breaks through the substrate it may damage the underlying layers. A second removal process may be utilized to remove additional substrate material and/or to finish the feature to form a through feature or slot. One such example can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>g </i>where feature <b>404</b><i>c </i>comprises a slot through substrate <b>300</b><i>c </i>and barrier layer <b>316</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Reflectometer's fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>can be positioned relative to print head <b>204</b><i>d </i>by fixture <b>440</b><i>d</i>. To determine the location of area <b>702</b> fixture <b>440</b><i>d </i>can position fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>at one extreme of the print head. For example to determine the location of area <b>702</b> in the y-direction, fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>can be positioned at the extreme left or right side of the print head. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>is positioned at the extreme left side.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When light is reflected from interface <b>704</b> at the first surface of barrier layer <b>316</b><i>d </i>a peak <b>705</b> is generated. When light is reflected from interface <b>706</b> at thin-films <b>314</b><i>d </i>a second peak <b>707</b> is generated. Since essentially no light passes through thin film <b>314</b><i>d </i>no subsequent peaks occur.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>c</i>-<b>7</b><i>d </i>illustrate print head <b>204</b><i>d </i>where fixture <b>440</b><i>d </i>moved fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>to the right, but still below thin film material <b>314</b><i>d</i>. Peaks <b>705</b><i>a</i>, <b>707</b><i>a </i>indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d </i>essentially match those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>e</i>-<b>7</b><i>f </i>illustrate print head <b>204</b><i>d </i>where fixture <b>440</b><i>d </i>moved fiber tip <b>436</b><i>d </i>further to the right. Light from the fiber tip will now reflect from interfaces <b>704</b><i>b</i>, <b>706</b><i>b </i>and <b>712</b>. These interfaces are represented by peaks <b>705</b><i>b</i>, <b>707</b><i>b </i>and <b>713</b> respectively. Similarly, more data can be generated by moving the fiber tip progressively to the right. An edge of the print head can be determined by scanning and moving until the data indicates no reflection associated with the print head. The data indicating the location of the area can be utilized by a controller to guide or otherwise to effect substrate removal to ensure proper alignment of a feature relative to the area. A similar technique can be employed in the x-direction to determine the relative x-dimensional location of area <b>702</b>. A grid pattern also can be mapped out by making multiple passes in the x and y directions with the reflectometer. Such an example is discussed below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-8</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-8</figref><i>a </i>illustrate a further embodiment which combines embodiments described above to produce data which can map thickness e<sub>3 </sub>of multiple subunits of region <b>501</b><i>e </i>of a microdevice <b>804</b>. In this embodiment region <b>501</b><i>e </i>can be defined between bottom surface <b>500</b><i>e </i>and second surface <b>303</b><i>e </i>of substrate <b>300</b><i>e</i>. In this particular embodiment the subunits comprise 60 subunits <b>802</b><i>e</i><sub>1</sub>-<b>802</b><i>e</i><sub>60 </sub>though for purposes of clarity they are not all specifically labeled. Other embodiments may map the thickness into more or less subunits than the 60 subunits comprising this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Reflectometer's fiber tip <b>436</b><i>e </i>can be moved over second surface <b>303</b><i>e </i>along the x-axis, y-axis and/or combination thereof for positioning proximate the various subunits. An example of moving the fiber tip relative to the substrate and along the y-axis is provided above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>g</i>. The fiber tip can then be repositioned in the x-direction and the process described above repeated. Other mapping methods should be recognized by the skilled artisan. The data generated by this movement or mapping can be utilized by a controller to effect further processing of individual sub-units <b>802</b><i>e</i>. For example, if an individual sub-unit <b>802</b><i>e</i><sub>1 </sub>has a thickness greater than a predetermined tolerance value then further processing can be conducted on that sub-unit such as with a laser beam. Sub-units <b>802</b><i>e</i><sub>2 </sub>and <b>802</b><i>e</i><sub>3 </sub>which fall within the tolerance value would not receive additional substrate removal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some embodiments could remap region <b>501</b><i>e </i>until all subunits <b>802</b><i>e </i>fell within the predetermined tolerance value. The skilled artisan should recognize other embodiments. The embodiment described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-8</figref><i>a </i>could also be utilized to map one or more surfaces of a wafer for deviations from a desired planarity. Any deviation could be utilized by a controller to adjust various processing techniques.</p>
