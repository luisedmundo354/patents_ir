A PR modulator may then be administered alone or in combination with an estrogen for a period of 1 to 11 days to begin on any cycle day between day 14 and 24. The PR modulator in these combinations may be administered at a dose of from about 2 Î¼g to about 50 Î¼g per day and the estrogen may be administered at a dose of from about 10 Î¼g to about 35 Î¼g per day. In an oral administration, a package or kit containing 28 tablets will include a placebo tablet on those days when the PR modulator, progestin, or estrogen is not administered.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0094">Progestational agents include, but are not limited to, tanaproget, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, desogestrel, 3-ketodesogestrel, norethindrone, gestodene, norethindrone acetate, norgestimate, osaterone, cyproterone acetate, trimegestone, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, or (17-deacetyl)norgestimate. Among the desirable progestins for use in the combinations are levonorgestrel, gestodene and trimegestone.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0095">Examples of orally administered regimens over a 28 day cycle include administration of a progestational agent solely for the first 21 days at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 100 Î¼g of levonorgestrel. A PR modulator compound can then be administered at a daily dose of from about 1 to 200 mg from day 22 to day 24, followed by no administration or administration of a placebo for days 25 to 28. It is most desirable that the daily dosages of each relevant active ingredient be incorporated into a combined, single daily dosage unit, totaling 28 daily units per 28-day cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0096">In another regimen, a progestational agent may be coadministered for the first 21 days at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 150 Î¼g levonorgestrel, desirably equal in activity to from about 35 to about 100 Î¼g levonorgestrel, with an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g. This may be followed as described above with a PR modulator administered at a daily dose of from about 1 to 250 mg from day 22 to day 24, followed by no administration or administration of a placebo for days 25 to 28.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0097">Still another regimen can include co-administration from days 1 to 21 of a progestational agent, e.g., levonorgestrel, being administered at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to from about 35 to about 100 Î¼g levonorgestrel, and an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g. This will be followed on days 22 to 24 by coadministration of a PR modulator (1 to 250 mg/day) and an estrogen, such as ethinyl estradiol, at a daily dose of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g. From day 25 to day 28, this regimen may be followed by no administration or administration of a placebo.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0098">The compounds and compositions can be included in kits or packages of pharmaceutical formulations designed for use in the regimens described herein. These kits are desirably designed for daily oral administration over a 28-day cycle, desirably for one oral administration per day, and organized so as to indicate a single oral formulation or combination of oral formulations to be taken on each day of the 28-day cycle. Desirably, each kit will include oral tablets to be taken on each the days specified. Desirably, one oral tablet will contain each of the combined daily dosages indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0099">According to the regimens described above, one 28-day kit may include (a) an initial phase of from 14 to 21 daily dosage units of a progestational agent equal in progestational activity to about 35 to about 150 Î¼g levonorgestrel, desirably equal in progestational activity to about 35 to about 100 Î¼g levonorgestrel; (b) a second phase of from 1 to 11 daily dosage units of a PR modulator compound, each daily dosage unit containing the PR modulator compound at a daily dosage of from about 1 to 250 mg; and (c) optionally, a third phase of an orally and pharmaceutically acceptable placebo for the remaining days of the cycle in which no PR modulator (i.e., antiprogestin or progestin) or estrogen is administered.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0100">In one embodiment of this kit, the initial phase involves 21 daily dosage units as described in the preceding passage, a second phase of 3 daily dosage units for days 22 to 24 of a PR modulator compound and an optional third phase of 4 daily units of an orally and pharmaceutically acceptable placebo for each of days 25 to 28.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0101">In another embodiment, a 28-day cycle packaged regimen or kit contains a first phase of from 18 to 21 daily dosage units, and more desirably, 21 days, as described in the preceding passages, and, further including, as an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g; a second phase of from 1 to 7 daily dosage units, and desirably, 4 daily dosage units, as described above, and an optional placebo for each of the remaining 0-9 days, or about 4 days, in the 28-day cycle in which no progestational agent, estrogen or antiprogestin is administered.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0102">A further 28-day packaged regimen or kit includes (a) a first phase of from 18 to 21 daily dosage units, each containing a progestational agent at a daily dose equal in progestational activity to about 35 to about 150 Î¼g levonorgestrel, desirably equal in activity to from about 35 to about 100 Î¼g levonorgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol at a daily dose range of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g; (b) a second phase of from 1 to 7 daily dose units, each daily dose unit containing a PR modulator at a concentration of from 1 to 250 mg and ethinyl estradiol at a concentration of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g; and (c) optionally, an orally and pharmaceutically acceptable placebo for each of the remaining 0-9 days in the 28-day cycle in which no progestational agent, estrogen or antiprogestin is administered.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0103">In one embodiment, the package or kit just described includes a first phase of 21 daily dosage units; a second phase of 3 daily dosage units for days 22 to 24, each daily dose unit containing an PR modulator at a concentration of from 2 to 200 mg and ethinyl estradiol at a concentration of from about 10 to about 35 Î¼g; and optionally, a third phase of 4 daily units of an orally and pharmaceutically acceptable placebo for each of days 25 to 28.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0104">In each of the regimens and kits just described, it is desirable that the daily dosage of each pharmaceutically active component of the regimen remain fixed in each particular phase in which it is administered. It is also understood that the daily dose units described are to be administered in the order described, with the first phase followed in order by the second and third phases. To help facilitate compliance with each regimen, it is also desirable that the kits contain the placebo described for the final days of the cycle. It is further desirable that each package or kit include a pharmaceutically acceptable package having indicators for each day of the 28-day cycle, such as a labeled blister package or dial dispenser packages known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0105">As used herein, the terms anti-progestational agents, anti-progestins and progesterone receptor antagonists are understood to be synonymous.

LDA (2M in heptane/THF/ethylbenzene, 306 mL, 0.613 mol, 1.3 eq.) was added in a stream, over about 15 minutes. The temperature of the reaction rose to 24Â° C., and then began to subside to 7Â° C. The cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred for one hour until no starting material (1-methylpyrrole-2-carbonitrile) was detected by thin layer chromatography (TLC, 1/5: EtOAc/hexane). The reaction mixture was poured gradually into HCl (4N, 542 mL) cooled with ice bath. The ice bath was removed, and the mixture stirred at room temperature for one hour. The organic phase was separated, and the water phase extracted with EtOAc (2Ã300 mL). The combined organic phases was dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at or below 30Â° C. The crude product (66 g) was mixed with EtOAc (100 mL), cooled with ice-water bath and basified with cold NaOH (2 N, 500 mL) solution. The cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred efficiently until most solids had dissolved. The EtOAc phase was then separated, and the aqueous layer extracted with ether (200 mL). The light colored aqueous phase was cooled to 7Â° C. and acidified with HCl (6N, 180 mL) to pH 2-3.
