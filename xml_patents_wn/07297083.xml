<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to automotive axle assemblies. In particular, the present invention relates to a differential carrier assembly having an electric drive assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automobile manufacturers are increasingly offering for sale automobiles powered by electric motors. Electric motors provide numerous advantages when compared to traditional combustion engines. For example, electric motors typically operate more efficiently and emit fewer undesirable emissions to the environment. However, combustion engines generally outperform electric motors in numerous other performance categories and typically provide higher horsepower per pound when the weight of batteries are taken into consideration. Further, automobiles propelled by electric motors are generally more expensive than automobiles propelled by combustion engines and need to be recharged more often than a vehicle propelled by a combustion engine needs to be refueled. Therefore, in spite of the advantages associated with electric motors, consumers are generally reluctant to purchase motor vehicles propelled solely by electric motors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a motor vehicle that offers the advantages of an electric engine, such as increased efficiency, as well as the advantages of a combustion engine, such as reduced cost and enhanced performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one form, the present invention provides for an axle assembly for a motor vehicle. The assembly comprises a carrier housing and a differential assembly that is rotatably mounted to the carrier housing. A ring gear is fixed to the differential assembly for rotation therewith. A first pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The first pinion is adapted to be driven by a combustion engine and is operable to drive the ring gear. An electric drive assembly is mounted to the carrier housing. The electric drive assembly includes an electric motor and a second pinion. The second pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The second pinion is selectively driven by the electric motor and is operable to drive the ring gear.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another form, the present invention provides for an axle assembly for a motor vehicle. The axle assembly comprises a carrier housing and a ring gear rotatably mounted within the carrier housing. A first pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear and is operable to drive the ring gear. A second pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The second pinion is also operable to drive the ring gear. An electric motor is mounted to the carrier housing. A controller monitors the operating parameters of the motor vehicle. The controller selectively activates and deactivates the electric motor in response to the status of the operating parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another form, the present invention provides for a method for propelling a motor vehicle having both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. The internal combustion engine is selectively coupled to a ring gear. The ring gear is rotatably mounted within a carrier housing. The electric motor is selectively operable to provide drive torque to the ring gear. The method comprises the following steps: drivingly interconnecting the ring gear and the combustion engine; drivingly interconnecting the ring and the electric motor; monitoring predetermined operating parameters of the motor vehicle using a controller; and selectively activating and deactivating the electric motor based on the status of the predetermined operating parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The housing <b>40</b> includes an opening <b>156</b> to allow components of the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> to cooperate with the ring gear <b>82</b>. The opening <b>156</b> can be specifically formed to accommodate the position of the assembly <b>26</b> or the opening <b>156</b> can be a pre-existing opening, such as a conventional carrier cover pan opening as illustrated.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electric drive assembly <b>26</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> generally comprises a second pinion <b>160</b>, an electric motor <b>162</b>, and a clutch assembly <b>164</b>.

Furthermore, as illustrated, the axis <b>175</b> may be offset from axis <b>46</b> to form a hypoid gear arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The motor <b>162</b> and the clutch <b>164</b> are both seated within a motor housing <b>178</b>. The motor housing <b>178</b> is rigidly coupled to an interior of the support casing <b>150</b> in any suitable manner. The motor housing <b>178</b> can also be integral with the casing <b>150</b>. The motor housing <b>178</b> includes an interior aperture <b>180</b> that extends through the approximate center of the motor housing <b>178</b>. The tail <b>170</b> extends through the interior aperture <b>180</b>. The motor housing <b>178</b> also includes cooling fins <b>182</b>. The cooling fins <b>182</b> are located on an outer surface of the housing <b>178</b> to increase the surface area of the motor housing <b>178</b> and assist in cooling the components of the housing <b>178</b>, such as the electric motor <b>162</b> and the clutch <b>164</b> assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The motor <b>162</b> is integral with or mounted within the motor housing <b>178</b> using any suitable mounting means. The motor <b>162</b> can be any suitable electric motor. The motor <b>162</b> includes a rotor <b>184</b>. The rotor <b>184</b> is generally cylindrical and has a center aperture. The rotor <b>184</b> is rotationally mounted within the housing <b>178</b>. The rotor <b>184</b> rotates about the third axis <b>175</b>. The pinion tail <b>170</b> extends through the center aperture of the rotor <b>184</b>. Thus, the rotor <b>184</b> may rotate about the pinion tail <b>170</b>. The motor <b>162</b> is powered by any suitable power source, such as the alternator <b>28</b> or the battery <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clutch assembly <b>164</b> generally includes a clutch pack <b>190</b> and an actuator <b>192</b>. The clutch pack <b>190</b> includes a series of first clutch plates <b>194</b> and a series of second clutch plates <b>196</b>. The first clutch plates <b>194</b> are splined to the tail <b>170</b> of the second pinion <b>160</b> and the second clutch plates <b>196</b> are splined to the rotor <b>184</b>. The first and second clutch plates <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> are interleaved with one another. The first and second clutch plates <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> are axially slidable along the third axis <b>175</b>. The actuator <b>192</b> is operable to axially slide the second clutch plates <b>196</b> into engagement with the first clutch plates <b>194</b>. The actuator <b>192</b> can be any conventional actuator. For example, the actuator <b>192</b> can be a hydraulic actuator or an electric actuator, which could be powered by the alternator <b>28</b> or the battery <b>29</b>. When the first and second clutch plates <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> engage each other, rotation of the rotor <b>184</b> effectuates rotation of the second pinion <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller <b>30</b> monitors various operating parameters of the vehicle <b>10</b> and controls the operation of the electric drive assembly <b>26</b>. The controller <b>30</b> can by any suitable signal processing device or control device, such as a microcomputer. The controller receives inputs from various sensors <b>32</b>, which monitor different parameters of the vehicle <b>10</b>. The sensors <b>32</b> can each be any suitable conventional sensing device. Specifically, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the sensor <b>32</b>A monitors the speed of the engine <b>16</b>. The sensor <b>32</b>B monitors the revolutions of the drive shaft <b>20</b> to determine the ground speed of the vehicle <b>10</b>. The sensor <b>32</b>C monitors the rotational speed of the ring gear <b>82</b>. The sensor <b>32</b>D monitors the rotational speed of the second pinion <b>160</b>. The sensor <b>32</b>E monitors the operation of the electric motor <b>162</b>, the position of the clutch <b>164</b>, and the position of the actuator <b>192</b>. The sensor <b>32</b>F monitors the throttle position as an indication of the amount of acceleration desired by the operator. The controller <b>30</b> is also operable to send commands to the engine <b>16</b> and the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> to control their operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The controller <b>30</b> activates the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> when certain predetermined operating conditions of the motor vehicle <b>10</b> are present. In some applications, the controller <b>30</b> is programmed to activate the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> when the vehicle <b>10</b> is accelerating from a standstill, such as between 0 mph and 10 mph, and at highway cruising speeds, such as above 55 mph. However, the controller <b>30</b> can be programmed to activate the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> in response to the occurrence of a variety of different conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Operation of the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> when the controller <b>30</b> is programmed to activate the motor <b>162</b> at lower speeds (speeds less than 10 mph) and highway cruising speeds (speeds greater than 55 mph) will now be described in detail. If vehicle <b>10</b> is at a stationary position, or rolling at less than 10 mph, sensor <b>32</b>B sends a signal to the controller <b>30</b> as such. Controller <b>30</b> also receives a signal from sensor <b>32</b>F indicative of the throttle position. The controller then sends commands to the motor <b>162</b> and the actuator <b>192</b> to activate the motor <b>162</b> and the actuator <b>192</b> if vehicle acceleration is requested. Activation of the motor <b>162</b> causes the rotor <b>184</b> to rotate about the third axis of rotation <b>175</b>. The activated actuator <b>192</b> axially slides the first clutch plates <b>194</b> and the second clutch plates <b>196</b> into engagement to drivingly interconnect the rotor <b>184</b> and the second pinion tail <b>170</b>. Therefore, rotation of the rotor <b>184</b> effectuates rotation of the second pinion <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The controller <b>30</b> also controls the speed at which the rotor <b>184</b> and the second pinion <b>160</b> rotate. During acceleration of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the second pinion <b>160</b> exerts a driving force on the ring gear <b>82</b> to supplement the driving force that the first pinion <b>110</b> exerts upon the ring gear <b>82</b>. This condition allows decreasing the output required by the engine <b>16</b>. To properly operate motor <b>162</b>, the controller <b>30</b> identifies the speed of the engine <b>16</b>, the speed of the ring gear <b>82</b> and the position of the throttle. Use of the motor <b>162</b> in this manner to decrease the load on the engine <b>16</b> advantageously improves the fuel economy of the vehicle <b>10</b> and prolongs the life of the engine <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the controller <b>30</b> determines that the speed of the vehicle <b>10</b> is greater than 10 mph by processing inputs from the sensor <b>32</b>B, the controller <b>30</b> sends a signal to the motor <b>162</b> to deactivate the motor <b>162</b>. Even after the motor <b>162</b> is deactivated, the second pinion <b>160</b> continues to rotate due to the cooperation between the head <b>172</b> and the ring gear <b>82</b>. At this time, motor <b>162</b> may be decoupled from second pinion <b>160</b> or may remain coupled to provide braking. For example, the controller <b>30</b> may be programmed to deactivate actuator <b>192</b> to decouple the second pinion <b>160</b> from the rotor <b>184</b>. Alternatively, if the second pinion <b>160</b> and the rotor <b>184</b> remain coupled, then rotation of the second pinion due to rotation of the ring gear <b>82</b> results in rotation of the rotor <b>184</b>, thus causing the motor <b>162</b> to act as a generator. Electricity generated by the motor <b>162</b> can be transferred to the battery <b>29</b> during a charging operation. If the second pinion <b>160</b> and the rotor <b>184</b> are decoupled then the second pinion <b>160</b> freely spins and no electricity is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The electric drive assembly <b>26</b> can also serve as the sole source of propulsion for the vehicle <b>10</b>. For example, after the vehicle <b>10</b> is propelled to a predetermined cruising speed by the engine <b>16</b>, such as 55 mph, the controller <b>30</b> can activate the electric motor <b>162</b> to rotate the second pinion <b>160</b> in the manner set forth above. The controller <b>30</b> then commands the engine <b>16</b> to reduce its RPM output to idle and the rotational speed of the second pinion <b>160</b> is set to provide the entire driving force necessary to drive the ring gear <b>82</b> and propel the vehicle <b>10</b>. At idle, the engine <b>16</b> is still operable to maintain the power steering, power brakes, and other vehicle accessories, but uses far less fuel and improves the vehicle's fuel economy. To accelerate the vehicle <b>10</b> after the engine <b>16</b> is brought to idle, the controller <b>30</b> can increase the rotational speed of the second pinion <b>160</b> and/or increase the speed of the engine <b>16</b> to increase the rotational speed of the first pinion <b>110</b>. The motor <b>162</b> can also be used to provide the entire driving force necessary to drive the ring gear <b>82</b> to propel the vehicle <b>10</b> from a standstill.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an electric drive assembly according to an additional embodiment at reference numeral <b>200</b>. The electric drive assembly <b>200</b> is similar to the electric drive assembly <b>26</b> and like reference numbers are used to identify like elements of the embodiments with the like elements of the assembly <b>200</b> including the prime (′) designation. The above description of the like elements and their operation equally applies to the assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The assembly <b>200</b> is a simplified version of assembly <b>26</b> and does not include the clutch assembly <b>164</b>. In the assembly <b>200</b>, the rotor <b>184</b>′ of the motor <b>162</b>′ is rotationally fixed to the tail <b>170</b>′ of the second pinion <b>160</b>′. Therefore, rotation of the second pinion <b>160</b>′ by the ring gear <b>82</b> when the motor <b>162</b>′ is not activated causes the rotor <b>184</b>′ to rotate. Controller <b>30</b> is operable to allow motor <b>162</b>′ to rotate freely or to function as a generator to generate electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an electric drive assembly according to an alternate embodiment at reference numeral <b>300</b>. The electric drive assembly <b>300</b> is similar to the electric drive assemblies <b>26</b> and <b>200</b> and like reference numbers are used to identify like elements of the embodiments with the like elements of the assembly <b>300</b> including the double prime (″) designation. The above description of the like elements equally applies to the assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The assembly <b>300</b> is substantially similar to the assembly <b>200</b> except that the assembly <b>300</b> includes a pinion actuator <b>302</b>. The actuator <b>302</b> can be any conventional actuator that is operable to linearly slide the second pinion <b>160</b>″ along the third axis <b>175</b>″ between a first position A, in which the head <b>172</b>″ meshingly engages the ring gear <b>82</b>, and a second position B, in which the head <b>172</b>″ is spaced apart from the ring gear <b>82</b>. In this embodiment, when torque is required from the motor <b>162</b>″, the controller <b>30</b> checks the position of the actuator <b>302</b> using the sensor <b>32</b>E to make sure that the second pinion <b>160</b>″ is at position A. If the second pinion <b>160</b>″ is not at position A then the controller activates the actuator <b>302</b> to move the second pinion <b>160</b>″ to position A.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the controller <b>30</b> determines that use of the motor <b>162</b>″ is not necessary, the controller <b>30</b> deactivates the motor <b>162</b>″. If the controller <b>30</b> determines that the battery <b>29</b>, or other device, needs to be recharged, the controller <b>30</b> keeps the second pinion <b>160</b>″ at position A so that rotation of the second pinion <b>160</b>″ by the ring gear <b>82</b> will rotate the rotor <b>184</b>″ and cause the motor <b>162</b>″ to generate electricity that can be stored by the battery <b>29</b>. If the controller <b>30</b> determines that the motor <b>162</b>″ does not need to be used to generate electricity, then the controller <b>30</b> signals the actuator <b>302</b> to move the second pinion <b>160</b>″ to position B so that the second pinion <b>160</b>″ is not in drivingly engaged with the ring gear <b>82</b>. Use of the assembly <b>300</b> is advantageous because the second pinion <b>160</b>″ can be moved from engagement with the ring gear <b>82</b> when the motor <b>162</b>″ is not in use and, therefore, the second pinion <b>160</b>″ does not cause unnecessary drag on the ring gear <b>82</b>, which can negatively effect fuel economy. The actuator <b>302</b> of the assembly <b>300</b> can also be provided in the assemblies <b>26</b> and <b>200</b> described above to move the second pinions <b>160</b> and <b>160</b>′ into and out of engagement with the ring gear <b>82</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the electric drive assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> of the present invention can be adapted for use with most any type of motor vehicle. For example, the assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> can be adapted to vehicles having front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, two wheel drive, four wheel drive, and all wheel drive systems. Further, the assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> may be mounted to existing carrier assemblies of previously manufactured vehicles. Also, the assemblies <b>26</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> may be provided with new carrier assemblies of new vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, the electric drive assembly of the present invention is operable to increase the fuel economy of the vehicle <b>10</b> and decrease the load on the engine <b>16</b> by driving a second pinion <b>160</b> that is in cooperation with the ring gear <b>82</b>. The driving force exerted by the second pinion <b>160</b> replaces or supplements the driving force of the first pinion <b>110</b> and thus the output required of the engine <b>16</b> is decreased. The electric motor <b>162</b> may be in operation at all times or only at select times, such as during acceleration when the demands of the engine <b>16</b> are the greatest or during highway cruising speeds when the electric motor <b>162</b> is capable of solely propelling the vehicle <b>10</b> with minimal performance loss. The electric drive assembly offers such advantages while still providing the user with the performance advantages of a traditional combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications and variations may be made therein without department from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
