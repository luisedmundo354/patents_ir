<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) on patent application Ser. No(s). 2003-065146 filed in JAPAN on Mar. 11, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image recording method and a device which encode, split and multiplex moving image data and sound data associated with moving image data by predetermined sizes, and an image converting method and a device which convert multiplexed moving image data and sound data into playback data format in which playback auxiliary information is to be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Arts</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group Phase2) is widely used as a format to compress moving image data with sound data obtained by image recording devices such as a digital camera, a video camera, and the like. Referring to the upper portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, moving image data V and sound data A, associated with the moving image data V, are independent data streams respectively. The moving image data V and the sound data A are encoded and multiplexed in MPEG2 format.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 11-296312 discloses a method to packetize compressively encoded sound data followed by compressively encoded moving image data, and record the packet data in a recording medium. Each packet data has the size of integer multiplication of fixed data block.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-24983, encoded data obtained by encoding moving image data is temporarily buffered until the encoded data has the size of certain units. At the same time, attached information related to the encoded data is also buffered. Buffered attached information is multiplexed in a predetermined area of the encoded data of certain units.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Processing (See the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is carried out in order to convert compressed moving image data with sound data, which is compressed by MPEG2 format, into DVD (Digital Video/Versatile Disc)-Video format data. In other words, multiplexed moving image data V and sound data A in MPEG2 format are demultiplexed to form respective data streams again. Thereafter, the data streams are remultiplexed by inserting NV_CPK, which is playback auxiliary information unique to DVD-video format, at the initial address of a unit (VOBU, Video Object Unit) which includes the sound data A and the moving image data V.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the MPEG2 format data is converted into the DVD-Video format data by the above-mentioned method, an additional area in a memory is necessary to temporarily buffer demultiplexed moving image data V and sound data A. Further, the above-mentioned method is inefficient since it requires additional time for remultiplexing the data streams. Therefore, the above-mentioned problems cannot be solved by the methods disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publications No. 11-296312 and No. 2001-24983, since demultiplexing and remultiplexing processes cannot be omitted to form the DVD-Video format data.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide an image recording method and a device which can perform effective data conversion without demultiplexing and remultiplexing moving image data and sound data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide an image converting method and a device which can convert a recording format of the moving image data with the sound data recorded by the above-mentioned recording method/device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the above objects, an image recording device according to the present invention comprises encoding means for encoding the moving image data, the sound data and attached information related to the moving image data and the sound data, and multiplex recording means for splitting and multiplexing encoded attached information, encoded sound data and encoded moving image data by predetermined sizes respectively. The encoded attached information has a unique identifying code and a data size equal to or larger than playback auxiliary information which is referred to in playing back the moving image. The encoded attached information is recorded in an area where the playback auxiliary information is to be recorded. It is preferable that the multiplex recording is carried out according to MPEG2 format.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When multiplexed attached information, sound data and moving image data is converted into playback data format in which the playback auxiliary information is to be recorded, it is identified whether the attached information is recorded according to an identifying code in an area where the playback auxiliary information is to be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the attached information is identified, the playback auxiliary information, which has a data size that can replace the attached information, is generated. Thereafter, the identified attached information is replaced by the playback auxiliary information. It is preferable to use DVD-Video data format as playback data format.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, the attached information is easily replaced by the playback auxiliary information when multiplexed moving image data and sound data is converted into playback data format. Therefore, data conversion is performed effectively since it is not necessary to demultiplex and remultiplex the moving image data and the sound data.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a digital camera <b>2</b> is provided with a taking lens <b>10</b>, a release button <b>11</b>, operation parts <b>12</b>, a microphone <b>13</b>, and a liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>14</b>. By pressing the release button <b>11</b>, the taking lens <b>10</b> allows subject light into a CCD <b>15</b> disposed behind the taking lens <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An imaging signal output from the CCD <b>15</b> is input to a correlated double sampling circuit (not shown), and then output as image data of R, G, and B, each of which precisely corresponds to accumulated charge amount in each cell of the CCD <b>15</b>. Image data output from the correlated double sampling circuit is amplified in an amplifier (not shown) and converted into digital data in an A/D converter <b>16</b>. Image data is sent to the LCD <b>14</b> to display so-called “through the lens image”.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operation parts <b>12</b> include a power supply switch for turning on/off the power supply, and a mode selector switch for selecting various modes. The digital camera <b>2</b> has following selectable modes: a still image taking mode for taking still images, a moving image taking mode for taking moving images, a playback mode for displaying the taken images on the LCD <b>14</b>, a set up mode for setting up various settings, and the like. Ambient sound is recorded through a microphone <b>13</b> while taking the moving images in the moving image taking mode. The sound recorded by the microphone <b>13</b> is converted into digital sound data by the A/D converter <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Image data output from the A/D converter <b>16</b> is sent to an image signal processing circuit <b>18</b>, and is subject to various kinds of image processing, such as gradation conversion, white balance correction, γ correction processing, and the like. Sound data output from the A/D converter <b>17</b> is sent to a sound signal processing circuit <b>19</b>, and is subject to various processes, for instance, noise elimination.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The CPU <b>20</b> is connected to each circuit through a system bus <b>21</b> to control the whole operation of the digital camera <b>2</b>. A JPEG compression/decompression circuit <b>22</b>, a YC circuit <b>23</b>, an SDRAM <b>24</b>, a card I/F <b>25</b>, an LCD driver <b>26</b>, and an MPEG compression circuit <b>27</b> are connected to the system bus <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After being subjected to various processes in the image signal processing circuit <b>18</b>, image data is converted into YC image data, including a luminance signal Y and color-difference signals Cr and Cb, in the YC circuit <b>23</b>. The JPEG compression/decompression circuit <b>22</b> compresses the YC image data in JPEG format. Image data compressed in the JPEG compression/decompression circuit <b>22</b> is stored in a memory card <b>28</b>, which is removably inserted in the digital camera <b>2</b>, through the card I/F <b>25</b>. Alternatively, image data compressed in the JPEG compression/decompression circuit <b>22</b> is converted into composite signals in the LCD driver <b>26</b> to display the image in the LCD <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An EEPROM <b>29</b> is connected to the CPU <b>20</b> in addition to the release button <b>11</b> and the operation parts <b>12</b>. Various control programs and setting information are recorded in the EEPPROM <b>29</b>. The CPU <b>20</b> reads the information from the EEPROM <b>29</b> to the SDRAM <b>24</b>, which is a work memory, in order to carry out various processes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The MPEG compression circuit <b>27</b> compresses moving image data and sound data in MPEG2 format. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the MPEG compression circuit <b>27</b> has a video encoder <b>40</b>, a sound encoder <b>41</b>, an attached information encoder <b>42</b>, buffer memories <b>43</b>-<b>45</b>, a multiplex recording circuit <b>46</b>, and an output buffer memory <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The video encoder <b>40</b> encodes moving image data sent from the image signal processing circuit <b>18</b>. The sound encoder <b>41</b> encodes sound data associated with moving image data which is encoded by the video encoder <b>40</b>. The attached information encoder <b>42</b> encodes attached information related to encoded moving image data and encoded sound data. Each encoded data is stored in the buffer memories <b>43</b>-<b>45</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The multiplex recording circuit <b>46</b> multiplexes each data by the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. First, encoded attached information (referred to as FF_PCK), which is encoded by the attached information encoder <b>42</b>, is read out from the buffer memory <b>45</b> by, a predetermined data size. Next, the encoded sound data of one VOBU, which is encoded by the sound encoder <b>41</b>, is read out from the buffer memory <b>44</b> and appended to FF_PCK. Then, encoded moving image data of one VOBU, which is encoded by the video encoder <b>40</b>, is read out from the buffer memory <b>43</b> and appended to encoded sound data. Thereafter, multiplexed data is sent to the output buffer memory <b>47</b> and recorded in the memory card <b>28</b>. The multiplex recording circuit <b>46</b> repeats the above-mentioned steps until all the frames of taken moving images are multiplexed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">FF_PCK has the same data size (2,048 bytes) as NV (navigation)_PCK, which is playback auxiliary information used as a reference while playing back the moving images in DVD-Video format, and is recorded at the initial address of a VOBU where NV_PCK is to be recorded. A unique identifying code is attached to FF_PCK for identifying the recorded position and the data size. FF_PCK is replaced by NV_PCK when the MPEG2 data is converted into the DVD-video data. FF_PCK may have larger data size than NV_PCK as long as FF_PCK is replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an image converting device <b>50</b> converts compressed MPEG2 data compressed by the above-mentioned steps into DVD-video data, and includes an FF_PCK identifying section <b>51</b>, a data table creating section <b>52</b>, a NV_PCK generating section <b>53</b>, and a NV_PCK <b>54</b> replacing section <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The FF_PCK identifying section <b>51</b> identifies whether FF_PCK is recorded at the initial address of the VOBU of MPEG2 data, which is input in the image converting device <b>50</b>, according to the identifying code attached to FF_PCK. The data table creating section <b>52</b> creates a data table for generating NV_PCK which corresponds to input MPEG2 data. The NV_PCK replacing section <b>54</b> replaces FF_PCK by NV_PCK, which is generated in the NV_PCK generating section <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an operation of the image converting device <b>50</b> in the above configuration is explained. First, a program stream of input MPEG2 data is open and the data table is created in the data table creating section <b>52</b> as a preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After preparation, a VOBU of MPEG2 data is retrieved into the FF_PCK identifying section <b>51</b>, and a pointer is moved at the initial address of the retrieved VOBU. Then, the FF_PCK identifying section <b>51</b> identifies whether FF_PCK is recorded at the initial address of the VOBU. When FF_PCK is not recorded at the initial address of the VOBU, an error handling step is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When FF_PCK is recorded at the initial address of the VOBU, the NV_PCK generating section <b>53</b> generates NV_PCK according to the data table created in the data table creating section <b>52</b>. Then, the NV_PCK replacing section <b>54</b> replaces FF_PCK by NV_PCK. Since FF_PCK has the same data size as NV_PCK, and is recorded at the initial address of the VOBU where NV_PCK is to be recorded, the replacement can be carried out easily.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The conversion of the VOBU is completed when seek is operated through the last address of the VOBU with replaced NV_PCK. The image converting device <b>50</b> repeats the above-mentioned converting process until all VOBUs of input MPEG2 data are converted. Thereafter, the converting process is completed by closing the program stream. In the above-mentioned configuration, it is not necessary to demultiplex and remultiplex moving image data and sound data when converting MPEG2 data into DVD-Video Data. As a result, the data conversion can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the above embodiment, digital camera <b>2</b> is described as an example. However, the present invention can be applied to other image recording devices for recording moving image data with sound data, such as a video camera, a cellular phone, a PDA, and the like. Further, MPEG2 data can also be converted into DVD-VR (Video recording format) data or any other data as long as playback auxiliary data can be recorded at the initial address of the VOBU.</p>
