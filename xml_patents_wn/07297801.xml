<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods of producing 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivatives such as oxandrolone (i.e., 17β-hydroxy-17α-methyl-2-oxa-5α-androstan-3-one) are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,583,298 describes a process for the synthesis of 17β-hydroxy-17α-methyl-2-oxa-5α-androstane-3-one, U.S. patent application Publication No. 2003/0032817 describes a process for the synthesis of oxandrolone, and U.S. Patent No. 3,128,283 describes 17-oxygenated oxa-steroids and intermediates thereto. However, as 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivatives such as oxandrolone have various therapeutic uses, improved methods for producing 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivatives are desirable.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the present invention, a 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivative is produced by reacting a 3-one androstane derivative with ozone. The 3-one androstane derivative may be in solution, and is preferably in an aqueous solution. The ozone that is reacted with the 3-one androstane derivative is preferably present in a mixture of ozone and oxygen. In one embodiment, the reaction is conducted by bubbling a mixture of ozone and oxygen through an aqueous solution of a 3-one androstane derivative. The reaction is preferably performed in an explosion-proof vessel, although other reaction vessels could also be used to carry out the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The reaction of the 3-one androstane derivative with ozone is preferably conducted in the presence of a peroxide. The peroxide may be an organic peroxide or an inorganic peroxide. One preferred inorganic peroxide is hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the 3-one androstane derivative may be in an aqueous solution and a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) may be continuously added (e.g., by dropwise addition to the solution) such that the peroxide is present during the entire reaction period or a portion of the reaction period.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The reaction of a 3-one androstane derivative with ozone may be carried out over varying periods of time such as, for example, 1-24 hours, preferably 2-12 hours, more preferably 3-5 hours. The reaction of a 3-one androstane derivative with ozone may also be carried out in varying ranges of temperatures such as, for example, in a temperature range between about 1° C. to about 50° C., preferably in a temperature range between about 5° C. to about 40° C., more preferably in a temperature range between about 10° C. to about 30° C.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After performing the reaction, the reaction mixture containing the 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivative may be isolated and/or purified according to known procedures. For example, when the reaction is performed using an aqueous solution of a 3-one androstane derivative, an organic solvent (e.g., methylene chloride) may be used to perform an extraction. If such an extraction is performed, the reaction solution may be diluted with water if desired. In addition, the reaction vessel and/or reaction mixture may be allowed to return to room temperature (if not already at room temperature) before isolating and/or purifying the 2-oxa-3-one androstane derivative.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one aspect, the 3-one androstane derivative is mestanolone (Formula (II) below), which is reacted with ozone to produce oxandrolone (Formula (III) below) as shown by the following reaction scheme:</p>
