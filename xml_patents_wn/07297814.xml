<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A multitube reactor, wherein tubes having smaller tolerance between a nominal size and actual sizes are used as reaction tubes to stably perform a high yield reaction for a long period, a catalyst is filled into the reaction tubes so that the catalyst layer peak temperature portions of the reaction tubes are not overlapped with the connection sites thereof with baffles to effectively prevent hot spots from occurring and stably perform a reaction for a long period without the clogging of the reaction tubes, a heat medium and raw material gas are allowed to flow in the direction of a countercurrent and a specified type of catalyst is filled into the reaction tubes so that activity is increased from the inlet of the raw material gas to the outlet thereof to prevent the autooxidation of products so as to prevent equipment from being damaged due to the reaction, and, at the time of starting, gas with a temperature of 100 to 400° C. is led to the outside of the reaction tubes to increase the temperature of the reaction tubes and, a heat medium, which is solid at the room temperature, is heated to circulate to the outside of the reaction tubes to efficiently start up the reactor without affecting the activity of the catalyst.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a multitube reactor applied to a method of producing (meth)acrolein and/or (meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing propylene, propane, isobutylene, isobutanol, or t-butanol with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using the multitube reactor, and to a start up method applied to the multitube reactor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional multitube reactor is equipped with a plurality of reaction tubes having a catalyst packed therein and a plurality of baffles inside a shell for feeding and circulating inside the shell a fluid for heat removal (hereinafter, referred to as “heat medium”) introduced into the shell. A raw material gas fed inside the reaction tubes reacts in the presence of the catalyst inside the reaction tubes, to thereby generate heat of reaction. The heat of reaction is removed by a heat medium circulating inside the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When differences of inner volumes among the plurality of reaction tubes equipped inside the shell is large, amounts of the catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes are irregular and a scatter arises. As a result, a flow rate of the raw material gas fed or a retention time differs among the reaction tubes, thereby becoming a factor causing yield reduction of a target product and reduced catalyst life. Further, a localized abnormal high-temperature site (hot spot) may form in the reaction tubes provoking a reaction out of control, thereby causing a problem of inhibiting a continuous operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in a multitube reactor provided with the baffles, the heat medium does not flow at all in a portion where the baffles and the reaction tubes are fixed to each other when the baffles and the reaction tubes are fixed through welding, flanges, or the like. A reactor in which outer walls of the reaction tubes and the baffle are not fixed also exists, but the amount of the heat medium flowing through this clearance is limited. The following problems arise in a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using a fixed bed multitube heat-exchanger type reactor as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a state of poor heat removal in the reaction tubes in a portion where flow of the heat medium is insufficient inside the shell. A localized abnormal high-temperature zone (hot spot) may form in the reaction tubes which are in a state of poor heat removal, possibly resulting in a reaction out of control. Further, a reaction may not become out of control, but problems arise including ease of clogging the reaction tubes, yield reduction of the reaction product gas, deterioration of the catalyst life, and inhibition of a stable operation for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many methods of suppressing hot spot formation have been proposed for the multitube reactor used in a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction. For example, JP 08-092147 A discloses a method of providing uniform heat medium temperature by: setting a flow direction of a reactant gas guided to a reactor and that of the heat medium inside a shell in a countercurrent; allowing the heat medium to flow further upward in a meandering way using baffles; and adjusting temperature differences of the heat medium from an inlet of the reactor to an outlet thereof within 2 to 10° C. or less.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The multitube reactor generally consists of a plurality of tubes (bundle) arranged vertically, and thus a process fluid flow can be upflow or downflow by allowing a process fluid to flow from an upper portion or lower portion of the reactor. The heat medium can also be fed to the shell from the upper portion or lower portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the multitube reactor is classified into two types similar to a general shell and tube heat exchanger: a concurrent type allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in the same direction; and a countercurrent type allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the multitube reactor may be classified into the following types considering the directions of the fluids: 1) a concurrent type of downflow process fluid/downflow heat medium; 2) a concurrent type of upflow process fluid/upflow heat medium; 3) a countercurrent type of upflow process fluid/downflow heat medium; and 4) a countercurrent type of downflow process fluid/upflow heat medium.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Proposed in JP 2000-093784 A is a method of suppressing hot spot formation by: allowing a raw material gas and a heat medium to flow in downward concurrent; and preventing a gas reservoir free of the heat medium. Further, the method allows an exchange of a catalyst in a vicinity of a catalyst layer inlet alone where most easily deteriorates by: feeding the raw material gas from an upper portion of a reactor; and allowing the raw material gas to flow downward inside the catalyst layer of reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the heat medium and the process fluid move in a concurrent according to the method, and gas temperature in an outlet portion of the reactor increases. Thus, the method has a fault that high concentration of a product (meth)acrolein easily causes an autooxidation reaction (autolysis reaction).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, with respect to the upflow, in a method of allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in a concurrent, that is in the same direction, heat medium temperature increases with heat of reaction. Thus, high temperature at a process outlet causes autooxidation at the reactor outlet easily. The autooxidation reaction results in problems of a combustion reaction of the product, equipment breakdown due to temperature increase, and yield reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Proposed is a method of preventing autooxidation for a purpose of preventing temperature increase, by providing a cooling zone or heat exchanger in a downstream of a reaction portion for decreasing gas temperature. However, in a concurrent, heat medium temperature in the vicinity of the reactor outlet and process gas temperature in an outlet portion are high. Thus, an amount of heat removal becomes large and a cooling portion (cooling zone and heat exchanger) enlarges, thereby becoming disadvantageous in point of cost.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, even if a significant autooxidation reaction is not caused, an autooxidation reaction is caused by a part of a product, which arises a problem of yield reduction of a target product as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, there is a necessary to maintain the heat medium at temperature of the solidifying point or above to ensure fluidity thereof for circulating the heat medium inside the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">JP 2001-310123 A discloses a-reactor start up method for a multitube reactor having reaction tubes, an introducing port of a fluid flowing outside reaction tubes, and a discharging port thereof for removing heat generated inside the reaction tubes, the method being characterized by including: heating reaction tubes by introducing a gas having temperature of 100 to 400° C. in the reaction tubes; and circulating a heated heat medium through the outside of the reaction tubes. Further, a gas not providing an effect when being mixed with a catalyst packed in the reaction tubes or with a raw material gas (such as air) is selected as the gas introduced to the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, a large volume of a high temperature gas is introduced to the reaction tubes according to the above-mentioned method, thereby changing an oxidation state of the catalyst. Therefore, catalytic activity and selectivity may be affected, possibly resulting in yield reduction or reduced catalyst life.</p>

In addition, the above-mentioned range of the tolerance is defined in the present invention as the range which represents “substantially the same”. The actual dimensions of a reaction tube can be measured by means of a conventionally known method. The dimensions may adopt the measured value at a given position or the average value of a plurality of measured values.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An outline of the multitube reactor of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Reference numeral <b>2</b> represents a shell of the multitube reactor, and the shell <b>2</b> comprises reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>each packed with a catalyst, the reaction tubes being fixed by both a lower tube plate <b>5</b><i>b </i>and an upper tube plate <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>each have an inner diameter of about 20 to 40 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 1 to 2 mm, and a length of 3,000 to 6,000 mm. A carbon steel tube or stainless steel tube is used as a material for each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The total number of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>equipped inside the shell <b>2</b> varies depending on the amount of production of a target product but: is typically 1,000 to 30,000.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The above equilateral triangle arrangement is often used because the arrangement can increase the number of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>equipped inside the reactor per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The outside diameter tolerance and wall-thickness tolerance of each of the reaction tubes used in the present invention are far more rigorous than the tolerance of JIS or of ASTM, and such tubes that satisfy the rigorous tolerances are used.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, when propylene or isobutylene is introduced as a mixed gas with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, propylene or isobutylene is converted into (meth)acrolein at an upper portion and is oxidized to (meth)acrylic acid at a lower portion.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference numeral <b>9</b> represents an intermediate tube plate, and <b>3</b> thermal shields <b>10</b> are fixed at the bottom face of the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b> by spacer rods <b>13</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thermal shields <b>10</b> are attached to the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b> for the following reason. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the difference in controlled temperature between the heat medium Hm<b>1</b> introduced into the lower portion of the shell <b>2</b> and the heat medium Hm<b>2</b> introduced into the upper portion of the shell <b>2</b> exceeds 100° C., heat transfer from the high-temperature heat medium to the low-temperature heat medium cannot be neglected. Thus, the precision in controlling the reaction temperature of a catalyst may degrade at lower temperatures. In such a case, heat insulation is necessary to prevent heat transfer above and/or below the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Here, the types and ratios of raw material gas components and the importance of uniform packing of a catalyst will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Introduced into a multitube reactor for use in vapor phase catalytic oxidation is a mixed gas of propylene or isobutylene and/or (meth)acrolein with a molecular oxygen-containing gas or with water vapor as a raw material gas Rg for a reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The concentration of propylene or isobutylene ranges from 3 to 10 vol %. A molar ratio of oxygen to propylene or to isobutylene ranges from 1.5 to 2.5, and a molar ratio of water vapor to propylene or to isobutylene ranges from 0.8 to 2.0.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The introduced raw material gas Rg is distributed to the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>and then flows through each reaction tube to react by an oxidation catalyst packed inside each reaction tube. However, the distribution of the raw material gas Rg to each reaction tube is affected by the packing weight, packing density, and the like of a catalyst in a reaction tube. The packing weight, packing density, and the like are set at the time of packing a catalyst into a reaction tube. Therefore, it is essential to uniformly pack a catalyst into each reaction tube.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">To uniformize the weight of a catalyst packed inside each reaction tube, it is important to set a rigorous tolerance of a reaction tube into which a catalyst is packed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The raw material gas Rg flowing through each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>is initially heated to a reaction starting temperature while flowing through the inert substance layer packed at the inlet portion.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The raw material (propylene or isobutylene) is oxidized by the catalyst packed as the successive layer in the reaction tube, and the temperature of the raw material further increases by heat of reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The reaction weight in the inlet portion of the catalyst layer is most. The heat of reaction generated increases the temperature of the raw material gas Rg when the heat of reaction is greater than the quantity of heat removal by the heat medium Hm. In such a case, hot spots may be formed. The hot spots are often formed at a position 300 to 1,000 mm from the inlet of each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, the effect of the heat of reaction generated on a catalyst, the temperature of a heat medium and the allowable maximum temperature of hot spots when producing acrolein through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, the type of heat medium used, and the effect of a fluid state of the heat medium on the heat removal efficiency of the heat medium will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the heat of reaction generated exceeds the heat removal capacity of the heat medium Hm on the outer periphery of the corresponding reaction tube, the temperature of the raw material gas Rg further increases, and the heat of reaction also increases. Finally, the reaction becomes out of control. In this case, the temperature of the catalyst exceeds the allowable maximum temperature, so that the catalyst undergoes a qualitative change. This change may be a main cause for the deterionation or breakage of the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A description is given by taking as an example a former stage reactor (for instance, the portion of the reactor above the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in which acrolein is produced through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas. In this example, the temperature of the heat medium Hm is in the range of 250 to 350° C. and the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots is in the range of 400 to 500° C.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In addition, the temperature of the heat medium Hm in a latter stage reactor (for instance, the portion of the reactor below the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) in which acrolein is oxidized by a molecular oxygen-containing gas to yield acrylic acid is in the range of 200 to 300° C. and the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots is in the range of 300 to 400° C.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Niter, a mixture of nitrates, is often used as the heat medium Hm that flows inside the shell <b>2</b> surrounding the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>However, a phenyl ether heat medium of an organic liquid system may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The heat medium Hm flows to remove heat from the outer periphery of each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>However, the heat medium Hm introduced into the shell <b>2</b> through the ring-shaped tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>for heat medium introduction flows toward the central portion from the outer peripheral portion of the shell <b>2</b> at a position and reverses its flow direction at another position. Heat removal effects at the positions were found to extremely differ from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A heat transfer coefficient of the heat medium when the flow direction of the heat medium Hm is at a right angle with the axis of a reaction tube is in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 W/m<sup>2</sup>° C. When the flow direction is not at a right angle with the axis of a reaction tube, the heat transfer coefficient varies depending on the flow rate and on whether the flow is an upflow or a downflow. However, the heat transfer coefficient often falls within a narrow range of 100 to 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>° C. when niter is used as the heat medium.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, the heat transfer coefficient of a catalyst layer in each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>naturally dependents on the flow rate of the raw material gas Rg, but is about 100 W/m<sup>2</sup>° C. As a matter of course, the rate determining factor of heat transfer is a gas phase in a tube as usual.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Specifically, heat transfer resistance on the outer periphery of each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>when the flow of the heat medium Hm is at a right angle with the axis of the tube is 1/10 to 1/20 that of the gas Rg in the tube. Therefore, a change in flow rate of the heat medium Hm hardly affects the overall heat transfer resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">However, when niter flows in parallel with the axis of a tube, the heat transfer coefficient in each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>is comparable to that outside the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>Therefore, the effect of the fluid state at the outer periphery of the tube on the heat removal efficiency is large. That is, when the heat transfer resistance at the outer periphery of a tube is 100 W/m<sup>2</sup>° C., the overall heat transfer coefficient becomes half. Furthermore, half the change in heat transfer resistance at the outer periphery of the tube affects the overall heat transfer coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the flow direction of the heat medium Hm in the shell <b>2</b> is represented as an upflow by arrows. However, the present invention can also be applied to the opposite flow direction.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In determining the direction of a circulation flow of the heat medium Hm, a phenomenon of engulfing, in the heat medium flow, a gas that may be present at top ends of the shell <b>2</b> and the circulating pump <b>7</b>, in particular an inert gas such as nitrogen, must be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the case where the heat medium Hm is an upflow as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cavitation phenomenon occurs in the circulating pump <b>7</b> when a gas is engulfed at an upper portion of the circulating pump <b>7</b>. In the worst case, the pump may break.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the case where the heat medium Hm is a downflow, a gas engulfing phenomenon occurs also at an upper portion of the shell <b>2</b>. In this case, a stagnant portion of a gas phase is formed at an upper portion of the shell <b>2</b>, and an upper portion of a reaction tube corresponding to the gas stagnant portion is not cooled by the heat medium Hm.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Prevention of gas stagnation must include: providing a degas line; and replacing a gas of the gas phase with the heat medium Hm. To achieve this, the pressure of the heat medium in the heat medium feed tube <b>8</b><i>a </i>is increased and the heat medium discharging tube <b>8</b><i>b </i>is provided at the highest position as possible to increase the pressure in the shell <b>2</b>. The heat medium discharging tube <b>8</b><i>b </i>is provided at least above the upper tube plate <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The raw material gas Rg can be an upflow or a downflow in the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>However, the raw material gas Rg preferably in a countercurrent in relation to the heat medium flow.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Examples of a method of adjusting activity of a catalyst layer include: a method of adjusting catalyst compositions to use catalysts having different activities; and a method of adjusting activity by mixing catalyst particles with inert substance particles to dilute the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A catalyst layer having a small ratio of the catalyst particles is packed into an inlet portion of each of the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>A catalyst layer having a large ratio of the catalyst particles or catalyst layer not diluted is packed into a portion of the reaction tube, the portion located downstream with respect to the flow direction of the raw material gas. Although the degree of dilution varies by a catalyst, a (catalyst particles/inert substance particles) mixing ratio is preferably in the range of 7/3 to 3/7 in the former stage and in the range of 10/0 to 5/5 in the latter stage. 2 to 3 stages are typically adopted for the activity change or dilution of a catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Dilution ratios of the catalysts packed inside the reaction tubes <b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>do not need to be the same with each other. For example, the reaction tube <b>1</b><i>a </i>has a high maximum temperature so that there is a high possibility of catalyst deterioration. To prevent the deterioration, it is possible to lower the catalyst particle ratio in the former stage and to increase the catalyst particle ratio in the latter stage.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Differences in reaction conversions among the respective reaction tubes may affect the average conversion and yield of the entire reactor. Therefore, it is preferable that the dilution rate is set so that the same conversion is obtained in the respective reaction tubes even when dilution ratios are changed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The present invention is suitably applied to a multitube reactor for oxidizing propylene or isobutylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas or to a multitube reactor in which (meth)acrolein is oxidized with a molecular oxygen-containing gas to yield (meth)acrylic acid. A catalyst used in oxidation of propylene is preferably a multicomponent mixed metal oxide, mainly an Mo—Bi mixed metal oxide. A catalyst used in oxidation of acrolein to yield acrylic acid is preferably an Sb—Mo mixed oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Propylene or isobutylene is typically oxidized in 2 stages and hence different catalysts may be packed inside 2 multitube reactors to carry out a reaction.

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The disc-type baffles are particularly used often as general baffles. An opening area in the central portion of the baffle <b>6</b><i>a </i>is preferably 5 to 50%, more preferably 10 to 30% of a sectional area of the shell. The opening area between the baffle <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the shell body plate <b>2</b> is preferably 5 to 50%, more preferably 10 to 30% of a sectional area of the shell. A too small opening ratio of the baffles (<b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>) provides a long flow path of the heat medium, increasing a pressure loss between the ring-shaped tubes (<b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>) and requiring high power for the heat medium circulating pump <b>7</b>. A too large opening ratio of the baffles increases the number of the reaction tubes (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) Most of the baffles are arranged at equal spacings (spacing between baffles <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b, </i>and spacing between baffle <b>6</b><i>a </i>and each of tube plates <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>), but the baffles need not to be arranged at equal spacings. It is preferable that a required flow rate of the heat medium determined by heat of oxidation reaction generated inside the reaction tubes is ensured and a pressure loss of the heat medium remains low. Hot spot positions in a temperature distribution in the reaction tubes and the baffle positions must not be the same from the ring-shaped tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>at the inlet of the heat medium. This is because the flow rate of the heat medium decreases in the vicinity of baffle surface, providing a small heat transfer coefficient. Thus, hot spot temperature further increases when the baffle positions overlap the hot spot positions.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Studies are preferably conducted for preventing the hot spot position from being located in the same position as the baffles, through experiments with small scale devices (such as bench facility and a pilot facility) or computer simulation carried out in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The types and ratios of raw material gas components and importance of uniform packing of the catalyst are the same as those for the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention. Note that, in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method, concentration of propylene, propane, or isobutylene in the raw material gas is preferably 6 to 10 mol %.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The arrangement of the catalyst in layers inside the reaction tubes, which increases the activity from the raw material gas inlet to the cutlet, can suppress hot spot formation and heat storage of the hot spot portions. Thus, the reaction can be carried out safely and efficiently, to thereby attain improvements on productivity without reducing the catalyst life.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Various methods for changing the catalytic activity inside the reaction tubes can be applied to catalyst packing to the reaction tubes of the multitube reactor according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method. Examples thereof include: a method of using catalysts having different catalytic activities by adjusting catalyst compositions; and a method of adjusting the activities by mixing catalyst particles with inert substance particles and diluting the catalyst. To be specific, a catalyst having a high ratio of the inert substance particles and a catalyst having a low ratio of the inert substance particles are packed in the raw material gas inlet portion of the reaction tubes and the outlet portion of the reaction tubes, respectively. The ratio of the inert substance particles used differs depending on the catalyst. The ratio of the inert substance particles used in a first stage is often 0.3 to 0.7. The ratio of the inert substance particles used in a second stage is suitably 0.5 to 1.0. Two to five stages are adopted in the change of activity and the dilution of the catalyst generally.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">A dilution degree of the catalyst packed in the reaction tubes need not be the same for all the reaction tubes. For example, a portion in the vicinity of the reaction tube center within the reaction tube <b>1</b><i>b </i>has high hot spot temperature, and thus has a high possibility of catalyst deterioration. To prevent catalyst deterioration, the reaction tube in such a portion can have a smaller ratio of the inert substance in the first stage compared to those of the reaction tubes in other portions, and on the other hand, can have a larger ratio of the catalyst in the second stage compared to those of the reaction tubes in other portions. Different reaction conversions of the respective reaction tubes affect the average conversion or yield of the entire reactor. Thus, even when the dilution degree is changed, it is preferable to set the respective reaction tubes to obtain the same conversions.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The type and shape of the inert substance used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction method are the same as those for the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The raw material gas flowing through the reaction tubes is heated while first flowing through catalyst layers packed in the raw material gas inlet portions of the reaction tubes and having a low catalytic activity, and reaches a reaction starting temperature. The raw material (propylene or isobutylene) is oxidized through an oxidation reaction by a catalyst included in succeeding layers in the reaction tubes, and is heated to higher temperature by the heat of oxidation reaction. The reaction weight is most in the catalyst layers in the vicinity of the raw material gas inlet. The heat of reaction generated increases the temperature of the raw material gas when the heat of reaction is greater than the heat removal by the heat medium generally, thereby forming the hot spots. The hot spots, though depending on catalytic activity adjustment, often form at positions from the raw material gas inlet of the reaction tubes to 10 to 80% of the entire length of the reaction tubes. For example, the hot spot form at positions 0.3 to 3.2 m from the raw material gas inlet of the reaction tubes that are 3 to 4 m long.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The effect of the generated heat of reaction on the catalyst, the heat medium temperature in acrolein production through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots, the type of the heat medium used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction, and the effect of a fluid state of the heat medium on heat removal efficiency are the same as those of the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Inner diameters of the reaction tubes significantly affecting a gas linear velocity are very important because: inside of the reaction tubes containing an oxidation catalyst inside the oxidation reactor is in a vapor phase; the gas linear velocity is limited by resistance of the catalyst; and the heat transfer coefficient inside the reaction tubes are very small, the heat transfer becoming rate determining.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The inner diameters of the reaction tubes of the multitube reactor according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction method depend on the amount of the heat of reaction and a particle size of the catalyst inside the reaction tubes, but the inner diameter is preferably 10 to 50 mm, more preferably 20 to 30 mm. Too small inner diameters-of the reaction tubes decrease the amount of the catalyst packed and increase the number of reaction tubes with respect to the necessary amount of the catalyst, thereby requiring a large reactor. On the other hand, too large inner diameters of the reaction tubes provide a small reaction tube surface area with respect to the necessary amount of the catalyst, thereby reducing a heat transfer area for removal of the heat of reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is suitably applied to: a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction for obtaining (meth)acrolein by oxidizing propylene, propane, or isobutylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas; and a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction for obtaining (meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing (meth)acrolein with a molecular oxygen-containing gas. A Mo—Bi multi-component mixed metal oxide is used as the catalyst for the oxidation of propylene, propane, and isobutylene, and a Sb—Mo multi-component mixed metal oxide is used as the catalyst for the oxidation of acrolein to produce acrylic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Note that, the Mo—Bi catalyst preferably used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is the same as that represented by the general formula (I) in the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention. Note that, the Mo—Bi catalyst used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferably produced through methods disclosed in JP 06-013096 B and the like, for example. Further, the Sb—Mo catalyst is preferably produced through methods disclosed in JP 06-38918 B and the like, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The Mo—Bi catalyst is produced following general production methods except that a mixed carbonate salt of a C component and Bi is prepared in advance as a Bi source compound, for example. The preparation of the mixed carbonate salt of a C component and B in advance involves, for example: mixing predetermined amounts of respective aqueous nitrate solutions of Bi and the C component; adding the nitrate solutions dropwise to an aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate while mixing the whole; and washing the obtained precipitate and drying the precipitate if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The production of the Mo—Bi catalyst generally includes an integration step of performing integration of source compounds of the respective elements in an aqueous system and a heating step. Here, the term “integration of source compounds of the respective elements in an aqueous system” means temporarily or gradually integrating aqueous solutions or aqueous dispersions of the respective compounds. Here, the term “source compounds of the respective elements” does not mean compounds of the respective elements alone, but includes compounds collectively containing multiple elements (such as ammonium phosphomolybdate for Mo and P). Further, the term “integration” does not mean integration of the source compounds of the respective elements alone, but also includes integration with support materials such as alumina, silica-alumina, and refractory oxides, which may be used if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">On the other hand, “heating” is carried out for the purposes including: formation of separate oxides and/or mixed oxides of the source compounds of the respective elements; and/or formation of oxides and/or mixed compounds of the mixed oxides obtained through integration; and/or heat treatment of the final mixed oxide products. Further, the heating need not be applied to primarily integration products of the source compounds of the respective elements, and the heating is not necessarily limited to once.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Thus, in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method, the term “heating” includes heating the source compounds of the respective elements separately and gradually forming the oxides (and may include forming mixed oxides). Further, the term “including an integration step and a heating step” means that steps of drying, pulverization, molding, and the like may be included in addition to the two steps.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method, the Bi source compound is bismuth subcarbonate which is water-insoluble and containing Mg, Ca, Zn, Ce, and/or Sm. The compound is preferably used in a powder form. The compounds as raw materials for catalyst production may consist of particles larger than the powder but preferably consist of small particles, considering the heating step for thermal diffusion. Thus, if the compounds as raw materials do not consist of small particles, the compounds are preferably pulverized before the heating step.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">A specific example of the catalyst production method according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is as follows. Aqueous solutions of compounds of iron, cobalt, and nickel, preferably nitrates of the respective elements are added to a suitable aqueous solution of a molybdenum compound, preferably ammonium molybdate. Further, aqueous solutions of compounds of sodium, potassium, rubidium, thallium, boron, phosphorus, arsenic, and/or tungsten, preferably water-soluble salts of the respective elements are added to the mixture. Further, particulate or colloidal silica is added to the mixture if necessary. Next, bismuth subcarbonate powder containing a C component prepared in advance is added to the mixture. Bismuth subcarbonate containing a C component in advance is prepared as described above by: mixing bismuth and aqueous solutions such as Mg, Ca, Zn, Ce, and/or Sm, preferably aqueous solutions of nitrates of the respective elements; adding the aqueous solutions dropwise to an aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate while mixing the whole; and washing the obtained slurry with water and the drying the slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Next, the obtained slurry is sufficiently agitated, and then dried. The dried granule or cake product is subjected to heat treatment in air at 250 to 350° C. for a short period of time. Here, the obtained heat-treated product already contains salts of iron, cobalt, and nickel with acidic oxides, but contains bismuth subcarbonate mostly remained in a form of the raw material. This fact indicates that bismuth subcarbonate may be added at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The obtained decomposed product is shaped into an arbitrary shape through methods such as extrusion molding, tablet compression, and support molding. The shaped product is then subjected to final heat treatment preferably at 450 to 650° C. for about 1 to 16 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Further, the Sb—Mo catalyst preferably used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is the same as that represented by the general formula (II) in the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention. The Sb—Mo catalyst used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferably produced using a mixed oxide represented by Sb—X—Si—O as a Sb source compound heated at 600 to 900° C.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Such a mixed oxide can be obtained by using: metal Sb, antimony oxide, or the like as an Sb source; nitrates, halides, or the like of the X elements as a raw material for an X component; and colloidal silica, particulate silica, or the like as an Si source; and subjecting a solid to heat treatment in the presence of molecular oxygen (such as air) at 600 to 900° C., preferably 650 to 850° C., the solid being obtained by, for example: adding the Sb source or Si source to an aqueous solution of an X component raw material; and evaporating the mixture to dryness under stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Atomic ratios of the respective elements of the mixed oxide represented by Sbw-Xx-Siy-Oz is 1≦w≦40 (preferably 1≦w≦20), 1≦x≦20 (preferably 1≦x≦10), and 1≦y≦10 (preferably 1≦y≦5). Note that, z is a value determined from an oxidation degree of the respective elements.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The Sb—Mo catalyst can be produced general production methods of a mixed oxide catalyst except that such a Sb mixed oxide is used.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The above-mentioned mixed oxide preferably accounts for at least 25%, preferably 50 to 100% of a final catalyst of the Sb—Mo catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">A specific example of catalyst production involves wet mixing the thus-obtained Sb—X—Si—O mixed oxide powder with: multiple acids of Mo, V, or Nb (such as molybdic acid or phosphomolybdic acid) or salts thereof (such as ammonium salt); hydroxides or salts of those metals; and Y components (such as copper compound and tungsten compound). The production method further involves concentrating and drying the mixture, and then pulverizing the dried mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The method for molding the catalyst, form, and shape of the catalyst used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method are the same as those for the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Note that, the catalyst packed at the raw material gas inlet of the reaction tubes may have the same composition and form as, or may have different compositions and forms from, the catalyst packed at the outlet of the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method can be applied to any one of cases which performs a reaction employing two multitube reactors packed with different catalysts; and a reaction employing one reactor having a shell divided into two or more chambers by intermediate tube plates and having the respective chambers packed with different catalysts for obtaining (meth)acrylic acid at once, because (meth)acrylic acid production involves two-stage oxidation of propylene or isobutylene.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a multitube reactor having a shell divided by the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b>, and the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method can be also applied to a method employing the reactor. Different heat mediums circulate in the respective divided spaces, and the spaces are controlled to different temperatures. A raw material gas may be introduced from either the port <b>4</b><i>a </i>or <b>4</b><i>b</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a flow direction of the heat medium inside the shell is indicated by arrows as an upflow, and thus, reference numeral <b>4</b><i>a </i>represents the raw material feed port in which the raw material gas process gas flows in a countercurrent to the heat medium.

First, the mixed gas is converted to (meth)acrolein in a first stage (reaction tubes in area A) for a former stage reaction, and the (meth)acrolein is then oxidized in a second stage (reaction tubes in area B) for a latter stage reaction, to thereby produce (meth)acrylic acid. A first stage portion of the reaction tubes (hereinafter, may also be referred to as “former stage portion”) and a second stage portion of the reaction tubes (hereinafter, may also be referred to as “latter stage portion”) are packed with different catalysts and are controlled to different temperatures for a reaction under optimum conditions. The inert substance not involved in the reaction is preferably packed in a portion where the intermediate tube plate exists between the former stage portion and the latter stage portion of the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged view of the intermediate tube plate and the vicinity thereof. The former stage portion and the latter stage portion are controlled to different temperatures. However, precision of reaction temperature at lower temperatures tends to degrade when the temperature difference exceeds 100° C. because heat transfer from a high-temperature heat medium to a low-temperature heat medium cannot be neglected. In such a case, heat insulation is required above or below the intermediate tube plate for preventing the heat transfer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a case employing a heat insulation board, and two to three thermal shields <b>10</b> are provided at positions of about 10 cm below or above the intermediate tube plate to form a flowless stagnant space <b>12</b> filled with the heat medium. It is preferable to produce a heat insulation effect thereby. Thermal shields <b>10</b> are fixed to the intermediate tube plate <b>9</b> by, for example, spacer rods <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The flow direction of the heat medium inside the shell is indicated by arrows as an upflow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, but the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method can also be applied to reactors having opposite directions of the heat medium. A direction of circulation flow of the heat medium must be set to prevent a phenomenon of engulfing, in the heat medium, a gas, specifically, an inert gas such as nitrogen existing on upper ends of the shell <b>2</b> and the circulating pump <b>7</b>. The gas may be engulfed in an upflow heat medium in an upper portion inside the circulating pump <b>7</b> and a cavitation phenomenon may be caused inside the circulating pump, possibly resulting in a worst case of pump breakdown. The gas may also be engulfed in a downflow heat medium in an upper portion of the shell and a stagnant portion of a gas phase may form in an upper portion of the shell, thereby preventing cooling of the upper portion of the reaction tubes provided in the stagnant portion by the heat medium.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Prevention of gas stagnation requires of a degas line and replacing a gas in a gas phase with the heat medium.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&lt;Start Up Method of the Present Invention&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">A gist of a start up method of the present invention is as follows. In a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, and having reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes, the start up method is characterized by comprising: introducing a gas at a temperature in the range of 100 to 400° C. to the outside of the reaction tube to heat; and circulating the heat medium heated outside the reaction tube.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Hereinafter, the start up method of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a process explanatory diagram showing an example of a preferable mode according to the start up method of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The start up method of the present invention is a start up method for a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature and having reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">First, the shell-tube type reactor used in the start up method of the present invention is described. Any one of the conventionally known reactors may be employed as the shell-tube type reactor as long as the reactor employed has reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes. Above all, a multitube reactor is preferable because the reactor provides a high reaction efficiency per a volume of the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">A multitube reactor that can be used in the start up method of the present invention generally has the following structure. That is, tube plates are arranged on the top and bottom in the shell and a plurality of reaction tubes are equipped inside the shell with both ends of each reaction tube supported and fixed by the tube plates. Furthermore, an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes of the shell are provided for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes. In the start up method of the present invention, shields may also be equipped for dividing the inside of the shell into multiple chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Next, a description is given of a heat medium used as a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes in the start up method of the present invention. The solidifying point of the heat medium is typically in the range of 50 to 250° C., preferably in the range of 130 to 180° C. Representative examples of such a heat medium include niter. Niter is particularly preferable because niter is excellent in thermal stability among the heat media used for controlling temperature in a chemical reaction and, in particular, has the most excellent stability to heat exchange at high temperatures ranging from 350 to 550° C.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Niter is the so-called molten salt and may adopt various compositions. Therefore, the solidifying point of niter varies depending on the compositions. However, niter of any composition can be suitably used in the start up method of the present invention as long as the niter has a solidifying point in the above range. Examples of a compound used as such niter include sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, and potassium nitrate. Each of those compounds can be used alone or 2 or more types of them can be mixed before use.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Next, the characteristics of the start up method of the present invention will be described. In the start up method of the present invention, a gas at a temperature in the range of 100 to 400° C. is introduced to the outside of the reaction tubes to previously heat the inside of the reactor to a temperature equal to or higher than the solidifying point of the heat medium. That is, in the method described in the above-mentioned unexamined publication, a gas for heating a reactor is introduced into reaction tubes packed with a catalyst whereas, in the start up method of the present invention, the gas is introduced to the outside of the reaction tubes. This is a characteristic of the start up method of the present invention. A start up method for a reactor according to the start up method of the present invention does not adversely affect the catalyst. Preferable examples of the gas for heating a reactor include air.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Next, the above-mentioned heating method in the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> will be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a reactor represented by reference numeral (<b>50</b>) has a first chamber and a second chamber. In the example shown in the figure, a process gas is fed as a downflow while a heat medium is fed in an upflow. Lines (L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, L<b>3</b>, and L<b>4</b>) constitute a process line, and lines (L<b>6</b>, L<b>7</b>, L<b>8</b>, L<b>9</b>, L<b>10</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>) constitute a heat medium line. Lines (L<b>15</b> and L<b>16</b>) constitute a discharge line used during heating. In the figure, symbols ◯●- and ●◯- each represent a spectacle blind (SB), so-called partition. An SB is inserted into tubing to open and close a flow path. The former symbol represents an opened state, and the latter symbol represents a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">First, an SB (<b>61</b>) is inserted into the line (L<b>3</b>) (that is, the flow path is closed) to close the feed line, used in ordinary operation, to the reaction tube (catalyst layer) of the reactor (<b>50</b>). Then, an SB (<b>62</b>) and an SB (<b>63</b>) are detached from the line (L<b>5</b>) (that is, the flow path is opened) to establish a line by the shell of the reactor (<b>50</b>) consisting of line (L<b>1</b>)→blower (<b>10</b>)→line (L<b>2</b>)→line (L<b>5</b>)→line (L<b>6</b>)→heater (<b>21</b>)→line (L<b>7</b>) and line (L<b>8</b>)→tank (<b>30</b>)→line (L<b>9</b>). At this time, a valve (<b>71</b>) of the line (L<b>5</b>) is closed. Furthermore, an SB (<b>64</b>) of the line (L<b>15</b>) and a valve (<b>72</b>) of the line (L<b>6</b>) are opened to discharge the introduced gas.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Subsequently, the blower (<b>10</b>) is started, and the gas heated to a temperature in the range of 100 to 400° C. is introduced to the outside of the reaction tube of the reactor (<b>50</b>) by using the heater (<b>21</b>). The gas heats the reactor (<b>50</b>). The temperature inside the reactor (<b>50</b>) is preferably equal to or higher than the solidifying point of the heat medium subsequently circulated, and the temperature can be appropriately selected depending on the heat medium used. In general, it is sufficient to heat the shell of the reactor (<b>50</b>) to a temperature in the range of 150 to 250° C. This is because a temperature of the shell within the above range prevents resolidification of the heat medium even if the heat medium is fed after heating the shell since the heat medium has a solidifying point in the range of 50 to 250° C. At this time, it is preferable to keep the reaction tube (catalyst side) in an air atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Subsequently, the blower (<b>10</b>) is stopped. The SB (<b>62</b>) of the line (L<b>5</b>) and the SB (<b>63</b>) of the line (L<b>15</b>) are closed. The valve (<b>72</b>) of the line (L<b>16</b>) is opened. Pumps (<b>41</b> and <b>42</b>) are started to introduce a heat medium into each of the first chamber (<b>51</b>) and second chamber (<b>52</b>) of the reactor (<b>50</b>) Then, the heat medium is circulated in each chamber by using an attached pump (<b>43</b>) to increase the temperature inside each chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Each operation described above is preferably performed quickly, preferably within 1 hour. Too slow operation may cause resolidification of a heat medium when introducing the heat medium because the temperature of the shell decreases due to radiation of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">When heat exchange is performed by using a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, the total amount of the heat medium is often recovered in the tank (<b>30</b>) after the use of the reactor (<b>50</b>). In such a case, the heat medium does not remain in the reactor (<b>50</b>) and is stored in the tank (<b>30</b>). Therefore, the heat medium in the tank (<b>30</b>) is heated by heaters (<b>22</b> and <b>23</b>) to an extent that the fluidity of the heat medium is ensured, and the heat medium is then introduced into the reactor (<b>50</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The heat medium is introduced into the reactor (<b>50</b>) through 2 routes as described below. That is, the heat medium is fed to the first chamber (<b>51</b>) by the heat medium pump (<b>41</b>) of the tank (<b>30</b>) via the lines (L<b>13</b>, L<b>14</b>, L<b>6</b>, and L<b>7</b>). In addition, the heat medium is fed to the second chamber (<b>52</b>) by the heat medium pump (<b>42</b>) of the tank (<b>30</b>) through the lines (L<b>12</b> and L<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Then, the heat medium introduced into the reactor (<b>50</b>) is circulated inside each chamber by the attached pump (<b>43</b>). This is because the temperature inside the reactor (<b>50</b>) may not be increased to a target temperature only by introducing and circulating the heat medium heated in advance. In view of this, the heat medium is circulated, heated by the heater (<b>21</b>), and then introduced into the reactor (<b>50</b>) again. For example, the heat medium is discharged from the first chamber (<b>51</b>) and the line (L<b>8</b>) and is introduced into the reactor (<b>50</b>) by the pump (<b>41</b>) through the line (L<b>7</b>) via the heater (<b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In the case where the required temperature of the reactor (<b>50</b>) can be ensured through circulation of the heat-medium as described above, the production of a target product can be started by feeding a raw material gas to reaction tubes (catalyst side).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">A start up method for a reactor according to the start up method of the present invention is particularly preferable as a start up method for a reactor used in the production of, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrolein, or methacrolein. This is because of the following reason. That is, acrylic acid or the like is a compound produced and used in a large amount, and a reactor becomes large in response to this. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to heat the reactor. The start up method of the present invention is particularly suitable for heating during start up of a large-scale reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Acrylic acid is produced by: feeding propylene, propane, acrolein, or the like as a raw material gas to a conventionally known reactor packed with an oxidation catalyst; and allowing to react through a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction. In general, a raw material gas is allowed to coexist with given amounts of a molecular oxygen-containing gas and an inert gas and then a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction is carried out. For instance, when propylene is used as a raw material gas, acrolein is produced first. Then, acrolein is oxidized through vapor phase catalytic oxidation to yield acrylic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Conventionally known oxidation catalysts can be used as former stage and latter stage catalysts in the 2-stage vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction described above. Furthermore, a shape of the catalyst is not particularly limited and may be spherical, columnar, cylindrical, and the like. Furthermore, the catalyst may be diluted with a solid inert material when the catalyst is packed. Examples of such a solid inert material include α-alumina, alundum, mullite, carborundum, stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and ceramics.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In the present invention, it is possible to realize a more suitable vapor phase catalytic oxidation in the production of (meth) acrolein and/or (meth) acrylic acid by applying the above-mentioned first and second vapor phase catalytic oxidation methods and of the start up method of the present invention to the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">That is, the vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using a multitube reactor of the present invention further comprising baffles connecting to the reaction tubes through connecting sites for changing a flow path of a heat medium introduced into the shell; circulating the heat medium through the outside of the of the reaction tubes; and feeding a raw material gas into the reaction tubes packed with a catalyst, to thereby obtain a reaction product gas, the vapor phase catalytic oxidation method comprising, determining catalyst packing specifications in the reaction tubes so that catalyst layer peak temperature sites of the reaction tubes are not located at the connecting sites between the baffles and the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Such a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferable for improving life of the catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes, preventing an yield of a target compound decreasing, preventing hot spot formation effectively, and performing a stable operation over a long period of time, without clogging the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Further, in the present invention, the above-mentioned second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method can also be applied to such a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method. That is, propylene, propane, or isobutylene, and/or (meth)acrolein is oxidized through vapor phase catalytic oxidation with a molecular oxygen-containing gas by packing a Mo—Bi catalyst and/or a Sb—Mo catalyst to the reaction tube in such a manner that activity increases from the process gas inlet to process gas outlet of the reaction tube; and allowing a heat medium and a process gas to flow in a countercurrent.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Such a method for vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferable for improving life of the catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes, preventing an yield of a target product decreasing, preventing hot spot formation effectively, and performing a stable operation over a long period of time, without clogging the reaction tubes, and reducing the temperature of the process gas at the product discharging port of the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Further, in the present invention, the above-mentioned start up method of the present invention can also be applied to such a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method. That is, in a method comprising at least one of those vapor phase catalytic oxidation methods, the multitube reactor is stared up by: introducing a gas at a temperature in the range of 100 to 400° C. to the outside of the reaction tubes to heat; and circulating a heated heat medium which is solid at normal temperature through the outside of the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Such a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferable for starting up a reactor efficiently without affecting the activity of a catalyst adversely.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Although each of the reactor of the present invention and the reactor used in the vapor phase catalytic oxidation method of the present invention is limited to a multitube reactor equipped with a plurality of reaction tubes inside a single shell, the limitations are based on an industrial usage form. The present invention can also be applied to a single tube reactor and the single tube reactor also takes the same effect as those of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Hereinafter, the present invention will be further described in detail by examples, but the present invention is not limited by the examples so long as not departing from the gist of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">For an oxidation reaction of propylene, catalyst powder having a composition (atomic ratio) of Mo(12)Bi(5)Ni(3)Co(2)Fe(0.4)Na(0.2)B(0.4)K(0.1)Si(24)O(x) was produced (oxygen composition x is a value determined from oxidation states of the respective metals) as a former stage catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The catalyst powder was molded in to ring-shaped catalysts having an outer diameter of 5 mmφ, an inner diameter of 2 mmφ, and a height of 4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Two stainless steel tubes both having a length of 3,500 mm, and respectively having an outside diameter of 30.57 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 1.80 mm, and an outside diameter of 30.23 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 2.10 mm were used as reaction tubes (nominal outside diameter of 30.40 mmΦ and nominal wall-thickness of 1.80 mm). Note that, an outside diameter tolerance and a wall-thickness tolerance of the tubes are ±0.17 mm (±0.56%) and +0.30 mm, −0 mm (+16.7%, −0%), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Further, a reactor used had a shell inner diameter of 100 mmΦ.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">A nitrates-mixed molten salt niter was used as a heat medium Hm, and the heat medium was fed from a side of bottom of the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Temperature of the niter fed to the shell was defined as reaction temperature. Further, a flow rate of the niter was adjusted so that a temperature difference between an outlet and inlet of the shell was 4° C.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Each of the reaction tubes was packed with 3,000 mm of the catalyst, and a raw material gas (Rg) containing 9 vol % propylene was fed from an upper portion of the shell at a gauge pressure of 75 kFa.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Temperature distributions in the reaction tubes were measured by inserting thereinto thermometers each having 10 points of measurement in an axial direction of the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">A reaction was conducted for 1 week at a heat medium Hm temperature of 330° C. A propylene conversion and an yield were 97.5% and 91.0%, respectively, and the highest temperature of reaction catalyst layers was 392° C.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The reaction was continued for 1 month maintaining the heat medium Hm temperature at 330° C. The propylene conversion and the yield were 97.0% and 90.5%, respectively, and the highest temperature of the reaction catalyst layers was 386° C.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Two stainless steel tubes both having a length of 3,500 mm, and respectively having an outside diameter of 30.58 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 1.80 mm, and an outside diameter of 30.22 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 2.14 mm were used as the reaction tubes (nominal outside diameter of 30.40 mmΦ and nominal wall-thickness of 1.80 mm). Note that, the outside diameter tolerance and the wall-thickness tolerance of the tubes are ±0.18 mm (±0.59%) and +0.34 mm, −0 mm (+18.9%, −0%), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The reaction was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1 except for the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The reaction was conducted for 1 week at a heat medium Hm temperature of 330° C. The propylene conversion and the yield were 97.2% and 90.0%, respectively, and the highest temperature of the reaction catalyst layers was 394° C.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The reaction was continued for 1 month maintaining the heat medium Hm temperature at 330° C. The propylene conversion and the yield were 96.8% and 89.7%, respectively, and the highest temperature of the reaction catalyst layers was 389° C.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Two stainless steel tubes both having a length of 3,500 mm, and respectively having an outside diameter of 30.65 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 1.80 mm, and an outside diameter of 30.15 mmΦ, a wall-thickness of 2.16 mm were used as the reaction tubes (nominal outside diameter of 30.40 mmΦ and nominal wall-thickness of 1.80 mm). Note that, the outside diameter tolerance and the wall-thickness tolerance of the tubes are ±0.25 mm (±0.82%) and +0.36 mm, −0 mm (+20%, −0%), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The reaction was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1 except for the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The reaction was conducted for <b>1</b> week at a heat medium Hm temperature of 330° C. The propylene conversion and the yield were 97.4% and 89.9%, respectively, and the highest temperature of the reaction catalyst layers was 429° C.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The reaction was continued for 1 month maintaining the heat medium Hm temperature at 330° C. The propylene conversion and the yield were 94.0% and 88.0%, respectively, and the highest temperature of the reaction catalyst layers was 422° C.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As described above, improvement on life of the catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes and prevention of yield reduction of the target product could be realized by using the reaction tubes having an outside diameter tolerance of ±0.62% and a thickness tolerance of +19% to −0%.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">A fixed bed multitube heat-exchanger type reactor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> which has 20,000 stainless steel reaction tubes having an inner diameter of 27 mm and a length of 5 m and double segment-type baffles for changing a flow path of the heat medium in the shell was used. Multi-point thermocouples were provided to allow measurement of catalyst layer temperature in the reaction tubes. Niter was used as the heat medium.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The reaction tube provided in position A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> was packed with alumina balls to a height of 1.7 m, a mixture containing 70% of an Mo—Bi—Fe catalyst prepared following a conventional procedure and 30% of alumina balls in volume ratio to a height of 3 m thereon, and alumina balls to a height of 0.3 m thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">A mixed gas consisting of 9 mol % of propylene, 71 mol % of air, 10 mol % of steam, nitrogen, and the like was fed in downflow under conditions of a contact time of 3 seconds. A temperature of the heat medium is 32° C. at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The catalyst layer peak temperature site at this time was this side of a baffle (first baffle, that is, baffle higher in position of the baffles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and the catalyst layer peak temperature was 400° C. Pressure loss increases of the reaction tube after 1-year operation and 2-year operation were 0.1 kPa and 0.15 kPa, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Here, the term “pressure loss increase” refers to a phenomenon of pressure increase inside the reaction tubes caused by a carbonization of reaction raw materials due to too high temperature to clog the reaction tubes. The pressure loss is determined by: feeding air or nitrogen of the same volume as the volume of gas fed during the reaction to the respective reaction tubes; and measuring the pressure of the reaction tube inlet.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The reaction tube provided in position B (next to A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> was packed with alumina balls to a height of 1.5 m, a mixture containing 70% of the same catalyst as in Example 4 and 30% of alumina balls in volume ratio to a height of 3 m thereon, and alumina balls to a height of 0.5 m thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The catalyst layer peak temperature site at this time was at a connecting site of the first baffle and the reaction tube, and the catalyst layer peak temperature was 415° C. The pressure loss increase of the reaction tube after 1-year operation was 0.5 kPa. The reaction tube was completely clogged after 2-year-operation, and the pressure loss increase could not be measured. As described above, the catalyst layer peak temperature site located at the connecting site causes excessive reaction and clogging of the reaction tube because removal of heat of reaction is insufficient, which is also apparent from high catalyst layer peak temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">As is clear from Examples 4 and 5, the present invention can provide a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method capable of effectively preventing hot spot formation and performing a stable operation over a long period of time and with long catalyst life, without clogging the reaction tubes by determining catalyst packing specifications in the reaction tubes so that the catalyst layer peak temperature sites inside the reaction tubes are not located at connecting sites between the baffles and the reaction tubes.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">EXAMPLE 6</heading>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">94 parts by weight of antimony paramolybdate was dissolved in 400 parts by weight of pure water by heating. Then, 7.2 parts by weight of ferric nitrate, 25 parts by weight of cobalt nitrate, and 38 parts by weight of nickel nitrate were dissolved in 60 parts by weight of pure water by heating. The two solutions were mixed with sufficient stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Next, a solution prepared by dissolving 0.85 parts by weight of borax and 0.36 parts by weight of potassium nitrate in 40 parts by weight of pure water under heating was added to the slurry. Then, 64 parts by weight of particulate silica was added to the slurry, and the whole was mixed. Next, 58 parts by weight of bismuth subcarbonate mixed with 0.8 wt % Mg in advance was added to the mixture, and the whole was mixed under stirring. The slurry was subjected to drying by heating, and then to heat treatment in air at 300° C. for 1 hour. The obtained particulate solid was molded into tablets having a diameter of 5 mm and a height of 4 mm through tablet compression using a molding machine. The tablets were then baked at 500° C. for 4 hours, to thereby obtain a former stage catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The obtained catalyst was Mo—Bi mixed oxide having a composition ratio of catalyst powder of a composition of Mo(12)Bi(5)Ni(3)Co(2)Fe(0.4)Na(0.2)Mg(0.4)B(0.2)K(0.1)Si(24)O(x) (oxygen composition x is a value determined from oxidation states of the respective metals).</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The multitube reactor used in this example was the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To be specific, the multitube reactor which has a shell (inner diameter of 4,500 mm) having 10,000 stainless steel reaction tubes having a length of 3.5 m and an inner diameter of 27 mm is used. The reaction tubes were not provided in a circular opening region at a center of the perforated disc-type baffle <b>6</b><i>a </i>having an opening portion in the vicinity of a central portion of the shell.

<p id="p-0301" num="0300">A nitrates-mixed molten salt (niter) was used as a heat medium, and the heat medium was fed from a lower portion of the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">The catalysts packed in the reaction tubes were prepared by mixing the former stage catalyst and silica balls having a diameter of 5 mm and no catalytic activity, to thereby adjust the catalytic activity. The reaction tubes were packed with the catalysts so that the ratio of catalytic activity was 0.5, 0.7, and 1 from the reaction tube inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The raw material gas was fed from an upper portion of the reactor, forming a countercurrent with the heat medium. A raw material gas consisting of 9 mol % of propylene, 15.1 mol % of molecular oxygen, 9 mol % of water, and 66.9 mol % of nitrogen was fed at a gauge pressure of 75 kPa (kilopascal). The temperature distributions in the reaction tubes were measured by inserting into the reaction tubes thermometers each having 10 points of measurement in an axial direction of the reaction tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">The reaction was conducted for 1 week at a heat medium temperature of 330° C. The propylene conversion was 97% and a total yield of acrolein and acrylic acid was 92%. The temperature of the niter fed was defined as the reaction temperature. The temperature difference of the niter between the inlet and outlet of the reactor was 4° C.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The propylene conversion and the yield were 96.8% and 91.9% respectively, after continuing the reaction for 1 month maintaining the heat medium temperature at 330° C.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">The gas temperature at the reactor outlet was constant at about 330° C. during operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">EXAMPLE 7</heading>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">The reaction tubes were packed with catalysts in the same manner as in Example 6 using the catalysts used in Example 6.</p>
