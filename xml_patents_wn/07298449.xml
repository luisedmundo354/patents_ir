<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a structure of a liquid crystal panel to be mounted in a liquid crystal display apparatus, and a method for manufacturing the liquid crystal display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A liquid crystal display apparatus is known as an In-plane-switching liquid crystal display apparatus in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-186023, for example. In this liquid crystal display apparatus, on the inner side face (i.e., the face on the side of a liquid crystal layer) of one of two opposite substrates with a liquid crystal layer between them, there are formed post spacers for retaining a cell gap from the other substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the liquid crystal display apparatus disclosed in the publication of the related art, however, when the liquid crystal layer between the two substrates expands with the heat coming from a back light, a variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer may occur to cause the mura defect.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, the invention helps provide a liquid crystal display apparatus which can suppress the mura defect.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid crystal display apparatus comprising: a first substrate including a first film formed; a second substrate confronting the first substrate and including a second film having first protrusions formed on a face facing the first substrate to contact with the first film; a frame-shaped sealant interposed between the first and second substrates and along the edges of the first and second substrates; and a liquid crystal layer enclosed by the frame-shaped sealant and formed in regions between the first and second films. The sealant fixes the first and second substrates such that the first substrate bulges toward the liquid crystal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the invention, it is possible to suppress the mura defect effectively during the operation of the liquid crystal display apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">First of all, a liquid crystal display apparatus according to the embodiment will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The image display apparatus according to the embodiment is provided with a liquid crystal panel LCD, which displays an image, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this liquid crystal panel LCD includes: a pair of opposite transparent substrates (of glass, plastics or the like) <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>; a sealant <b>30</b> which fixes the frame-shaped edge region in the inner face (i.e., the face on the side of the substrate <b>20</b>) <b>10</b>A of the transparent substrate <b>10</b> on the inner face (i.e., the face on the side of the substrate <b>10</b>) of the other transparent substrate <b>20</b>; drivers (or terminals, to which signals from a driver chip are inputted) <b>50</b> formed in the edge regions along two sides of the inner face of one transparent substrate <b>20</b>; and a liquid crystal <b>40</b> which is sealed between the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the sealant <b>30</b>, there are fitted fibers (e.g., glass fibers) <b>31</b> of a suitable diameter, which extend along the sealant <b>30</b> so as to control the spacing between the inner faces <b>10</b>A and <b>20</b>A of the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At least one of the paired transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is fixed on the sealant <b>30</b> so that it stay a state in which it has been bended convexly to the liquid crystal <b>40</b> by the pressure applied at a substrate assembling step. Specifically, the sealant <b>30</b> existing on at least one of the four sides of the liquid crystal panel constrains the edge portions of the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> so that the spacing between the inner sides <b>10</b>A and <b>20</b>A of the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may become gradually narrower from the edges of the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> toward a interface <b>30</b>A between the sealant <b>30</b> and the liquid crystal layer <b>40</b> (i.e., so that the spacing may satisfy the following Relation (1)):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>h3a&lt;h3b  (1).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Here, h<b>3</b><i>b </i>designates the spacing between the inner faces <b>10</b>A and <b>20</b>A at the edge position of the transparent substrates, and h<b>3</b><i>a </i>designates the spacing between the inner faces <b>10</b>A and <b>20</b>A of the transparent substrates at a position closer to the interface <b>30</b>A between the sealant <b>30</b> and the liquid crystal layer <b>40</b> than the edge position of the transparent substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one transparent substrate <b>10</b> of the two transparent substrates is provided on its inner face <b>10</b>A with a multi-layered film <b>11</b> including a color film, and the other transparent substrate <b>20</b> is provided on its inner face <b>20</b>A with a multi-layered film <b>21</b> containing the TFTs. Here, the structures of the multi-layered films <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The multi-layered film <b>21</b> of one transparent substrate <b>20</b> is provided with a plurality of protrusions <b>21</b>A which function as a spacer for restricting the deformations of the transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> toward the liquid crystal <b>40</b>, in image display regions A (i.e., the regions in which pixel regions <b>54</b> enclosed by drain lines <b>51</b> and gate lines <b>52</b> and passed by common electrode signal lines <b>53</b> and a color filter exist in a matrix shape so that the image is displayed by the transmission of light) and in an image non-display regions B (i.e., the regions which are located between the image display regions A and the sealant <b>30</b> so that the image is not displayed). Moreover, the multi-layered film <b>11</b> of the other transparent substrate <b>10</b> is so formed that a film thickness t<b>1</b> at positions facing the individual protrusions <b>21</b>A in the image display regions A is smaller than a film thickness t<b>2</b> at positions facing the individual protrusions <b>21</b>A in the image non-display regions B.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The structure thus made can suppress the variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer <b>40</b> for the following reasons so that it can prevent the mura defect, as might otherwise be caused by the heat coming from a back light.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Under pressure applied at the substrate assembling step, the individual transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are deformed convexly toward each other using the fibers <b>31</b> of the sealant <b>30</b> in the regions C as a support point, as indicated by a broken curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, this deformation is restricted at the positions of the protrusions in the image display regions A and in the image non-display regions B. As the sealant <b>30</b> becomes hardened, the edge portions of the two transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are restrained while keeping their shapes under pressure by the sealant <b>30</b>. As a result, the two transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> put the forces in the directions to compress the protrusions <b>21</b>A to each other, after the pressure is released.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As indicated by a solid curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, therefore, the variation in the positions of the inner faces of the transparent substrates within the image display regions A is suppressed, so that variation in the thickness of the liquid crystal layer <b>40</b> can be resultantly suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the image non-display regions B in which the spacing between the inner faces <b>10</b>A and <b>20</b>A of the two transparent substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are larger than in the image display regions A, the multi-layered film <b>11</b> of the transparent substrate <b>10</b> is accordingly thicker. In the image non-display regions B, therefore, the multi-layered film <b>11</b> of the transparent substrate <b>10</b> will not be excessively away from the protrusions <b>21</b>A of the multi-layered film <b>21</b> of the transparent substrate <b>20</b>. As a result, the thickness fluctuation in the liquid crystal film <b>20</b> can be prevented, which is caused by the partial deformation of the transparent substrate, even if the image non-display regions B are touched by the user, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a case the percentage of width of the image non-display regions B to that of the image display regions A is equal or smaller than a predetermined value, it is not necessarily essential that the thickness of the multi-layered film <b>11</b> be made larger in the image non-display regions B than in the image display regions A.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Here, the shapes of the multi-layered films over the pattern forming faces of the individual mother substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> need not be limited to the aforementioned ones, if the total film thicknesses of the multi-layered films interposed between the pattern forming faces of the mother substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> at the contact positions of the multi-layered films over the pattern forming faces of the mother substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> satisfy “the relations of the total film thickness in the regions a≦the total film thickness in the regions b&lt;the total film thickness in the seal regions c≦the total film thickness in the cut regions d”.</p>
