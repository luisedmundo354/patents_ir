<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to electronic systems, and more particularly, to mobile communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many parts of the world the use of mobile telephones has become ubiquitous. One popular feature available on mobile telephones is known as push-to-talk. Push-to-talk allows a mobile telephone handset to function similarly to a walkie-talkie. Typically the user selects a contact or group of contacts, presses and holds the talk button and speaks. When the user is done with speaking releasing the talk-button ends that communication. One benefit of push-to-talk is a shorter-than-normal cell phone call. Push-to-talk can also be a more efficient and convenient manner on which to communicate with frequently called parties.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically a request for a new contacts or group for use with push-to-talk services are handled and caused to be added to a mobile telephone handset through an external server. Contrastingly, a conventional mobile telephone handset address book service is typically located and processed directly on the mobile telephone handset.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A new push-to-talk contact or group is typically created by sending a request to create the contact or group to the external server. The mobile then waits for a confirmation from the server that the contact or group was created successfully. Until the mobile receives the confirmation the new contact or group will remain pending from the mobile's perspective. Push-to-talk calls cannot be made to pending contacts or groups. Additionally, pending contacts or groups cannot be delete because the mobile telephone handset is waiting for the confirmation from the server.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases the server may not be able to create a contact or group. For example, if a contact is not valid the contact will not be created. Similarly, if one or more contacts in a group are not valid the group will not be created. Typically, the amount of time allowed for creating of a contact or group at the server is limited to a maximum time period known as a group creation time period. The length of the group creation time period can vary depending on the particular carrier, or in some cases the particular server. After the group creation time period expires the server typically deletes the contact or group associated with the specific time period at issue. In conventional systems however, the server does not communicate that the contact or group was not created to the mobile telephone handset.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the server fails to create a new contact or group of contacts the mobile telephone handset does not delete the pending contact or group. Since push-to-talk calls cannot be made to pending contacts or groups and pending contacts or groups cannot be delete, the pending contact or group of contacts may confuse the user and/or waste resources on the mobile handset, such as memory and space on the mobile telephone user interface. Additionally, when a group is invalid due to a few invalid entries it may be more difficult for the user to contact any contacts that are valid within the invalid group.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for creating a contact on a mobile device includes processing a request from a user to create a contact or group. After a predetermined period, if a confirmation of the creation of the contact or group has not been received, then the group is deleted from the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect the predetermined time period is measured from the time of the request to create the contact or group.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the predetermined time period is longer than the group creation time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect, a computer readable medium, such as a memory, embodies instructions performing a method of operating a mobile device. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: processing a request from a user to create a contact; storing the contact in a memory connected to the processor for a predetermined period of time; transmitting the request to a server; determining whether a confirmation has been received from the server prior to the expiration of the predetermined period of time; and in the event no confirmation has been received prior to the expiration of the predetermined period, then delete the contact from the memory responsive to the determination. These and other features, aspects, and embodiments are described below in the section entitled “Detailed Description.”</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Examples are discussed below generally in the contexts of a mobile device, specifically, a mobile telephone handset. It will be understood that the systems and methods described herein can be applied to any mobile device, including, but not limited to personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method for creating a contact or group of contacts in accordance with the systems and methods described herein. In step <b>102</b>, a user request to create a contact or group can be processed. In certain embodiments, the user request can be a request to create a contact or group for push-to-talk services. For example, when a subscriber desires to create a new contact or group, the subscriber can elect to do so through the user interface on their mobile device. Once the subscriber has finished imputing the relevant information through the user interface, the mobile device can then generate a request to create the contact or group and formed it to an external server for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In step <b>104</b>, the contact or group can be stored in a memory location on the mobile device for a predetermined time period. The memory can, for example, be a random access memory, flash memory, or any other type of memory commonly used in mobile electronic devices. Memory will be discussed further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In step <b>106</b>, the request to create a contact or group of contacts can be transmitted to the external server. When the server receives the request, it can be configured to process the request and send a confirmation back to the mobile device. When processing the request the server can be configured to set a group creation timer. In certain embodiments, if the group cannot be created before expiration of the group creation timer, then the server will stop attempting to create the group, however, in conventional systems, the server will not indicate to the mobile device the failure to make the group.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In step <b>108</b>, therefore, the mobile device determines whether a confirmation has been received prior to the expiration of a predetermined time period maintained on the mobile device. In step <b>110</b> the contact can be deleted if a confirmation has not been received prior to the expiration of the predetermined time period. Alternatively, if the confirmation has been received prior to the expiration of the predetermined time period then the contact can be obtained, as illustrated by step <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the mobile device can be configured such that steps <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, and/or <b>112</b> occur after the expiration of the predetermined time period. In other embodiments step <b>108</b> can occur in conjunction with step <b>110</b> and both can occur at any time during the predetermined time period. For example, if a confirmation is received before expiration of the predetermined time period, then the mobile device can be configured to determine that the confirmation was received (step <b>108</b>) and to store the contact or group (step <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the mobile device can be configured to begin a countdown to determine the expiration of a predetermined time period when it is powered up. In this way groups and/or contacts pending when the mobile device was last powered off can be deleted if the group(s), contact(s) or both are not valid. Alternatively, the mobile device can continue a countdown from where it left off when last powered down. In other embodiments the mobile device can assume the predetermined time period has expired when it powers up and groups and/or contacts that a confirmation has not been received for can be deleted. In another embodiment the mobile device may use time information to determine if a predetermined time period has expired. If the predetermined time period has expired the groups and/or contacts that a confirmation has not been received for can be deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Implementation of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> should reduce resources and overhead associated with group creation. As an example, in some cases less memory can be devoted to invalid contacts or groups, because the invalid contact or group can be deleted. Having fewer invalid contacts can also be less confusing for the subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a mobile device, specifically a mobile telephone handset <b>200</b> configured in accordance with the systems and methods as described herein. Mobile telephone handset <b>200</b> can be configured to perform the steps illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Mobile telephone handset <b>200</b> can include an antenna <b>202</b> configured to transmit and receive wireless signals. Antenna <b>202</b> is shown as a single antenna; however, it will be appreciated that antenna <b>202</b> can be a plurality of antennas, an array of antennas, etc. Additionally antenna <b>202</b> is shown as an external antenna, but it will be appreciated that the antenna <b>202</b> can be an internal antenna, an external antenna, or a combination of internal and external antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Antenna <b>202</b> is connected to a radio <b>204</b>. Radio <b>204</b> can comprise the circuitry necessary to process wireless signals transmitted and received via antenna <b>202</b>. For example, radio <b>204</b> can comprise the filters, demodulators, and analog-to-digital converters necessary to transform wireless signals received via antenna <b>202</b> into information carrying baseband signals. Similarly, radio <b>204</b> can comprise the filter, modulators and digital-to-analog converters necessary to transform baseband signals into wireless signals that can be transmitted via antenna <b>202</b>. It will be understood of course that radio <b>202</b> can comprise various integrated circuits and/or discrete components. Either some of the circuit or functions typically performed by a radio can be incorporated into processor <b>206</b>. Accordingly, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> should not be seen to limit the systems and methods described herein to any particular design or architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A processor <b>206</b> can be connected to radio <b>204</b>. Processor <b>206</b> can be configured to generate and receive the signals processed by the radio and can be configured to control radio <b>204</b>. Processor <b>206</b> can also be configured to control the application of mobile device <b>200</b> and to implement the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Processor <b>206</b> can comprise a microprocessor, digital logic, or a digital signal processor (DSP). Additionally, processor <b>206</b> can comprise a mobile station modem (MSM) or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Processor <b>206</b> can also be a combination of devices, for example, processor <b>206</b> can comprise a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, and digital logic.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Processor <b>206</b> can be connected to memory <b>208</b>, which can be configured to store instructions used by processor <b>206</b> to control the operation of device. Memory <b>208</b> can store data for processing by processor <b>206</b>. Memory <b>208</b> can be Random Access Memory (RAM), Flash memory, a hard drive, or some combination thereof. Further, memory <b>208</b>, or a portion thereof, can be removable. Memory <b>208</b> can be a device packaged separately from the processor <b>206</b>. In another embodiment memory <b>208</b> can be packaged with processor <b>206</b> in a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, instructions for causing processor <b>206</b> to implement the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be stored in memory <b>208</b> where necessary, processor <b>206</b> can be configured to access the instructions in order to create a group or contact as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, when a subscriber associated with mobile device <b>200</b> decides to create a new contact, the subscriber can indicate this desire via user interface <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">User interface <b>210</b> can comprise a display, keypad, buzzer, or ringer, microphone, speakers, etc. In short, the user interface <b>210</b> can comprise the hardware and software required to allow a subscriber to interface with mobile device <b>200</b>. In certain embodiments this can include a push-to-talk mechanism that allows the user, once a push-to-talk contact is selected to simply push a button and establish communication with that contact.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The subscriber can then use user interface <b>210</b> to input information related to the new contact. For example, the subscriber can, in some embodiments, scroll through, or select menu options using user interface <b>210</b> in order to indicate a desire to create a new contact via the user interface. Once the information is received via user interface <b>210</b> processor <b>206</b> can be configured to process the request (step <b>102</b>). The new contact information can then be stored (step <b>104</b>) in memory <b>208</b>, and transmitted via radio <b>204</b> and antenna <b>202</b> to an external server (step <b>106</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Mobile device <b>200</b> can also comprise a time set for a predetermined time period. Processor <b>206</b> can be configured to activate the timer upon transmission of request to the external server. The timer can be a hardware or software timer, or some combination thereof. If mobile device <b>200</b> receives a conformation that the contact was created, then processor <b>206</b> can be configured to store the new contact permanently in memory <b>208</b>. Alternatively, if processor <b>206</b> determines that a confirmation was not received (step <b>108</b>) before expiration of the timer, then processor <b>206</b> can be configured to delete the user contact (step <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, the external server receives the request and begins processing the new contact information. Conventionally, the external server also comprises a timer, termed the group creation timer, that is set once the request is received. If one new contact information cannot be verifies, or the new contact cannot be created, before the expiration of the group creation timer, then the process fails and the external server will cease trying to create the new contact. Further, no confirmation is sent to the mobile device Conversely, if the new contact can be verified and created within the time period defined by the group evaluation time, then the new contact will be created and a confirmation sent to the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In certain embodiments, therefore, the time included in mobile device <b>200</b> will define a time period that is longer than the time period defined by the group creation timer included on the server. This is obviously ensures that the external server has sufficient time to verify and create the user contact and send the confirmation before the mobile device deletes the new contact.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which depicts an exemplary wireless communication system <b>300</b>, an external server <b>308</b> can be communicated either one or more mobile devices <b>310</b> via one or more base stations <b>302</b>. Thus, mobile device <b>310</b> can be configured to transmit request to base station <b>302</b> as described above. Base station <b>302</b> can receive the requests via antenna <b>304</b> and process them using radio <b>306</b>. The processed requests can then be forwarded to server <b>308</b> for handling. Similarly, confirmations can be sent from server <b>308</b> to base station <b>302</b> for processing and transmission to mobile devices <b>310</b>.</p>
