<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Braille is a writing system for visually impaired or sightless people, consisting of raised elements, e.g. bumps, that are read by touch. A Braille document may include a pattern of Braille elements that are embossed in a relatively thick paper.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A Braille printer may be used to generate Braille documents using a computer system. A Braille printer may include a mechanism for embossing Braille elements into a relatively thick paper. For example, a Braille printer may include a mechanism for punching a pattern of bumps into a thick paper. The relative thickness of the paper is intended to hold the shape of the bumps in the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, prior Braille printers may be relatively expensive and cumbersome to use. For example, an embossing mechanism for punching Braille elements into paper may be relatively expensive to manufacture particularly in light of the relatively low volume of Braille printers that may be produced. In addition, the relatively thick paper used in prior Braille printers may be expensive and difficult to obtain in comparison to paper that is used in sight read text/graphics printers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A laser printer for Braille is disclosed that obviates the need for embossing mechanisms and specialized paper. A laser printer that prints a Braille element according to the present teachings increases an amount of a toner that adheres to an area of the paper that corresponds to the Braille element. The increased amount of toner yields a printed Braille element that may be read by touch.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a laser printer <b>10</b> for printing Braille onto a paper <b>12</b> according to the present techniques. The paper <b>12</b> may be the same type of paper that may be used for printing text or graphics suitable for sight reading.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a drum <b>26</b> that rotates, e.g. in a counter-clockwise direction as shown. The drum <b>26</b> includes a photoconductive material that may be discharged by light. As the drum <b>26</b> rotates, a drum charger <b>30</b> imparts a positive electrical charge onto the drum <b>26</b>. The drum charger <b>30</b> may be an electrical wire with electrical current passing through or may be a charged roller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The laser printer <b>10</b> writes a Braille element onto the drum <b>26</b> by performing an enhanced discharge of an area of the drum <b>26</b> that corresponds to the Braille element. The amount of the enhanced discharge may be selected to increase an amount of a toner <b>34</b> from a toner holder <b>35</b> that adheres to the area of the drum <b>26</b> that corresponds to the Braille element. For example, the enhanced discharge may be selected to yield a tactile feel, e.g. a bump feel, to the Braille element after the toner that adheres to the Braille element is transferred to and fused onto the paper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the enhanced discharge of the area of the drum <b>26</b> corresponding to the Braille element is provided by applying an enhanced amount of light from a laser <b>22</b> onto the area of the drum <b>26</b>. For example, a set of additional pulses of light may be applied from the laser <b>22</b> to the area of the drum <b>26</b> corresponding to the Braille element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a scanning mirror <b>24</b> that applies light pulses from the laser <b>22</b> onto the drum <b>26</b>. The combination of motions of the scanning mirror <b>24</b>, the rotation of the drum <b>26</b>, and the light pulses from the laser <b>22</b> are used to draw Braille elements onto the drum <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a roller <b>32</b> that rolls the toner <b>34</b> onto the surface of the drum <b>26</b> as it rotates. The toner <b>34</b> is positively charged and adheres to the negatively charged areas of the drum <b>26</b>. The enhanced discharge of the area of the drum <b>26</b> corresponding to the Braille element increases an amount of the toner <b>34</b> that adheres to the Braille element on the drum <b>26</b> in comparison to an amount of the toner <b>34</b> that adheres to areas not having an enhanced discharge, e.g. areas for printing text and graphics for sight reading.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a paper charger <b>36</b> that applies a negative charge to the paper <b>12</b> as it approaches the drum <b>26</b>. The paper charger <b>36</b> may be an electrical wire with electrical current passing through.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The negative charge on the paper <b>12</b> attracts the toner that has adhered to the drum <b>26</b>, thereby transferring the Braille element from the drum <b>26</b> onto the paper <b>12</b>. The paper <b>12</b> then passes through a fuser <b>28</b> that melts the deposited toner onto the paper <b>12</b>. The enhanced amount of toner transferred from the Braille element on the drum <b>26</b> to the paper <b>12</b> yields a tactile feel on the paper <b>12</b> after fusing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a drum discharger <b>29</b>, e.g. a bright lamp, that discharges the drum <b>26</b> to erase the Braille element from the drum <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the above-described charge polarities may be reversed. For example, the drum <b>26</b> may initially be charged to a negative charge and then written by positively charging the Braille element areas of the drum <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows progressive close-up views of an example set of Braille characters <b>40</b>-<b>46</b> written onto the drum <b>26</b>. The Braille characters <b>40</b>-<b>46</b> are written using combination of motions of the scanning mirror <b>24</b>, the rotation of the drum <b>26</b>, and a series light pulses from the laser <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A close-up view of the Braille character <b>40</b> shows that it includes an arrangement of Braille elements <b>60</b>-<b>64</b>. The Braille elements <b>60</b>-<b>64</b> each define an area that will be perceivable to touch, i.e. a bump, when printed on the paper <b>12</b>. The laser <b>22</b> writes the Braille elements <b>60</b>-<b>64</b> by applying a series of light pulses <b>50</b> that discharge the areas of the drum <b>26</b> that correspond to the Braille elements <b>60</b>-<b>64</b> on the drum <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A close-up view of the Braille element <b>60</b> shows that the series of light pulses <b>50</b> discharge an arrangement of dots <b>70</b>. Each dot <b>70</b> corresponds to the resolution of the laser <b>22</b> and the scanning mirror <b>24</b>, i.e. the maximum resolution of the laser printer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The pattern used to make up the Braille element <b>60</b> may have a significant impact on the amount of toner transferred. Depending on the embodiment, the pattern may be a solid fill of toner, or a specific pattern of dots designed to maximize the toner pile height. For example, on jump gap systems in which the roller <b>32</b> is not in contact with the drum <b>26</b>, a solid filled area has higher amounts of toner at the edges than in the center. A series of rings or separate larger dots that are larger than the native resolution of the laser printer <b>10</b> may yield a significant increases in toner over a solid filled area.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The laser printer <b>10</b> when printing a Braille element uses the laser <b>22</b> to provide a greater discharge of the drum <b>26</b> so that the discharge pattern on the drum <b>26</b> attracts more of the toner <b>34</b> from the roller <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, the laser printer <b>10</b> when printing a text or graphics image for sight reading applies one pulse of the laser <b>22</b> per dot of resolution. For a Braille element, the laser printer <b>10</b> applies two or more pulses of the laser <b>22</b> to each of the dots <b>70</b>. Each pulse of the laser <b>22</b> on each dot <b>70</b> produces a greater negative charge on the drum <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a set of control circuits in the laser printer <b>10</b> that are employed in printing Braille. The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a printer controller <b>80</b> that receives print files from a computer system via a communication path <b>86</b>. Examples of the communication path <b>86</b> includes a USB port, parallel port, serial port, Ethernet, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a printer memory <b>82</b> that holds a bit map of the dots to be printed onto the paper <b>12</b> when printing Braille. In some embodiments, the bit map is generated on a computer system and transferred to the laser printer <b>10</b> via the communication path <b>86</b>. In other embodiments, the printer controller <b>80</b> generates the bit map in response to information contained in a print file obtained via the communication path <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a laser controller <b>84</b>. The printer controller <b>80</b> issues commands to the laser controller <b>84</b>. The commands cause the laser controller <b>84</b> to issue control signals <b>88</b> to the laser <b>22</b> and the scanning mirror <b>24</b> to hit the drum <b>26</b> with pulses of light. When printing Braille, the printer controller <b>80</b> causes the laser controller <b>84</b> to generate additional pulses of light for each dot of a Braille element.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a bias control circuit <b>94</b> that generates a set of control signals <b>90</b> for controlling biases applied to the toner holder <b>35</b> that contains the toner <b>34</b> and for controlling an amount of charge applied to the drum <b>26</b> by the drum charger <b>30</b>. The bias control circuit <b>94</b> enables the printer controller <b>80</b> to print Braille elements by controlling the charge on the drum <b>26</b> together with a bias applied to the toner holder <b>35</b> so that more of the toner <b>34</b> is attracted to the drum <b>26</b> when printing Braille elements. In one embodiment of the laser printer <b>10</b>, the bias that is used to adjust the amount of the toner <b>34</b> placed on an area of the paper <b>12</b> is a DC bias for primary charging of the drum <b>26</b> and developing using the toner holder <b>35</b> of approximately 700VDC. For wider ranges of density, i.e. more toner deposition, both the DC and AC biases may be adjusted. The biases used on the toner <b>34</b> and the drum charger <b>30</b> may be independently controlled or may be controlled in concert. An interaction of the biases used on the toner <b>34</b> and the drum charger <b>30</b> may significantly influence how much toner is applied to the paper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The printer controller <b>80</b> uses the bias control circuit <b>94</b> to control the charge on the drum <b>26</b> together with a bias applied to the toner holder <b>35</b> on a page by page basis. The control of charge on the drum <b>26</b> with the bias to the toner holder <b>35</b> provides a density setting. The density is a measure of how much of the toner <b>34</b> is applied to the paper <b>12</b>. The density may be used to provide a “Braille page” setting for the laser printer <b>10</b> such that the amount of the toner <b>34</b> applied to the drum <b>26</b> (and ultimately the paper <b>12</b>) is maximized. The Braille page setting may be used in combination with extra light pulses from the laser <b>22</b> when printing Braille elements.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The particles of the toner <b>34</b> may be enlarged to facilitate the formation of tactile bumps for Braille elements. If toner particle size is changed, the DC and AC biases may be adjusted to compensate for the changed particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The laser printer <b>10</b> includes a fuser control circuit <b>96</b> that generates a set of control signals <b>92</b> to the fuser <b>28</b>. The fuser control circuit <b>96</b> enables the printer controller <b>80</b> to control an amount of pressure applied by a set of rollers in the fuser <b>28</b> to the paper <b>12</b>. For example, the printer controller <b>80</b> may reduce the amount of pressure applied by the rollers when printing a Braille page. The reduced pressure increases the height of Braille bumps. In addition, the fuser control circuit <b>96</b> enables the printer controller <b>80</b> to control the temperature applied by the fuser <b>28</b>. For example, the temperature of the fuser <b>28</b> may be reduced when printing a Braille page so that the height of Braille bumps is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The printer controller <b>80</b> may reduce the speed of movement of the paper <b>12</b> when printing a Braille page. For example, the laser printer <b>10</b> in one embodiment includes a motor control circuit <b>110</b> that generates a set of control signal <b>112</b> that provide paper speeds of one-half, one-third, and one quarter normal speed. The different speeds may be employed for different types of media that require significantly more heating. A slower print speed enables the paper <b>12</b> to spend more time in the fuser <b>28</b> to increase heat to the toner without generating more heat in the fuser <b>28</b>. The increased time in the fuser <b>28</b> increases the heat applied to the paper <b>12</b> and facilitates the heating of larger amounts of toner on Braille elements.</p>
