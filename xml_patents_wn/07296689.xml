<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a filter cartridge for liquid media at risk for freezing, in particular, for use in fuel cell operated vehicles and in internal combustion engines, preferably diesel engines. The filter cartridge comprises a housing that is closable by a filter lid. A filter insert is arranged in the housing and has at least one filter element which is positioned between terminal parts and is axially tensioned by at least one tensioning part.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In known filter cartridges of this type, the filter element is arranged between two end plates of the filter insert. They are axially pretensioned by means of a pretensioning ring, respectively, relative to the filter element when the filter insert is inserted into the filter housing. Because of the contact of the pretensioning rings on the housing, between the upper and lower end plates a torque is produced so that the end plates are twisted relative to one another. Accordingly, the filter elements of the filter insert position themselves in a slanted position so that they become shorter. This results in a decrease of the axial pretension. When medium flows through the filter unit, the filter element is moreover widened so that it can no longer provide the axial pretensioning forces which are required for proper sealing. When the filter element becomes warped, the length of the filter cartridge is shortened which, in turn, results also in a decrease of the axial pretensioning forces. The filter element therefore can no longer properly ensure a reinforcement action for the filter cartridge.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to configure a filter cartridge of the aforementioned kind such that a reduction of the axial pretensioning forces is prevented and a proper axial sealing action is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, this is achieved in that the filter element comprises at least one reinforcement part comprising at least one profiled section for taking up torque and/or axial forces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result of the configuration according to the invention, the reinforcement part will take up the torque resulting from screwing the filter insert into the housing and will provide all supporting functions. It thus prevents that the filter element, or the filter paper elements thereof, will twist. In this way, the axial length of the cartridge remains unchanged so that a proper axial sealing function of the filter cartridge is ensured.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The filter cartridge <b>1</b> is suitable particularly for use in internal combustion engines, preferably for diesel engines, in which such filter cartridges are employed for cleaning liquid media that are at risk for freezing, such as, in particular, a 32.5% aqueous urea solution.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The filter cartridge <b>1</b> has a filter housing <b>2</b> comprising a bottom part <b>2</b>′ and a lid <b>26</b>. The bottom part <b>2</b>′ is provided on a housing part and the lid <b>26</b> on a housing part <b>13</b>. The housing part <b>12</b> is screwed onto the housing part <b>13</b>. When doing so, a filter insert <b>3</b> inserted into the filter housing <b>2</b> is axially pretensioned and axially as well as radially sealed. The filter insert <b>3</b> has a cylindrical filter element <b>4</b> which is comprised of at least one filter paper <b>4</b>′ folded in accordion-shape. The filter element <b>4</b> is axially and radially secured with its lower end <b>34</b> and its upper end <b>37</b> in annular grooves <b>16</b> and <b>32</b> provided at the upper and lower terminal parts (disks) <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>, wherein a ring-shaped adhesive film <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> is positioned inbetween, respectively. The lower terminal disk <b>6</b> is in annular disk with an inner sleeve-shaped rim <b>14</b> and an outer sleeve-shaped rim <b>15</b> which are arranged coaxially relative to one another and project past a bottom or an inner side <b>30</b>, respectively. The adhesive film <b>17</b> rests against the terminal disk <b>6</b>. Approximately at the level of the bottom <b>30</b>, the terminal disk <b>6</b> has a circumferential groove <b>19</b> in which, when the filter insert <b>3</b> is mounted, a seal <b>20</b> in the form of an O-ring is positioned with which the filter insert rests radially sealingly against the cylindrical casing <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the filter housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the outer end face <b>10</b>, the terminal disk <b>6</b> has in annular groove in which a pretensioning part in the form of a pretensioning ring <b>9</b> is arranged. By means of the ring <b>9</b>, the filter insert <b>3</b> is pressed axially against the bottom <b>40</b> of the housing bottom part <b>2</b>′. The other terminal disk <b>5</b>, also configured as an annular disk, has also a circumferentially extending bushing-shaped outer rim <b>41</b>; together with a rod-shaped filler member <b>7</b>, the outer rim <b>41</b> delimits radially the annular groove <b>32</b> for receiving the filter element <b>37</b> and the adhesive film <b>18</b>. The filler member <b>7</b> provides a reinforcement part for the filter element <b>4</b> having a central opening <b>33</b> through which the filler member <b>7</b> projects. In the illustrated embodiment, it is a unitary part of the upper terminal disk <b>5</b>. Preferably, they are produced in a constructively simple and inexpensive way as injection molded plastic parts.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The side of the terminal disk <b>5</b> facing away from the terminal disk <b>6</b> has a projecting, preferably annular, collar <b>22</b> which has a circumferential groove <b>23</b> that extends coaxially to the filler member <b>7</b>; a pretensioning part (ring) <b>8</b> is arranged in the groove <b>23</b>. The ring <b>8</b> is preferably of the same configuration as the pretensioning ring <b>9</b> and projects axially past the collar <b>22</b>. By means of the pretensioning ring <b>8</b>, the filter insert <b>3</b> is supported and axially sealed on the inner side of the housing lid <b>26</b>. A central pin-shaped projection <b>24</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> projects past the end face <b>21</b> of the terminal disk <b>5</b> and past the annular collar <b>22</b>. The projection <b>24</b> tapers slightly in the outward direction and projects axially past the pretensioning ring <b>8</b>. With this projection <b>24</b>, the filter insert <b>3</b> in the mounted position projects into an area between radial stays (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) which project from the inner side of the housing lid <b>26</b> so that the filter insert <b>3</b> is aligned radially relative to the housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the terminal disk <b>6</b> has a central opening <b>42</b> which has two diametrically oppositely positioned flattened edge sections <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> which extend parallel to one another. The narrow end <b>27</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> has two matching flattened circumferential sections <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) which, in the mounted position, rest areally against the edge sections <b>43</b> or <b>44</b>. In this way, rotation of the filter element <b>4</b> relative to the filler member <b>7</b> is reliably prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The narrow end <b>27</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> has in the illustrated embodiment four axial depressions <b>28</b> which are positioned at the same spacing sequentially behind one another in the circumferential direction. The end section <b>7</b>′ of the filler member <b>7</b> adjoining the narrow end <b>27</b> is profiled such that it has four axial depressions <b>31</b> which are positioned at identical spacing behind one another in the circumferential direction; the depressions <b>31</b> are aligned with the recesses <b>28</b> of the narrow end <b>27</b>. The depressions <b>31</b> extend only across a relatively short length and form overflow channels for the liquid together with the recesses <b>28</b>. Instead of the described recesses or depressions <b>28</b>, <b>31</b>, it is also possible to provide flattened sections on the peripheral surface of the end section <b>7</b>′ and on the narrow end <b>27</b> by means of which it is also possible to provide flow cross-sections for the liquid. The liquid flows in the direction P out of annular chamber <b>47</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which is formed between the casing <b>39</b> of the filter housing <b>2</b> and the filter element <b>4</b>, and then in the direction of arrow P′ adially through the filter element <b>4</b>. In the area between the filter element <b>4</b> and the filler member <b>7</b> the filtered liquid flows into an annular chamber <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the direction of arrow P″. The liquid then flows from the annular chamber <b>11</b> into the overflow channels <b>28</b>, <b>31</b> in which it can flow in the direction of arrow P′″ in a direction to the housing outlet <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the mounted position, the terminal disk <b>6</b> is axially supported with an end face <b>29</b> of its inner rim <b>14</b> on a radial shoulder area <b>35</b> formed between the narrow end <b>27</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> and its profiled end section <b>7</b>′</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since the filler member <b>7</b> penetrates the so-called dead filtration space, i.e., the interior of the filter element <b>4</b>, it is achieved that only so little liquid is present that a liquid flowing through the filter cartridge during freezing is subjected only to a minimal volume expansion which does not impair filter properties. The support of the terminal disk <b>6</b> on the annular shoulder <b>35</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> provides that the filter element <b>4</b> maintains its axial length. The filter insert <b>3</b> rests with the pretensioning rings <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> against the inner side of the housing lid <b>26</b> and against the bottom of the housing part <b>2</b>′. When the two housing parts <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are screwed together with interposition of the filter insert <b>3</b>, a torque acts by means of the pretensioning rings <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, preferably comprised of elastic material, on the terminal disks <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. The profiled end <b>27</b> of the filler member <b>7</b> receives reliably the torque occurring between the two terminal disks <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> upon screwing together the two housing parts <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> so that twisting of the terminal disks relative to one another and thus twisting of the filter element <b>4</b> about its axis is prevented. In this way, a decrease of the axial pretensioning force is prevented. By means of the filler member <b>7</b>, the filter element <b>4</b> cannot soften excessively so that also in this way no decrease of the axial pretensioning force can occur which would lead to impairment of the sealing action of the filter insert <b>3</b> in the filter cartridge <b>1</b>. Since the filler member <b>7</b> reinforces the filter element <b>4</b>, the filter element itself is relieved. All supporting functions are provided by the filler member with the upper terminal disk <b>5</b>.</p>
