<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a fluid sensor and, more particularly, to a fluid sensor having a low pressure drain.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fuel systems often include a source of pressurized fuel, one or more fuel injectors, and a distribution system for directing the pressurized fuel from the source to the fuel injectors. The fuel injectors are often associated with an engine and it can be important to monitor various parameters of the pressurized fuel such as, for example, a temperature, a viscosity, a pressure, and other parameters known in the art to facilitate proper operational control of the engine. One or more sensors can be employed to monitor these parameters and may require direct contact with the pressurized fuel. These sensors typically include a seal to minimize leakage caused by an interface between the sensors and the fuel system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One such sensor-seal arrangement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,070,883 (the '883 patent) to Marto, issued on Jun. 6, 2000. The '883 patent describes a sealing unit for a fuel pressure sensor for sealing a flat sealing joint between the sensor and a fluid pressure carrying component. The sealing unit includes a round sealing washer with a central bore, the sealing washer being disposed between a threaded bolt-shaped end of the sensor and a bottom of a threaded bore of the fluid pressure carrying component.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the sealing unit of the '883 patent may reduce fuel leakage caused by the interface between the fuel pressure sensor and the fluid pressure carrying component, the sealing unit of the '883 patent does not contain the fluid that does leak past the interface. In particular, when fuel does leak past the sealing unit of the '883 unit, it will be allowed to escape to the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed fuel system is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a sensor for a fluid system having a tank and a source of pressurized fluid. The sensor includes a sensor body enclosing a sensor element that is configured to sense a parameter of the pressurized fluid. The sensor also includes a first passageway configured to fluidly communicate the sensor element with the pressurized fluid and a first sealing interface configured to seal the first passageway. The sensor further includes a second passageway configured to allow fluid that has leaked past the first sealing interface to drain to the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method of sensing a parameter of a fluid system. The method includes directing pressurized fluid from the fluid system to a sensor having a sensing element via a first fluid passageway. The sensing element is sealed to the fluid system via a first sealing interface. The method also includes sensing a parameter of the pressurized fluid. The method further includes directing fluid that has leaked past the first sealing interface to a tank via a second fluid passageway.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary fluid system <b>10</b>. Fluid system <b>10</b> may be operably connected to a power source (not shown) and may include a source <b>14</b> adapted to draw fluid from a supply tank <b>12</b>, to pressurize the fluid, and to direct the pressurized fluid to one or more fluid actuators. For example, fluid system <b>10</b> may include a fuel injection system connecting source <b>14</b> to a plurality of fuel injectors <b>16</b> by way of a common rail <b>18</b>. Fluid system <b>10</b> may direct fuel, hydraulic oil, or any other fluid known in the art to fuel injectors <b>16</b> either for direct injection or to cause actuation of fuel injectors <b>16</b>. During operation of fluid system <b>10</b>, various parameters of the fluid within common rail <b>18</b> may be monitored via a sensor <b>20</b>. It is contemplated that fluid system <b>10</b> may alternately be a hydraulic system other than a fuel injection system such as, for example, a hydraulic actuator system configured to move a cylinder associated with a work implement, a hydraulic transmission system, an engine lubrication sytem, or any other hydraulic system known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Supply tank <b>12</b> may constitute a reservoir configured to hold a supply of fluid. The fluid may include, for example, a liquid or gaseous fuel, a dedicated hydraulic oil, an engine lubrication oil, a transmission lubrication oil, or any other fluid known in the art. One or more hydraulic systems associated with the power source may draw fluid from and return fluid to supply tank <b>12</b>. It is also contemplated that fluid system <b>10</b> may be connected to multiple separate fluid supply tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Source <b>14</b> may be configured to produce a flow of pressurized fluid and may include a pump such as, for example, a variable displacement pump, a fixed displacement pump, a variable flow pump, or any other source of pressurized fluid known in the art. Source <b>14</b> may be drivably connected to the power source (not shown) by, for example, a countershaft (not shown), a belt (not shown), an electrical circuit (not shown), or in any other suitable manner. Source <b>14</b> may be dedicated to supplying pressurized fluid only to fluid system <b>10</b>, or may alternately supply pressurized fluid to multiple hydraulic systems.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of fuel injectors <b>16</b> may be disposed within a cylinder head (not shown) associated with combustion chambers (not shown) of the power source. Each fuel injector <b>16</b> may be operable to inject an amount of pressurized fuel into the combustion chamber at predetermined fuel pressures and fuel flow rates. Each fuel injector <b>16</b> may be mechanically, electrically, pneumatically, or hydraulically operated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Common rail <b>18</b> may be a hollow tubular member configured to distribute the flow of pressurized fluid from source <b>14</b>. In particular, common rail <b>18</b> may connect source <b>14</b> to fuel injectors <b>16</b> by way of a plurality of fuel lines <b>21</b>. In this manner, source <b>14</b> may draw fuel from supply tank <b>12</b> and direct the fuel to each fuel injector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, sensor <b>20</b> may include an assembly of components that cooperate to sense one or more parameters of the fluid within fluid system <b>10</b>. Specifically, sensor <b>20</b> may include a sensor body <b>22</b>, a coupling member <b>24</b>, and an intermediate member <b>26</b>. Sensor <b>20</b> may sense a pressure, a temperature, a viscosity, a flow rate, a contamination level, or any other suitable fluid parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Sensor body <b>22</b> may house a sensing element <b>27</b> and include a protrusion <b>28</b> having external threads, an electrical connector <b>30</b>, and tool engagement surfaces <b>32</b>. Protrusion <b>28</b> of sensor body <b>22</b> may provide a means for connecting sensor body <b>22</b> to intermediate member <b>26</b>, a fluid passageway allowing fluid from common rail <b>18</b> to communicate with sensing element <b>27</b>, and a means for sealing the fluid passageway. In particular, a central bore <b>34</b> within protrusion <b>28</b> may form the fluid passageway, while a flat end surface <b>36</b> of protrusion <b>28</b> may provide a bearing surface against which a sealing washer <b>38</b> may be compressed. It is contemplated that sealing washer <b>38</b> may be absent, if desired, with a deformable bite edge being alternately included. Electrical connector <b>30</b> may provide a means for conducting signals from sensor <b>20</b>. Tool engagement surfaces <b>32</b> may provide a means for assembling sensor <b>20</b> to fluid system <b>10</b>. A substantially planar flanged member <b>40</b> may be disposed between protrusion <b>28</b> and tool engagement surfaces <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Coupling member <b>24</b> may be connected to common rail <b>18</b> and may provide a low-pressure leak path to supply tank <b>12</b>. In particular, coupling member <b>24</b> may be a generally hollow cylindrical member disposed radially around a portion of common rail <b>18</b>. A space may be provided between coupling member <b>24</b> and common rail <b>18</b> such that a low-pressure drain passageway <b>42</b> in fluid communication with the space may allow fluid buildup within the space to drain to supply tank <b>12</b>. Coupling member <b>24</b> may also include a low-pressure radial passageway <b>44</b> fluidly connecting intermediate member <b>26</b> with the space between coupling member <b>24</b> and common rail <b>18</b>. Coupling member <b>24</b> may further include internal threads <b>46</b> configured to receive intermediate member <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Intermediate member <b>26</b> may be disposed between sensor body <b>22</b> and coupling member <b>24</b> and may include multiple fluid passageways and sealing interfaces. In particular, intermediate member <b>26</b> may include external threads <b>48</b> configured to engage internal threads <b>46</b> of coupling member <b>24</b> and internal threads <b>50</b> configured to receive externally-threaded protrusion <b>28</b> of sensor body <b>22</b>. Intermediate member <b>26</b> may include a first fluid passageway <b>54</b> and a second fluid passageway <b>52</b>. First fluid passageway <b>54</b> may fluidly connect common rail <b>18</b> to central bore <b>34</b> of sensor body <b>22</b>. Second fluid passageway <b>52</b> may provide a leak path for fluid that escapes past sealing washer <b>38</b> to low-pressure drain passageways <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. Intermediate member <b>26</b> may also have a substantially planar bearing surface <b>56</b> in opposition to flat end surface <b>36</b> of protrusion <b>28</b> such that sealing washer <b>38</b> may be compressibley sandwiched between the two surfaces. One or more sealing members <b>58</b> such as, for example, o-rings, may be disposed between intermediate member <b>26</b> and a peripheral edge of planar flanged member <b>40</b>, and between intermediate member <b>26</b> and coupling member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The threading of intermediate member <b>26</b> into coupling member <b>24</b> may provide a sealing interface between intermediate member <b>26</b> and common rail <b>18</b>.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The disclosed fluid system has wide use in a variety of applications including, for example, fuel systems, lubrication systems, work implement actuation systems, transmission systems, and other hydraulic systems, where fluid leakage to the environment is undesirable. The disclosed fluid system may minimize fluid leakage to the environment by providing a double walled sensor having a leak path between the two walls. This leak path allows fluid that has leaked past an inner of the two walls to drain back to a low-pressure supply tank. The operation of fluid system <b>10</b> will now be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">During operation of fluid system <b>10</b>, source <b>14</b> may draw fluid from supply tank <b>12</b>, pressurize the fluid, and direct the pressurized fluid to common rail <b>18</b>. Sensing element <b>27</b> within sensor body <b>22</b> may be in fluid communication with the fluid within common rail <b>18</b> via either radial passageway <b>62</b>, first fluid passageway <b>54</b>, and central bore <b>34</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or via axial common rail passageway <b>70</b> and central bore <b>34</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). If fluid leaks past either bite edge <b>60</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or sealing washer <b>38</b>, it may return to supply tank <b>12</b> via low-pressure drain passageways <b>52</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>42</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or via low-pressure drain passageway <b>74</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
