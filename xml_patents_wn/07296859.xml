<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention is directed to a rocking chair that can be shipped as component parts and readily assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Rocking chairs are an enduringly popular item of furniture. But due to their characteristically high backs, and the extended runners that form their rocking base, they are unusually bulky chairs, which take up much space. This is a particular problem when they are packed for shipping. The shipping container must be quite large to contain the chair, and quite sturdy because all the chair's extended parts are relatively fragile.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be a great advantage for the manufacturers of rocking chairs to be able to ship in smaller containers, and have the chair parts packed so as to be less fragile. This can be accomplished by shipping the rocking chair in the form of unassembled components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is accordingly, an object of the present invention, to provide a rocking chair which is comprised of specific components, which can be packed together in close and parallel relationship, and yet readily assembled into a sturdy chair with a minimal number of steps and no particular skills. This is facilitated by use of unique corner joints which attach the seat to front and rear uprights.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Applicant is aware of no prior art directly relevant to the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with the present invention, an erectable rocking chair in the form of components which can be packed together in close and parallel relationship and yet readily assembled into a sturdy chair with horizontally and vertically reinforced joints attaching the seat to the front and rear uprights.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a rocking chair disassembled into its various components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The front frame <b>11</b> comprises a left upright <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and right upright <b>12</b><i>b</i>. A front rail <b>15</b>, extends between them, near their bottom ends. On top of uprights <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, are formed tenons <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>. On the bottom of upright <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, are formed tenons <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The rear frame <b>16</b> comprises a left upright <b>17</b><i>a </i>and right upright <b>17</b><i>b</i>. A head board <b>18</b>, extends between uprights <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b </i>near their top ends. A woven back support <b>19</b>, extends between uprights <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, below headboard <b>18</b>. A rail <b>20</b>, extends between uprights <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, near their bottom ends. The lower halves of uprights <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, have upper mortises <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, middle mortises <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and lower mortises <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>. Mortises <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are rectangular in shape to accommodate a rectangular tenon.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Seat <b>24</b>, is formed on a rectangular frame comprised of front seat frame <b>25</b>, rear seat frame <b>26</b>, left side seat frame <b>27</b> and right side seat frame <b>28</b>. Tenon <b>29</b><i>b </i>is formed on the front end of frame <b>28</b>, and tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>is formed on its rear end. Tenon <b>29</b> is formed on the front end of frame <b>27</b>, and tenon <b>30</b><i>a </i>is formed on its rear end. A woven seat bottom <b>45</b> extends between and is supported by front seat frame <b>25</b> and rear seat frame <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A left rail <b>41</b> is illustrated; and a right rail <b>42</b>. Rail <b>41</b> has a tenon <b>43</b><i>a </i>on its front end and tenon <b>44</b><i>a </i>on its rear end. Rail <b>42</b> has tenon <b>43</b><i>b </i>on its front end and tenon <b>44</b><i>b </i>on its rear end.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Left runner <b>35</b> is essentially identical to right runner <b>36</b>. Each has a front mortise <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b</i>, as well as a rear mortise <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Left arm <b>31</b> is essentially identical to right arm <b>32</b>. Each has a tenon <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>formed on its rear end. Each has mortise <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>formed toward its front end.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates all of the individual separate components of a rocking chair. These components thus separated can be contained and packed flat in a relatively compact container, less than a quarter the size of a container required for an assembled rocking chair.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The subsequent <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, illustrate the order and method by which the components are assembled to form the rocking chair illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. All joints are glued.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the insertion of tenons <b>43</b><i>a </i>and <b>43</b><i>b</i>, into mortises <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the attachment of the seat <b>24</b> to the rear frame <b>16</b>. Tenons <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>are inserted into mortises <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the attachment of front frame <b>11</b> to seat <b>24</b>. For purposes of clearer understanding this view does not show the woven seat bottom <b>45</b>, but only the seat frame (<b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>). Mortises in the underside of uprights <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, fit onto the tenons <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>as well as tenons <b>43</b><i>a </i>and <b>43</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>is an enlarged detail from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that illustrates a distinctive feature of the present invention. Mortise <b>22</b><i>b </i>is formed in upright <b>17</b><i>b</i>. Mortise <b>22</b><i>b </i>is a relatively large mortise, and rectangular in shape. Tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>(on the rear end of side seat frame <b>28</b>) is of a corresponding rectangular shape. The joint formed of tenant <b>30</b><i>b </i>and mortise <b>22</b><i>b</i>, is particularly stable. Due to its rectangular shape, the tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>cannot rotate, as a round tenon could. There is a space between tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the adjacent end of rear seat frame <b>26</b>. That space is just slightly wider than the portion of upright <b>17</b><i>b</i>, which is adjacent to mortise <b>22</b><i>b </i>on the inner side of upright <b>17</b><i>b</i>. So when the tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>is forced into mortise <b>22</b><i>b</i>, that portion of upright <b>17</b><i>b </i>is edged into the said space between tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the adjacent end of rear seat frame <b>26</b>. This wedging, combined with the joint formed by tenon <b>30</b><i>b </i>and mortise <b>22</b><i>b </i>creates a juncture between the seat <b>24</b> and rear frame <b>16</b> which is both horizontally and vertically reinforced at a point subject to considerable stress. Similar junctures are formed at the other three corners of seat <b>24</b>, where it is attached to uprights <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the attachment of arm <b>32</b> to uprights <b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>. Tenon <b>33</b><i>b </i>is forced into mortise <b>21</b><i>b</i>, and mortise <b>34</b><i>b </i>is forced down onto tenon <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Arm <b>31</b> (not shown) is attached in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the attachment of runners <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. The tenons <b>39</b><i>a </i>and <b>39</b><i>b </i>are forced into mortises <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>of runners <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. The tenons <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are forced into the mortises <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b </i>of runners <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. The joint formed by insertion of tenons <b>39</b><i>a </i>and <b>39</b><i>b </i>into mortises <b>38</b> <i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b</i>, as well as the joint formed by the insertion of tenons <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>into mortises <b>37</b><i>a </i>and <b>37</b><i>b</i>, is further strengthened by insertion of a dowel (not illustrated in the drawings) through the runner and through the tenon.</p>
