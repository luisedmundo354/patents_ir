<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates toan installation tool for self-expanding fasteners, having an outer sleeve for preventing the mushrooming component from turning and a socket for turning a threaded component said socket turning inside of the outer sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Plumbers, electricians, mechanical contractors, sprinkler fitters and maintenance personnel often have to hang pipe, conduit, cabling, ducting, light fixtures and various other items from structural supports such as ceilings, thin metal decking, roof decking, beams, Z purlin, bar joist or other truss materials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specialty brackets must be employed or holes must be be drilled in the material and a mounting plate or bracket bolted in place with nuts, bolts, or screws to support a hanger therefrom. Often times access to the top or backside of the material may be restricted making use of backing nuts difficult or impossible to incorporate. These methods either use multiple installation steps with several parts being installed separately, or have limitations on the ease of installation and involve parts, which can be stripped, over torqued or otherwise compromised during or after installation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, the space required by various mechanical systems incorporated in most buildings hinders and often prohibits the worker from easily reaching the support from which the hanger is to be attached. This space limitation combined with multi-step processes for attaching the hanger such as drilling a hole, placing a back nut over the hole and turning in a bolt while balancing on a ladder is difficult, time consuming, dangerous and expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further the strength and integrity of the fastening connection must be calibrated and known for building inspection and end product integrity. Some methods used cannot guarantee the strength of the connection, due to base material limitations, thickness of the various building materials employed in today's building practices and installer error.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The mushrooming expandable anchor has two main components, the portion that collapses or mushrooms and a second threaded component that mechanically causes the collapse.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The mushrooming component has a tubular body with a short section of internal threads on one end and a square flat washer on the opposite end. The tubular portion of the mushrooming component has slits in the sides, and the sides are slightly bowed out to promote symmetrical collapse. The tube is collapsed by a treaded screw rotated within the tubular body pulling the internally threaded section downwards towards the washer at the base. The mushrooming anchor when collapsed has radially extended anchoring strips preventing extraction of the fastener from a hole drilled in the support through which the fastener extends.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When there is clear access to the fastening point and the installer is on a lift or other support, the installer can first drill a hole through the support. The expandable anchor is then inserted into the hole and the internal threaded component is rotated collapsing the tubular body portion of the fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment a drill point can be pressed into the tip of the expandable anchor for self-drilling through the support.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The anchor is easy to use by simply placing the device in a socket attached to a drill and turning the socket. The drill point on the end of the expandable anchor drills a hole in the support it is to be held from. Once the hole is drilled, the anchor seats into the hole and an external socket end sleeve tool slides upward over the internal socket engaging the seated, unexpanded fastener. The exterior sleeve engages the square seated collar of the fastener preventing it from rotating. The interior socket is then rotated causing the expanding portion of the fastener to collapse as the point of the internal threaded portion pushes the pressed in drill point from the anchor. This self-drilling option allows the installer to fasten and hang threaded rod from the floor. Any given length of threaded rod can be installed into high ceilings with the limitations being (1) the length of the pole tool, which can be a telescoping tool comprised of aluminum tubes as are readily available in the market place and (2) the length of the threaded rod because the threaded rod must protrude from the lower end of the pole tool so it can be rotated within the pole tool independently. By rotating the threaded rod with the self-drilling fastener already threaded onto its end, the fastener self drills and seats itself. Once seated, the extended pole tool (with the rod inside) is lifted and the notched exterior pole tool end engages the base of the expandable portion of the fastener prohibiting it from rotating. The next step is to turn the threaded rod causing the mushrooming portion of the fastener to collapse. The threaded rod remains installed in the fastener, allowing the worker to hang the intended load.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Alternatively the self-drilling expandable anchor can be constructed in a different manner. In this embodiment the collapsible mushrooming portion with a drill point can be placed in the inner socket and rotated by a drill to drill a hole in the support and seat the collapsible mushrooming portion that has a receiver head broached directly onto the opposite end of the drill point. A threaded component is incorporated within the assembly and collapses it by use of an internal screwdriver. The drill point is pushed from the top of the mushrooming portion by the advancing threaded component.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment a drill bit having a hex at it's base is placed in a drill to drill a hole in a support. Once the hole is drilled a combination sleeve tool is placed over the drill bit and engages the hex at the drill bit base. The outer portion of the combination sleeve tool engages the collapsible mushrooming portion to keep it from turning and the threaded component of the expandable anchor is engaged by an internal drive/drive shaft. The expandable anchor is inserted into the drilled hole in the support and the internal threaded component is turned relative to the collapsible mushrooming portion to collapse it by operating the drill.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Once the expandable anchor has been installed in the support an all thread rod may then be installed into the male receiver at the base of the threaded component. The hanger is now ready for its intended load. Alternatively a cross drilled head in the base of the threaded component could hang wire or an adaptor bracket to allow the fastening of rods, bracing, bracketing or wire. The expandable anchor can have a fixed head or a swivel head.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The expandable anchor provides a known pull out strength which is necessary for building safety while providing an easy to install method having a fool proof, no stripping, overturning or over torquing feature thus preventing breakage of the fastener which may cause failure and increase construction costs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the self-drilling screw with expandable anchor <b>10</b> unassembled. In a first embodiment the self-drilling screw having an expandable anchor <b>10</b> has three component parts. A hex head screw threaded component <b>20</b> similar to a SAMMY SUPER SCREW® sold by Speedy Products, Inc. owned by Illinois Tool Works, Inc. 3600 West Lake Avenue, Glenview, Ill. 60025-5811, a mushrooming component <b>30</b> similar to AVK Industrial Products A-R Series™ Threaded Insert, sold by AVK Industrial Products of Valencia, Calif. and a drill point <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows tools used to install the mushrooming expandable anchor <b>10</b>. The tools include a socket <b>50</b> for turning the hex head screw <b>20</b>, a sleeve tool <b>70</b> for engaging the expandable anchor <b>30</b>, an internally broached drive shaft <b>80</b> for engaging the socket <b>50</b>, a drive tool/adaptor <b>83</b> having a hex adaptor portion <b>82</b> to turn the above described assembly and adapt to drill bit <b>81</b>, if a drill point <b>40</b> is not included in the assembly, and finally drill <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drill point <b>40</b> has a slightly larger diameter than the mushrooming component <b>30</b> such that it can cut a hole in a support <b>60</b> and allow the mushrooming portion <b>35</b> of the expandable anchor body <b>30</b> to fit though the drilled hole.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mushrooming component <b>30</b> is basically a cylinder having an internal threaded portion <b>34</b> near the top and a base <b>38</b> at the bottom. Slots <b>36</b> are cut thought the cylinder walls in several locations around the mushrooming component <b>30</b> so that it can be compressed and split apart along the slits to form anchoring strips <b>37</b> when the mushrooming component <b>30</b> is collapsed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>. The mushrooming component <b>30</b> is formed with a bulge in the walls to facilitate the collapse of anchoring strips <b>37</b>. Although mushrooming component <b>30</b> is shown as a cylindrical body with a circular cross section in the figures it can be any shape with any cross section such as an octagon, hexagon, square, or oval etc. as long as it will fit through the hole drilled in the support and collapse as shown herein.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The hex head component <b>20</b> has a hex head portion <b>22</b>, a base portion <b>24</b> and a screw shaft <b>26</b> having a diameter just smaller than the inside threaded diameter <b>34</b> of the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. The shaft <b>26</b> has a threaded section <b>28</b> on the top portion for engaging the threads of the internal threaded portion <b>34</b> in the mushrooming component <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one mode of use, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the threads of the internal threaded portion <b>34</b> in mushrooming component <b>30</b> are threaded onto the threads <b>28</b> on the screw shaft <b>26</b> of hex head screw <b>20</b> by a few turns. The hex head screw <b>20</b> is placed in a socket <b>50</b> having a hexagon wall <b>58</b> on a portion of the inside surface for mating with the hex head portion <b>22</b> of hex head screw <b>20</b>. The hex head screw <b>20</b> can then be turned by the socket <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> a sleeve tool <b>70</b> has an inside diameter which fits over the outside diameter of the socket <b>50</b> such that the socket <b>50</b> can rotate inside the sleeve tool. <b>70</b> when desired. The sleeve tool <b>70</b> has notches <b>72</b> for engaging the comers <b>74</b> of the base <b>38</b> of the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. Sleeve tool <b>70</b> can either be a hand held tool on the order of 12 to 15 inches long or an expandable pole tool that can be extended to any length. The sleeve tool <b>70</b> may have a hand gripping means to hold it in place while the socket <b>50</b> is being turned therein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The socket <b>50</b> has a hex shaft <b>52</b> for connection to internally broached drive shaft <b>80</b> which allows connection to drive tool/adaptor <b>83</b> having a hex adapter portion <b>82</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A driving means <b>84</b> such as an electric or battery operated drill, air powered drill or the like can rotate the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The driving means <b>84</b> is connected to the drive shaft <b>80</b> to drive socket <b>50</b> by part <b>83</b>, which optionally holds disposable drill bit <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the driving means <b>84</b> will turn drill point <b>40</b> on the top of mushrooming component <b>30</b> to cut through a support <b>60</b>, which may be a thin metal decking, beams, supports, Z purlin, bar joist, roof decking, or other truss materials. After the drill point <b>40</b> has cut through the support <b>60</b> the drill point <b>40</b> is no longer needed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The next step in the process is to collapse or mushroom the mushrooming component <b>30</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to secure it from being pulled out of the support <b>60</b>. The driving means <b>84</b> will now rotate the combination of socket <b>50</b> and drive shaft <b>80</b> while the installer is holding the sleeve tool <b>70</b> in a fixed position such that the hex head screw <b>20</b> can rotate relative to the mushrooming component <b>30</b> thus rotating the treads <b>28</b> of the screw. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the threads <b>28</b> are only on a portion of the top of the screw shaft <b>26</b>. The internal threaded portion <b>34</b> of the mushrooming component <b>30</b> is also only on a top portion of the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. The relative length of the threaded portions <b>28</b> and <b>34</b> on the screw shaft <b>26</b> and the mushrooming component <b>30</b> respectively are such that as the hex head screw <b>20</b> is turned relative to the mushrooming component <b>30</b> the top of the mushrooming component <b>30</b> will be pulled downward allowing the bowed portion <b>35</b> having the slots <b>36</b> to collapse, forming anchoring strips <b>37</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>. Base <b>38</b> will be pulled up against the bottom of support <b>60</b> and will not fit through the drilled hole therein. As the hex head screw <b>20</b> is turned relative to the mushrooming component <b>30</b> the anchoring strips <b>37</b> will be flattened out. The anchoring strips <b>37</b> will not fit through the hole self-drilled by drill point <b>40</b> offering a pull out strength strong enough to support whatever the hanger is to be attached to. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> the internal hanger threads <b>25</b> in the bottom portion of the hex head screw <b>20</b> are available to hold whatever is screwed into the hanger threads <b>25</b> or alternatively a cross drilled hole <b>46</b> may be incorporated to allow attachment of a great variety of adaptors. The pull out strength can vary depending on the support material <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the drill point <b>40</b> is expelled from the top of the mushrooming component <b>30</b> by the top of the screw shaft <b>26</b> as it pushes through the top of the expandable anchor <b>10</b>. The drill point <b>40</b> will then fall out and may land on the support <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The lengths of the threaded portions <b>28</b> and <b>34</b> on the screw shaft <b>26</b> and the mushrooming component <b>30</b> respectively are such that the threads <b>28</b> on the screw shaft <b>26</b> will exit the top threads of internal threaded portion <b>34</b> on the mushrooming component <b>30</b> allowing the hex head screw <b>20</b> to spin freely thereafter when the expandable anchor <b>10</b> is compressed to the desired amount. This spin free feature eliminates possible over torque or fracture of components incorporated in fastener <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that the drill point <b>40</b> can be connected to the mushrooming component <b>30</b> in many different ways. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the drill point <b>40</b> is swaged at neck <b>44</b> into the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the drill point <b>40</b> has teeth <b>130</b> for engaging the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the drill point <b>40</b> has teeth notches <b>42</b> for engaging posts <b>45</b> the mushrooming component <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When self-drilling a hole in the support <b>60</b> the socket <b>50</b> turns the hex head screw <b>20</b> while notches <b>72</b> in sleeve <b>70</b> engage the corners <b>74</b> of the base <b>38</b> on the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. When the socket <b>50</b> turns the screw <b>20</b> the mushrooming component <b>30</b> and sleeve <b>70</b> will spin with the screw <b>20</b> since it takes a great deal of force to turn the threads <b>28</b> on screw <b>20</b> into the treads of internal threaded portion <b>34</b> of mushrooming component <b>30</b>. Therefore the drilling can be accomplished without collapsing the mushrooming component <b>30</b>. However when the sleeve <b>70</b> is held to keep it from rotating then the mushrooming component <b>30</b> will collapse. Alternatively the sleeve <b>70</b> will not be placed into engagement with the mushrooming component <b>30</b> and held from spinning until it is desired to collapse the mushrooming component <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">There can be many different varieties of hex head screw <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the screw shaft <b>26</b> is integral with or fixed in the base <b>24</b>. Alternatively as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b> the hex head screw <b>20</b> is an assembly of two parts, the base portion <b>124</b> with a hex head base <b>22</b> and a screw <b>126</b> having screw shaft <b>26</b> with threads <b>28</b>, a screw hex head <b>29</b> having a rim <b>23</b>. The hex head <b>29</b> on screw <b>126</b> mates with a hex head receiving portion <b>31</b> in the base portion <b>124</b> of hex head screw <b>20</b>. The screw <b>126</b> with a hex head <b>29</b> can be a standard screw, which can be purchased in bulk at low prices from any number of suppliers. The base portion <b>124</b> can have the hex head receiving portion <b>31</b> for receiving the hex head <b>29</b> of screw <b>126</b> and then folding a flange <b>27</b> over the rim <b>23</b> to keep the screw <b>126</b> in place relative to the base portion <b>124</b>. As shown in greater detail in the applicant's co pending application Ser. No. 09/848,658 filed May 4, 2001 titled MOUNTING APPARATUS HAVING A SWIVEL HEAD, now Pat. No. 6,443,680 issued Sep. 3, 2002, which is hereby made a part hereof and incorporated herein by reference, the flange <b>27</b> can be some distance from the hex head receiving portion <b>31</b> providing space <b>33</b> for a dome portion within the base portion <b>124</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The dome portion <b>33</b> allows the screw hex head <b>29</b> to broach into the hex head receiving portion <b>31</b> when it is desired to fix the screw in position while in use for compressing the expandable anchor <b>30</b> and thereafter to release the screw hex head <b>29</b> from the hex head receiving portion <b>31</b> so that it can swivel freely in the domed portion <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an alternative embodiment, the self-drilling on pre drilling of the hole in the support <b>60</b> would proceed as in prior embodiments, however, instead of a screw hex head <b>29</b> the screw head would be replaced by an alternatively shaped head <b>125</b> with a slot or other such driver <b>129</b> therein as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this embodiment, the threads <b>228</b> of the screw shaft <b>226</b> can be turned relative to the threads <b>234</b> while the mushrooming component <b>230</b> is held stationary by a wrench while a screw driver, preferrably connected to a drill, is inserted in the slot <b>129</b> or some other means provided the screw head is designed to receive such a turning device. In this manner the mushrooming component <b>230</b> is collapsed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> mushrooming component <b>230</b> is internally broached into head <b>22</b> and held in place by flange <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a disposable drill bit <b>81</b> fits into machine part <b>83</b> that has a hex adaptor portion <b>82</b> having a set screw <b>87</b>. This fits into a drill chuck <b>84</b> to drill a hole in a support <b>60</b>. In this embodiment the drill bit <b>40</b> is not used. After the hole is drilled a drive shaft <b>80</b> having interior hex portions <b>53</b> on both ends attaches to the hex portion <b>82</b> of the bit adaptor and hex portion <b>52</b> of socket <b>50</b> allowing the rotation of part <b>20</b> while sleeve <b>70</b> prevents rotation of mushrooming component <b>30</b>. In this manner an installer can use the assembly repeatedly without rechucking his drill. He drills a hole in support material <b>60</b> with the drill bit <b>81</b> and then attaches the assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref> by the assembly of parts <b>80</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>70</b> over hex adaptor portion <b>82</b>, to collapse mushrooming component <b>30</b> in the support <b>60</b>. He then removes the assembly of parts <b>80</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>70</b> to make the drill bit available for drilling the next hole in the support, then inserts another pre assembled non self-drilling screw with expandable anchor <b>10</b> in socket <b>50</b> and is ready to mushroom another collapsible component <b>30</b> in the support <b>60</b>. Expandable anchor <b>10</b> is significantly less expensive without drill point <b>40</b> as a component.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">One of the advantages of the screw with expandable anchor <b>10</b> with a drill point <b>40</b> thereon is that it can be used with a pole installation method such that the installer need not be on a ladder adjacent the support <b>60</b> to drill a hole therein. He can stand on the floor and move about freely without having to reposition a ladder for each installation operation. With this method the installer can also access the support <b>60</b> through narrow gaps between pipes, vents or other equipment. The pole and equipment attached thereto can be held at a position considerably below the support <b>60</b> for self-drilling a hole therein and collapsing the collapsible anchor <b>10</b>. To use this method a threaded rod <b>90</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be threaded to the base of self-drilling hex head screw <b>20</b> using threads <b>25</b> therein. A long or an extendable pole tool <b>70</b> can be used with the threaded rod to match the length of the threaded rod. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> drill chuck <b>84</b> receives internally threaded driver <b>85</b>, which accepts a length of threaded rod <b>90</b>. Threaded rod <b>90</b> must protrude from the lower end of pole tool <b>70</b>. By rotating the assembly comprising the drill chuck <b>84</b>, the driver <b>85</b> the threaded rod <b>90</b>, part <b>10</b> and the drill point <b>40</b> will self drill through material <b>60</b>. Once drilling is complete, pole tool <b>70</b> is raised to engage the corners <b>74</b> on base <b>38</b> of seated collapsible anchor portion <b>30</b>. The installer grasps pole tool <b>70</b> preventing it from rotating while activating drill <b>84</b> thus turning threaded rod <b>90</b> and internal screw <b>20</b> causing collapse of mushrooming component <b>30</b>. Then pole tool <b>70</b> is slid down leaving the complete fastener assembly <b>10</b> with threaded rod <b>90</b> ready for the intended load to be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The pole tool <b>70</b> can be extendable to be used with different lengths of rods <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively if the installer would prefer to use an embodiment with no drill tip <b>40</b> on the mushrooming component <b>30</b> he would have to first drill a hole in the support <b>60</b> with a drill <b>84</b> and the assembly comprising disposable drill bit <b>81</b>, and adaptor <b>83</b>, and then install the collapsible anchor <b>10</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in the figures the base of the screw <b>20</b> has internal threads <b>25</b> providing a connection to the object to be hung therefrom, however the base of screw <b>20</b> may use any means of attaching an object thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an alternate embodiment a hole <b>46</b> cross drilled through the hex head portion <b>22</b> can be used to insert a rod or bolt (not shown) for hanging an object or bracket by use of the hole <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
