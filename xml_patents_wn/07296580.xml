<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to blow dryers and, more specifically, to a plurality of hair curlers having means for engaging a hair curling appliance comprising a housing having curler engaging and disengaging means, a circuit for producing a volume of heated air, control means for energizing and de-energizing said circuit, an actuator for engaging a temperature burst and means for tapping a power source. The housing incorporates a handle assembly containing a heating element for electrically heating the air in use, an on/off switch, quick release ring and temperature burst button. At one distal end of the curling wand is a curler attachment port that allows the user to insert a curler and release the curler by a quick release button. The wand allows for the use of a variety of different size and style curlers to be used. A storage case is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are other hair care device designed for styling. Typical of these is U.S. Pat. No. 3,365,811 issued to Djenner on Jan. 30, 1968.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another patent was issued to Reyes on Oct. 12, 1071 as U.S. Pat. No. 3,612,070. Yet another U.S. Pat. No. 4,222,398 was issued to Fromman on Sep. 16, 1980 and still yet another was issued on U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,851 to Plaisted as U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,851.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another patent was issued to McClean on Aug. 11, 1987 as U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,479. Yet another U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,037 was issued to Chan on Nov. 15, 1994. Another was issued to (Chan on (May 7, 1996 as U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,665 and still yet another was issued on Mar. 23, 1999 to O'Brien as U.S. Pat. No. 5,884,635.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another patent was issued to Smal on Dec. 19, 1979 as U.K. Patent No. GB2022406. Yet another U.K. Patent No. GB2241434 was issued to Chan on Sep. 4, 1991. Another was issued to Assmann on Apr. 18, 1996 as German Patent No. DE4437703.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Inventor: Richard Djenner</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Issued: Jan. 30, 1968</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A hair drier having a handle in which is placed an electrical resistance, comprising a rotor which is mounted and placed in such a way that implements placed upon the rotor can be turned independent of the position of the hand, said rotor or handle being provided with openings for a cold stream of air, said arrangement being such that a mantle of cold air is formed around the implement, e.g., a curler, said stream of air being provided from a blower which preferably is connected to the handle by means of a flexible tube.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Issued: Oct. 12, 1971</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A power-driven hand-held hair curler having provision for selectively supporting both hot and cold types of curler rolls and operable to roll hair thereonto in either direction at the user's option. The accessory includes a support stand for the curler itself and provision for storing the curler rolls in readiness for use as well as a battery recharger.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">U.S. Pat. No. 4,222,398</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Inventor: Arthur R. A. Fromman</heading>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Issued: Sep. 16, 1980</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An electrically powered device for curling hair including a power element containing handle housing portion and an angularly disposed, rotatable chucking device and spindle with a removable hair curler associated in driven relationship therewith. Make and break connections between the rotatable elements and the actuating means are made by the application of hand or finger pressure to the end of the curler, the end of the spindle or to conveniently located switches.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Inventor: Richard E. Plaisted</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Issued: May 19, 1981</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A hair curling device including a heatable rod having a plurality of longitudinal channels. A non-conductive roller having a cage-like body is provided with a plurality of mating strips or bars. When the roller is slidably mounted on the rod, a sufficient heated surface area of the rod remains exposed for applying heat directly to a wound tress. The rod may be removed from the formed curl leaving the roller to support the hair while it cools to operate as a hair setter. If the rod remains mated to the roller and left in the hair while the hair cools, the device operates as a curling iron or styling wand.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,479</heading>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Inventor: John W. McClean</heading>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Issued: Aug. 11, 1987</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A device for heating hair curling rollers consisting of an attachment for a hair dryer of the small portable type which is frictionally attached to the barrel of the hair dryer so that heated air from the dryer passes through the attachment. The attachment is arranged to support a number of hair curling rollers of a conventional type and to direct air from the hair dryer into and around the rollers to heat them to a working temperature. The usual heat indicating spot provided on each roller may be applied to the exterior of the attachment. As an adjunct to the attachment an adaptor is provided to enable the attachment to be attached to hair dryers having barrels of different external diameters. A fan is preferably included in the attachment to assist in even distribution of heated air over the hair curling rollers.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A hand-held electric curling iron has a hollow elongated barrel selectively insertable sequentially into one of a plurality of different diameter cylindrical hair rollers during the process of curling hair. The barrel communicates with an electric heater-blower assembly in the curling iron handle and has a plurality of apertures along its length for delivering a stream of heated air radially outwardly into the interior of the roller for heating the hair wound thereon. Each roller is provided at its ends with projecting collars for receiving and locating the barrel within the roller with a circumferential gap between the perforated portion of the roller and the barrel. The collars have circumferential apertures which cooperate with a retaining clip on the handle for securing the roller in place during use. While the external diameter of each roller is different for making different size curls, the collars of all the rollers have the same internal diameter so that the same curling iron can be used to heat the different diameter rollers.</p>
