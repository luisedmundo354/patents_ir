<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the field of maize breeding, specifically relating to an inbred maize line designated PHAKC.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The goal of plant breeding is to combine, in a single variety or hybrid, various desirable traits. For field crops, these traits may include resistance to diseases and insects, tolerance to heat and drought, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield, and better agronomic quality. With mechanical harvesting of many crops, uniformity of plant characteristics such as germination, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, plant height and ear height, is important. Traditional plant breeding is an important tool in developing new and improved commercial crops.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the invention, there is provided a novel inbred maize line, designated PHAKC and processes for making PHAKC. This invention relates to seed of inbred maize line PHAKC, to the plants of inbred maize line PHAKC, to plant parts of inbred maize line PHAKC, and to processes for making a maize plant that comprise crossing inbred maize line PHAKC with another maize plant. This invention also relates to processes for making a maize plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into PHAKC through backcross conversion and/or transformation, and to the maize seed, plant and plant part produced by such introgression. This invention further relates to a hybrid maize seed, plant or plant part produced by crossing the inbred line PHAKC or an introgressed trait conversion of PHAKC with another maize line. This invention also relates to inbred maize lines derived from inbred maize line PHAKC, to processes for making other inbred maize lines derived from inbred maize line PHAKC and to the inbred maize lines and their parts derived by the use of those processes.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain definitions used in the specification are provided below. Also in the examples that follow, a number of terms are used herein. In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided. NOTE: ABS is in absolute terms and % MN is percent of the mean for the experiments in which the inbred or hybrid was grown. PCT designates that the trait is calculated as a percentage. % NOT designates the percentage of plants that did not exhibit a trait. For example, STKLDG % NOT is the percentage of plants in a plot that were not stalk lodged. These designators will follow the descriptors to denote how the values are to be interpreted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">ABTSTK=ARTIFICIAL BRITTLE STALK. A count of the number of “snapped” plants per plot following machine snapping. A snapped plant has its stalk completely snapped at a node between the base of the plant and the node above the ear. Expressed as percent of plants that did not snap.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">ALLELE. Any of one or more alternative forms of a genetic sequence. Typically, in a diploid cell or organism, the two alleles of a given sequence typically occupy corresponding loci on a pair of homologous chromosomes.</p>

Percent similarity is determined by comparing a statistically significant number of loci and recording the number of loci with similar alleles as a percentage. For example, a percent similarity of 90% between inbred PHAKC and a hybrid maize plant means that the inbred line matches at least one of the hybrid alleles at 90% of the loci.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND FURTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">All tables discussed in the Detailed Description of the Invention and Further Embodiments section can found at the end of the section.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Morphological and Physiological Characteristics of PHAKC</heading>
<p id="p-0118" num="0128">Inbred maize line PHAKC is a yellow, dent maize inbred with some flint characteristics that may be used as either a male or female in the production of the first generation F1 maize hybrids although PHAKC may be best suited for use as a female. Inbred maize line PHAKC is best adapted to the Central Corn Belt, Northcentral, Southwest, and Western United States and in Continental and Mediterranean Europe, and can be used to produce hybrids with approximately 108 maturity based on the Comparative Relative Maturity Rating System for harvest moisture of grain. Inbred maize line PHAKC demonstrates good female yield, good grain quality, and good plant health as an inbred per se. In hybrid combination, inbred PHAKC demonstrates very good yield for maturity, wide area of adaptation, good stalk strength, good root strength, and good grain quality.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0129">The inbred has shown uniformity and stability within the limits of environmental influence for all the traits as described in the Variety Description Information (Table 1, found at the end of the section). The inbred has been self-pollinated and ear-rowed a sufficient number of generations with careful attention paid to uniformity of plant type to ensure the homozygosity and phenotypic stability necessary for use in commercial hybrid seed production. The line has been increased both by hand and in isolated fields with continued observation for uniformity. No variant traits have been observed or are expected in PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0130">Inbred maize line PHAKC, being substantially homozygous, can be reproduced by planting seeds of the line, growing the resulting maize plants under self-pollinating or sib-pollinating conditions with adequate isolation, and harvesting the resulting seed using techniques familiar to the agricultural arts.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Genotypic Characteristics of PHAKC</heading>
<p id="p-0121" num="0131">In addition to phenotypic observations, a plant can also be identified by its genotype. The genotype of a plant can be characterized through a genetic marker profile, which can identify plants of the same variety or a related variety, or be used to determine or validate a pedigree. The SSR profile of Inbred PHAKC can be found in Table 2 at the end of this section.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0132">As a result of inbreeding, PHAKC is substantially homozygous. This homozygosity has been characterized at the loci shown in the marker profile provided herein. An F1 hybrid made with PHAKC would comprise the marker profile of PHAKC shown herein. This is because an F1 hybrid is the sum of its inbred parents, e.g., if one inbred parent is homozygous for allele x at a particular locus, and the other inbred parent is homozygous for allele y at that locus, the F1 hybrid will be x.y (heterozygous) at that locus. The profile can therefore be used to identify hybrids comprising PHAKC as a parent, since such hybrids will comprise two sets of alleles, one set of which will be from PHAKC. The determination of the male set of alleles and the female set of alleles may be made by profiling the hybrid and the pericarp of the hybrid seed, which is composed of maternal parent cells. The paternal parent profile is obtained by subtracting the pericarp profile from the hybrid profile.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0133">Subsequent generations of progeny produced by selection and breeding are expected to be of genotype x (homozygous), y (homozygous), or x.y (heterozygous) for these locus positions. When the F1 plant is used to produce an inbred, the resulting inbred should be either x or y for that allele. In that regard, a unique allele or combination of alleles unique to that inbred can be used to identify progeny plants that retain those unique alleles or combinations of alleles.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0134">Therefore, in accordance with the above, an embodiment of this invention is a PHAKC progeny maize plant or plant part that is a first generation hybrid maize plant comprising two sets of alleles, wherein one set of the alleles is the same as PHAKC at all of the SSR loci listed in Table 2. A maize cell wherein one set of the alleles is the same as PHAKC at all of the SSR loci listed in Table 2 is also an embodiment of the invention. This maize cell may be a part of a hybrid seed produced by crossing PHAKC with another inbred maize plant.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0135">Genetic marker profiles can be obtained by techniques such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites, and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). For example, see Berry, Don, et al., “Assessing Probability of Ancestry Using Simple Sequence Repeat Profiles: Applications to Maize Hybrids and Inbreds”, Genetics, 2002, 161:813-824, and Berry, Don, et al., “Assessing Probability of Ancestry Using Simple Sequence Repeat Profiles: Applications to Maize Inbred Lines and Soybean Varieties”, Genetics, 2003, 165: 331-342, which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0136">Particular markers used for these purposes are not limited to the set of markers disclosed herein, but may include any type of marker and marker profile which provides a means of distinguishing varieties. In addition to being used for identification of Inbred Line PHAKC, a hybrid produced through the use of PHAKC, and the identification or verification of pedigree for progeny plants produced through the use of PHAKC, the genetic marker profile is also useful in further breeding and in developing an introgressed trait conversion of PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0137">Means of performing genetic marker profiles using SSR polymorphisms are well known in the art. SSRs are genetic markers based on polymorphisms in repeated nucleotide sequences, such as microsatellites. A marker system based on SSRs can be highly informative in linkage analysis relative to other marker systems in that multiple alleles may be present. Another advantage of this type of marker is that, through use of flanking primers, detection of SSRs can be achieved, for example, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive Southern hybridization. The PCR detection is done by use of two oligonucleotide primers flanking the polymorphic segment of repetitive DNA. Repeated cycles of heat denaturation of the DNA followed by annealing of the primers to their complementary sequences at low temperatures, and extension of the annealed primers with DNA polymerase, comprise the major part of the methodology.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0138">Following amplification, markers can be scored by electrophoresis of the amplification products. Scoring of marker genotype is based on the size of the amplified fragment, which may be measured by the base pair weight or molecular weight of the fragment. While variation in the primer used or in laboratory procedures can affect the reported fragment size, relative values should remain constant regardless of the specific primer or laboratory used. When comparing lines it is preferable if all SSR profiles are performed in the same lab. The SSR analyses reported herein were conducted in-house at Pioneer Hi-Bred. An SSR service is available to the public on a contractual basis by DNA Landmarks in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada (formerly Paragen, Celera AgGen, Perkin-Elmer AgGen, Linkage Genetics and NPI).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0139">Primers used for the SSRs reported herein are publicly available and may be found in the Maize GDB on the World Wide Web at maizegdb.org (sponsored by the USDA Agricultural Research Service), in Sharopova et al. (Plant Mol. Biol. 48(5-6):463-481), Lee et al (Plant Mol. Biol. 48(5-6); 453-461), or may be constructed from sequences if reported herein. Primers may be constructed from publicly available sequence information. Some marker information may also be available from DNA Landmarks.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0140">Map information is provided by bin number as reported in the Maize GDB for the IBM 2 and/or IBM 2 Neighbors maps. The bin number digits to the left of decimal point represent the chromosome on which such marker is located, and the digits to the right of the decimal represent the location on such chromosome.

<p id="p-0131" num="0141">PHAKC and its plant parts can be identified through molecular marker profile. An inbred corn plant cell having the SSR genetic marker profile shown in Table 2 is an embodiment of the invention. Such cell may be either diploid or haploid.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0142">Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are plants and plant parts substantially benefiting from the use of PHAKC in their development, such as PHAKC comprising a introgressed trait through backcross conversion or transformation, and which may be identified by having an SSR molecular marker profile with a high percent identity to PHAKC, such as at least 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% identity. Likewise, percent similarity at these percentages may be used to identify hybrid and other non-inbred plants produced by the use of PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0143">An embodiment of this invention is an inbred PHAKC progeny maize plant or plant part comprising the same homozygous alleles as the plant or plant part of PHAKC for at least 90% of the SSR loci listed in Table 2. A plant cell comprising the same homozygous alleles as a plant cell of PHAKC for at least 90% of the SSR loci listed in Table 2 is also an embodiment of this invention. In these specific embodiments, 90% may also be replaced by any integer or partial integer percent of 80% or greater as listed above. One means of producing such a progeny plant, plant part or cell is through the backcrossing and/or transformation methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0144">Similarly, an embodiment of this invention is a PHAKC progeny maize plant or plant part comprising at least one allele per locus that is the same allele as the plant or plant part of PHAKC for at least 90% of the SSR loci listed in Table 2. This progeny plant may be a hybrid. A progeny or hybrid plant cell wherein at least one allele per locus that is the same allele as the plant cell PHAKC for at least 90% of the SSR loci listed in Table 2 is also a specific embodiment of this invention. In these specific embodiments, 90% may also be replaced by any integer percent listed above. One means of producing such a progeny or hybrid plant, plant part or cell is through the backcrossing and/or transformation methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0145">In addition, the SSR profile of PHAKC also can be used to identify essentially derived varieties and other progeny lines developed from the use of PHAKC, as well as cells and other plant parts thereof. Progeny plants and plant parts produced using PHAKC may be identified by having a molecular marker profile of at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 99.5% genetic contribution from inbred line PHAKC, as measured by either percent identity or percent similarity.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Comparing PHAKC to Other Inbreds</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0146">A breeder uses various methods to help determine which plants should be selected from segregating populations and ultimately which inbred lines will be used to develop hybrids for commercialization. In addition to knowledge of the germplasm and plant genetics, a part of the selection process is dependent on experimental design coupled with the use of statistical analysis. Experimental design and statistical analysis are used to help determine which plants, which family of plants, and finally which inbred lines and hybrid combinations are significantly better or different for one or more traits of interest. Experimental design methods are used to assess error so that differences between two inbred lines or two hybrid lines can be more accurately evaluated. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of mean values, determination of the statistical significance of the sources of variation, and the calculation of the appropriate variance components. Either a five or a one percent significance level is customarily used to determine whether a difference that occurs for a given trait is real or due to the environment or experimental error. One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would know how to evaluate the traits of two plant varieties to determine if there is no significant difference between the two traits expressed by those varieties. For example, see Fehr, Walt, Principles of Cultivar Development, p. 261-286 (1987) which is incorporated herein by reference. Mean trait values may be used to determine whether trait differences are significant. Trait values should preferably be measured on plants grown under the same environmental conditions, and environmental conditions should be appropriate for the traits or traits being evaluated. Sufficient selection pressure should be present for optimum measurement of traits of interest such as herbicide, insect or disease resistance. Similarly, an introgressed trait conversion of PHAKC for resistance, such as herbicide resistance, should not be compared to PHAKC in the presence of the herbicide when comparing non-resistance related traits such as plant height and yield.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0147">In Table 3, data from traits and characteristics of inbred maize line PHAKC per se are given and compared to other maize inbred lines and hybrids. The following are the results of these comparisons:</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0148">The results in Table 3A compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PH1W2. The results show inbred PHAKC has significantly higher number of growing degree units required to achieve 50% pollen shed, ear height and taller plant height compared to PH1W2.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0149">The results in Table 3B compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PH79A. The results show inbred PHAKC has a significantly larger plant height and a smaller tassel size when compared to inbred PH79A.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0150">The results in Table 3C compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PHKV0. The results show inbred PHAKC differs significantly from PHKV0 in a number of traits including the number of growing degree units required to achieve 50% pollen shed and plant height.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0151">The results in Table 3D compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PH4GP. The results show inbred PHAKC differs significantly from PH4GP in a number of traits including yield, early growth and pollen weight.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0152">The results in Table 3E compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PH7CH. The results show inbred PHAKC differs significantly from PH7CH in a number of traits including plant height and ear height.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0153">The results in Table 3F compare inbred PHAKC to inbred PH05F. The results show inbred PHAKC differs significantly from PH05F in a number of traits including yield, test weight and ear height.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Development of Maize Hybrids Using PHAKC</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0154">A single cross maize hybrid results from the cross of two inbred lines, each of which has a genotype that complements the genotype of the other. The hybrid progeny of the first generation is designated F1. In the development of commercial hybrids in a maize plant breeding program, only the F1 hybrid plants are sought. F1 hybrids are more vigorous than their inbred parents. This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, can be manifested in many polygenic traits, including increased vegetative growth and increased yield.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0155">PHAKC may be used to produce hybrid maize. One such embodiment is the method of crossing inbred maize line PHAKC with another maize plant, such as a different maize inbred line, to form a first generation F1 hybrid seed. The first generation F1 hybrid seed, plant and plant part produced by this method is an embodiment of the invention. The first generation F1 seed, plant and plant part will comprise an essentially complete set of the alleles of inbred line PHAKC. One of ordinary skill in the art can utilize either breeder books or molecular methods to identify a particular F1 hybrid plant produced using inbred line PHAKC. Further, one of ordinary skill in the art may also produce F1 hybrids with transgenic, male sterile and/or backcross conversions of inbred line PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0156">The development of a maize hybrid in a maize plant breeding program involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; (2) the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, such as PHAKC, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred lines with different inbred lines to produce the hybrids. During the inbreeding process in maize, the vigor of the lines decreases, and so one would not be likely to use PHAKC directly to produce grain. However, vigor is restored when PHAKC is crossed to a different inbred line to produce a commercial F1 hybrid. An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred line is that the hybrid between a defined pair of inbreds may be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0157">PHAKC may be used to produce a single cross hybrid, a three-way hybrid or a double cross hybrid. A single cross hybrid is produced when two inbred lines are crossed to produce the F1 progeny. A double cross hybrid is produced from four inbred lines crossed in pairs (A×B and C×D) and then the two F1 hybrids are crossed again (A×B)×(C×D). A three-way cross hybrid is produced from three inbred lines where two of the inbred lines are crossed (A×B) and then the resulting F1 hybrid is crossed with the third inbred (A×B)×C. In each case, pericarp tissue from the female parent will be a part of and protect the hybrid seed.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Combining Ability of PHAKC</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0158">Combining ability of a line, as well as the performance of the line per se, is a factor in the selection of improved maize inbreds. Combining ability refers to a line's contribution as a parent when crossed with other lines to form hybrids. The hybrids formed for the purpose of selecting superior lines may be referred to as test crosses, and include comparisons to other hybrid varieties grown in the same environment (same cross, location and time of planting). One way of measuring combining ability is by using values based in part on the overall mean of a number of test crosses weighted by number of experiment and location combinations in which the hybrid combinations occurs. The mean may be adjusted to remove environmental effects and known genetic relationships among the lines.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0159">General combining ability provides an overall score for the inbred over a large number of test crosses. Specific combining ability provides information on hybrid combinations formed by PHAKC and a specific inbred parent. A line such as PHAKC which exhibits good general combining ability may be used in a large number of hybrid combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0160">A general combining ability report for inbred PHAKC is provided in Table 4. This data represents the overall mean value for these traits over a large number of test crosses. Table 4 demonstrates that inbred PHAKC shows good general combining ability for hybrid production.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Hybrid Comparisons</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0161">These hybrid comparisons represent specific hybrid crosses with PHAKC and a comparison of these specific hybrids with other hybrids with favorable characteristics. These comparisons illustrate the good specific combining ability of PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0162">The results in Table 5A compare a specific hybrid for which inbred PHAKC is a parent and a second hybrid, 35Y54. The results show that the hybrid containing inbred PHAKC produced significantly different results over multiple traits including increased yield and plant height.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0163">The results in Table 5B compare a specific hybrid for which inbred PHAKC is a parent and a second hybrid, 35P12. The results show that the hybrid containing inbred PHAKC produced significantly different results over multiple traits including increased yield and increased resistance to <i>Gibberella </i>ear rot.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Introgression of a New Locus or Trait into PHAKC</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0164">PHAKC represents a new base genetic line into which a new locus or trait may be introgressed. Direct transformation and backcrossing represent two important methods that can be used to accomplish such an introgression. The term backcross conversion and single locus conversion are used interchangeably to designate the product of a backcrossing program.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Backcross Conversions of PHAKC</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0165">A backcross conversion of PHAKC occurs when DNA sequences are introduced through backcrossing (Hallauer et al, 1988), with PHAKC utilized as the recurrent parent. Both naturally occurring and transgenic DNA sequences may be introduced through backcrossing techniques. A backcross conversion may produce a plant with a trait or locus conversion in at least one or more backcrosses, including at least 2 crosses, at least 3 crosses, at least 4 crosses, at least 5 crosses and the like. Molecular marker assisted breeding or selection may be utilized to reduce the number of backcrosses necessary to achieve the backcross conversion. For example, see Openshaw, S. J. et al., Marker-assisted Selection in Backcross Breeding. In: Proceedings Symposium of the Analysis of Molecular Data, August 1994, Crop Science Society of America, Corvallis, Oreg., where it is demonstrated that a backcross conversion can be made in as few as two backcrosses.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0166">The complexity of the backcross conversion method depends on the type of trait being transferred (single genes or closely linked genes as vs. unlinked genes), the level of expression of the trait, the type of inheritance (cytoplasmic or nuclear) and the types of parents included in the cross. It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that for single gene traits that are relatively easy to classify, the backcross method is effective and relatively easy to manage. (See Hallauer et al. in Corn and Corn Improvement, Sprague and Dudley, Third Ed. 1998). Desired traits that may be transferred through backcross conversion include, but are not limited to, waxy starch, sterility (nuclear and cytoplasmic), fertility restoration, grain color (white), nutritional enhancements, drought tolerance, nitrogen utilization, altered fatty acid profile, increased digestibility, low phytate, industrial enhancements, disease resistance (bacterial, fungal or viral), insect resistance, herbicide resistance and yield enhancements. In addition, an introgression site itself, such as an FRT site, Lox site or other site specific integration site, may be inserted by backcrossing and utilized for direct insertion of one or more genes of interest into a specific plant variety. In some embodiments of the invention, the number of loci that may be backcrossed into PHAKC is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 and/or no more than 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. A single loci may contain several transgenes, such as a transgene for disease resistance that, in the same expression vector, also contains a transgene for herbicide resistance. The gene for herbicide resistance may be used as a selectable marker and/or as a phenotypic trait. A single locus conversion of site specific integration system allows for the integration of multiple genes at the converted loci.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0167">The backcross conversion may result from either the transfer of a dominant allele or a recessive allele. Selection of progeny containing the trait of interest is accomplished by direct selection for a trait associated with a dominant allele. Transgenes transferred via backcrossing typically function as a dominant single gene trait and are relatively easy to classify. Selection of progeny for a trait that is transferred via a recessive allele, such as the waxy starch characteristic, requires growing and selfing the first backcross generation to determine which plants carry the recessive alleles. Recessive traits may require additional progeny testing in successive backcross generations to determine the presence of the locus of interest. The last backcross generation is usually selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred, although a backcross conversion with a stably introgressed trait may also be maintained by further backcrossing to the recurrent parent with selection for the converted trait.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0168">Along with selection for the trait of interest, progeny are selected for the phenotype of the recurrent parent. While occasionally additional polynucleotide sequences or genes may be transferred along with the backcross conversion, the backcross conversion line “fits into the same hybrid combination as the recurrent parent inbred line and contributes the effect of the additional gene added through the backcross.” Poehlman et al. (1995, page 334). It has been proposed that in general there should be at least four backcrosses when it is important that the recovered lines be essentially identical to the recurrent parent except for the characteristic being transferred (Fehr 1987, Principles of Cultivar Development). However, as noted above, the number of backcrosses necessary can be reduced with the use of molecular markers. Other factors, such as a genetically similar donor parent, may also reduce the number of backcrosses necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0169">One process for adding or modifying a trait or locus in maize inbred line PHAKC comprises crossing PHAKC plants grown from PHAKC seed with plants of another maize line that comprise the desired trait or locus, selecting F1 progeny plants that comprise the desired trait or locus to produce selected F1 progeny plants, crossing the selected progeny plants with the PHAKC plants to produce backcross progeny plants, selecting for backcross progeny plants that have the desired trait or locus and the morphological characteristics of maize inbred line PHAKC to produce selected backcross progeny plants; and backcrossing to PHAKC three or more times in succession to produce selected fourth or higher backcross progeny plants that comprise said trait or locus. The modified PHAKC may be further characterized as having the physiological and morphological characteristics of maize inbred line PHAKC listed in Table 1 as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions and/or may be characterized by percent similarity or identity to PHAKC as determined by SSR markers. The above method may be utilized with fewer backcrosses in appropriate situations, such as when the donor parent is highly related or markers are used in the selection step. Desired traits that may be used include those nucleic acids known in the art, some of which are listed herein, that will affect traits through nucleic acid expression or inhibition. Desired loci include the introgression of FRT, Lox and other sites for site specific integration, which may also affect a desired trait if a functional nucleic acid is inserted at the integration site.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0170">In addition, the above process and other similar processes described herein may be used to produce F1 hybrid maize seed by adding a step at the end of the process that comprises crossing PHAKC with the introgressed trait or locus with a different maize plant and harvesting the resultant F1 hybrid maize seed.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Male Sterility and Hybrid Seed Production</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0171">Hybrid seed production requires elimination or inactivation of pollen produced by the female inbred parent. Incomplete removal or inactivation of the pollen provides the potential for self-pollination. A reliable method of controlling male fertility in plants offers the opportunity for improved seed production.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0172">PHAKC can be produced in a male-sterile form. There are several ways in which a maize plant can be manipulated so that it is male sterile. These include use of manual or mechanical emasculation (or detasseling), use of one or more genetic factors that confer male sterility, including cytoplasmic genetic and/or nuclear genetic male sterility, use of gametocides and the like. A male sterile inbred designated PHAKC may include one or more genetic factors, which result in cytoplasmic genetic and/or nuclear genetic male sterility. All of such embodiments are within the scope of the present claims. The male sterility may be either partial or complete male sterility.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0173">Hybrid maize seed is often produced by a male sterility system incorporating manual or mechanical detasseling. Alternate strips of two maize inbreds are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (female). Provided that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign maize pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred will be fertilized only from the other inbred (male), and the resulting seed is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0174">The laborious detasseling process can be avoided by using cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) inbreds. Plants of a CMS inbred are male sterile as a result of genetic factors in the cytoplasm, as opposed to the nucleus, and so nuclear linked genes are not transferred during backcrossing. Thus, this characteristic is inherited exclusively through the female parent in maize plants, since only the female provides cytoplasm to the fertilized seed. CMS plants are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile. Pollen from the second inbred may or may not contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile, and either option may be preferred depending on the intended use of the hybrid. The same hybrid seed, a portion produced from detasseled fertile maize and a portion produced using the CMS system, can be blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown. CMS systems have been successfully used since the 1950's, and the male sterility trait is routinely backcrossed into inbred lines. See Wych, p. 585-586, 1998.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0175">There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar et al. and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511. In addition to these methods, Albertsen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describe a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not “on” resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning “on”, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0176">These, and the other methods of conferring genetic male sterility in the art, each possess their own benefits and drawbacks. Some other methods use a variety of approaches such as delivering into the plant a gene encoding a cytotoxic substance associated with a male tissue specific promoter or an antisense system in which a gene critical to fertility is identified and an antisense to that gene is inserted in the plant (see: Fabinjanski, et al. EPO 89/3010153.8 publication no. 329,308 and PCT application PCT/CA90/00037 published as WO 90/08828).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0177">Another system for controlling male sterility makes use of gametocides. Gametocides are not a genetic system, but rather a topical application of chemicals. These chemicals affect cells that are critical to male fertility. The application of these chemicals affects fertility in the plants only for the growing season in which the gametocide is applied (see Carlson, Glenn R., U.S. Pat. No.: 4,936,904). Application of the gametocide, timing of the application and genotype specificity often limit the usefulness of the approach and it is not appropriate in all situations.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0178">Incomplete control over male fertility may result in self-pollinated seed being unintentionally harvested and packaged with hybrid seed. This would typically be only female parent seed, because the male plant is grown in rows that are typically destroyed prior to seed development. Once the seed from the hybrid bag is planted, it is possible to identify and select these self-pollinated plants. These self-pollinated plants will be genetically equivalent to one of the inbred lines used to produce the hybrid. Though the possibility of inbred PHAKC being included in a hybrid seed bag exists, the occurrence is very low because much care is taken by seed companies to avoid such inclusions. It is worth noting that hybrid seed is sold to growers for the production of grain or forage and not for breeding or seed production. These self-pollinated plants can be identified and selected by one skilled in the art due to their less vigorous appearance for vegetative and/or reproductive characteristics, including shorter plant height, small ear size, ear and kernel shape, cob color, or other characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0179">Identification of these self-pollinated lines can also be accomplished through molecular marker analyses. See, “The Identification of Female Selfs in Hybrid Maize: A Comparison Using Electrophoresis and Morphology”, Smith, J. S. C. and Wych, R. D., Seed Science and Technology 14, pp. 1-8 (1995), the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Through these technologies, the homozygosity of the self pollinated line can be verified by analyzing allelic composition at various loci along the genome. Those methods allow for rapid identification of the invention disclosed herein. See also, “Identification of Atypical Plants in Hybrid Maize Seed by Postcontrol and Electrophoresis” Sarca, V. et al., Probleme de Genetica Teoritica si Aplicata Vol. 20 (1) p. 29-42.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0180">An embodiment of this invention is a process for producing seed of PHAKC, comprising planting a collection of seed comprising seed of a hybrid, one of whose parents is inbred PHAKC, said collection also comprising seed of said inbred, growing plants from said collection of seed, identifying inbred parent plants, selecting said inbred parent plant; and controlling pollination to preserve the homozygosity of said inbred parent plant.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Transformation</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0181">The advent of new molecular biological techniques has allowed the isolation and characterization of genetic elements with specific functions, such as encoding specific protein products. Scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genetic elements, or additional, or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Any DNA sequences, whether from a different species or from the same species, that are inserted into the genome using transformation are referred to herein collectively as “transgenes”. In some embodiments of the invention, a transformed variant of PHAKC may contain at least one transgene but could contain at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and/or no more than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present invention also relates to transformed versions of the claimed inbred maize line PHAKC as well as hybrid combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0182">Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants” in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88 and Armstrong, “The First Decade of Maize Transformation: A Review and Future Perspective” (Maydica 44:101-109, 1999). In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in <i>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</i>, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0183">The most prevalent types of plant transformation involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0184">A genetic trait which has been engineered into the genome of a particular maize plant using transformation techniques, could be moved into the genome of another line using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach is commonly used to move a transgene from a transformed maize plant to an elite inbred line, and the resulting progeny would then comprise the transgene(s). Also, if an inbred line was used for the transformation then the transgenic plants could be crossed to a different inbred in order to produce a transgenic hybrid maize plant.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0185">Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include, but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. For example, see the traits, genes and transformation methods listed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,055.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0186">With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants that are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>114: 92-6 (1981).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0187">A genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) that identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule. For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0188">Wang et al. discuss “Large Scale Identification, Mapping and Genotyping of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Human Genome”, Science, 280:1077-1082, 1998, and similar capabilities are becoming increasingly available for the corn genome. Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques. SNPs may also be used alone or in combination with other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0189">Likewise, by means of the present invention, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Through the transformation of maize the expression of genes can be modulated to enhance disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide resistance, agronomic, grain quality and other traits. Transformation can also be used to insert DNA sequences which control or help control male-sterility. DNA sequences native to maize as well as non-native DNA sequences can be transformed into maize and used to modulate levels of native or non-native proteins. Various promoters, targeting sequences, enhancing sequences, and other DNA sequences can be inserted into the maize genome for the purpose of modulating the expression of proteins. Reduction of the activity of specific genes (also known as gene silencing, or gene suppression) is desirable for several aspects of genetic engineering in plants.</p>

Plant defenses are often activated by specific interaction between the product of a disease resistance gene (R) in the plant and the product of a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen. A plant variety can be transformed with cloned resistance gene to engineer plants that are resistant to specific pathogen strains. See, for example Jones et al., Science 266: 789 (1994) (cloning of the tomato Cf-9 gene for resistance to <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i>); Martin et al., Science 262: 1432 (1993) (tomato Pto gene for resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae </i>pv. tomato encodes a protein kinase); Mindrinos et al., Cell 78: 1089 (1994) (<i>Arabidopsis </i>RSP2 gene for resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>). A plant resistant to a disease is one that is more resistant to a pathogen as compared to the wild type plant.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0193">(B) A <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>protein, a derivative thereof or a synthetic polypeptide modeled thereon. See, for example, Geiser et al., <i>Gene </i>48: 109 (1986), who disclose the cloning and nucleotide sequence of a Bt delta-endotoxin gene. Moreover, DNA molecules encoding delta-endotoxin genes can be purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.), for example, under ATCC Accession Nos. 40098, 67136, 31995 and 31998.

Using PHAKC to Develop Other Maize Inbreds
</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0232">Inbred maize lines such as PHAKC are typically developed for use in the production of hybrid maize lines. However, inbred lines such as PHAKC also provide a source of breeding material that may be used to develop new maize inbred lines. Plant breeding techniques known in the art and used in a maize plant breeding program include, but are not limited to, recurrent selection, mass selection, bulk selection, mass selection, backcrossing, pedigree breeding, open pollination breeding, restriction fragment length polymorphism enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection, making double haploids, and transformation. Often combinations of these techniques are used. The development of maize hybrids in a maize plant breeding program requires, in general, the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses. There are many analytical methods available to evaluate the result of a cross. The oldest and most traditional method of analysis is the observation of phenotypic traits but genotypic analysis may also be used.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Using PHAKC in a Breeding Program</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0233">This invention is directed to methods for producing a maize plant by crossing a first parent maize plant with a second parent maize plant wherein either the first or second parent maize plant is an inbred maize plant of the line PHAKC. The other parent may be any other maize plant, such as another inbred line or a plant that is part of a synthetic or natural population. Any such methods using the inbred maize line PHAKC are part of this invention: selfing, sibbing, backcrosses, mass selection, pedigree breeding, bulk selection, hybrid production, crosses to populations, and the like. These methods are well known in the art and some of the more commonly used breeding methods are described below. Descriptions of breeding methods can also be found in one of several reference books (e.g., Allard, <i>Principles of Plant Breeding, </i>1960; Simmonds, <i>Principles of Crop Improvement, </i>1979; Fehr, “Breeding Methods for Cultivar Development”, <i>Production and Uses, </i>2<sup>nd </sup>ed., Wilcox editor, 1987).</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Pedigree Breeding</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0234">Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, such as PHAKC and one other elite inbred line having one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking or which complements PHAKC. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population. In the pedigree method, superior plants are selfed and selected in successive filial generations. In the succeeding filial generations the heterozygous condition gives way to homogeneous lines as a result of self-pollination and selection. Typically in the pedigree method of breeding, five or more successive filial generations of selfing and selection is practiced: F1→F2; F2→F3; F3→F4; F4→F<sub>5</sub>, etc. After a sufficient amount of inbreeding, successive filial generations will serve to increase seed of the developed inbred. Preferably, the inbred line comprises homozygous alleles at about 95% or more of its loci.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0235">In addition to being used to create a backcross conversion, backcrossing can also be used in combination with pedigree breeding to modify PHAKC and a hybrid that is made using the modified PHAKC. As discussed previously, backcrossing can be used to transfer one or more specifically desirable traits from one line, the donor parent, to an inbred called the recurrent parent, which has overall good agronomic characteristics yet lacks that desirable trait or traits. However, the same procedure can be used to move the progeny toward the genotype of the recurrent parent but at the same time retain many components of the non-recurrent parent by stopping the backcrossing at an early stage and proceeding with selfing and selection. For example, an F1, such as a commercial hybrid, is created. This commercial hybrid may be backcrossed to one of its parent lines to create a BC1 or BC2. Progeny are selfed and selected so that the newly developed inbred has many of the attributes of the recurrent parent and yet several of the desired attributes of the non-recurrent parent. This approach leverages the value and strengths of the recurrent parent for use in new hybrids and breeding.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0236">Therefore, an embodiment of this invention is a method of making a backcross conversion of maize inbred line PHAKC, comprising the steps of crossing a plant of maize inbred line PHAKC with a donor plant comprising a mutant gene or transgene conferring a desired trait, selecting an F1 progeny plant comprising the mutant gene or transgene conferring the desired trait, and backcrossing the selected F1 progeny plant to a plant of maize inbred line PHAKC. This method may further comprise the step of obtaining a molecular marker profile of maize inbred line PHAKC and using the molecular marker profile to select for a progeny plant with the desired trait and the molecular marker profile of PHAKC. In the same manner, this method may be used to produce an F1 hybrid seed by adding a final step of crossing the desired trait conversion of maize inbred line PHAKC with a different maize plant to make F1 hybrid maize seed comprising a mutant gene or transgene conferring the desired trait.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Recurrent Selection and Mass Selection</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0237">Recurrent selection is a method used in a plant breeding program to improve a population of plants. PHAKC is suitable for use in a recurrent selection program. The method entails individual plants cross pollinating with each other to form progeny. The progeny are grown and the superior progeny selected by any number of selection methods, which include individual plant, half-sib progeny, full-sib progeny, selfed progeny and topcrossing. The selected progeny are cross pollinated with each other to form progeny for another population. This population is planted and again superior plants are selected to cross pollinate with each other. Recurrent selection is a cyclical process and therefore can be repeated as many times as desired. The objective of recurrent selection is to improve the traits of a population. The improved population can then be used as a source of breeding material to obtain inbred lines to be used in hybrids or used as parents for a synthetic cultivar. A synthetic cultivar is the resultant progeny formed by the intercrossing of several selected inbreds.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0238">Mass selection is a useful technique when used in conjunction with molecular marker enhanced selection. In mass selection seeds from individuals are selected based on phenotype and/or genotype. These selected seeds are then bulked and used to grow the next generation. Bulk selection requires growing a population of plants in a bulk plot, allowing the plants to self-pollinate, harvesting the seed in bulk and then using a sample of the seed harvested in bulk to plant the next generation. Instead of self pollination, directed pollination could be used as part of the breeding program.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Mutation Breeding</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0239">Mutation breeding is one of many methods that could be used to introduce new traits into PHAKC. Mutations that occur spontaneously or are artificially induced can be useful sources of variability for a plant breeder. The goal of artificial mutagenesis is to increase the rate of mutation for a desired characteristic. Mutation rates can be increased by many different means including temperature, long-term seed storage, tissue culture conditions, radiation; such as X-rays, Gamma rays (e.g. cobalt 60 or cesium 137), neutrons, (product of nuclear fission by uranium 235 in an atomic reactor), Beta radiation (emitted from radioisotopes such as phosphorus 32 or carbon 14), or ultraviolet radiation (preferably from 2500 to 2900 nm), or chemical mutagens (such as base analogues (5-bromo-uracil), related compounds (8-ethoxy caffeine), antibiotics (streptonigrin), alkylating agents (sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, epoxides, ethylenamines, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfones, lactones), azide, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, or acridines. Once a desired trait is observed through mutagenesis the trait may then be incorporated into existing germplasm by traditional breeding techniques, such as backcrossing. Details of mutation breeding can be found in “Principals of Cultivar Development” Fehr, 1993 Macmillan Publishing Company the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, mutations created in other lines may be used to produce a backcross conversion of PHAKC that comprises such mutation.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Breeding with Molecular Markers</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0240">Molecular markers, which includes markers identified through the use of techniques such as Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), may be used in plant breeding methods utilizing PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0241">Isozyme Electrophoresis and RFLPs as discussed in Lee, M., “Inbred Lines of Maize and Their Molecular Markers,” <i>The Maize Handbook</i>, (Springer-Verlag, New York, Inc. 1994, at 423-432), have been widely used to determine genetic composition. Isozyme Electrophoresis has a relatively low number of available markers and a low number of allelic variants among maize inbreds. RFLPs allow more discrimination because they have a higher degree of allelic variation in maize and a larger number of markers can be found. Both of these methods have been eclipsed by SSRs as discussed in Smith et al., “An evaluation of the utility of SSR loci as molecular markers in maize (<i>Zea mays </i>L.): comparisons with data from RFLPs and pedigree”, <i>Theoretical and Applied Genetics </i>(1997) vol. 95 at 163-173 and by Pejic et al., “Comparative analysis of genetic similarity among maize inbreds detected by RFLPs, RAPDs, SSRs, and AFLPs,” <i>Theoretical and Applied Genetics </i>(1998) at 1248-1255 incorporated herein by reference. SSR technology is more efficient and practical to use than RFLPs; more marker loci can be routinely used and more alleles per marker locus can be found using SSRs in comparison to RFLPs. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms may also be used to identify the unique genetic composition of the invention and progeny lines retaining that unique genetic composition. Various molecular marker techniques may be used in combination to enhance overall resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0242">Maize DNA molecular marker linkage maps have been rapidly constructed and widely implemented in genetic studies. One such study is described in Boppenmaier, et al., “Comparisons among strains of inbreds for RFLPs”, Maize Genetics Cooperative Newsletter, 65:1991, pg. 90, is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0243">One use of molecular markers is Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping. QTL mapping is the use of markers, which are known to be closely linked to alleles that have measurable effects on a quantitative trait. Selection in the breeding process is based upon the accumulation of markers linked to the positive effecting alleles and/or the elimination of the markers linked to the negative effecting alleles from the plant's genome.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0244">Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select for the genome of the recurrent parent and against the genome of the donor parent. Using this procedure can minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program. The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called genetic marker enhanced selection.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Production of Double Haploids</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0245">The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of inbreds in the breeding program. For example, an F1 hybrid for which PHAKC is a parent can be used to produce double haploid plants. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes (1N) from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. For example, see Wan et al., “Efficient Production of Doubled Haploid Plants Through Colchicine Treatment of Anther-Derived Maize Callus”, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 77:889-892, 1989 and US2003/0005479. This can be advantageous because the process omits the generations of selfing needed to obtain a homozygous plant from a heterozygous source.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0246">Thus, an embodiment of this invention is a process for making a substantially homozygous PHAKC progeny plant by producing or obtaining a seed from the cross of PHAKC and another maize plant and applying double haploid methods to the F1 seed or F1 plant or to any successive filial generation. Such methods decrease the number of generations required to produce an inbred with similar genetics or characteristics to PHAKC. See Bernardo, R. and Kahler, A. L., Theor. Appl. Genet. 102:986-992, 2001.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0247">In particular, a process of making seed retaining the molecular marker profile of maize inbred line PHAKC is contemplated, such process comprising obtaining or producing F1 hybrid seed for which maize inbred line PHAKC is a parent, inducing doubled haploids to create progeny without the occurrence of meiotic segregation, obtaining the molecular marker profile of maize inbred line PHAKC, and selecting progeny that retain the molecular marker profile of PHAKC.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Use of PHAKC in Tissue Culture</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0248">This invention is also directed to the use of PHAKC in tissue culture. As used herein, the term “tissue culture” includes plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue culture, cultured microspores, plant calli, plant clumps, and the like. As used herein, phrases such as “growing the seed” or “grown from the seed” include embryo rescue, isolation of cells from seed for use in tissue culture, as well as traditional growing methods.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0249">Duncan, Williams, Zehr, and Widholm, Planta (1985) 165:322-332 reflects that 97% of the plants cultured that produced callus were capable of plant regeneration. Subsequent experiments with both inbreds and hybrids produced 91% regenerable callus that produced plants. In a further study in 1988, Songstad, Duncan &amp; Widholm in <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>(1988), 7:262-265 reports several media additions that enhance regenerability of callus of two inbred lines. Other published reports also indicated that “nontraditional” tissues are capable of producing somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration. K. P. Rao, et al., <i>Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter, </i>60:64-65 (1986), refers to somatic embryogenesis from glume callus cultures and B. V. Conger, et al., <i>Plant Cell Reports, </i>6:345-347 (1987) indicates somatic embryogenesis from the tissue cultures of maize leaf segments. Thus, it is clear from the literature that the state of the art is such that these methods of obtaining plants are, and were, “conventional” in the sense that they are routinely used and have a very high rate of success.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0250">Tissue culture of maize, including tassel/anther culture, is described in U.S. 2002/0062506A1 and European Patent Application, publication 160,390, each of which are incorporated herein by reference for this purpose. Maize tissue culture procedures are also described in Green and Rhodes, “Plant Regeneration in Tissue Culture of Maize,” <i>Maize for Biological Research </i>(Plant Molecular Biology Association, Charlottesville, Va. 1982, at 367-372) and in Duncan, et al., “The Production of Callus Capable of Plant Regeneration from Immature Embryos of Numerous <i>Zea Mays </i>Genotypes,” 165 <i>Planta </i>322-332 (1985). Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce maize plants having the genotype and/or physiological and morphological characteristics of inbred line PHAKC.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Progeny Plants</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0251">All plants produced by the use of the methods described herein and that retain the unique genetic or trait combinations of PHAKC are within the scope of the invention. Progeny of the breeding methods described herein may be characterized in any number of ways, such as by traits retained in the progeny, pedigree and/or molecular markers. Combinations of these methods of characterization may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0252">Breeder's of ordinary skill in the art have developed the concept of an “essentially derived variety”, which is defined in 7 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(3) of the Plant Variety Protection Act and is hereby incorporated by reference. Varieties and plants that are essentially derived from PHAKC are within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0253">Pedigree is a method used by breeders of ordinary skill in the art to describe the varieties. Varieties that are more closely related by pedigree are likely to share common genotypes and combinations of phenotypic characteristics. All breeders of ordinary skill in the art maintain pedigree records of their breeding programs. These pedigree records contain a detailed description of the breeding process, including a listing of all parental lines used in the breeding process and information on how such line was used. One embodiment of this invention is progeny plants and parts thereof with at least one ancestor that is PHAKC, and more specifically, where the pedigree of the progeny includes 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 or less breeding crosses to a maize plant other than PHAKC or a plant that has PHAKC as a parent or other progenitor. A breeder of ordinary skill in the art would know if PHAKC were used in the development of a progeny line, and would also know how many crosses to a line other than PHAKC or line with PHAKC as a parent or other progenitor were made in the development of any progeny line.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0254">Molecular markers also provide a means by which those of ordinary skill in the art characterize the similarity or differences of two lines. Using the breeding methods described herein, one can develop individual plants, plant cells, and populations of plants that retain at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% genetic contribution from inbred line PHAKC, as measured by either percent identity or percent similarity. In pedigree analysis the percentage genetic contribution may not be actually known, but on average 50% of the starting germplasm would be expected to be passed to the progeny line after one cross to another line, 25% after another cross to a different line, and so on. With backcrossing, the expected contribution of PHAKC after 2, 3, 4 and 5 doses (or 1, 2, 3 and 4 backcrosses) would be 75%, 87.5%, 93.75% and 96.875% respectively. Actual genetic contribution may be much higher than the genetic contribution expected by pedigree, especially if molecular markers are used in selection. Molecular markers could also be used to confirm and/or determine the pedigree of the progeny line.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0255">Traits are also used by those of ordinary skill in the art to characterize progeny. Traits are commonly evaluated at a significance level, such as a 1%, 5% or 10% significance level, when measured in plants grown in the same environmental conditions. For example, a backcross conversion of PHAKC may be characterized as having the same morphological and physiological traits as PHAKC. The traits used for comparison may be any or all of the traits shown in Table 1, Table 3, Table 4 or Table 5.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0256">A breeder will commonly work to combine a specific trait of an undeveloped variety of the species, such as a high level of resistance to a particular disease, with one or more of the elite agronomic characteristics (yield, maturity, plant size, lodging resistance, etc.) needed for use as a commercial variety. This combination, once developed, provides a valuable source of new germplasm for further breeding. For example, it may take 10-15 years and significant effort to produce such a combination, yet progeny may be developed that retain this combination in as little as 2-5 years and with much less effort.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="1">SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0257">Specific methods and products produced using inbred line PHAKC in plant breeding are discussed in the following sections. The methods outlined are described in detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding. However, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0258">One method for producing a line derived from inbred line PHAKC is as follows. One of ordinary skill in the art would produce or obtain a seed from the cross between inbred line PHAKC and another variety of maize, such as an elite inbred variety. The F1 seed derived from this cross would be grown to form a homogeneous population. The F1 seed would contain essentially all of the alleles from variety PHAKC and essentially all of the alleles from the other maize variety. The F1 nuclear genome would be made-up of 50% variety PHAKC and 50% of the other elite variety. The F1 seed would be grown and allowed to self, thereby forming F2 seed. On average the F2 seed would have derived 50% of its alleles from variety PHAKC and 50% from the other maize variety, but many individual plants from the population would have a greater percentage of their alleles derived from PHAKC (Wang J. and R. Bernardo, 2000, Crop Sci. 40:659-665 and Bernardo, R. and A. L. Kahler, 2001, Theor. Appl. Genet 102:986-992). The molecular markers of PHAKC could be used to select and retain those lines with high similarity to PHAKC. The F2 seed would be grown and selection of plants would be made based on visual observation, markers and/or measurement of traits. The traits used for selection may be any PHAKC trait described in this specification, including the inbred per se maize PHAKC traits described herein under the detailed description of inbred PHAKC. Such traits may also be the good general or specific combining ability of PHAKC, including its ability to produce hybrids with the approximate maturity and/or hybrid combination traits described herein under the detailed description of inbred PHAKC. The PHAKC progeny plants that exhibit one or more of the desired PHAKC traits, such as those listed herein, would be selected and each plant would be harvested separately. This F3 seed from each plant would be grown in individual rows and allowed to self. Then selected rows or plants from the rows would be harvested individually. The selections would again be based on visual observation, markers and/or measurements for desirable traits of the plants, such as one or more of the desirable PHAKC traits listed herein. The process of growing and selection would be repeated any number of times until a PHAKC progeny inbred plant is obtained. The PHAKC progeny inbred plant would contain desirable traits derived from inbred plant PHAKC, some of which may not have been expressed by the other maize variety to which inbred line PHAKC was crossed and some of which may have been expressed by both maize varieties but now would be at a level equal to or greater than the level expressed in inbred variety PHAKC. However, in each case the resulting progeny line would benefit from the efforts of the inventor(s), and would not have existed but for the inventor(s) work in creating PHAKC. The PHAKC progeny inbred plants would have, on average, 50% of their nuclear genes derived from inbred line PHAKC, but many individual plants from the population would have a greater percentage of their alleles derived from PHAKC. This breeding cycle, of crossing and selfing, and optional selection, may be repeated to produce another population of PHAKC progeny maize plants with, on average, 25% of their nuclear genes derived from inbred line PHAKC, but, again, many individual plants from the population would have a greater percentage of their alleles derived from PHAKC. This process can be repeated for a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh or more breeding cycles. Another embodiment of the invention is a PHAKC progeny plant that has received the desirable PHAKC traits listed herein through the use of PHAKC, which traits were not exhibited by other plants used in the breeding process.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0259">Therefore, an embodiment of this invention is a PHAKC progeny maize plant, wherein at least one ancestor of said PHAKC progeny maize plant is the maize plant or plant part of PHAKC, and wherein the pedigree of said PHAKC progeny maize plant is within two breeding crosses of PHAKC or a plant that has PHAKC as a parent. The progeny plants, parts and plant cells produced from PHAKC may be further characterized as having a percent marker similarity or identity with PHAKC as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0260">The previous example can be modified in numerous ways, for instance selection may or may not occur at every selfing generation, selection may occur before or after the actual self-pollination process occurs, or individual selections may be made by harvesting individual ears, plants, rows or plots at any point during the breeding process described. Double haploid breeding methods may be used at any step in the process. Instead of selfing out of the hybrid produced from the inbred, one could first cross the hybrid to either a parent line or a different inbred, and then self out of that cross.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0261">The population of plants produced at each and any cycle of breeding is also an embodiment of the invention, and on average each such population would predictably consist of plants containing approximately 50% of its genes from inbred line PHAKC in the first breeding cycle, 25% of its genes from inbred line PHAKC in the second breeding cycle, 12.5% of its genes from inbred line PHAKC in the third breeding cycle, 6.25% in the fourth breeding cycle, 3.125% in the fifth breeding cycle, and so on. However, in each case the use of PHAKC provides a substantial benefit. The linkage groups of PHAKC would be retained in the progeny lines, and since current estimates of the maize genome size is about 50,000-80,000 genes (Xiaowu, Gai et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2000, Vol. 28, No. 1, 94-96), in addition to non-coding DNA that impacts gene expression, it provides a significant advantage to use PHAKC as starting material to produce a line that retains desired genetics or traits of PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0262">Therefore, an embodiment of the invention is a process for making a population of PHAKC progeny inbred maize plants comprising obtaining or producing a first generation progeny maize seed comprising the plant of PHAKC as a parent, growing said first generation progeny maize seed to produce first generation maize plants and obtaining self or sib pollinated seed from said first generation maize plants, and growing the self or sib pollinated seed to obtain a population of PHAKC progeny inbred maize plants.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0263">The population of PHAKC progeny inbred maize plants produced by this method are also embodiments of the invention, and such population as a whole will retain the expected genetic contribution of PHAKC. An inbred line selected from the population of PHAKC progeny inbred maize plants produced by this method is an embodiment, and such line may be further characterized by its molecular marker identity or similarity to PHAKC.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0264">In this manner, the invention also encompasses a process for making a PHAKC inbred progeny maize plant comprising the steps of obtaining or producing a first generation progeny maize seed wherein a parent of said first generation progeny maize seed is a PHAKC plant, growing said first generation progeny maize seed to produce a first generation maize plant and obtaining self or sib pollinated seed from said first generation maize plant, and producing successive filial generations to obtain a PHAKC inbred progeny maize plant. Also an embodiment of this invention is the first breeding cycle inbred PHAKC maize plant produced by this method.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Crosses to Other Species</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0265">The utility of inbred maize line PHAKC also extends to crosses with other species. Commonly, suitable species will be of the family Graminaceae, and especially of the genera <i>Zea, Tripsacum, Coix, Schlerachne, Polytoca, Chionachne</i>, and <i>Trilobachne</i>, of the tribe Maydeae. Potentially suitable for crosses with PHAKC may be the various varieties of grain sorghum, <i>Sorghum bicolor </i>(L.) Moench.</p>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0250" num="0266">Maize is used as human food, livestock feed, and as raw material in industry. The food uses of maize, in addition to human consumption of maize kernels, include both products of dry- and wet-milling industries. The principal products of maize dry milling are grits, meal and flour. The maize wet-milling industry can provide maize starch, maize syrups, and dextrose for food use. Maize oil is recovered from maize germ, which is a by-product of both dry- and wet-milling industries.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0267">Maize, including both grain and non-grain portions of the plant, is also used extensively as livestock feed, primarily for beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs, and poultry.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0268">Industrial uses of maize include production of ethanol, maize starch in the wet-milling industry and maize flour in the dry-milling industry. The industrial applications of maize starch and flour are based on functional properties, such as viscosity, film formation, adhesive properties, and ability to suspend particles. The maize starch and flour have application in the paper and textile industries. Other industrial uses include applications in adhesives, building materials, foundry binders, laundry starches, explosives, oil-well muds, and other mining applications.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0269">Plant parts other than the grain of maize are also used in industry: for example, stalks and husks are made into paper and wallboard and cobs are used for fuel and to make charcoal.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0270">The seed of inbred maize line PHAKC, the plant produced from the inbred seed, the hybrid maize plant produced from the crossing of the inbred, hybrid seed, and various parts of the hybrid maize plant and transgenic versions of the foregoing, can be utilized for human food, livestock feed, and as a raw material in industry.</p>
