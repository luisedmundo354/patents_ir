<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to electronic imaging apparatus for fundus imaging and more particularly relates to an improved fundus imaging apparatus using scanned slit illumination and an electronically controlled aperture.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fundus camera imaging is acknowledged to be an important diagnostic tool for detection of various conditions affecting the eye, including diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Various embodiments of fundus imaging apparatus are disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,047 (Kohayakawa); U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,116 (Zeimer); U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,266 (Ohtsuka); U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,680 (Nunokawa); U.S. Pat. No. 6,546,198 (Ohtsuka); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,696 (Saito).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While these patents attest to continuous improvements in fundus camera design, there are still significant hurdles to widespread acceptance and usability of these devices. Among disadvantages noted with current devices are high cost and complexity, difficulty of operation, large size, and image quality limitations. These disadvantages hinder the successful deployment of fundus cameras in primary care physician (PCP) offices or in medical test labs, where they could be used by a technician having relatively little training in device operation and imaging, to obtain images that can be assessed by specialists at some other location.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A further significant disadvantage of existing fundus imaging apparatus relates to the requirement for pupil dilation. For most patients, artificially induced enlargement of the pupil is necessary in order to allow sufficient light into the eye of the patient for fundus observation and image capture. At best, pupil dilation is uncomfortable and at least temporarily unsettling; at worst, dilation can even be dangerous for some individuals. A number of commercially available fundus imaging systems claim to be “non-mydriatic”, that is, operable without pupil dilation. However, in practice, pupil dilation is still often required when using these apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The illumination optics subsystem of a conventional fundus imaging apparatus is designed in such a way that it requires pupil dilation for most patients. In order to provide a truly non-mydriatic fundus imaging system that renders pupil dilation unnecessary and that can be used by relatively untrained personnel, improved design of the illumination system would be required. However, the efforts of designers and manufacturers of these devices have been directed to providing more sophisticated imaging and assessment functions, many of which may actually require dilation in all cases. Thus, the limitations due to illumination subsystem design have been largely ignored and dilation is generally accepted as a requirement. For this reason, it can be seen that there is a need for an improved fundus imaging apparatus having an illumination system that allows fully non-mydriatic retinal imaging for a broad range of patients.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a fundus imaging apparatus having an improved illumination subsystem and imaging system that promotes non-mydriatic imaging. With this object in mind, the present invention provides an apparatus for obtaining an image of the eye, comprising:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a) an alignment section for aligning the pupil of the eye along an optical axis;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">b) a pupil sensor for identifying location and dimensions of the pupil of the eye; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">c) an illumination section for directing light through the pupil of the eye.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">It is a feature of the present invention that it provides an illumination system for a fundus imaging apparatus that adapts the width of the illumination beam to the dimensions of the pupil, rather than requiring a fixed pupil width, as in conventional systems that require pupil dilation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">It is an advantage of the present invention that it minimizes or eliminates the requirement for pupil dilation for fundus imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">It is a further advantage of the present invention that it provides the capability for full-color fundus imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">It is yet a further advantage of the present invention that it provides a fundus imaging system with a larger field of view than conventional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described an illustrative embodiment of the invention.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a hindus imaging apparatus <b>10</b> in which a conventional illumination section <b>12</b> is used. The patient's eye E is positioned along an optical axis O using an alignment subsystem, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but described subsequently. Illumination section <b>12</b> directs light either from an observation light source <b>14</b> and a lens <b>16</b> or from an image capture light source <b>18</b> and a lens <b>20</b> as controlled by control logic circuitry (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A half-minor <b>22</b> directs light from the appropriate source through a ring-slit diaphragm <b>24</b> and a lens <b>26</b>, to an apertured minor <b>28</b>. Apertured mirror <b>28</b> directs the illumination light along axis O and toward the pupil for illuminating the retina of eye E. Depending on the use of hindus imaging apparatus <b>10</b> at any one time, either observation light source <b>14</b> or image capture light source <b>18</b> is activated. Observation light source <b>14</b> is typically infrared (IR) light, to which eye E is insensitive. Image capture light source <b>18</b>, on the other hand, may be a high-brightness source such as a xenon lamp, for example. Depending on the application, image capture light source <b>18</b> may be pulsed or strobed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">Ring-slit diaphragm <b>24</b> has the characteristic functional arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Light is transmitted through an inner ring <b>30</b> and is blocked at a middle section <b>32</b> and at an outer section <b>34</b>. As is shown in the received illumination ring of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, inner ring <b>30</b> is directed into a pupil <b>36</b> of the patient as a ring <b>40</b> of illumination. To obtain the retinal image, apertured mirror <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) has an aperture suitably centered about optical axis O to allow light that has been reflected from the retina of eye E and directed through lenses <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> to a sensor <b>46</b>, such as a CCD.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">The high-level block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thus gives an overview of illumination section <b>12</b> that applies for conventional fundus imaging apparatus. There have been numerous methods disclosed for optimizing the performance of illumination section <b>12</b>, including components arranged to prevent stray reflected light from the cornea of eye E from being directed back toward sensor <b>46</b>. However, the basic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is conventionally followed for these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">Among disadvantages of this conventional method is the relatively small field that is available. To compensate for this shortcoming, a series of tiled sections is typically imaged. In some cases, conventional image capture uses a narrow range of wavelengths, resulting in monochromatic images. The static ring <b>40</b> of illumination as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is disadvantageous, since this ring occupies a portion of the image area during image capture. The combination of ring-slit diaphragm <b>24</b> and apertured mirror <b>28</b> acts to block scattered rays of illumination from the cornea, thereby obstructing these rays from affecting sensor <b>46</b>. As yet another disadvantage, alignment of the patient's pupil with the conventional fundus imaging apparatus is time-consuming, since ring <b>40</b> must be fully inside the pupil and must avoid the iris.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Overview of Illumination Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">The apparatus and method of the present invention eliminate the need for a separate ring of illumination, shown as static ring <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Instead, the apparatus and method of the present invention use one or more moving members to selectively partition the illumination beam from either observation light source <b>14</b> or image capture light source <b>18</b>, directing one or more partitions or segments of the illumination beam to eye E and allowing light reflected from the retina of eye E to be detected at sensor <b>46</b>, while also blocking reflected light from the cornea of eye E from sensing components.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown, in block diagram form, an overview of a fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention. An illumination section <b>112</b> directs light either from an observation light source <b>114</b> and a lens <b>116</b> or from an image capture light source <b>118</b> and a lens <b>120</b> as controlled by control logic circuitry (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A half-mirror <b>122</b> or, alternately, a dichroic surface, directs light from the appropriate source through a transmissive spatial light modulator <b>125</b> which, acting as a type of transmissive light valve, provides an electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> for the illumination beam, as described subsequently. The illumination beam is directed by a lens <b>126</b> to an illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">Illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b> segments the illumination beam cross-sectionally, as is described subsequently. To do this, illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b> uses a reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> moves in a direction D and scans one or more segments of the illumination beam through a lens <b>142</b> and into the eye E. Reflected light from the retina of eye E is then passed through reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b>, with unwanted reflected light from the cornea blocked. The light reflected from the retina is thus directed through a lens <b>144</b> to a sensor <b>146</b>. A display <b>138</b>, such as a CRT or LCD monitor, may be used in conjunction with sensor <b>146</b> and with cornea sensing camera or other sensing components, as described subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">As the overview of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, illumination section <b>112</b> of the present invention directs the illumination beam from either observation light source <b>114</b> or image capture light source <b>118</b> toward the eye E and conditions the illumination beam in two ways:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">This dimensioning and conditioning of the illumination beam and method of scanning provide exceptional advantages for effecting a truly non-mydriatic illumination system for retinal imaging. It is worthwhile to observe that, while steps (i) and (ii) above are executed in this order in the embodiments described herein, a different order could be used, so that the illumination beam is first partitioned (step ii, above), then shaped (step i, above).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Shaping the Illumination Beam</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">The conventional ring-slit illumination method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> directs a static ring <b>40</b> of illumination to the eye E being imaged. Among the problems inherent to this approach is its relatively poor adaptability to the dimensions of the pupil of eye E. Not only can pupils have different diameters from one patient to the next, but the actual shape of the pupil itself can vary from circular shape. Dilated pupils for different patients, for example, can vary in diameter between about 6 and 8 mm. Conventional fundus imaging systems reach some compromise for variable pupil dimensions using methods such as a variety of selectable ring-slit diaphragms <b>24</b>. For example, a set of different ring-slit diaphragms <b>24</b>, or other apertured devices, can be provided on a selector wheel or other mechanism, allowing an operator to select the aperture that is best suited to the dimensions of the patient's pupils. Any aperture selected in the place of ring-slit diaphragm <b>24</b> is, at best, an approximation and must fit the illumination ring <b>40</b> within the outer dimensions of the pupil for best operation. Providing illumination that extends even slightly beyond the borders of the pupil of eye E is not optimal, since stray, diffused light from the surrounding iris of eye E can easily be directed back along optical axis O and degrade image quality obtained at sensor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">The apparatus and method of the present invention approaches this problem in a different manner, by shaping the illumination beam according to the detected coordinates of the pupil. This method shapes the illumination beam, when considered in cross-sectional profile, to match dimensional profile of the pupil, in size, placement, and overall shape. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown, in perspective view, the optical path of illumination to the pupil from image capture light source <b>118</b>. It must be noted that the same beam shaping operation applies for light from either image capture light source <b>118</b> or observation light source <b>114</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, light from image capture light source <b>118</b> is directed through lens <b>120</b> toward spatial light modulator <b>125</b>, which provides an electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> that is sized to correspond to the outline of pupil P of eye E. Electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> provides a mask for the illumination beam to form a shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped</sub>, which is directed through lens <b>126</b> and goes to illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b>. Here, shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped</sub>, is segmented and reflected from reciprocating partioning member <b>129</b> or other component, then through lens <b>142</b> to pupil P.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">There are a number of ways to provide electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> for conditioning the cross-sectional profile of the illumination beam. Spatial light modulator <b>125</b> may be a transmissive LCD, for example, such as an LCD spatial light modulator, blocking light from around electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> in a masking pattern that corresponds to pupil P coordinates and dimensions. In this way, illumination can be directed to the full area of pupil P, but not extending outside the circumference of pupil P.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">In one embodiment, the outline of pupil P is detected by an electronic camera or other sensor, as described subsequently. Image data from this camera is processed by a control logic processor <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to determine pupil P position and dimensional coordinates using pattern recognition and other imaging algorithms such as outline detection algorithms, employing methods familiar to those skilled in the imaging arts. Overall, the mechanism used as pupil sensor may have any of a number of components and may be fully automated or require operator interaction, such as for centering of sensor measurements or for verification of pupil outline and dimensions. This pupil sensing subsystem may also include feedback and adjustment mechanisms for adapting to subtle changes in pupil position over time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">It must be noted that mechanisms other than transmissive spatial light modulators <b>125</b> could be used to provide electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> for beam shaping. Reflective spatial light modulators and light valves could also be used for this purpose, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Here, image capture light source <b>118</b> provides light that may be conditioned by a uniformizer <b>186</b> or other component and directed, by an optional mirror <b>184</b>, through lens <b>120</b> and to a prism <b>188</b> or a beamsplitter of some type. Prism <b>188</b> directs the light toward a reflective light valve, such as a digital micromirror device <b>190</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Digital micromirror device <b>190</b> then provides electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b>, modulating the incident light to provide, through lens <b>126</b>, an illumination beam that is shaped, in cross-sectional profile, according to data provided about the dimensions and position of the pupil. A similar arrangement to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> would be used for a reflective LCD spatial light modulator used in place of digital micromirror device <b>190</b>, with a polarization beamsplitter providing the light directing function of prism <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Partitioning the Illumination Beam</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">For obtaining an image, the full shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>provided through spatial light modulator <b>125</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> cannot be provided to pupil P. If this were to happen, there would be excessive light reflection from the cornea C of eye E, resulting in unacceptably poor image quality. Instead, the present invention provides a cross-sectional partitioning or segmenting of the illumination beam. Referring to the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>, the circular shape represents the two-dimensional shape of the patient's pupil P, to which the two-dimensional cross-section of the illumination beam, as shaped by illumination section <b>112</b>, corresponds. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the shape of P describes the cross-sectional “envelope” of the illumination beam, as modulated through spatial light modulator <b>125</b> or other device that provides electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b>. Reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, acting as illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b>, segments the illumination beam to provide one or more light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> separated by one or more non-light-bearing partitions <b>152</b>. Movement of reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> then scans the segmented illumination provided by light-bearing partitions across the area of pupil P. In the sequence of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>, scanning is effected in the direction of the outlined arrow. Following this overall pattern, reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> partitions shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>so that, at any instant, one or more light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> or segments of the shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>are directed into pupil P. These light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> are then shifted in position to provide a scanning effect over the pupil that enables the complete image to be obtained over time.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the result of this partitioning behavior of reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> within fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is shown for one embodiment. Reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> reflects shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>from spatial light modulator <b>125</b> along optical axis O towards the pupil P (shown in dotted outline in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), with this light segmented into a set of light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> separated by non-light-bearing partitions <b>152</b>. Reflected light R from the eye then travels back along optical axis O. The unwanted reflected light from the cornea is substantially blocked by suitable portions of reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b>. The desired light from the retina is transmitted to sensor <b>146</b>. To provide scanning action that allows a complete image to be obtained over time, an actuator <b>132</b> is coupled to reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> to provide reciprocating movement.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">One embodiment of reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. One or more reflective members <b>154</b> reflects light into light-bearing partitions <b>150</b>. Gaps <b>156</b> between reflective members <b>154</b> correspond to non light-bearing partitions <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>, enabling the return of reflected light from the eye along the optical axis O to sensor <b>146</b>. As the double arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> indicates, reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> is moved up or down during scanning operation, in order to bathe the complete pupil P of eye E in light over time, using scanned light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> to reflect the shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>appropriately. The arrangement of reflective members <b>154</b> can have any number of alternate embodiments for partitioning the shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>Reciprocating actuation, represented by actuator <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, can be provided by any number of electromechanical devices, including a solenoid, motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic device, spring-loaded actuator, or other device. The speed of movement provided for this scanning effect can be varied, based on the response characteristics of sensor <b>146</b>, the brightness of shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped</sub>, and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">An alternate embodiment for partitioning the pupil as illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here, a reciprocating partitioning member <b>229</b>, disposed within the path of shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped</sub>, has one or more slits <b>202</b> that provide an aperture for illumination. A beamsplitter <b>204</b> directs the partitioned illumination along optical axis O and toward the eye of the patient, following the general pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Light reflected from the eye, returning along optical axis O, is directed toward sensor <b>146</b> though apertures <b>206</b>. One or more blocking members <b>208</b> block light reflected back from the corneal surface, so that the reflected light that goes to sensor <b>146</b> is from the retina. For scanning the complete pupil, linear movement is provided in the direction of arrow L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">As the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> clearly show, there can be a number of ways for implementing the overall function of illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b> performed by reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b>, <b>229</b> of the present invention. This component partitions the shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>into distinct light-bearing and non-light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, scans light-bearing and non-light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> across the pupil to illuminate the full field over time, and blocks unwanted light that is reflected from the cornea.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Fundus Imaging Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> in one embodiment of the present invention. In addition to illumination section <b>112</b> described above, fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> has an alignment section <b>160</b>, a cornea focusing section <b>180</b>, and a retina focusing section <b>192</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an alternate embodiment of a fundus imaging apparatus <b>200</b> using reciprocating partitioning member <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Alignment section <b>160</b> provides aiming and accommodation of the patient's vision, in order to position the eye E favorably for fundus imaging. To simplify description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> isolates the basic components of alignment section <b>160</b> from the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. An aiming target <b>162</b>, such as an LED or other light source, visible through beamsplitters <b>172</b> and <b>166</b>, is used to direct the eye of the patient to a position that provides visual accommodation. That is, when viewing aiming target <b>162</b> through lens <b>142</b> and a lens assembly <b>164</b>, the light entering eye E is substantially collimated. When the light entering eye E is collimated, light from illumination section <b>112</b> can be directed to the retina and more accurate focus adjustments can be made. Relative to the coordinate axes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the alignment procedure along optical axis O<sub>a </sub>sets the position of eye E along the z axis, and provides alignment positioning relative to the orthogonal x and y axes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> also show different embodiments of illumination section <b>112</b> in more detail. A beamsplitter <b>178</b> in illumination section <b>112</b> directs light from either observation light source <b>114</b> or image capture light source <b>118</b> through spatial light modulator <b>125</b> and lens <b>126</b> for beam shaping and to reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) or <b>229</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) as illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b> for partitioning illumination to the pupil as was described generally with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>. Lenses <b>182</b> and <b>142</b> direct the shaped and partitioned illumination beam into the pupil of eye E. Beamsplitters <b>172</b> and <b>174</b> fold optical axis O between lenses <b>182</b> and <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">Once alignment of eye E is achieved, it is necessary to focus on the cornea using cornea focusing section <b>180</b>. To simplify description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> isolates the basic components of cornea focusing section <b>180</b> from the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the purpose of cornea focusing section <b>180</b> is to adjust the focus of lens <b>142</b> or, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, to adjust for the position of the eye along the z-axis. When necessary to focus the cornea, light sources <b>176</b> provide peripheral illumination to the cornea. The reflected light is then directed, through beamsplitters <b>172</b> and <b>166</b> and through lens <b>168</b>, to cornea camera <b>170</b>, which is optically conjugate to the cornea. Cornea camera <b>170</b> can be a relatively inexpensive imaging device, requiring only that it have sufficient resolution for focusing. In one embodiment, for example, cornea camera <b>170</b> is a CCD camera, model no. IK-52V manufactured by Toshiba.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Achieving proper focus of the cornea allows the retinal image to be obtained. As a first step, partitioned, shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>is directed onto the cornea, imaging reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b> onto the cornea. To simplify description for this step, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> isolates the basic components used for this phase of retinal focus setup from the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. Observation light source <b>114</b> is conjugate with the cornea. For observation functions, an IR LED or similar source for observation light source <b>114</b> is directed through transmissive spatial light modulator <b>125</b> for beam shaping and through reciprocating partitioning member <b>229</b> and beamsplitter <b>204</b> for partitioning, then directed to the cornea of eye E along optical axis O. Cornea camera <b>170</b> detects the image of reciprocating partitioning member <b>229</b>, which can be displayed on an accompanying CRT monitor (not shown) for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">It must be observed that light sources <b>176</b>, used for initial stages of cornea focus, are disabled during the step of cornea focus described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. It must also be noted that similar behavior occurs whether reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or reciprocating partitioning member <b>229</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is used. Light-bearing partitions <b>150</b> and non-light-bearing partitions <b>152</b>, once properly focused in this manner, can be scanned over the area of a pupil P to provide full retinal illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">Once the partitioned, shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>is directed onto the cornea for observation, thereby forming an image of reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b> onto the cornea, final adjustments can be made for sizing electronically controlled aperture <b>127</b> provided by transmissive spatial light modulator <b>125</b>. In addition, any necessary final adjustments to retinal focus can be made. To simplify description for this step, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> isolates the basic components used for final retinal focus from the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, observation light source <b>114</b> provides illumination that is shaped and partitioned by illumination section <b>112</b>, using either reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b>, for example. Lenses <b>182</b> and <b>142</b> cooperate to focus the partitioned, shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>onto the cornea. The path of light reflected from the retina goes back through reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b>, which blocks at least a substantial portion of light reflected from the cornea. The retinal image is thereby made available, in scanned partition format, to sensor <b>146</b>. A preview image I<sub>p </sub>is then displayed to the operator to enable focus adjustment of lens <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">With the retina focused using preview image I<sub>p</sub>, the retinal image can now be obtained. To simplify description for this step, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> isolates the basic components used for retinal imaging from the block diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. Image capture light source <b>118</b>, typically a visible light source, is now energized, producing a beam of illumination that is shaped and partitioned by illumination section <b>112</b>, using either reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b>, for example. Lenses <b>182</b> and <b>142</b> cooperate to focus the partitioned, shaped illumination beam I<sub>shaped </sub>onto the cornea. As with the preview illumination described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the path of light reflected from the retina goes back through reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b> or <b>229</b>, which blocks at least a substantial portion of light reflected from the cornea. The retinal image is thereby made available, in scanned partition format, to sensor <b>146</b>. A retina image I<sub>r </sub>is then displayed to the operator and can be stored electronically for transfer to some other location or for additional processing.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">During image capture, it may be useful to continually recheck eye E alignment as well as cornea and retinal focus.

<p id="p-0061" num="0065">The present invention provides a fundus imaging apparatus that is simple to operate, allows compact packaging, and does not require dilation of the pupil for most patients. It must be emphasized that fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>, as described in the present application, is primarily intended to provide basic fundus imaging that can be inexpensively performed at the office of a PCP or other non-specialist site.

<p id="p-0062" num="0066">The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope of the invention as described above, and as noted in the appended claims, by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the various light sources used within fundus imaging apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>200</b> allow a number of optional types. Sensors and CCD devices could be any of a number of different types. Although the resolution and overall image quality requirements for cornea camera <b>170</b> and sensor <b>146</b> are quite different, a single CCD array could be used for both cornea camera <b>170</b> and sensor <b>146</b>, switched between these functions, using techniques well known in the imaging arts.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">Within illumination beam partitioning mechanism <b>50</b>, various types of actuators and mechanisms could be used for performing the functions of scanning reciprocating partitioning member <b>129</b>, <b>229</b>. Possible actuator types include electromagnetic and piezoelectric actuators or acoustical transducers. Alternately, devices used could be spring-mounted. Other types of electromechanical actuators could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">Thus, what is provided is an apparatus and method for fundus imaging using scanned illumination.</p>
