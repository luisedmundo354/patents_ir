<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a level shifter circuit having a screening test function which efficiently destroys latent manufacturing defects which lead to initial failures after shipping, such as in a gradation selection circuit which selects and outputs one of plural analog gradation voltages, to a drive circuit in which the level shifter circuit is installed, to a display in which the drive circuit is installed, and to a stress test method for the gradation selection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A high voltage stress test is a general method for screening the initial failure of a display drive LSI. This high voltage stress test is a test method which, in the stress test before shipping, applies a voltage higher than the LSI drive voltage applied to the LSI in use, and thus reveals latent element defects in the LSI more effectively (i.e., latently defective parts are destroyed prior to shipping). The high voltage stress test time is determined by taking account of a voltage acceleration component (i.e., how much the revealing of an element defect is accelerated by applying a voltage), and a temperature acceleration component (how much the revealing of an element defect is accelerated by temperature), estimating the initial market failure rate, and setting a target failure rate according to the application of the LSI and the specification required of the LSI so that the initial failure rate is less than the target failure rate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent microfabrication wafer processes, high voltage-resisting elements which can apply a high voltage such as 16 V have become indispensable, and it is important to screen for latent defects which could lead to the initial failure of these elements by a high voltage stress test. In order to maximize the test coverage of such screening, a full gradation scan test of the gradation selection circuit used for the display drive (generally, a digital analog converter (DAC)) must be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows the construction of prior-art level shifter circuits <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> and gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the operating state of the level shifter circuits <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> during a prior-art stress test.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The gradation selection operation of the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b> will first be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. The level shifter circuit <b>604</b> applies a control signal BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>from an output terminal OUTb to the gates NOb<b>1</b> and NOb<b>3</b> of an NMOS transistor N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>. The level shifter circuit <b>604</b> also applies a control signal BIT<b>0</b> from the output terminal OUT to the gates of the NMOS transistors N<b>02</b> and N<b>04</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>. The control signal BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>is a signal which is the logical reverse of the control signal BIT<b>0</b>, therefore, one of the control signals BIT<b>0</b> and BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>is H (high) level, and the other is L (low) level. The level shifter circuit <b>605</b> applies a control signal BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>from the output terminal OUTb to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b><i>b</i><b>12</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>. The level shifter circuit <b>605</b> applies a control signal BIT<b>1</b> from the output terminal OUT to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>134</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>. The control signal BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>is a signal which is the logical reverse of the control signal BIT<b>1</b>, therefore, one of the control signals BIT<b>1</b> and BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>is H level, and the other is L level. By controlling the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b> by the level shifter circuits <b>604</b> and <b>605</b>, one of the analog gradation voltages V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> is output from the gradation selection circuit <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows the construction of the prior-art level shifter circuit <b>700</b> (the level shifter circuit <b>604</b> or <b>605</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows the operating state of the level shifter circuit <b>700</b> during a prior-art stress test.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the level shifter circuit <b>700</b> has a first reference potential supply line <b>701</b> to which an L level (GND) potential (or voltage) is applied, a second reference potential supply line <b>702</b> to which an H level potential (or voltage) is applied, a first PMOS transistor <b>711</b> and first NMOS transistor <b>712</b> connected in series sequentially from the second reference potential supply line <b>702</b> side, a second PMOS transistor <b>721</b> and second NMOS transistor <b>722</b> connected in series sequentially from the second reference potential supply line <b>702</b> side, a first connection line <b>714</b> which connects a gate <b>715</b> of the first PMOS transistor <b>711</b> to a drain <b>723</b> of the second NMOS transistor <b>722</b>, and a second connection line <b>724</b> which connects a gate <b>725</b> of the second PMOS transistor <b>721</b> to a drain <b>713</b> of the first NMOS transistor <b>712</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the level shifter circuit <b>700</b> further has a first input line <b>731</b> connected to the gate of the first NMOS transistor <b>712</b> into which a first input signal IN is input, a second input line <b>732</b> connected to the gate of the second NMOS transistor <b>722</b> into which a second input signal INb (i.e., a signal which is the logical reverse of the first signal IN) is input, a first output line <b>741</b> connected to the drain <b>713</b> of the first NMOS-transistor <b>712</b> which outputs a first output signal (i.e., a control signal which controls the gradation selection circuit) BITnb (n=0, 1, . . . ), and a second output line <b>742</b> connected to the drain <b>723</b> of the second NMOS transistor <b>722</b> which outputs a second output signal (i.e., a control signal which controls the gradation selection circuit) BITn (n=0, 1, . . . ). The prior-art level shifter circuit is disclosed, for example, by Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-Open) Publication No. 2002-84184.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, the stress test method of the gradation selection circuit (four gradations (2-BIT gradation) DAC) <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> will be described. To apply the test voltage to all six NMOS transistors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, N<b>02</b>, N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>3</b>, N<b>04</b>, N<b>134</b> and N<b>1</b><i>b</i><b>12</b>, it is necessary to perform a high voltage stress test with all four patterns of the four gradations of the analog output voltages V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b>. This is because, to destroy the latently defective parts in the NMOS transistors N<b>02</b> and N<b>04</b> and the NMOS transistors N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>3</b> which are controlled by the control signal BIT<b>0</b> or BIT<b>0</b><i>b</i>, these four NMOS transistors must be switched ON, and to destroy the latently defective parts in the NMOS transistors N<b>134</b> and N<b>1</b><i>b</i><b>12</b> which are controlled by the control signal BIT<b>1</b> or BIT<b>1</b><i>b</i>, these two NMOS transistors must be switched ON. For example, in an n-BIT gradation DAC, the number of transistors is (2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+ . . . +2<sup>n</sup>). Therefore, in an 8-BIT gradation DAC, the number of transistors per output is 510, and in an 8-BIT gradation <b>642</b> output DAC, the number of transistors is 510×642=327,420. Also, in order to apply a high voltage stress to the (2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+ . . . +2<sup>n</sup>) transistors, <b>2</b><sup>n </sup>patterns must be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in flat panel displays which display digital images or television, etc., in recent years, higher gradation displays, finer displays and display drive LSI with multiple outputs (increase in drive outputs) have come into demand. For example, the source electrode drive LSI for TFT liquid crystal panels have shifted from a 6-BIT gradation (about 260,000 colors) to an 8-BIT gradation (about 16,780,000 colors), moreover, trials are now being performed on a 10-BIT gradation (about 1 billion colors), and even higher gradations are expected to be realized in future. As regards the number of drive outputs of display drive LSI, in addition to the usual 384 outputs, 480 outputs, 642 outputs and even more outputs have come into practical use. To increase display contrast, there is a trend to increase the display drive voltage and LSI power supply voltage. Moreover, to provide the multiple gradations and multiple outputs of display drive LSI, there is a need for display drive LSI with very large-scale integrated circuits, and in costly display devices such as large televisions it is a matter of particular importance to reduce the initial failure rate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in a prior-art level shifter circuit which controls the transistor of a DAC forming a gradation selection circuit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, there are only two combinations of the output signals OUT (BIT<b>0</b>, BIT<b>1</b>) and OUTb (BIT<b>0</b><i>b</i>, BIT<b>1</b><i>b</i>) with the input signals IN and INb (output signal OUT is H level and OUTb is L level, or output signal OUT is L level and OUTb is H level), so a very large number of stress test patterns had to be input, and the stress test time was very long.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a level shifter circuit which can efficiently perform a stress test on a controlled circuit such as a gradation selection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A level shifter circuit, wherein a circuit which turns on when a first reference potential is input as a control potential is used as a first-type switching circuit, and a circuit which turns on when a second reference potential different from the first reference potential is input, is used as a second-type switching circuit, the level shifter circuit includes: a first reference potential supply line to which a first reference potential is applied; a second reference potential supply line to which a second reference potential different from the first reference potential is applied; a first output potential supply circuit including a first first-type switching circuit and a first second-type switching circuit connected sequentially in series from the second reference potential supply line side, the first output potential supply circuit being connected between the first reference potential supply line and the second reference potential supply line; a second output potential supply circuit including a second first-type switching circuit and a second second-type switching circuit connected sequentially in series from the second reference potential supply line side, the second output potential supply circuit being connected between the first reference potential supply line and the second reference potential supply line, the second output potential supply circuit being connected in parallel with the first output potential supply circuit between the first reference potential supply line and the second reference potential supply line; a first connection line which supplies a potential between the second first-type switching circuit and the second second-type switching circuit to a control terminal of the first first-type switching circuit; a second connection line which supplies a potential between the first first-type switching circuit and the first second-type switching circuit to a control terminal of the second first-type switching circuit; a first input line which supplies a first input signal to a control terminal of the first second-type switching circuit; a second input line which supplies a second input signal to a control terminal of the second second-type switching circuit; a first output line which outputs a potential between the first first-type switching circuit and the first second-type switching circuit as a first output signal; a second output line which outputs a potential between the second first-type switching circuit and the second second-type switching circuit as a second output signal; and a stress test circuit which changes over the first output signal and the second output signal output to a controlled circuit from the first output line and the second output line, to any one of a signal when the controlled circuit is operating normally and a signal when the controlled circuit is subjected to a stress test. The stress test circuit functions to during normal operation, when the first input signal and the second input signal having respectively different potentials are input to the first input line and the second input line, output the first output signal and the second output signal having respectively different potentials for the first output line and the second output line, and during the stress test, when the first input signal and the second input signal having respectively different potentials are input to the first input line and the second input line, output signals having identical potentials from the first output line and the second output line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, a signal having the same potential can be output from both the first output line and second output line during a stress test, so the stress test of the controlled circuit such as a gradation selection circuit can be efficiently performed.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows level shifter circuits in accordance with first, second and fourth embodiments of the present invention, and the construction of a gradation selection circuit functioning as a controlled circuit controlled by these level shifter circuits, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the operating state of the level shifter circuits and the gradation selection circuit during a stress test. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a drive circuit <b>2</b> is a circuit which drives a display panel (e.g., a liquid crystal panel) <b>3</b> of a display (e.g., a liquid crystal display apparatus), and it has level shifter circuits <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and a gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>. The controlled circuit which is controlled by the level shifter circuit of the present invention is not limited to the gradation selection circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, but may also be a circuit of different construction. For example, the gradation selection circuit driven by the level shifter circuit of the third and fifth embodiments of the present invention has a construction wherein the NMOS transistors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are replaced by PMOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a gradation selection operation of the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b> will be described. The level shifter circuit <b>4</b> applies a control signal BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>from the output terminal OUTb to the gates of the NMOS transistors N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and NOb<b>3</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>. The level shifter circuit <b>4</b> also applies a control signal BIT<b>0</b> from the output terminal OUT to the gates of the NMOS transistors N<b>02</b> and N<b>04</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>. The control signal BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>is a signal which is the logical reverse of the control signal BIT<b>0</b>, therefore, one of the control signals BIT<b>0</b> and BIT<b>0</b><i>b </i>is H (high) level and the other is L (low) level. The level shifter circuit <b>5</b> applies a control signal BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>from the output terminal OUTb to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b><i>b</i><b>12</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>. The level shifter circuit <b>5</b> also applies a control signal BIT<b>1</b> from the output terminal OUT to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>134</b> of the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>. The control signal BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>is a signal which is the logical reverse of the control signal BIT<b>1</b>, therefore, one of the control signals BIT<b>1</b> and BIT<b>1</b><i>b </i>is H level and the other is L level. From the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b>, any of the input analog gradation voltages V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> is output by controlling the gradation selection circuit <b>1</b> by the level shifter circuits <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, the stress test method of the gradation selection circuit (four gradation (2-BIT gradation) DAC) <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> will be described. In order to apply a stress test voltage to all six NMOS transistors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, it is necessary to perform a high voltage stress test with the four patterns of all four gradations of the analog output voltages V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b>. This is because to destroy the latently defective parts in the NMOS transistors N<b>02</b> and N<b>04</b> and the NMOS transistors N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and N<b>0</b><i>b</i><b>3</b> which are controlled by the control signal BIT<b>0</b> or BIT<b>0</b><i>b</i>, these four NMOS transistors must be switched ON, and to destroy the latently defective parts in the NMOS transistors N<b>134</b> and N<b>1</b><i>b</i><b>12</b> which are controlled by the control signal BIT<b>1</b> or BIT<b>1</b><i>b</i>, these two NMOS transistors must be switched ON. Further, during a stress test, a gradation voltage other than one arbitrary output gradation (one of V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b>) is arranged to be floating, or the same potential is applied to all the output gradation voltages V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the level shifter circuit <b>400</b> in accordance with the fourth embodiment, the layout area of the circuit can be made small. This is due to the following two reasons. The first reason is as follows. Test circuit control on the NMOS transistor side having a small voltage amplitude (i.e., voltage amplitude of gate input of NMOS transistor) is performed at low voltage amplitude (test signal TEST), and test circuit control on the PMOS transistor side having a large voltage amplitude is performed at high voltage amplitude (test signal TESTb). Hence, due to performing logic control on the low voltage side, it is possible to form a circuit layout of small area rather than form the circuit from high voltage transistors having a large layout area. The second reason is as follows. As the gate voltage on the input side (the transistor, e.g., NMOS transistor, which inputs the input signal IN or INb as the gate signal) of the level shifter circuit has a smaller voltage amplitude than the source-drain amplitude of the high voltage transistors, large dimensions (gate amplitude) are required to ensure a sufficient source-drain current Ids. Therefore, if a construction were adopted wherein low voltage amplitude transistors were connected in series to realize the level shifter circuit of the fourth embodiment, resistance components would be doubled due to the series connection, so the transistors would require approximately twice the gate amplitude (i.e., requiring an increase in the source-drain current Ids of the transistors by two times).</p>
