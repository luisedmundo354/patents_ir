<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to electrical connectors which connect electrical components together and more particularly to electrical connectors which can be adjusted to provide for different configurations of connecting members so that the connectors can be used with different electrical components.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical connectors are needed to connect electrical components together. As used herein, electrical components include cables, wires, patch panels and the like. Each connector is typically provided with a fixed configuration of male or female connecting members which enables it to connect only to an electrical component with the complementary configuration of connecting members. There is therefore no flexibility to use the same connector to connect to two or more electrical components having different configurations of connecting members.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be beneficial if a single connector were able to be re-configurable to connect to electrical components having different configurations of connecting members.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide new and improved electrical connectors which connect electrical components together.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide new and improved electrical connectors which are adjustable to provide different configurations of connecting members so that the same connectors can be used with electrical components having different configurations of connecting members.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide new and improved electrical connectors which are re-configurable to connect to electrical components having different configurations of connecting members.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve these objects and others, one embodiment of an electrical connector in accordance with the invention includes a pair of endcaps, a pair of elongate rails, each removably attached at one end to one of the endcaps (and possibly removably attached at each end to a respective endcap), and connector modules arranged between the endcaps and including one or more male or female connecting members adapted to electrically connect at a first end to one electrical component or connecting member thereof and at a second, opposite end to another electrical component or connecting member thereof. The connector modules are individual modules in the sense that they are separated from one another and movable relative to one another. When the rails are attached to the endcaps, the connector modules are fixed in position by the attachment of the rails to the endcaps, but when the rails are separated or detached from the endcaps, each connector module can be moved relative to the rails, i.e., slid off of the end of the rails. By arranging different numbers and types of connector modules along the rails between the endcaps, different configurations of connector modules and thus different connectors can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More specifically, in one configuration of the connector modules, all of the connector modules are identical and include a pre-determined number of male connecting members, e.g., pins, or female connecting members, e.g., sockets. To obtain a different configuration of connector modules, one or more of the connector modules is removed and replaced with a connector module having a different number of connecting members or possibly even with a blank, i.e., a module without any connecting members. Replacement of the connector modules(s) would be performed when the connector is intended to be used to connect to a different electrical component, i.e., an electrical component having a different complementary configuration of connecting members. Thus, when the connector modules are all identical, the connector connects to one electrical component and when the connector modules are not all identical, the connector connected to a second, different electrical component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By selecting particular connector modules and their relative position between the endcaps and/or orientation relative to the endcaps, numerous different configurations of connectors can be obtained. Moreover, changing between connector configurations is easy to perform as it entails simply separating or detaching the rails from the endcaps, moving one or more of the connector modules out of engagement with the rails, placing connector modules in the new, desired order and in engagement with the rails, and then re-attaching the rails and the endcaps together.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The endcaps may be different depending on whether the connector is used in a fixture or a receiver. In the former case, the fixture includes male endcaps each having a pair of coupling members oriented so that a projecting portion thereof is in the same direction as the mating surface whereas in the latter case, the receiver includes female endcaps each having a pair of similar coupling members oriented so that a recessed portion thereof is in the same direction as the mating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One particularly useful configuration of a female connector in accordance with the invention is one in which the connector is adapted for connection to a Virginia Panel Series 90 patch panel and wherein there are 480 Hypertronics contacts arranged in 48 connector modules each including 10 sockets. Another useful configuration is one in which the female connector is adapted for connection to a Mac Panel 60 RFI patch panel and wherein there are 500 Hypertronics contacts arranged in 50 connector modules each including 10 sockets.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To provide for engagement between the endcaps and the rails, each endcap includes a pair of channels on each side and each rail includes a pair of elongate projections having a form substantially complementary to the form of the channels, e.g., a dovetail form. Each projection on the rail is slidable into and along a respective channel on a respective side of the endcaps. That is, on each side of each endcap, there are two channels and each channel aligns with a respective one of the channels on the same side of the other endcap. One projection on the rail engages with each aligning pair of channels.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Screws or another attachment mechanism are used to removably attach the rails to the endcaps. Such screws may be placed at one or both ends of the rails so that the rails can be removably attached to only one endcap or to both endcaps.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A dielectric housing of the connector modules is also provided with a channel on each side having a form complementary to the form of one of the projections on the rail. Accordingly, in its assembled form, this projection on each rail is situated within the channel on a respective side of the housings of the connector modules to thereby secure the connector modules in place between the endcaps.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another way to consider the electrical connector in accordance with the invention is as a connector having individual connector modules each including at least one male or female connecting member adapted to electrically connect at a first end to a first electrical component or connecting member thereof and at a second, opposite end to a second electrical component or connecting member thereof, a pair of elongate rails and a pair of endcaps. Each connector module engages at one side with one rail and at an opposite side with the other rail. Each rail is removably attached at one end to one of the endcaps, and possibly at each end to a respective endcap. When the rails are separated or detached from the endcap(s), different configurations of connector modules are positionable between the endcaps, to thereby form different connectors in a similar manner as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Yet another way to consider an electrical connector in accordance with the invention is as a connector including a frame having a plurality of side members defining an interior space, at least a first side member being detachable from any remaining side members (or assembly thereof) to enable access to the interior space. The side members could be the endcaps and rails described above, with one of the endcaps being detachable from the remaining assembly of the rails and other endcap, or may be other forms of rigid members which cooperate to define a border around an interior space. Connector modules are arranged in the interior space defined by the side members. The connector modules are separated from one another and each includes at least one male or female connecting member adapted to electrically connect at a first end to a first electrical component or part thereof and at a second, opposite end to a second electrical component or part thereof. Each connector module is movable relative to any remaining side members (or assembly thereof) when the first side member is detached therefrom to enable different configurations of connector modules to be arranged in the interior space.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements, a first embodiment of an electrical connector in accordance with the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> and is designated generally as <b>10</b>. Connector <b>10</b> includes a pair of endcaps <b>12</b>, a pair of elongate rails <b>14</b> attached at their ends to the endcaps <b>12</b> and a plurality of connector modules <b>16</b> arranged between the endcaps <b>12</b> and in engagement with the rails <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Connector <b>10</b> is a male connector in the sense that the connector modules <b>16</b> all include only male connecting members, specifically pins <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>). Pins can be any known type of pins used in electrical connectors but in a preferred embodiment, the pins are Hypertronics pins designated YPN006-046H-A81, although other 0.024 round pins could be used as well. Pins <b>18</b> are held in place by a dielectric housing <b>20</b> to form each connector module <b>16</b>. Each pin <b>18</b> includes connecting projections each extending from a respective side of the housing <b>20</b>. Each lateral side <b>22</b> of the housing <b>20</b> includes a channel <b>24</b> in the form of a dovetail groove (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Endcaps <b>12</b> are male endcaps in the sense that they include a pair of coupling members <b>26</b> having projections <b>26</b>A oriented in the same direction as the pins <b>18</b> (i.e., in the direction of the mating surface) and recesses <b>26</b>B on an opposite side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>). Projections <b>26</b>A of the coupling members <b>26</b> are designed to mate with a complementary female coupling recess on another electrical component.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, endcaps <b>12</b> each have a housing <b>28</b> having a front side <b>30</b>, a rear side <b>32</b>, a top <b>34</b>, a bottom <b>36</b> and lateral sides <b>38</b>. Projections <b>26</b>A project from the top <b>34</b>. A flange <b>40</b> also extends upward at a rear of the housing <b>28</b> from the top <b>34</b> and has a rear surface contiguous with the rear side <b>32</b>. Screw holes <b>42</b> are formed in the lateral sides <b>38</b>, the purpose of which is explained below. Lateral sides <b>38</b> each include a channel <b>44</b>, and an additional, larger channel <b>46</b> is formed partially in the lateral side <b>38</b> and partially on the side of the flange <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Rails <b>14</b> each include a first projection <b>48</b> on an inner side extending along substantially the entire length of the rail <b>14</b> and a second projection <b>50</b> along the inner side extending along substantially the entire length of a stepped portion <b>52</b> of the rail <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). Projection <b>50</b> is wider than projection <b>48</b>, although different relative sizes of these projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Apertures <b>54</b> are provided proximate the longitudinal ends of the rails <b>14</b> and align with the screw holes <b>42</b> in the sides <b>38</b> of the housing <b>28</b> of the endcaps <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Screws <b>56</b> can therefore be inserted through apertures <b>54</b> into screw holes <b>42</b> and tightened to thereby secure the rails <b>14</b> at their longitudinal ends to the endcaps <b>12</b>. Instead of screws, other attachment mechanisms which enable the rails <b>14</b> to be selectively attachable to and detachable from the endcaps <b>12</b> can be provided in the invention without deviating from the scope and spirit thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> have a form, i.e., size and shape, substantially complementary to the form of channels <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, respectively, on the housing <b>28</b> of the endcaps <b>12</b>. As such, the endcaps <b>12</b> can be engaged with the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> on the rails <b>14</b> with the channels <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, respectively, on the endcaps <b>12</b> and sliding them into the respective channel <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To assemble connector <b>10</b>, one end of each rail <b>14</b> is attached to one endcap <b>12</b>, one rail <b>14</b> on each side of the endcap <b>12</b>, by inserting the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> on the rail <b>14</b> into the respective channel <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> on the housing <b>28</b> of the endcap <b>12</b>. Screws <b>56</b> are then inserted through apertures <b>54</b> into screw holes <b>42</b> and tightened. Connector modules <b>16</b> are selected for the particular use of the connector <b>10</b>, e.g., 48 of the connector modules <b>16</b> as shown, and each is slid along the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projection <b>50</b> on the rails <b>14</b> with the channels <b>24</b> on the lateral sides <b>22</b> of the housing <b>20</b>. Once the desired connector modules <b>16</b> are engaged with the rails <b>14</b> attached to one endcap <b>12</b>, the other endcap <b>12</b> is engaged with the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> with the channels <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in the housing <b>28</b> of the endcap <b>12</b>. Screws <b>56</b> are then inserted through apertures <b>54</b> into screw holes <b>42</b> in this second endcap <b>12</b> and tightened to thereby form connector <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If and when it is desired to reconfigure connector <b>10</b>, the rails <b>14</b> are detached from one of the endcaps <b>12</b> by loosening the screws <b>56</b> and removing them from the screw holes <b>42</b> and apertures <b>54</b>. The endcap <b>12</b> is then slid off of the rails <b>14</b> and the connector modules <b>16</b> are then also slidable off of the rails <b>14</b>. The different connector modules <b>16</b> sought to be used for the re-configured connector are then placed in engagement with the rails <b>14</b> in the desired order and once all of the connector modules <b>16</b> are in place, the endcap <b>12</b> and rails <b>14</b> are re-attached to one another. When reconfiguring the connector <b>10</b>, it is not required to detach both endcaps <b>12</b> from the rails <b>14</b> but rather only one of the endcaps <b>12</b> needs to be detached from the rails <b>14</b> to enable removal and replacement of the connector modules <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiments described above, the combination of the endcaps <b>12</b> and rails <b>14</b> defines a frame with a plurality of side members, at least one of which is separable from the remaining side members. During use of the connector <b>10</b>, this separable side member (either of the endcaps <b>12</b>) is fixed to the other side members (the rails <b>14</b> which in turn are fixed to the other one of the endcaps <b>12</b>) but when it is desired to re-configure the connector <b>10</b>, this separable side member is detached from the other side members to allow access to the interior of the frame, i.e., to allow the connector modules <b>16</b> in the interior of the frame to be removed and replaced as desired. Instead of endcaps <b>12</b> and rails <b>14</b>, other constructions for defining such a frame with an accessible interior are envisioned to be within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the frame could be defined by only two side members, namely, a U-shaped side member and an elongate side member which closes the opening of the U-shaped member and is removably attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-16</figref>, a second embodiment of an electrical connector in accordance with the invention is designated generally as <b>60</b> and includes a pair of endcaps <b>62</b>, a pair of elongate rails <b>14</b> as described above and a plurality of connector modules <b>64</b> arranged between the endcaps <b>62</b> and in engagement with the rails <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Connector <b>60</b> is a female connector in the sense that the connector modules <b>64</b> all include only female connecting members, specifically sockets <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Sockets <b>66</b> can be any known type of sockets used in electrical connectors but in a preferred embodiment, the sockets are Hypertronics part number YSK006-031AH-A81. Sockets <b>66</b> are held in place by a dielectric housing <b>68</b> to form each connector module <b>64</b>. Each socket <b>66</b> includes a receptacle at one end and a connecting projection extending from the housing <b>68</b> at the other. Each lateral side of the housing <b>68</b> includes a channel in the form of a dovetail groove in a similar manner as housing <b>20</b> of connector module <b>16</b> includes a channel <b>24</b> in the form of a dovetail groove.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Endcaps <b>62</b> are female endcaps in the sense that they include a pair of coupling members <b>70</b> having a receptacle or recess <b>70</b>A oriented inward in the same direction as the sockets <b>66</b> (i.e., in the direction of the mating surface) and a projection <b>70</b>B on an opposite side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>). Recesses <b>70</b>A are designed to accept a screw to fasten the connector <b>60</b> to, for example, a Virginia Panel Series 90 patch panel. Projections <b>70</b>B are designed to mate with a complementary female coupling (or recess) on the patch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Endcaps <b>62</b> each have a housing <b>72</b> having a front side <b>74</b>, a rear side <b>76</b>, a top <b>78</b>, a bottom <b>80</b> and lateral sides <b>82</b>. A flange <b>86</b> extends upward at a rear of the housing <b>72</b> from the top <b>78</b> and has a rear surface contiguous with the rear side <b>76</b>. Screw holes <b>88</b> are formed in the lateral sides <b>82</b>, the purpose of which is explained below. Lateral sides <b>82</b> each include a channel <b>90</b> and an additional, larger channel <b>92</b> is formed partially in the lateral side <b>82</b> and partially on the side of the flange <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Channels <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> have a form, i.e., size and shape, substantially complementary to the form of projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, respectively, on the rails <b>14</b>. As such, the endcaps <b>62</b> can be engaged with the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> on the rails <b>14</b> with the channels <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively, on the endcaps <b>12</b> and sliding them into the respective channel <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To assemble connector <b>60</b>, one end of each rail <b>14</b> is attached to one endcap <b>62</b>, one rail <b>14</b> on each side of the endcap <b>62</b>, by inserting the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> on the rail <b>14</b> into the respective channel <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> on the housing <b>72</b> of the endcap <b>62</b>. Screws <b>56</b> are then inserted through apertures <b>54</b> into screw holes <b>88</b> and tightened. Connector modules <b>64</b> are selected for the particular use of the connector <b>10</b>, e.g., <b>48</b> of the connector modules <b>64</b> as shown, and each is slid along the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projection <b>50</b> on the rails <b>14</b> with the channels on the lateral sides of the housing <b>68</b>. Once the desired connector modules <b>64</b> are engaged with the rails <b>14</b> attached to one endcap <b>62</b>, the other endcap <b>62</b> is engaged with the rails <b>14</b> by aligning the projections <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> with the channels <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> in the housing <b>72</b> of the endcap <b>62</b>. Screws <b>56</b> are then inserted through apertures <b>54</b> into screw holes <b>88</b> in this second endcap <b>62</b> and tightened to thereby form connector <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If and when it is desired to reconfigure connector <b>60</b>, the rails <b>14</b> are detached from one of the endcaps <b>62</b> by loosening the screws <b>56</b> and removing them from the screw holes <b>88</b> and apertures <b>54</b>. The endcap <b>62</b> is then slid off of the rails <b>14</b> and the connector modules <b>64</b> are then also slidable off of the rails <b>14</b>. The different connector modules <b>64</b> sought to be used for the re-configured connector are then placed in engagement with the rails <b>14</b> in the desired order and once all of the connector modules <b>64</b> are in place, the endcap <b>62</b> and rails <b>14</b> are re-attached to one another. When reconfiguring the connector <b>60</b>, it is not required to detach both endcaps <b>62</b> from the rails <b>14</b> but rather only one of the endcaps <b>62</b> needs to be detached from the rails <b>14</b> to enable removal and replacement of the connector modules <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The illustrated connector modules <b>16</b>, <b>64</b> include ten, identical pins <b>18</b> or ten, identical sockets <b>66</b>. Alternative connector modules <b>16</b>, <b>64</b> can be used in the invention provided each has the same general form of housing, i.e., a channel on each side which can engage with one of the projections on the rails <b>14</b>. For example, possible connector modules include one which has a different number of male connecting members, one which has different male connecting members (i.e., different types of pins alongside one another), and one which could conceivably have both a male and a female connecting member. In one embodiment, different pins are used depending on the signal intended to be used, i.e., the signal being conveyed through the connector. Of course, whatever configuration is used for one connector must have a complementary configuration in an electrical component to which the connector is to be mated. Typically, the existence of electrical components with known connecting member configurations will determine the manner in which the connector modules will be assembled in a connector in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In connectors <b>10</b>, <b>60</b>, the coupling members <b>26</b> and <b>70</b> are shown mounted onto the endcaps <b>12</b>, <b>62</b>, respectively, and this is designed to ensure that the connectors <b>10</b>, <b>60</b> align properly into the mating receiver or fixture. In a similar manner, the receiver and fixture also have alignment points that ensure that they mate properly.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is conceivable that in some connectors in accordance with the invention, there may be blank modules which do not contain any connecting members. Such blank modules could serve to position other connecting modules at desired locations intermediate the endcaps <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Regarding the material composition of the connectors <b>10</b>, <b>60</b>, the rails <b>14</b> and endcaps <b>12</b>, <b>62</b> can be made of a metal, such as aircraft-grade aluminum, which provides them with an acceptable level of rigidity for use (which level would be understood or readily determinable by those skilled in the art). The connector modules <b>16</b>, <b>64</b> are made of a material selected based on its electrical properties, such as glass-filled nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects, and, therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although in the illustrated embodiment, the rails includes two projections and endcaps include two complementary channels, it is possible to form the rails with only one projection in which case, this projection would pass through a single channel formed in the endcap housings and also through the single channel formed in the connector module housings.</p>
