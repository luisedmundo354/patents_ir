<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a peripheral circuit of a scan chain and particularly to a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a conventional scan chain. It includes five (for example) shift registers <b>11</b>˜<b>15</b> connected in series. Each of the shift registers <b>11</b>˜<b>15</b> is a scan cell. The first shift register <b>11</b> receives a data signal from a tester (not shown). In response to a clock signal, the bits carried by the data signal are forwarded through the shift registers <b>11</b>˜<b>15</b> one by one and stored therein. Then, the stored bits are sent to a device under test (DUT). The data with which the DUT responds to the scan chain is sent back to the tester for data comparison. Results of the data comparison determine whether the DUT fails.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The results of the data comparison are reliable only when the scan chain operates correctly. If any one of the shift register <b>11</b>˜<b>15</b> malfunctions so that its output gets stuck at “1”, the final output of the scan chain will also get stuck at “1” despite any “0” bit in the data signal. However, in the conventional scan chain, there is no means for monitoring the scan cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present invention is to provide a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain, which monitors inputs and outputs of the scan cells, and interrupts the forwarding of the bits between the cells if some necessary corrections are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain. The circuit comprises a group of first scan cells connected in series, receiving a first data signal and outputting a second data signal, a multiplexer receiving the first and second data signal, and selectively outputting the first and second data signal in response to a selection signal, and a group of second scan cells connected in series, receiving the first or second data signal from the multiplexer, and outputting a third data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention further provides a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain. The circuit comprises a group of first scan cells connected in series, receiving a first data signal and outputting a second data signal, a first control gate receiving the second data signal and a first enable signal, and selectively outputting the second and a third data signal in response to the first enable signal, and a group of second scan cells connected in series, receiving the second or third data signal from the first control gate, and outputting a fourth data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also provides a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain. The circuit comprises a group of first scan cells connected in series, receiving a first data signal and outputting a second data signal, a first multiplexer receiving the second and a third data signal, and selectively outputting the second and third data signal in response to a first selection signal, a group of second scan cells connected in series, receiving the second or third data signal from the first multiplexer, and outputting a fourth data signal, a second multiplexer receiving the second and fourth data signal, and selectively outputting the second and fourth data signal in response to a second selection signal, a third multiplexer receiving the second and fourth data signal, and selectively outputting the second and fourth data signal in response to a third selection signal, and an XOR gate receiving the second or fourth data signal from the second multiplexer, and the second or fourth data signal from the third multiplexer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, in the present invention, the scan cells are divided into groups, and a multiplexer or control gate selectively blocks the output from one group of cells to dominate the input to the following group of cells. This provides a means for monitoring the scan chain.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain according to a first embodiment of the invention. It includes three groups of scan cells <b>21</b>˜<b>23</b>, for example, and two multiplexers <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. There are scan cells (shift registers) <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>223</b>, and <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>233</b> in the groups <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> respectively. The scan cell group <b>21</b> receives a data signal IN from a tester (not shown). In response to a clock signal, the bits carried by the data signal IN are forwarded through the cells <b>211</b>˜<b>213</b>, whereby the scan cell group <b>21</b> outputs a data signal at a terminal OB<b>1</b> to the multiplexer <b>24</b>. The multiplexer <b>24</b> receives both of the signals from the tester and the scan cell group <b>21</b>, and selects one of the received signals to be transferred to the following scan cell group <b>22</b> in response to a selection signal. Similarly, in response to the clock signal, the bits carried by the data signal from the multiplexer <b>24</b> are forwarded through the cells <b>221</b>˜<b>223</b>, whereby the scan cell group <b>22</b> outputs a data signal at a terminal OB<b>2</b> to the multiplexer <b>25</b>. The multiplexer <b>25</b> receives both of the signals from the tester and the scan cell group <b>22</b>, and selects one of the received signals to be transferred to the following scan cell group <b>23</b> in response to the selection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, counters (not shown) may be connected to receive the data signals at the terminals OB<b>1</b> and OB<b>2</b> to count the number of is and 0s in the data signals. An embedded memory device may be used to store the data carried by the data signals for data analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a circuit for control and observation of a scan chain according to a second embodiment of the invention. The same elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> refer to the same symbol for clarity. It includes scan cells <b>211</b>˜<b>213</b>, <b>221</b>˜<b>223</b>, and <b>231</b>˜<b>233</b> (shift registers) connected in series, and control gates <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. In response to a clock signal, a bit input to each of the cells <b>211</b>˜<b>213</b>, <b>221</b>˜<b>223</b>, and <b>231</b>˜<b>233</b> are forwarded. The control gate <b>31</b> receives a data signal from the cell <b>213</b> and an enable signal EN<b>1</b>. The control gate <b>31</b> selects the signal from the cell <b>213</b> or a signal carrying predetermined data to be transferred to the cell <b>221</b> in response to the enable signal EN<b>1</b>. That is to say, the control gate <b>31</b> will block the output from the cell <b>213</b> and dominate the input of the cell <b>221</b> when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is asserted. Similarly, multiplexer <b>24</b> receives both of the signals from the tester and the scan cell group <b>21</b>, and selects one of the received signals to be transferred to the following scan cell group <b>22</b> in response to a selection signal. Similarly, the control gate <b>32</b> receives a data signal from the cell <b>213</b> and an enable signal EN<b>1</b>. The control gate <b>31</b> selects the signal from the cell <b>223</b> or a signal carrying predetermined data to be transferred to the cell <b>231</b> in response to the enable signal EN<b>2</b>. That is to say, the control gate <b>32</b> will block the output from the cell <b>223</b> and dominate the input of the cell <b>231</b> when the enable signal EN<b>2</b> is asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, counters (not shown) may be connected to receive the data signals at the terminals OB<b>1</b> and OB<b>2</b> to count the number of is and 0s in the data signals. An embedded memory device may be used to store the data carried by the data signals for data analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A˜4D</figref> are diagrams showing the control gates used in the second embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the control gate <b>31</b> may be an AND gate <b>41</b>. The AND gate <b>41</b> outputs a low logic voltage level representing the bit “0” when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the low logic voltage level, and transfers the signal output from the cell <b>213</b> when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at a hihg logic voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the control gate <b>31</b> may be an OR gate <b>42</b>. The OR gate <b>42</b> outputs the high logic voltage level representing the bit “1” when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the high logic voltage level, and transfers the signal output from the cell <b>213</b> when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the low logic voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the control gate <b>31</b> may be an XOR gate <b>43</b>. The XOR gate <b>43</b> outputs an inverted signal of the signal from the cell <b>213</b> when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the high logic voltage level, and transfers the signal output from the cell <b>213</b> when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the low logic voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the control gate <b>31</b> may be a multiplexer <b>44</b>. The multiplexer <b>44</b> receives a data signal TD<b>1</b> and the signal output from the cell <b>213</b>. The multiplexer <b>44</b> selects the signal from the cell <b>213</b> to be transferred, when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at the high logic voltage level, and selects the data signal TD<b>1</b> to be transferred when the enable signal EN<b>1</b> is at a low logic voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, the enable signal EN<b>1</b> may be derived from an embedded memory or another control gate circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. An XOR gate <b>52</b> receives the signal from the cell <b>213</b> and a data signal EDI. The XOR gate <b>52</b> outputs the low logic voltage level when the received bits of the two signals are the same, and outputs the high logic voltage level when the received bits of the two signals are different. A control gate <b>51</b> receives an enable signal DebugEN and the signal output from the XOR gate <b>52</b>, and generates the enable signal EN<b>1</b>. The control gate <b>31</b> selects the signal from the cell <b>213</b> to be transferred when the XOR gate <b>52</b> outputs the low logic voltage level and the enable signal DebugEN is at the high logic voltage level, and selects the signal EDI carrying predetermined data to be transferred when the XOR gate <b>52</b> outputs the high logic voltage level and the enable signal DebugEN is at the high logic voltage level.
