<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a nonvolatile memory device having a shallow trench isolation (STI) structure and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the trend in the field of semiconductor devices continues toward higher density integration, the demand and need for decreasing the fine linewidth of a gate and the width of a device isolation layer also grows. Shallow trench isolation (STI) technology has become more widely adopted and used than local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) technology because a narrower and deeper device isolation layer can be formed. However, STI technology requires the use of a diffusion barrier layer to prevent deterioration of an interface between a semiconductor substrate and a device isolation layer, and a groove is formed between the device isolation layer and an active region. This results in generation of a leakage current and deterioration of a gate oxide layer. In order to overcome such problems, a self-aligned trench technology has recently been employed in which a gate oxide layer is formed during formation of a trench isolation layer to simplify the process. Since the trench isolation layer is formed after formation of the gate oxide layer and ion implantation, the conventional problems associated with STI technology can be solved. Unfortunately, in spite of the foregoing advantages, the self-aligned trench technology suffers from several problems that occur while fabricating semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a top, plan view for explaining a general nonvolatile memory, in which region “a” represents a cell array region and region “b” represents a peripheral circuit region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, device isolation layers <b>108</b> (<b>208</b>) are disposed over a semiconductor substrate in the cell array region “a” along one direction. A plurality of control gate electrodes <b>112</b> is located across an active region <b>106</b> between the device isolation layers <b>108</b> (<b>208</b>). A floating gate “F” is disposed between the control gate electrode <b>112</b> and the active region <b>106</b>. A transistor in the peripheral circuit region “b” includes a gate electrode <b>114</b> crossing an active region <b>107</b> defined by the device isolation layers <b>108</b> (<b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref> illustrate flow diagrams for explaining problems of a conventional memory device, which are taken along a line I-I′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a gate oxide layer <b>102</b>, a lower conductive layer <b>104</b>, and a hard mask layer <b>105</b> are sequentially formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> with a cell array region “a” and a peripheral circuit region “b”. Thickness of the gate oxide layer may be different in the cell array region and the peripheral circuit region. The hard mask layer <b>105</b>, the lower conductive layer <b>104</b>, and the gate oxide layer <b>102</b> are sequentially patterned to form a lower conductive pattern <b>104</b> and a hard mask pattern <b>105</b> that are sequentially stacked in the cell array region “a” and the peripheral circuit region “b”. The cell gate oxide layer (tunnel oxide layer) <b>102</b> is disposed between the lower conductive pattern <b>104</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in the cell array region “a”. Also, the gate oxide layer <b>102</b> is disposed between the lower conductive layer pattern <b>104</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in the peripheral circuit region “b”. Using the hard mask pattern <b>105</b> as an etch mask, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is etched to form a trench area “T” and to define first and second active regions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> in the regions “a” and “b”, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a device isolation layer <b>108</b> is formed in the trench area “T” by first forming an insulating layer to fill the trench area “T”. The insulting layer is then etched to expose the hard mask pattern <b>105</b> using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technique and thereafter recessed to form the device isolation layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Prior to the formation of the insulating layer, defects in the semiconductor substrate that formed during formation of the trench area “T” are recovered by a process whereby a thermal oxide layer is formed. In this process, a sidewall of the lower conductive pattern <b>104</b> is also oxidized, and an edge of the lower conductive layer pattern <b>104</b> is bent by a tensile stress applied thereto. Thus, the lower conductive pattern <b>104</b> has a structure where the width at a lower portion is larger than the width at an upper portion. Also, the device isolation layer <b>108</b> protruding into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> has a structure where the width at an upper portion is larger than the width at a lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, hard mask patterns <b>105</b> on the first and second active regions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> are removed. Generally, the hard mask layer is made of silicon nitride, and the hard mask patterns <b>105</b> may be etched by wet etch using the solution of phosphoric acid. An upper conductive layer is formed over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate from which the hard mask patterns <b>105</b> have been removed. The upper conductive layer is then patterned to form a floating gate pattern, which comprises the upper and lower conducive layer <b>104</b>, on the first active region <b>106</b>. A gate interlayer dielectric film and a control gate conductive layer are formed to cover the cell array region “a”. In the cell array region “a”, the control gate conductive layer, the gate interlayer dielectric film, and the floating gate pattern are sequentially patterned to form a control gate electrode (<b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) crossing the first active region <b>106</b> and a floating gate (“F” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) disposed between the gate electrode (<b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the first active region <b>106</b>. The gate electrode <b>114</b> consists of a lower gate electrode <b>104</b> and an upper gate electrode <b>111</b>. In the peripheral circuit region “b”, the upper conductive layer and lower conductive layer <b>104</b> are sequentially patterned to form a gate electrode <b>114</b> crossing the second active region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the prior art, an upper width of the device isolation layer <b>108</b> protruding into the semiconductor substrate is larger than a lower width thereof. This causes a stringer <b>113</b>, which remains along a boundary of the first and second active regions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> in a process for forming a control gate (not shown) in the cell array region “a” and a gate electrode <b>114</b> in the peripheral circuit region “b”. Since the stringer electrically connects adjacent floating gates “F” (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the cell array region “a” to each other, it is difficult to program one cell transistor independently.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With a view towards avoiding the shortcomings and problems of the prior art, the present invention provides a nonvolatile semiconductor memory having a device isolation layer structure for preventing the formation of a stringer along a boundary of a device isolation layer and an active region, and provides a method of fabricating the same.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Korean Patent Application No. 2001-30818, filed on Jun. 1, 2001, and entitled: “Nonvolatile Memory Device Having STI Structure and Method of Fabricating the Same,” is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cell array region “a” of a nonvolatile memory device according to the present invention includes a plurality of parallel device isolating layers <b>208</b> formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and a plurality of control gate electrodes <b>112</b> each crossing the device isolation layers <b>208</b>. The device isolation layer <b>208</b> has a protruding portion that is higher than the surface of the semiconductor substrate. A lower width of the protruding portion is larger than an upper width thereof. Therefore, unlike in a conventional nonvolatile memory, it is possible to prevent a stringer from remaining at a boundary of the device isolation layer <b>208</b> and an active region <b>106</b> in the processing of patterning the control gate electrode <b>112</b> and the floating gate “F”.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the control gate electrodes <b>112</b> crosses a first active region <b>106</b> between the device isolation layers <b>208</b>. The floating gate “F” is disposed between the control gate electrode <b>112</b> and the first active region <b>106</b>. The floating gate “F” consists of a lower floating gate <b>204</b> on the first active region <b>106</b>, and an upper floating gate <b>109</b> covering the lower floating gate <b>204</b> and partially overlapping with the device isolation layer <b>208</b>. Also the floating gate “F” is insulated from the first active region <b>106</b> by a tunnel oxide layer <b>102</b>, and is insulated from the control gate electrode <b>112</b> by a gate interlayer dielectric film <b>110</b>. The control gate electrode <b>112</b> may be made of polysilicon, or polysilicon and metal silicide that are stacked. A capping insulating layer may further be formed over the control gate electrode <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A peripheral circuit region “b” of the nonvolatile memory device includes a device isolation layer <b>208</b> and a gate electrode <b>214</b> that are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The gate electrode <b>214</b> crosses a second active region <b>107</b> between the device isolation layers <b>208</b>. Also the gate electrode <b>214</b> consists of a lower gate electrode <b>204</b> on the second active region <b>107</b> and an upper gate electrode <b>211</b> crossing the second active region arid covering the lower gate electrode <b>204</b>. A gate oxide layer <b>102</b> is disposed between the second active region <b>107</b> and the gate electrode <b>214</b>. The upper gate electrode <b>211</b> is made of polysilicon, or polysilicon and metal silicide that are stacked. A capping insulating layer may further be formed over the control gate electrode <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described herein below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, taken along line II-II′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an oxide layer <b>102</b>, a lower conductive layer <b>204</b>, and a hard mask layer <b>105</b> are sequentially formed on a semiconductor substrate having a cell array region “a” and a peripheral circuit region “b”. The thickness of the oxide layers in the cell array region “a” and in the peripheral circuit region “b” may be different. The lower conductive layer may be made of polysilicon, either doped or undoped. The hard mask layer is made of a material having an etch selectivity with respect to the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, e.g., silicon nitride or silicon nitride and oxide that are stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The hard mask layer <b>105</b>, the lower conductive layer <b>204</b>, and the oxide layer <b>102</b> are patterned to expose a device isolation area <b>101</b>. In the process of exposing the device isolation area <b>101</b>, a photoresist pattern (not shown) is formed on the hard mask layer <b>105</b>. Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the hard mask layer <b>105</b> is etched to form a hard mask pattern <b>105</b>. Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the lower conductive layer <b>204</b> is etched to form a lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b>. In this case, the lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b> has a sloped sidewall profile where the width at an upper portion is larger than the width at a lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, after formation of the hard mask pattern <b>105</b>, CF<sub>4 </sub>gas of 40 sccm is introduced to remove native oxide as well as particles on the exposed lower conductive layer <b>204</b> in a chamber under a pressure of 25 mT and at a plasma power of 300 W for about five seconds. After changing the chamber pressure to 30 mT and applying a plasma power of 250 W, HBr of 90 sccm, Cl<sub>2 </sub>of 30 sccm and a mixture gas of He and O<sub>2 </sub>of 8 sccm are introduced to suppress production of polymer in the etching process. Then, the lower conductive layer <b>204</b> is etched. If a mixed gas of He and O<sub>2 </sub>increases in amount, a lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b> has a sidewall profile where a difference between the width at an upper portion and the width at a lower portion becomes greater. As the ratio of Cl<sub>2 </sub>to HBr is increased, the difference between the width at an upper portion and the width at a lower portion also increases.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, the oxide layer is etched to expose a device isolation area <b>101</b>. As a result, a tunnel oxide layer <b>102</b>, a lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b>, and a hard mask pattern <b>105</b> are formed which are sequentially stacked on the cell array region “a”, and a gate oxide layer <b>102</b>, a lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b> having a sloped sidewall profile, and a hard mask pattern <b>105</b> are formed which are sequentially formed on the peripheral circuit region “b”.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, using the hard mask pattern <b>105</b> as an etch mask, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is anisotropically etched to form a trench area “T” and define first and second active regions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> in the cell array region “a” and the peripheral circuit region “b”, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an insulating layer to fill the trench area “T” is formed on an entire surface of the semiconductor substrate where the trench area “T” is formed. This insulating layer intended for device isolation is made of O<sub>3</sub>-tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) oxide or high-density-plasma (HDP) CVD oxide. The insulating layer is etched by CMP to expose a top surface of the hard mask pattern <b>105</b> and form a device isolation layer <b>208</b> in the trench area “T”. As a result, a protruding portion of the device isolation layer <b>208</b> has a sidewall profile where the width at a lower portion is greater than the width at an upper portion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to recover a defect of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> which occurs during an etch process for forming the trench area “T”, it is more preferable to further form a thermal oxide layer on a surface of the trench area “T” before formation of the insulating layer. Also, the top surface of the device isolation layer <b>208</b> is preferably recessed to decrease a height of the device isolation layer <b>208</b> protruding on the semiconductor substrate, after formation of the device isolation layer <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although not shown in the drawing, the hard mask pattern <b>105</b> on the first and second active regions <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> is removed to expose the lower conductive layer pattern <b>204</b>. Subsequent processes are conventionally carried out to form a control gate electrode crossing the first active region <b>106</b> in the cell array region “a” and a gate electrode crossing the second active region <b>107</b> in the peripheral circuit region “b”.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the present invention, the sidewall of the protruding portion of a device isolation layer is obliquely formed. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a stringer from remaining along a boundary of the device isolation layer and an active region while forming a gate electrode in a cell array region and a gate electrode in a peripheral circuit region.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In summary, the present invention makes it possible to prevent errors caused by a stringer formed at a boundary of a trench isolation layer and an active region, while writing, erasing, and reading a cell transistor. As a result of the present invention as disclosed and described above, production yield may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed herein and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purpose of limitation. Accordingly, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
