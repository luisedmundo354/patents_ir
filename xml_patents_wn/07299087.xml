<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to myocardial ischemia (or myocardial infarction) diagnosis and analysis, and, in particular, to a system and method for providing diagnosis and monitoring of myocardial ischemia for use in automated patient care throughout disease onset, progression, regression, and status quo.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Presently, myocardial ischemia, usually from the narrowing of the coronary arteries as a result of atherosclerosis, is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease-related deaths in the world. Clinically, myocardial ischemia involves a decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the myocardium resulting from diminished coronary artery blood flow which in turn leads primarily to abnormalities of left ventricular function and cardiac rhythm and the consequences thereof. Myocardial ischemia occurs when the demands of the heart for oxygen and nutrients are not met commensurately by available blood supply. The physiological effects of myocardial ischemia range from minimal to a complete failure of cardiac pumping function depending upon the degree of myocardial involvement and/or associated cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia include chest pain or discomfort (angina); respiratory distress, including shortness of breath; fatigue; reduced exercise capacity or tolerance; and nausea.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several factors make the early diagnosis and prevention of myocardial ischemia, as well as the monitoring of the progression of myocardial ischemia, relatively difficult. First, the onset of myocardial ischemia is generally subtle and sometimes occurs without any clinical manifestations perceptible to the patient. Often, the symptoms are mild and ignored. The patient may also compensate by changing his or her daily activities in an unconscious manner to minimize symptoms. As a result, myocardial ischemia can remain undiagnosed until more serious problems arise, such as severe congestive heart failure leading to cardiac arrest or pulmonary edema. Moreover, the susceptibility to suffer from myocardial ischemia depends upon the patient's age, sex, physical condition, and other factors, such as diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol and homocystine levels. No one factor is dispositive. Finally, annual or even monthly checkups provide, at best, a “snapshot” of patient wellness and the incremental and subtle clinicophysiological changes which portend the onset or progression of myocardial ischemia often go unnoticed, even with regular health care. Documentation of subtle changes following initiation of therapy, that can guide and refine further evaluation and therapy, can be equally elusive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nevertheless, taking advantage of frequently and regularly measured physiological measures, such as recorded manually by a patient, via an external monitoring or therapeutic device, or via implantable device technologies, can provide a degree of detection and prevention heretofore unknown. For instance, patients already suffering from some form of treatable heart disease often receive an implantable pulse generator (IPG), cardiovascular monitor, therapeutic device, or similar external wearable device, with which rhythm and structural problems of the heart can be monitored and treated. These types of devices are useful for detecting physiological changes in patient conditions through the retrieval and analysis of telemetered signals stored in an on-board, volatile memory. Typically, these devices can store more than thirty minutes of per heartbeat data recorded on a per heartbeat, binned average basis, or on a derived basis from, for example, a trial or ventricular electrical activity, ST and T wave electrocardiographic changes, coronary sinus blood flow and composition, cardiac enzyme release, minute ventilation, patient activity score, cardiac output score, mixed venous oxygen score, cardiovascular pressure measures, and the like. However, the proper analysis of retrieved telemetered signals requires detailed medical subspecialty knowledge, particularly by cardiologists.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively, these telemetered signals can be remotely collected and analyzed using an automated patient care system. One such system is described in a related, commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,378, issued Nov. 6, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A medical device adapted to be implanted in an individual patient records telemetered signals that are then retrieved on a regular, periodic basis using an interrogator or similar interfacing device. The telemetered signals are downloaded via an internetwork onto a network server on a regular, e.g., daily, basis and stored as sets of collected measures in a database along with other patient care records. The information is then analyzed in an automated fashion and feedback, which includes a patient status indicator, is provided to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While such an automated system can serve as a valuable tool in providing remote patient care, an approach to systematically correlating and analyzing the raw collected telemetered signals, as well as manually collected physiological measures, through applied cardiovascular medical knowledge to accurately diagnose the onset of a particular medical condition, such as myocardial ischemia, is needed. One automated patient care system directed to a patient-specific monitoring function is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,869 ('869) to Nappholz et al. The '869 patent discloses an implantable, programmable electrocardiography (ECG) patient monitoring device that senses and analyzes ECG signals to detect ECG and physiological signal characteristics predictive of malignant cardiac arrhythmias. The monitoring device can communicate a warning signal to an external device when arrhythmias are predicted. Like the ECG morphology of malignant cardiac tachycardias, the electrocardiographic diagnosis of myocardial ischemia is well established and can be readily predicted using on-board signal detection techniques. However, the Nappholz device is limited to detecting tachycardias. The Nappholz device is patient specific and is unable to automatically take into consideration a broader patient or peer group history for reference to detect and consider the progression or improvement of myocardial ischemia. In addition, the Nappholz device does not take into account other physiological or chemical measures indicative of myocardial ischemia. Moreover, the Nappholz device has a limited capability to automatically self-reference multiple data points in time and cannot detect disease regression even in the individual patient. Also, the Nappholz device must be implanted and cannot function as an external monitor. Finally, the Nappholz device is incapable of tracking the cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary consequences of any rhythm disorder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, there is a need for a systematic approach to detecting trends in regularly collected physiological and chemical data indicative of the onset, progression, regression, or status quo of myocardial ischemia diagnosed and monitored using an automated, remote patient care system. The physiological data could be telemetered signals data recorded either by an external or an implantable medical device or, alternatively, individual measures collected through manual means. Preferably, such an approach would be capable of diagnosing both myocardial ischemia conditions, as well as the symptoms of other diseases. In addition, findings from individual, peer group, and general population patient care records could be integrated into continuous, on-going monitoring and analysis.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a system and method for diagnosing and monitoring the onset, progression, regression, and status quo of myocardial ischemia using an automated collection and analysis patient care system. Measures of patient cardiovascular information are either recorded by an external or implantable medical device, such as an IPG, cardiovascular or heart failure monitor, or other therapeutic device, or manually through conventional patient-operable means. The measures are collected on a regular, periodic basis for storage in a database along with other patient care records. Derived measures are developed from the stored measures. Select stored and derived measures are analyzed and changes in patient condition are logged. The logged changes are compared to quantified indicator thresholds to detect the principal cardiovascular pathophysiological manifestations of myocardial ischemia: ST segment and/or T wave changes on the ECG, left ventricular wall motion changes, increased coronary sinus lactate production, increased serum creating kinase, increased serum troponin, increased ventricular arrhythmias, increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and reduced cardiac output.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An embodiment of the present invention is an automated system and method for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia and outcomes thereof. A plurality of monitoring sets is retrieved from a database. Each of the monitoring sets includes recorded measures relating to patient information recorded on a substantially continuous basis. A patient status change is determined by comparing at least one recorded measure from each of the monitoring sets to at least one other recorded measure. Both recorded measures relate to the same type of patient information. Each patient status change is tested against an indicator threshold corresponding to the same type of patient information as the recorded measures that were compared. The indicator threshold corresponds to a quantifiable physiological measure of a pathophysiology indicative of myocardial ischemia.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further embodiment is an automated collection and analysis patient care system and method for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia and outcomes thereof. A plurality of monitoring sets is retrieved from a database. Each monitoring set includes recorded measures that each relate to patient information and include either medical device measures or derived measures calculable therefrom. The medical device measures are recorded on a substantially continuous basis. A set of indicator thresholds is defined. Each indicator threshold corresponds to a quantifiable physiological measure of a pathophysiology indicative of myocardial ischemia and relates to the same type of patient information as at least one of the recorded measures. A myocardial ischemia finding is diagnosed. A change in patient status is determined by comparing at least one recorded measure to at least one other recorded measure with both recorded measures relating to the same type of patient information. Each patient status change is compared to the indicator threshold corresponding to the same type of patient information as the recorded measures that were compared.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further embodiment is an automated patient care system and method for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia and outcomes thereof. Recorded measures organized into a monitoring set for an individual patient are stored into a database. Each recorded measure is recorded on a substantially continuous basis and relates to at least one aspect of monitoring angina, reduced exercise capacity and/or respiratory distress. A plurality of the monitoring sets is periodically retrieved from the database. At least one measure related to myocardial ischemia onset, progression, regression, and status quo is evaluated. A patient status change is determined by comparing at least one recorded measure from each of the monitoring sets to at least one other recorded measure with both recorded measures relating to the same type of patient information. Each patient status change is tested against an indicator threshold corresponding to the same type of patient information as the recorded measures that were compared. The indicator threshold corresponds to a quantifiable physiological measure of a pathophysiology indicative of angina, reduced exercise capacity and/or respiratory distress.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides a capability to detect and track subtle trends and incremental changes in recorded patient information for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia. When coupled with an enrollment in a remote patient monitoring service having the capability to remotely and continuously collect and analyze external or implantable medical device measures, myocardial ischemia detection, prevention, and tracking regression from therapeutic maneuvers become feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein is described embodiments of the invention by way of illustrating the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing an automated collection and analysis patient care system <b>10</b> for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia in accordance with the present invention. An exemplary automated collection and analysis patient care system suitable for use with the present invention is disclosed in the related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,378, issued Nov. 6, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, an individual patient <b>11</b> is a recipient of an implantable medical device <b>12</b>, such as, by way of example, an IPG, cardiovascular or heart failure monitor, or therapeutic device, with a set of leads extending into his or her heart and electrodes implanted throughout the cardiopulmonary system. Alternatively, an external monitoring or therapeutic medical device <b>26</b>, a subcutaneous monitor or device inserted into other organs, a cutaneous monitor, or even a manual physiological measurement device, such as an electrocardiogram or heart rate monitor, could be used. The implantable medical device <b>12</b> and external medical device <b>26</b> include circuitry for recording into a short-term, volatile memory telemetered signals stored for later retrieval, which become part of a set of device and derived measures, such as described below, by way of example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Exemplary implantable medical devices suitable for use in the present invention include the Discovery line of pacemakers, manufactured by Guidant Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind., and the Gem line of ICDs, manufactured by Medtronic Corporation, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The telemetered signals stored in the implantable medical device <b>12</b> are preferably retrieved upon the completion of an initial observation period and subsequently thereafter on a continuous, periodic (daily) basis, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,011, issued Apr. 24, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A programmer <b>14</b>, personal computer <b>18</b>, or similar device for communicating with an implantable medical device <b>12</b> can be used to retrieve the telemetered signals. A magnetized reed switch (not shown) within the implantable medical device <b>12</b> closes in response to the placement of a wand <b>13</b> over the site of the implantable medical device <b>12</b>. The programmer <b>14</b> sends programming or interrogating instructions to and retrieves stored telemetered signals from the implantable medical device <b>12</b> via RF signals exchanged through the wand <b>13</b>. Similar communication means are used for accessing the external medical device <b>26</b>. Once downloaded, the telemetered signals are sent via an internetwork <b>15</b>, such as the Internet, to a server system <b>16</b> which periodically receives and stores the telemetered signals as device measures in patient care records <b>23</b> in a database <b>17</b>, as further described below, by way of example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. An exemplary programmer <b>14</b> suitable for use in the present invention is the Model 2901 Programmer Recorder Monitor, manufactured by Guidant Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The patient <b>11</b> is remotely monitored by the server system <b>16</b> via the internetwork <b>15</b> through the periodic receipt of the retrieved device measures from the implantable medical device <b>12</b> or external medical device <b>26</b>. The patient care records <b>23</b> in the database <b>17</b> are organized into two identified sets of device measures: an optional reference baseline <b>26</b> recorded during an initial observation period and monitoring sets <b>27</b> recorded subsequently thereafter. The device measures sets are periodically analyzed and compared by the server system <b>16</b> to indicator thresholds corresponding to quantifiable physiological measures of a pathophysiology indicative of myocardial ischemia, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As necessary, feedback is provided to the patient <b>11</b>. By way of example, the feedback includes an electronic mail message automatically sent by the server system <b>16</b> over the internetwork <b>15</b> to a personal computer <b>18</b> (PC) situated for local access by the patient <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the feedback can be sent through a telephone interface device <b>19</b> as an automated voice mail message to a telephone <b>21</b> or as an automated facsimile message to a facsimile machine <b>22</b>, both also situated for local access by the patient <b>11</b>. Moreover, simultaneous notifications can also be delivered to the patient's physician, hospital, or emergency medical services provider <b>29</b> using similar feedback means to deliver the information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The server system <b>10</b> can consist of either a single computer system or a cooperatively networked or clustered set of computer systems. Each computer system is a general purpose, programmed digital computing device consisting of a central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), non-volatile secondary storage, such as a hard drive or CD ROM drive, network interfaces, and peripheral devices, including user interfacing means, such as a keyboard and display. Program code, including software programs, and data are loaded into the RAM for execution and processing by the CPU and results are generated for display, output, transmittal, or storage, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The database <b>17</b> stores patient care records <b>23</b> for each individual patient to whom remote patient care is being provided. Each patient care record <b>23</b> contains normal patient identification and treatment profile information, as well as medical history, medications taken, height and weight, and other pertinent data (not shown). The patient care records <b>23</b> consist primarily of two sets of data: device and derived measures (D&amp;DM) sets <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>and quality of life (QOL) sets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, the organization of which are further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively. The device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>and quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>can be further logically categorized into two potentially overlapping sets. The reference baseline <b>26</b> is a special set of device and derived reference measures sets <b>24</b><i>a </i>and quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a </i>recorded and determined during an initial observation period. Monitoring sets <b>27</b> are device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>b </i>and quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>b </i>recorded and determined thereafter on a regular, continuous basis. Other forms of database organization are feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The implantable medical device <b>12</b> and, in a more limited fashion, the external medical device <b>26</b>, record patient information for care of patients with myocardial ischemia on a regular basis. The recorded patient information is downloaded and stored in the database <b>17</b> as part of a patient care record <b>23</b>. Further patient information can be derived from recorded data, as is known in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a database schema showing, by way of example, the organization of a device and derived measures set record <b>40</b> for patient care stored as part of a patient care record in the database <b>17</b> of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each record <b>40</b> stores patient information which includes a snapshot of telemetered signals data which were recorded by the implantable medical device <b>12</b> or the external medical device <b>26</b>, for instance, on per heartbeat, binned average or derived bases; measures derived from the recorded device measures; and manually collected information, such as obtained through a patient medical history interview or questionnaire. The following non-exclusive information can be recorded for a patient: a trial electrical activity <b>41</b>, ventricular electrical activity <b>42</b>, PR interval or AV interval <b>43</b>, QRS measures <b>44</b>, ST segment measures <b>45</b>, T wave measures <b>46</b>, QT interval <b>47</b>, body temperature <b>48</b>, posture <b>49</b>, cardiovascular pressures <b>50</b>, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measure <b>51</b>, cardiac output <b>52</b>, systemic blood pressure <b>53</b>, patient geographic location (altitude) <b>54</b>, mixed venous oxygen score <b>55</b>, arterial oxygen score <b>56</b>, pulmonary measures <b>57</b>, minute ventilation <b>58</b>, potassium [K+] level <b>59</b>, sodium [Na+] level <b>60</b>, glucose level <b>61</b>, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine <b>62</b>, acidity (pH) level <b>63</b>, hematocrit <b>64</b>, hormonal levels <b>65</b>, cardiac injury chemical tests <b>66</b>, serum creatinine kinase <b>67</b>, serum troponin <b>68</b>, left ventricular wall motion changes <b>69</b>, myocardial blood flow <b>70</b>, coronary sinus lactate production <b>71</b>, cardiac injury chemical tests <b>72</b>, central nervous system (CNS) injury chemical tests <b>73</b>, central nervous system blood flow <b>74</b>, interventions made by the implantable medical device or external medical device <b>75</b>, and the relative success of any interventions made <b>76</b>. In addition, the implantable medical device or external medical device communicates device-specific information, including battery status, general device status and program settings <b>77</b> and the time of day <b>78</b> for the various recorded measures. Other types of collected, recorded, combined, or derived measures are possible, as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), along with quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are continuously and periodically received by the server system <b>16</b> as part of the on-going patient care monitoring and analysis function. These regularly collected data sets are collectively categorized as the monitoring sets <b>27</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In addition, select device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>a </i>and quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a </i>can be designated as a reference baseline <b>26</b> at the outset of patient care to improve the accuracy and meaningfulness of the serial monitoring sets <b>27</b>. Select patient information is collected, recorded, and derived during an initial period of observation or patient care, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,011, issued Apr. 24, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an adjunct to remote patient care through the monitoring of measured physiological data via the implantable medical device <b>12</b> or external medical device <b>26</b>, quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a </i>can also be stored in the database <b>17</b> as part of the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used, and the monitoring sets <b>27</b>. A quality of life measure is a semi-quantitative self-assessment of an individual patient's physical and emotional well-being and a record of symptoms, such as provided by the Duke Activities Status Indicator. These scoring systems can be provided for use by the patient <b>11</b> on the personal computer <b>18</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to record his or her quality of life scores for both initial and periodic download to the server system <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a database schema showing, by way of example, the organization of a quality of life record <b>80</b> for use in the database <b>17</b>. The following information is recorded for a patient: overall health wellness <b>81</b>, psychological state <b>82</b>, activities of daily living <b>83</b>, work status <b>84</b>, geographic location <b>85</b>, family status <b>86</b>, shortness of breath <b>87</b>, energy level <b>88</b>, exercise tolerance <b>89</b>, chest discomfort <b>90</b>, nausea <b>91</b>, diaphoresis <b>92</b>, and time of day <b>93</b>, and other quality of life and symptom measures as would be known to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The patient may also add non-device quantitative measures, such as the six-minute walk distance, as complementary data to the device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the symptoms during the six-minute walk to quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other types of quality of life and symptom measures are possible, such as those indicated by responses to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire described in E. Braunwald, ed., “Heart Disease—A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine,” pp. 452-454, W. B. Saunders Co. (1997), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, functional classifications based on the relationship between symptoms and the amount of effort required to provoke them can serve as quality of life and symptom measures, such as the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifications I, II, III and IV, for angina also described in Ibid.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On a periodic basis, the patient information stored in the database <b>17</b> is analyzed and compared to pre-determined cutoff levels, which, when exceeded, can provide etiological indications of myocardial ischemia symptoms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a database schema showing, by way of example, the organization of a combined measures set record <b>95</b> for use in the database <b>17</b>. Each record <b>95</b> stores patient information obtained or derived from the device and derived measures sets <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>and quality of life and symptom measures sets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>as maintained in the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used, and the monitoring sets <b>27</b>. The combined measures set <b>95</b> represents those measures most (but not exhaustively or exclusively) relevant to a pathophysiology indicative of myocardial ischemia and are determined as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>. The following information is stored for a patient: heart rate <b>96</b>, heart rhythm (e.g., normal sinus vs. a trial fibrillation) <b>97</b>, ST segment elevation <b>98</b>, ST segment depression <b>99</b>, T wave inversion (including changes) <b>100</b>, pacing modality <b>101</b>, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure <b>102</b>, cardiac output <b>103</b>, arterial oxygen score <b>104</b>, mixed venous oxygen score <b>105</b>, respiratory rate <b>106</b>, transthoracic impedance <b>107</b>, pressures <b>108</b>, left ventricular wall motion changes <b>109</b>, myocardial blood flow <b>110</b>, coronary sinus lactate production <b>111</b>, myocardial band creatinine kinase levels <b>112</b>, troponin levels <b>113</b>, patient activity score <b>114</b>, posture <b>105</b>, exercise tolerance quality of life and symptom measures <b>116</b>, respiratory distress quality of life and symptom measures <b>117</b>, chest discomfort quality of life and symptom measures <b>118</b>, any interventions made to treat myocardial ischemia <b>119</b>, including treatment by medical device, via drug infusion administered by the patient or by a medical device, surgery, and any other form of medical intervention as is known in the art, the relative success of any such interventions made <b>120</b>, and time of day <b>121</b>. Other types of comparison measures regarding myocardial ischemia are possible as is known in the art. In the described embodiment, each combined measures set <b>95</b> is sequentially retrieved from the database <b>17</b> and processed. Alternatively, each combined measures set <b>95</b> could be stored within a dynamic data structure maintained transitorily in the random access memory of the server system <b>16</b> during the analysis and comparison operations.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing the software modules of the server system <b>16</b> of the system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each module is a computer program written as source code in a conventional programming language, such as the C or Java programming languages, and is presented for execution by the CPU of the server system <b>16</b> as object or byte code, as is known in the art. The various implementations of the source code and object and byte codes can be held on a computer-readable storage medium or embodied on a transmission medium in a carrier wave. The server system <b>16</b> includes three primary software modules, database module <b>125</b>, diagnostic module <b>126</b>, and feedback module <b>128</b>, which perform integrated functions as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">First, the database module <b>125</b> organizes the individual patient care records <b>23</b> stored in the database <b>17</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and efficiently stores and accesses the reference baseline <b>26</b>, monitoring sets <b>27</b>, and patient care data maintained in those records. Any type of database organization could be utilized, including a flat file system, hierarchical database, relational database, or distributed database, such as provided by database vendors, such as Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, the diagnostic module <b>126</b> makes findings of myocardial ischemia based on the comparison and analysis of the data measures from the reference baseline <b>26</b> and monitoring sets <b>27</b>. The diagnostic module includes three modules: comparison module <b>130</b>, analysis module <b>131</b>, and quality of life module <b>132</b>. The comparison module <b>130</b> compares recorded and derived measures retrieved from the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used, and monitoring sets <b>27</b> to indicator thresholds <b>129</b>. The database <b>17</b> stores individual patient care records <b>23</b> for patients suffering from various health disorders and diseases for which they are receiving remote patient care. For purposes of comparison and analysis by the comparison module <b>130</b>, these records can be categorized into peer groups containing the records for those patients suffering from similar disorders, as well as being viewed in reference to the overall patient population. The definition of the peer group can be progressively refined as the overall patient population grows. To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a record view showing, by way of example, a set of partial patient care records for care of patients with myocardial ischemia stored in the database <b>17</b> for three patients, Patient <b>1</b>, Patient <b>2</b>, and Patient <b>3</b>. For each patient, three sets of peer measures, X, Y, and Z are shown. Each of the measures, X, Y, and Z, could be either collected or derived measures from the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used, and monitoring sets <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The same measures are organized into time-based sets with Set 0 representing sibling measures made at a reference time t=0. Similarly, Set n−2, Set n−1 and Set n each represent sibling measures made at later reference times t=n−2, t=n−1 and t=n, respectively. Thus, for a given patient, such as Patient <b>1</b>, serial peer measures, such as peer measure X<sub>0 </sub>through X<sub>n</sub>, represent the same type of patient information monitored over time. The combined peer measures for all patients can be categorized into a health disorder- or disease-matched peer group. The definition of disease-matched peer group is a progressive definition, refined over time as the number of monitored patients grows. Measures representing different types of patient information, such as measures X<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>0</sub>, and Z<sub>0</sub>, are sibling measures. These are measures which are also measured over time, but which might have medically significant meaning when compared to each other within a set for an individual patient.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The comparison module <b>130</b> performs two basic forms of comparisons. First, individual measures for a given patient can be compared to other individual measures for that same patient (self-referencing). These comparisons might be peer-to-peer measures, that is, measures relating to a one specific type of patient information, projected over time, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, X<sub>n−1</sub>, X<sub>n−2</sub>, . . . X<sub>0</sub>, or sibling-to-sibling measures, that is, measures relating to multiple types of patient information measured during the same time period, for a single snapshot, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>, and Z<sub>n</sub>, or projected over time, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>, Z<sub>n</sub>, X<sub>n−1</sub>, Y<sub>n−1</sub>, Z<sub>n−1</sub>, X<sub>n−2</sub>, Y<sub>n−2</sub>, Z<sub>n−2</sub>, . . . X<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>0</sub>, Z<sub>0</sub>. Second, individual measures for a given patient can be compared to other individual measures for a group of other patients sharing the same disorder- or disease-specific characteristics (peer group referencing) or to the patient population in general (population referencing). Again, these comparisons might be peer-to-peer measures projected over time, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, X<sub>n′</sub>, X<sub>n″</sub>, X<sub>n−1</sub>, X<sub>n−1′</sub>, X<sub>n−1″</sub>, X<sub>n−2</sub>, X<sub>n−2′</sub>X<sub>hd n−2″</sub>, . . . X<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>0°</sub>,X<sub>O″</sub>, or comparing the individual patient's measures to an average from the group. Similarly, these comparisons might be sibling-to-sibling measures for single snapshots, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, X<sub>n′</sub>, X<sub>n″</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n′</sub>, Y<sub>n″</sub>, and Z<sub>n</sub>, Z<sub>n′</sub>, Z<sub>n″</sub>, or projected over time, for instance, X<sub>n</sub>, X<sub>n′</sub>, X<sub>n″</sub>, Y<sub>n</sub>, Y<sub>n′</sub>, Y<sub>n″</sub>, Z<sub>n</sub>, Z<sub>n′</sub>, Z<sub>n″</sub>, X<sub>n−1</sub>, X<sub>n−1′</sub>, X<sub>n−1″</sub>, Y<sub>n−1</sub>, Y<sub>n−1′</sub>, Y<sub>n−1″</sub>, Z<sub>n−1</sub>, Z<sub>n−1′</sub>, Z<sub>n−1″</sub>, X<sub>n−2</sub>, X<sub>n−2′</sub>, X<sub>n−2″</sub>, Y<sub>n−2</sub>, Y<sub>n−2′</sub>, Y<sub>n−2″</sub>, Z<sub>n−2</sub>, Z<sub>n−2′</sub>, Z<sub>n−2″</sub>, . . . X<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>0′</sub>, X<sub>0″</sub>, Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>0′</sub>, Y<sub>0″</sub>, and Z<sub>0</sub>, Z<sub>0′</sub>, Z<sub>0″</sub>. Other forms of comparisons are feasible, including multiple disease diagnoses for diseases exhibiting similar physiological measures or which might be a secondary disease candidate. Other forms of comparisons are feasible, including multiple disease diagnoses for diseases exhibiting similar abnormalities in physiological measures that might result from a second disease but manifest in different combinations or onset in different temporal sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a Venn diagram showing, by way of example, peer group overlap between the partial patient care records <b>23</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each patient care record <b>23</b> includes characteristics data <b>350</b>, <b>351</b>, <b>352</b>, including personal traits, demographics, medical history, and related personal data, for patients <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, respectively. For example, the characteristics data <b>350</b> for patient <b>1</b> might include personal traits which include gender and age, such as male and an age between 40-45; a demographic of resident of New York City; and a medical history consisting of anterior myocardial infraction, congestive heart failure and diabetes. Similarly, the characteristics data <b>351</b> for patient <b>2</b> might include identical personal traits, thereby resulting in partial overlap <b>353</b> of characteristics data <b>350</b> and <b>351</b>. Similar characteristics overlap <b>354</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>356</b> can exist between each respective patient. The overall patient population <b>357</b> would include the universe of all characteristics data. As the monitoring population grows, the number of patients with personal traits matching those of the monitored patient will grow, increasing the value of peer group referencing. Large peer groups, well matched across all monitored measures, will result in a well known natural history of disease and will allow for more accurate prediction of the clinical course of the patient being monitored. If the population of patients is relatively small, only some traits <b>356</b> will be uniformly present in any particular peer group. Eventually, peer groups, for instance, composed of 100 or more patients each, would evolve under conditions in which there would be complete overlap of substantially all salient data, thereby forming a powerful core reference group for any new patient being monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the analysis module <b>131</b> analyzes the results from the comparison module <b>130</b>, which are stored as a combined measures set <b>95</b> (not shown), to a set of indicator thresholds <b>129</b>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>. Similarly, the quality of life module <b>132</b> compares quality of life and symptom measures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>from the reference baseline <b>26</b> and monitoring sets <b>27</b>, the results of which are incorporated into the comparisons performed by the comparison module <b>13</b>, in part, to either refute or support the findings based on physiological “hard” data. Finally, the feedback module <b>128</b> provides automated feedback to the individual patient based, in part, on the patient status indicator <b>127</b> generated by the diagnostic module <b>126</b>. As described above, the feedback could be by electronic mail or by automated voice mail or facsimile. The feedback can also include normalized voice feedback, such as described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,495, issued Mar. 20, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the feedback module <b>128</b> determines whether any changes to interventive measures are appropriate based on threshold stickiness (“hysteresis”) <b>133</b>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The threshold stickiness <b>133</b> can prevent fickleness in diagnostic routines resulting from transient, non-trending and non-significant fluctuations in the various collected and derived measures in favor of more certainty in diagnosis. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the feedback module <b>128</b> includes a patient query engine <b>134</b> which enables the individual patient <b>11</b> to interactively query the server system <b>16</b> regarding the diagnosis, therapeutic maneuvers, and treatment regimen. Conversely, the patient query engines <b>134</b> can be found in interactive expert systems for diagnosing medical conditions can interactively query the patient. Using the personal computer <b>18</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the patient can have an interactive dialogue with the automated server system <b>16</b>, as well as human experts as necessary, to self assess his or her medical condition. Such expert systems are well known in the art, an example of which is the MYCIN expert system developed at Stanford University and described in Buchanan, B. &amp; Shortlife, E., “RULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEMS. The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project,” Addison-Wesley (1984). The various forms of feedback described above help to increase the accuracy and specificity of the reporting of the quality of life and symptomatic measures.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> are flow diagrams showing a method for diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia and outcomes thereof <b>135</b> using an automated collection and analysis patient care system <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. First, the indicator thresholds <b>129</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are set (block <b>136</b>) by defining a quantifiable physiological measure of a pathophysiology indicative of myocardial ischemia and relating to the each type of patient information in the combined device and derived measures set <b>95</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The actual values of each indicator threshold can be finite cutoff values, weighted values, or statistical ranges, as discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11F</figref>. Next, the reference baseline <b>26</b> (block <b>137</b>) and monitoring sets <b>27</b> (block <b>138</b>) are retrieved from the database <b>17</b>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, respectively. Each measure in the combined device and derived measures set <b>95</b> is tested against the threshold limits defined for each indicator threshold <b>129</b> (block <b>139</b>), as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11F</figref>. The potential onset, progression, regression, or status quo of myocardial ischemia is then evaluated (block <b>140</b>) based upon the findings of the threshold limits tests (block <b>139</b>), as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D, <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a further embodiment, multiple near-simultaneous disorders are considered in addition to primary myocardial ischemia. Primary myocardial ischemia is defined as the onset or progression of myocardial ischemia without obvious inciting cause. Secondary myocardial ischemia is defined as the onset or progression of myocardial ischemia (in a patient with or without pre-existing myocardial ischemia) from another disease process, such as coronary insufficiency, respiratory insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and so forth. Other health disorders and diseases can potentially share the same forms of symptomatology as myocardial ischemia, such as congestive heart failure, respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, renal failure, sleep-apnea, stroke, anemia, atrial fibrillation, other cardiac arrhythmias, and so forth. If more than one abnormality is present, the relative sequence and magnitude of onset of abnormalities in the monitored measures becomes most important in sorting and prioritizing disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, if other disorders or diseases are being cross-referenced and diagnosed (block <b>141</b>), their status is determined (block <b>142</b>). In the described embodiment, the operations of ordering and prioritizing multiple near-simultaneous disorders (box <b>151</b>) by the testing of threshold limits and analysis in a manner similar to congestive heart failure as described above, preferably in parallel to the present determination, is described in the related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,066, issued Aug. 27, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. If myocardial ischemia is due to an obvious inciting cause, i.e., secondary myocardial ischemia, (block <b>143</b>), an appropriate treatment regimen for myocardial ischemia as exacerbated by other disorders is adopted that includes treatment of secondary disorders, e.g., myocardial ischemia, respiratory insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and so forth (block <b>144</b>) and a suitable patient status indicator <b>127</b> for myocardial ischemia is provided (block <b>146</b>) to the patient. Suitable devices and approaches to diagnosing and treating congestive heart failure, respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation are described in related, commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,336,903, issued Jan. 8, 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 6,398,728, issued Jun. 4, 2002; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,411,840, issued Jun. 25, 2002, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Otherwise, if primary myocardial ischemia is indicated (block <b>143</b>), a primary treatment regimen is followed (block <b>145</b>). A patient status indicator <b>127</b> for myocardial ischemia is provided (block <b>146</b>) to the patient regarding physical well-being, disease prognosis, including any determinations of disease onset, progression, regression, or status quo, and other pertinent medical and general information of potential interest to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Finally, in a further embodiment, if the patient submits a query to the server system <b>16</b> (block <b>147</b>), the patient query is interactively processed by the patient query engine (block <b>148</b>). Similarly, if the server elects to query the patient (block <b>149</b>), the server query is interactively processed by the server query engine (block <b>150</b>). The method then terminates if no further patient or server queries are submitted.</p>

The purpose of this routine is to analyze, compare, and log any differences between the observed, objective measures stored in the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used, and the monitoring sets <b>27</b> to the indicator thresholds <b>129</b>. Briefly, the routine consists of tests pertaining to each of the indicators relevant to diagnosing and monitoring myocardial ischemia. The threshold tests focus primarily on: (1) changes to and rates of change for the indicators themselves, as stored in the combined device and derived measures set <b>95</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or similar data structure; and (2) violations of absolute threshold limits which trigger an alert. The timing and degree of change may vary with each measure and with the natural fluctuations noted in that measure during the reference baseline period. In addition, the timing and degree of change might also vary with the individual and the natural history of a measure for that patient.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">One suitable approach to performing the threshold tests uses a standard statistical linear regression technique using a least squares error fit. The least squares error fit can be calculated as follows:</p>

where n is the total number of measures, x<sub>i </sub>is the time of day for measure i, and y <sub>i </sub>is the value of measure i, β<sub>1 </sub>is the slope, and β<sub>0 </sub>is the y-intercept of the least squares error line. A positive slope β<sub>1 </sub>indicates an increasing trend, a negative slope β<sub>1 </sub>indicates a decreasing trend, and no slope indicates no change in patient condition for that particular measure.

The purpose of this routine is to evaluate the presence of sufficient indicia to warrant a diagnosis of the onset, progression, regression, and status quo of myocardial ischemia. Quality of life and symptom measures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>can be included in the evaluation (block <b>230</b>) by determining whether any of the individual quality of life and symptom measures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>have changed relative to the previously collected quality of life and symptom measures from the monitoring sets <b>27</b> and the reference baseline <b>26</b>, if used. For example, an increase in the shortness of breath measure <b>87</b> and exercise tolerance measure <b>89</b> would corroborate a finding of myocardial ischemia. Similarly, a transition from NYHA Class II angina to NYHA Class III angina would indicate a deterioration or, conversely, a transition from NYHA Class III to NYHA Class II angina status would indicate improvement or progress. Incorporating the quality of life and symptom measures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>into the evaluation can help, in part, to refute or support findings based on physiological data. Next, a determination as to whether any changes to interventive measures are appropriate based on threshold stickiness (“hysteresis”) is made (block <b>231</b>), as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0083">The routine returns upon either the determination of a finding or elimination of all factors as follows. If a finding of myocardial ischemia was not previously diagnosed (block <b>232</b>), a determination of disease onset is made (block <b>233</b>), as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref>. Otherwise, if myocardial ischemia was previously diagnosed (block <b>232</b>), a further determination of either disease progression or worsening (block <b>234</b>) or regression or improving (block <b>235</b>) is made, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref> and <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C, respectively.

<p id="p-0066" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref> are flow diagrams showing the routine for determining an onset of myocardial ischemia <b>233</b> for use in the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Myocardial ischemia is possible based on three general symptom categories: reduced exercise capacity (block <b>244</b>), respiratory distress (block <b>251</b>), and increased chest discomfort (angina) (block <b>261</b>). An effort is made to diagnose myocardial ischemia manifesting primarily as resulting in reduced exercise capacity (block <b>244</b>), increased respiratory distress (block <b>251</b>) and/or angina (block <b>261</b>). Increased chest discomfort, or angina, can be a direct marker of myocardial ischemia. Reduced exercise capacity generally serves as a marker of low cardiac output and respiratory distress as a marker of increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Both reduced exercise capacity and respiratory distress may result from a myocardial wall motion abnormality that occurs in response to myocardial ischemia. The clinical aspects of acute myocardial ischemia (and infarction) are described, by way of example, in E. Braunwald, ed., “Heart Disease—A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine,” Chs. 1 and 36-38, W. B. Saunders Co. (1997), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0085">As primary cardiac disease considerations, multiple individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) should be present for the three respective principal symptom findings of myocardial ischemia related reduced exercise capacity (block <b>244</b>), myocardial ischemia related respiratory distress (block <b>251</b>), or myocardial ischemia related chest discomfort (block <b>261</b>), to be indicated, both for disease onset or disease progression. The presence of primary key findings alone can be sufficient to indicate an onset of myocardial ischemia and secondary key findings serve to corroborate disease onset. Note the presence of any abnormality can trigger an analysis for the presence or absence of secondary disease processes, such as the presence of atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure. Secondary disease considerations can be evaluated using the same indications (see, e.g., blocks <b>141</b>-<b>144</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>), but with adjusted indicator thresholds <b>129</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) triggered at a change of 0.5 SD, for example, instead of 1.0 SD.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0086">In the described embodiment, the reduced exercise capacity, respiratory distress, and chest discomfort findings (blocks <b>244</b>, <b>251</b>, <b>261</b>) can be established by consolidating the respective individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) in several ways. First, in a preferred embodiment, each individual indication (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) is assigned a scaled index value correlating with the relative severity of the indication. For example, ST segment elevation (block <b>252</b>) could be measured on a scale from ‘1’ to ‘5’ wherein a score of ‘1’ indicates no change in ST segment elevation from the reference point, a score of ‘2’ a 0.5 SD change, a score of ‘3’ a 1.0 SD change, a score of ‘4’ a 2.0 SD change, and a score of ‘5’ indicates a change exceeding 3.0 SD. The index value for each of the individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) can then either be aggregated or averaged with a result exceeding the aggregate or average maximum indicating an appropriate myocardial ischemia finding.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0087">Preferably, all scores are weighted depending upon the assignments made from the measures in the reference baseline <b>26</b>. For instance, ST segment changes <b>98</b>, <b>99</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) could be weighted more heavily than heart rate <b>96</b> if the heart rate in the reference baseline <b>26</b> is particularly high at the outset, making the detection of further disease progression from increases in heart rate, less sensitive. In the described embodiment, ST segment elevation <b>98</b> receives the most weight in determining increased chest discomfort whereas new wall motion abnormalities <b>109</b> receive the most weight in determining a reduced exercise or respiratory distress finding.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0088">Alternatively, a simple binary decision tree can be utilized wherein each of the individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) is either present or is not present. All or a majority of the individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) should be present for the relevant myocardial ischemia finding to be affirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0089">Other forms of consolidating the individual indications (blocks <b>240</b>-<b>243</b>, <b>245</b>-<b>250</b>, <b>252</b>-<b>260</b>) are feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14D</figref> are flow diagrams showing the routine for determining a progression or worsening of myocardial ischemia <b>234</b> for use in the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The primary difference between the determinations of disease onset, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, and disease progression is the evaluation of changes indicated in the same factors present in a disease onset finding. Thus, a revised myocardial ischemia finding is possible based on the same three general symptom categories: reduced exercise capacity (block <b>274</b>), respiratory distress (block <b>281</b>), and chest discomfort (angina) (block <b>291</b>). The same factors which need be indicated to warrant a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia onset are evaluated to determine disease progression.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0091">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15D</figref> are flow diagrams showing the routine for determining a regression or improving of myocardial ischemia <b>235</b> for use in the routine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The same factors as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref> and <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>D, trending in opposite directions from disease onset or progression, are evaluated to determine disease regression. As primary cardiac disease considerations, multiple individual indications (blocks <b>300</b>-<b>303</b>, <b>305</b>-<b>310</b>, <b>312</b>-<b>320</b>) should be present for the three principal findings of myocardial ischemia related reduced exercise capacity (block <b>304</b>), myocardial ischemia related respiratory distress (block <b>311</b>), or myocardial ischemia related chest discomfort (block <b>321</b>), to indicate disease regression.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flow diagram showing the routine for determining threshold stickiness (“hysteresis”) <b>231</b> for use in the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Stickiness, also known as hysteresis, is a medical practice doctrine whereby a diagnosis or therapy will not be changed based upon small or temporary changes in a patient reading, even though those changes might temporarily move into a new zone of concern. For example, if a patient measure can vary along a scale of ‘1’ to ‘10’ with ‘10’ being worse, a transient reading of ‘6,’ standing alone, on a patient who has consistently indicated a reading of ‘5’ for weeks will not warrant a change in diagnosis without a definitive prolonged deterioration first being indicated. Stickiness dictates that small or temporary changes require more diagnostic certainty, as confirmed by the persistence of the changes, than large changes would require for any of the monitored (device) measures. Stickiness also makes reversal of important diagnostic decisions, particularly those regarding life-threatening disorders, more difficult than reversal of diagnoses of modest import. As an example, automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) manufactured by Heartstream, a subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Seattle, Wash., monitor heart rhythms and provide interventive shock treatment for the diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation. Once diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation and a decision to shock the patient has been made, a pattern of no ventricular fibrillation must be indicated for a relatively prolonged period before the AED changes to a “no-shock” decision. As implemented in this AED example, stickiness mandates certainty before a decision to shock is disregarded. In practice, stickiness also dictates that acute deteriorations in disease state are treated aggressively while chronic, more slowly progressing disease states are treated in a more tempered fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0093">Thus, if the patient status indicates a status quo (block <b>330</b>), no changes in treatment or diagnosis are indicated and the routine returns. Otherwise, if the patient status indicates a change away from status quo (block <b>330</b>), the relative quantum of change and the length of time over which the change has occurred is determinative. If the change of approximately 0.5 SD has occurred over the course of about one month (block <b>331</b>), a gradually deteriorating condition exists (block <b>332</b>) and a very tempered diagnostic, and if appropriate, treatment program is undertaken. If the change of approximately 1.0 SD has occurred over the course of about one week (block <b>333</b>), a more rapidly deteriorating condition exists (block <b>334</b>) and a slightly more aggressive diagnostic, and if appropriate, treatment program is undertaken. If the change of approximately 2.0 SD has occurred over the course of about one day (block <b>335</b>), an urgently deteriorating condition exists (block <b>336</b>) and a moderately aggressive diagnostic, and if appropriate, treatment program is undertaken. If the change of approximately 3.0 SD has occurred over the course of about one hour (block <b>337</b>), an emergency condition exists (block <b>338</b>) and an immediate diagnostic, and if appropriate, treatment program is undertaken as is practical. Finally, if the change and duration fall outside the aforementioned ranges (blocks <b>331</b>-<b>338</b>), an exceptional condition exists (block <b>339</b>) and the changes are reviewed manually, if necessary. The routine then returns. These threshold limits and time ranges may then be adapted depending upon patient history and peer-group guidelines.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0094">The present invention provides several benefits. One benefit is improved predictive accuracy from the outset of patient care when a reference baseline is incorporated into the automated diagnosis. Another benefit is an expanded knowledge base created by expanding the methodologies applied to a single patient to include patient peer groups and the overall patient population. Collaterally, the information maintained in the database could also be utilized for the development of further predictive techniques and for medical research purposes. Yet a further benefit is the ability to hone and improve the predictive techniques employed through a continual reassessment of patient therapy outcomes and morbidity rates.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0095">Other benefits include an automated, expert system approach to the cross-referral, consideration, and potential finding or elimination of other diseases and health disorders with similar or related etiological indicators and for those other disorders that may have an impact on myocardial ischemia. Although disease specific markers will prove very useful in discriminating the underlying cause of symptoms, many diseases, other than myocardial ischemia, will alter some of the same physiological measures indicative of myocardial ischemia. Consequently, an important aspect of considering the potential impact of other disorders will be, not only the monitoring of disease specific markers, but the sequencing of change and the temporal evolution of more general physiological measures, for example heart rate, ECG ST-T wave changes, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and cardiac output, to reflect disease onset, progression or regression in more than one type of disease process.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0096">While the invention has been particularly shown and described as referenced to the embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will understand that the foregoing and other changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
