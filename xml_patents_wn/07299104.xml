<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Shock waves occurring when opening a gate valve between two vacuum chambers and peeling of particles by a viscous force taking place when a gas is supplied into a vacuum chamber are necessary to be suppressed by the apparatus and method of the invention, whereby contamination of a substrate by particles is suppressed. If one vacuum chamber is a substrate processing chamber for performing a vacuum process on the substrate and the other chamber is a transfer chamber having a substrate transfer device therein, the gate valve is opened when inner pressures of both the vacuum chambers are less than 66.5 Pa and higher one thereof is less than twice a lower one thereof. Preferably, a purge gas for peeling of particles is supplied, before supplying the purge gas for pressure control, into the substrate processing chamber with a flow rate greater than that of the purge gas for pressure control.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a substrate processing apparatus in which a plurality of substrate processing chambers are airtightly coupled to a transfer chamber having a substrate transfer device for transferring a substrate, e.g., semiconductor wafer (hereinafter, referred to as ‘wafer’), and a method for transferring a substrate thereto; and, more particularly, to a technology for transferring a substrate between two vacuum chambers in a substrate processing apparatus having a first and a second vacuum chamber coupled to each other through a sluice valve and performing a vacuum process on the substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a semiconductor fabrication apparatus, there is a known mechanism such that a plurality of processing chambers is coupled to a transfer chamber having a substrate transfer device, i.e., cluster tools or multi-chamber mechanism. Such a mechanism has some merits that a vacuum processing on a substrate can be performed continuously without breaking a vacuum state in case of performing same several times, for example, and a processing chamber can be kept away from the atmosphere. Further, high throughput can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the cluster tools mentioned above, one side of a polygonal transfer chamber is airtightly coupled to a load-lock chamber, and, at the same time, other sides are airtightly coupled to a plurality of processing chambers. In addition, a substrate transfer device installed inside the transfer chamber has two forks for supporting a semiconductor wafer (hereinafter, referred to as ‘wafer’). Here, the forks can be revolved, extended, and shrunken by operations of a robot.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While, in the cluster tools, one fork of the substrate transfer device reaches to a load-lock chamber to pick up an unprocessed wafer to mounts same thereon, the other fork reaches to load a processed wafer thereon. Thereafter, the unprocessed wafer on the one fork is transferred to the processing chamber by revolving the robot by 180°.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, if the robot is rotated by 180° whenever a wafer is loaded in one processing chamber, it takes a relatively long time to transfer the wafer. As a result, throughput becomes lowered. For insuring high throughput by effectively using the cluster tools, it is important to transfer the substrate efficiently. As an apparatus for efficiently transferring a substrate, there has been disclosed an apparatus in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Heisei No. 11-207666.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a cluster tools described in the aforementioned prior art, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, five processing chamber stations (hereinafter, referred to as ‘processing chamber’) <b>91</b> to <b>95</b> are airtightly coupled to a transfer chamber <b>90</b>, and a handling robot <b>96</b> for transferring a wafer of a substrate to the transfer chamber <b>90</b> is disposed. The handling robot <b>96</b> has two transfer tables <b>97</b><i>a </i>and <b>97</b><i>b </i>for supporting the wafer. The transfer tables <b>97</b><i>a </i>and <b>97</b><i>b </i>are constructed so as to appear and disappear in the same direction as a revolving direction or in a direction shifted a small angle, by robot link mechanisms <b>98</b><i>a </i>and <b>98</b><i>b </i>which can conduct extending and shrinking operations, and revolve. Thereby, the transfer tables <b>97</b><i>a </i>and <b>97</b><i>b</i>need not to revolve to reach a next processing chamber but revolve by a few angles such that a processed wafer can be exchanged with an unprocessed wafer in the same corresponding processing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 20</figref> of the aforementioned prior art show operation states of the conventional handling robot mentioned above. In this example, it is described that each of the two robot link mechanisms <b>98</b><i>a </i>and <b>98</b><i>b </i>stands by in the transfer chamber <b>90</b> while supporting an unprocessed wafer. At first, a wafer of a first robot link mechanism <b>98</b><i>a </i>is loaded into a processing chamber <b>93</b>, and subsequently, a wafer of a second robot link mechanism <b>98</b><i>b </i>is loaded into the processing chamber <b>94</b> adjacent to the processing chamber <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when comparing the time required for performing a process in each processing chamber of the cluster tools with that for transferring an unprocessed wafer from a load-lock chamber to the processing chamber, there are cases that the processing time is shorter than the transfer time and vice versa. Here, in case where the processing time is longer than the transfer time, as described in the prior art, the unprocessed wafer is held by the substrate transfer device in the transfer chamber until performing a process on a prior wafer is completed in the processing chamber. Upon completing the process in the corresponding processing chamber, the processed wafer will be immediately unloaded. Since the processed wafer and an unprocessed wafer can be quickly exchanged in the corresponding process chamber, it is possible to reduce the transfer time and transfer effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in case where the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, the processing on the wafer must already have been completed in the processing chamber while the unprocessed wafer being transferred from the load-lock chamber by the substrate transfer device. Thus, the configuration of the aforementioned prior art does not help to facilitate the transfer of the wafer effectively since there is no case where the unprocessed wafer stands by until performing a process on a prior wafer is completed in the processing chamber, in such a state where a wafer is supported by the substrate transfer device in the transfer chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, there are the following problems in an apparatus for performing a vacuum process of a cluster tools or the like. For example, when supporting or repairing the apparatus, an interior of the processing chamber is opened to the atmosphere by opening a lid of the processing chamber. At this time, particles from the outside are introduced into the processing chamber to thereby be attached thereto. In addition, reaction products are attached to the processing chamber on performing a vacuum process, e.g., etching. Meanwhile, when loading a wafer from the load-lock chamber into the processing chamber, a gate valve of a sluice valve is opened. At this time, if there is a pressure difference between the processing chamber and the load-lock chamber, shock waves are generated to thereby peel off the particles attached to the chamber. As a result, there is a concern for contaminating the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, there has been known a technology for suppressing a rapid flow of a gas and preventing an oscillation by setting up the pressures of two chambers at the vicinity of the atmosphere so as to minimize the pressure difference before opening the gate valve between the processing chamber and the load-lock chamber or the processing chambers adjacent to each other, and making the pressures equal by opening a connecting line valve (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Heisei No. 6-177060).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the aforementioned method is not effective since shock waves are generated when opening the valve in the case of employing a connecting line between the vacuum chambers. Further, even if the pressure difference becomes small, the shock wave strong enough to peel off the particles inside the chamber may be generated depending on a pressure band. Since a design rule of a semiconductor device is getting more and more strict, it is required that the substrate should be managed more carefully to prevent the contamination of the wafer due to the particles. However, it is difficult to respond to such needs with the conventional technology.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are views for showing a preferred embodiment of a substrate processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The substrate processing apparatus includes, e.g., two cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> each having an airtight structure, in which a cassette (transfer container) C accommodating a plurality of wafers, i.e., substrates, is loaded. Each gate door GD is prepared at the atmosphere side of each of the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> to thereby airtightly shut off the corresponding cassette chamber from the atmosphere. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an elevator <b>11</b><i>b </i>is installed in each of the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> so as to elevate a cassette mounting table <b>11</b><i>a </i>and dispose a wafer supporting groove in the cassette C at an excess level of a first transfer device that will be discussed later, subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Inner sides of the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are airtightly connected to a first transfer chamber <b>13</b> having an airtight structure. And, the first transfer chamber <b>13</b> is airtightly connected to a second transfer chamber <b>16</b> of a vacuum state via preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> of two load-lock chambers (waiting rooms) standing side by side. Here, the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> correspond to loading/unloading chambers of the present invention. In addition, reference number <b>10</b> in the drawing indicates a panel forming a bulkhead. In the first transfer chamber <b>13</b>, there are installed position aligning stages <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> for aligning a direction of a wafer W while it being rotated, and a first substrate transfer device <b>19</b> for transferring the wafer W between the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the position aligning stages <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. The cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the first transfer chamber <b>13</b> are, e.g., in an inert gas atmosphere, but may be in a vacuum state.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A second transfer chamber <b>16</b> is formed of a polygonal shape, e.g., octagonal shape, and has a second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> therein. In the second transfer chamber <b>16</b>, six sides in eight sides of the octagonal shape are airtightly connected to substrate processing chambers, e.g., vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, and the rest two sides are connected to the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. For the convenience of illustration, a vacuum chamber <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown as a simple circle. But, in a case of using the circle chamber practically, a member for forming a transferring port, which connects the chamber <b>2</b> to the second transfer chamber <b>16</b>, is intervened. Reference number G in the drawing indicates a gate valve of a sluice valve for opening and closing the transferring port.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> may be a chamber of, e.g., rectangular shape. As for a vacuum process performed in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, there are processes of etching by an etching gas, forming a film by a film forming gas, ashing by an ashing gas, and the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, there are installed a mounting table <b>21</b> for mounting a wafer W thereon, a gas supply unit <b>22</b> for supplying a process gas, and the like. And, a central portion of the wafer W to be mounted on the mounting table <b>21</b> in each vacuum chamber <b>2</b> is placed on a circle whose a center is equal to that of the second transfer chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> of a substrate transfer device in accordance with the present invention will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic configuration of the second substrate transfer device and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> describes a transfer mechanism thereof. In this example, the substrate transfer device <b>3</b> includes a first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A forming a first transfer part and a second multi-joint arm <b>3</b>B forming a second transfer part. The first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A has a revolving arm <b>41</b> forming a first revolving part where a revolution center <b>100</b> corresponds to the center of the second transfer chamber <b>16</b>, a middle arm <b>42</b> installed at a rear end of the revolving arm <b>41</b> to make it rotate horizontally, and a first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> installed at a rear end of the middle arm <b>42</b> such that it allows to rotate horizontally. The middle arm <b>42</b> is set to have a substantially same length as that of the revolving arm <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the second multi-joint arm <b>3</b>B, center of revolution thereof is same as the rotation center <b>100</b> of the revolving arm <b>41</b>.

The configuration of the second multi-joint arm <b>3</b>B is substantially same as that of the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A, but there is a difference in a length of a rotation axis of the middle arm <b>52</b> such that a height of the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> is equal to that of the substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> of the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A, that is, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> transfer on a same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B are set such that the revolving arms <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> are on a straight line and the middle arms <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> are set to approach in a direction to make them overlap with the revolving arms <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>, respectively, in a standard position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further, in the standard position, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> are set to face each other, and substantially be at right angles to the revolving arms <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>, respectively. In the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b>, leading ends thereof are pivoted on the middle arms <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, and rear ends of advancement/retraction directions are formed of supports <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>, each having a fork shape so as to support the wafer W.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Transfer mechanisms of the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The revolving arm <b>41</b> of the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A is formed to be rotated by a revolution axis <b>60</b> of a pipe shape whose rotation center is the revolution center <b>100</b>. In a leading end of the revolving arm <b>41</b>, a leading end pulley <b>62</b> is installed, which can rotate independent of the revolving arm <b>41</b> by a rotation axis <b>61</b> that is installed inside the revolution axis <b>60</b> of a pipe shape and has the revolution center <b>100</b> as a rotation center. In a rear end of the revolving arm <b>41</b>, a supporting pulley <b>63</b> for supporting the middle arm <b>42</b> and rotating therewith as a single body is installed rotatably. Here, the supporting pulley <b>63</b> is connected to the leading end pulley <b>62</b> by a timing belt <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The middle arm <b>42</b> is fixed to an upper portion of a hollow type rotation axis <b>65</b> prepared above the supporting pulley <b>63</b>. In a leading end of the middle arm <b>42</b>, a middle pulley <b>66</b> of a same diameter, i.e., the same number of teeth as that of the supporting pulley <b>63</b>, is installed on the same axis therewith. On the other hand, in a rear end of the middle arm <b>42</b>, a leading end pulley <b>67</b> is installed rotatably and connected to the middle pulley <b>66</b> by a timing belt <b>68</b>.

Reference number <b>55</b><i>a </i>is a pulley for rotating the revolution axis <b>70</b>, and the pulley <b>55</b><i>a </i>is driven by a motor M<b>3</b> through a driving pulley <b>55</b><i>c </i>and a belt <b>55</b><i>b</i>. Reference number <b>56</b><i>a </i>is a pulley for rotating the rotation axis <b>71</b>, and the pulley <b>56</b><i>a </i>is driven by a motor M<b>4</b> through a driving pulley <b>56</b><i>c </i>and a belt <b>56</b><i>b</i>. The motors M<b>1</b> to M<b>4</b> are fixed at a base BE forming a lower plane of the transfer chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Operations of such a second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> will be explained. In the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A, if the first revolving driving unit <b>45</b> corresponding to the driving unit of the revolution axis <b>60</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is stopped and the first rotation driving unit <b>65</b> corresponding to the driving unit of the rotation axis <b>61</b> is operated to rotate the leading end pulley <b>62</b>, the rotation axis <b>65</b> supporting the middle arm <b>42</b> tends to rotate. At this time, the rotational force from the driving unit <b>45</b> is not applied to the revolution axis <b>60</b>. However, the revolution axis <b>60</b> is in a free state (rotatable state). Therefore, if the leading end pulley <b>62</b> rotates clockwise, the middle arm <b>42</b> rotates clockwise and at the same time the revolving arm <b>41</b> rotates anti-clockwise since the middle arm <b>42</b> begins to open for the revolving arm <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Here, if the revolving arm <b>41</b> rotates by α degree from the standard position, the middle arm <b>42</b> rotates by −2 α degree, since the gear ratio of the leading end pulley <b>62</b> to the supporting pulley <b>63</b> is 2:1. In addition, if the middle arm <b>42</b> rotates clockwise, the middle pulley <b>66</b> rotates anti-clockwise with respect to the middle arm <b>42</b>. As a result, the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> rotates anti-clockwise by α degree since the gear ratio of the middle pulley <b>66</b> to the rear end pulley <b>67</b> is 1:2. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> advances by extending the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A from the standard position, the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b>, more specifically, a trajectory of a center position of a wafer W supported by the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> comes to draw a straight line through the revolution center <b>100</b> and perpendicular to the revolving arm <b>41</b> on the standard position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, the second multi-joint arm <b>3</b>B moves like the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A by the second advancement/retraction driving unit. Still further, in a case of reversing the base pulleys <b>62</b> and <b>72</b> (rotating anti-clockwise) in the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> move while drawing a trajectory, which is perfectly symmetric with respect to that of the advance direction. Here, the first and second revolving driving units <b>45</b> and <b>55</b>, and the first and the second advancement/retraction driving unit are formed to be controlled independently. As a result, the respective first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B can independently conduct revolving operation, and advancing or retracting operation, without interfering each other. By such a construction, the first and second arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B are formed so as to have an access to the preliminary chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, and the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b> (<b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F), independently. Here, the second transfer chamber <b>16</b> is of an octagonal shape, and, as for the widths of the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> or the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> connected to the transfer chamber side <b>16</b>, a central angle from the center of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> toward the centers of widths of the chambers adjacent to each other (i.e., an angle formed by centers of the wafers W inside the vacuum chambers <b>2</b> or the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> adjacent to each other, and the center of the transfer chamber <b>16</b>) becomes 45 degrees. However, even in this case, the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B are made to be accessible to the vacuum chambers <b>2</b> (<b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F) adjacent to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Now, the flow of a wafer in the aforementioned substrate processing apparatus will be explained. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, unprocessed wafers W are supported in the cassettes C and loaded into the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> from outside, and then, the gate doors GD are closed to make the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> airtight space. Thereafter, the wafers are taken out from the cassettes C inside the cassette chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, simultaneously, by means of the first substrate transfer device <b>19</b> in the first transfer chamber <b>13</b> of, e.g., an inert gas atmosphere, and transferred to the position aligning stages <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. Here, the first substrate transfer device <b>19</b> is made of two multi-joint arms and formed to transfer, e.g., two wafers W, simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The two wafers W are adjusted to be aligned along specific directions and loaded into the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> by the first substrate transfer device <b>19</b>, respectively. Then, after setting the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> for, e.g., a specific vacuum atmosphere like the transfer chamber <b>16</b>, the two wafers W are loaded into a specific vacuum chamber <b>2</b> by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Subsequently, a control mechanism of the substrate processing apparatus mentioned above will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the drawing, reference number <b>8</b> refers to a control unit, and the control unit <b>8</b> functions to perform a processing recipe performed in each of the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, transfer recipes of the first and second transfer devices <b>19</b> and <b>3</b>, or an edition or management of a transfer mode, and the like. And, at the same time, the control unit <b>8</b> functions to control the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F or the substrate transfer devices <b>19</b> and <b>3</b> in accordance with such recipes. Practically, the control unit <b>8</b> is made of CPU (central processing unit), program, memory, and the like, but it is explained by dividing the functions thereof into some blocks. In this embodiment, the essential point is related to the transferring of the wafer inside the transfer device <b>16</b> by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> and, hereinafter, the description will be centered mainly on this point.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reference number <b>81</b> indicates a processing recipe creating unit, <b>82</b> a processing recipe storing unit, <b>83</b> a processing recipe selecting unit, <b>84</b> a transfer recipe storing unit, and <b>85</b> a transfer recipe selecting unit. And, reference number B is a bus. The processing recipe creating unit <b>81</b> functions to creates a processing recipe in the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F and is formed of a recipe creating program, an operation screen for inputting or editing the recipe, and the like. Here, each of the processing recipes created is stored in the processing recipe storing unit <b>82</b>. A plurality of processing recipes are provided depending on a desired process and an operator selects a desired processing recipe in the processing recipe selecting unit <b>83</b> from the plurality of processing recipes stored in the processing recipe storing unit <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the transfer recipe storing unit <b>84</b> stores a transfer route of the wafer or two transfer modes by the second transfer device <b>3</b>. There are first and second transfer modes in the transfer mode, and the transfer mode is memorized in the memory in such a way that the transfer mode is to be associated with a corresponding processing recipe. For example, if a processing recipe is selected, a corresponding transfer mode is selected by the transfer recipe selecting unit <b>85</b>, on the basis of the processing recipe. In this example, the transfer recipe selecting unit <b>85</b> corresponds to means for selecting the transfer mode in accordance with the processing recipe.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first transfer mode is used in a case of a transfer rate control, and the second transfer mode is used in a case of a process rate control. The transfer rate control and the process rate control are determined by a relation between the transfer time of a wafer in the first and second transfer chambers <b>13</b> and <b>16</b> and the processing time in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F where the corresponding wafer is to be transferred thereto. In the case where the transfer time is longer than the processing time, it becomes the transfer rate control, and the wafer is transferred in the first transfer mode. In addition, if the transfer time is shorter than the processing time, it becomes the process rate control and the wafer is transferred in the second transfer mode.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, the transfer time of the wafer in the transfer chamber refers to the time taken for an unprocessed wafer to be transferred from the first transfer chamber <b>13</b> to specific vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F through the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> (<b>15</b>), and conventionally, ranges from 20 to 30 seconds. Thus, for a process adopting the first transfer mode, there may be an ashing process, an etching process on an anti-reflection film, or the like, in which the processing time falls between 20 seconds and 30 seconds. In addition, for a process adopting the second transfer mode, there may be process for making an oxidation film, gate process, contact hole process, or the like, in which the processing time falls between 30 seconds and 20 minutes, e.g., about 5 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, the control unit <b>8</b> is connected to the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, the first revolution axis driving unit <b>45</b> and the first advancement/retraction driving unit <b>47</b> of the first multi-joint arm <b>3</b>A of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>, and the second revolution axis driving unit <b>55</b> and the second advancement/retraction driving unit <b>57</b> of the second multi-joint arm <b>3</b>B, respectively, through a controller (not shown)</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Subsequently, a method for transferring a substrate in accordance with the present invention will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>. First, an operator selects a processing recipe by using the control unit <b>8</b>. In this example, such a process is performed in which the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, e.g., ashing process in which the processing time is 20 seconds or more and 30 seconds or less, as a first process in the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F. Thereafter, the operator selects a recipe for performing such a process in which the processing time is longer than the transfer time, e.g., oxidation film making process whose processing time is about 5 minutes, as a second process in the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F (step S<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, in the processing recipe, there are described, e.g., vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F to be used, order for use, and the like. For example, such a processing recipe is selected wherein wafers are transferred to all the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F in such an order that the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>A is the first and the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>F is the last, and performed the same processing therein; and the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are alternately used so that the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> is employed when the wafer is transferred to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>A, and subsequently, the second preliminary vacuum chamber <b>15</b> is employed when the wafer is transferred to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the processing recipe described above is selected, a transfer route or transfer mode of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>, which is stored in the transfer recipe storing unit <b>84</b>, is automatically selected by the transfer recipe selecting unit <b>85</b>, on the basis of the corresponding processing recipe. In this case, the first transfer mode is selected in the first process since the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, and, in the second process, the second transfer mode is selected since the processing time is longer than the transfer time (step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the first process is performed on the wafer in each of the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, while transferring the wafer W between the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and each of the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> in the first transfer mode (step S<b>3</b>). Now, the first transfer mode will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows that vacuum processing on a wafer W<b>1</b> is completed in a vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, for example, and a wafer W<b>2</b> to be processed next stands by in the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In such a state, for example, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> simultaneously extend to reach for a processed wafer W<b>1</b> of the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D and unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> of the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b>, respectively. Then, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> enter into the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D and the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b>, respectively, so as to receive the wafers W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> by the supports <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> thereof (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> return to the standard position, and then, the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> revolves by specific angles, i.e., 180 degrees in this example, to a position accessible to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> (particularly, the aforementioned revolving arms <b>41</b> an <b>51</b> revolve by 180 degrees). Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> supported by the support. <b>54</b> of the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> is delivered into the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, and, at the same time, the processed wafer W<b>1</b> supported by the support <b>44</b> of the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> is delivered to the first preliminary chamber <b>14</b>. Here, when the aforementioned first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> are said to simultaneously receive (or deliver) the wafers W, it is understood that it is not strictly limited to the case of receiving the wafers exactly at the same time. Such a case in which timing shift generated when receiving (or delivering) the wafer is 0.5 second or less may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, the processed wafer W<b>1</b> in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D is replaced by the unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> in the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b>. Then, for example, a processed wafer W<b>3</b> in a vacuum chamber <b>2</b>E is exchanged for an unprocessed wafer W<b>4</b> of the second preliminary vacuum chamber <b>15</b>. In this case, replacing the wafer W<b>3</b> with the wafer W<b>4</b> is performed in the same manner. The first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> for supporting the wafers W<b>3</b> and W<b>4</b>, respectively, shrink simultaneously so as to return to the standard position. Then, the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> revolves by a specific angle to a position accessible to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>E. Thereafter, the second and first substrate supporting units <b>53</b> and <b>43</b> are extended simultaneously, so that the unprocessed wafer W<b>4</b> supported by the support <b>54</b> of the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> is loaded into the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>E, and, at the same time, the processed wafer W<b>3</b> supported by the support <b>44</b> of the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> is loaded into the second preliminary vacuum chamber <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, the wafers are transferred among all the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F and the first and second preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, and the first process is performed on the wafers in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, the second process is performed on the wafers in the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, while transferring the wafer among the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the respective vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>, in the second transfer mode (step S<b>4</b>). Now, the second transfer mode will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows that the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> stands by, waiting for completion of the process in a corresponding vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, while vacuum processing is performed on a wafer W<b>1</b> in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In such a waiting state, for example, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> are placed in waiting positions. In other words, the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> is disposed in a position that it has access to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, and the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the vacuum chamber, if possible; for example, the second and first substrate supporting units <b>53</b> and <b>43</b> are disposed in such a position that an angle formed therebetween becomes about 45 degrees. At this time, the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> approaches for the unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> to the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> in advance, and thus supporting the wafer W<b>2</b> by the corresponding substrate supporting unit <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, after completing the process in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> enters into the corresponding vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D and immediately receives the processed wafer W<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. After that, the substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> returns to the waiting position, and subsequently, the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> revolves by a specific angle, i.e., about 45 degrees in this example, to a position accessible to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> supported by the support <b>54</b> of the second substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> is loaded into the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D, and subsequently, the substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> returns to the waiting position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the first substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> approaches to have access to the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> to thereby unload the processed wafer W<b>1</b> supported therein into the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, after replacing the processed wafer W<b>1</b> in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>D with the unprocessed wafer W<b>2</b> from the first preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> in the second transfer mode, and then, the processed wafer W<b>3</b> in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>E is replaced with the unprocessed wafer W<b>4</b> from the second preliminary vacuum chamber <b>15</b> in the same manner, for example. Thus, the wafers are transferred between all the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F and the first and second preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> in the second transfer mode, and the second process is performed on the wafers in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B are disposed such that the center of revolution thereof are the same, and the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F are circumferentially installed around the revolution center of the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B. Therefore, a radius of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> is small and a footprint thereof can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At this time, the driving units <b>45</b> and <b>55</b> for revolving and the driving units <b>46</b> and <b>56</b> for rotation (for expansion and contraction) are provided in the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B, respectively, and the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B are formed to be controlled independently. As a result, the first and second multi-joint arms <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B can have access to the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F arbitrarily, and simultaneous access the neighboring chamber <b>2</b>. Thus, a wafer can be transferred with a high efficiency even in a narrow transfer region.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, in the embodiment mentioned above, a wafer can be transferred efficiently whether the process time is shorter or longer than the transfer time, since the transfer mode is selected on the basis of the processing time. In other words, if the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, i.e., transfer rate control, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> simultaneously go for processed and unprocessed wafers, and simultaneously transfer same to the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As described above, by operating the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> simultaneously, wherein while one substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>) moves, the other substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> (<b>43</b>) stands by. In addition, the unnecessary waiting time is eliminated. Therefore, it is possible to transfer a wafer efficiently and further reduce the transfer time. In the case of the transfer rate control mentioned above, the total processing time is determined by the transfer time, so that reduction of the transfer time depends on reduction of the total processing time. Therefore, the throughput can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, in case where the processing time is longer than the transfer time, i.e., process rate control, one substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>), which transfers the processed wafer to a position accessible to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> in which a process is performed in advance, stands by, so that the processed wafer can be taken out right after the process in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> ended. In addition, the other substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> (<b>43</b>) is disposed in the vicinity of one substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>), if possible, to thereby stand by for the end of the process in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, while supporting the unprocessed wafer therein. As a result, the revolution angle becomes small when the substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> (<b>43</b>) having access to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> into which the wafer W is loaded, whereby the wafer W can be loaded into the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">After replacing the processed wafer W with the unprocessed wafer W in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> in a short time and starting a vacuum processing on the wafer W in the corresponding vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, the processed wafer W supported by one substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>) is transferred to the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. As described above, by transferring the wafer to the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> while performing a specific process in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, the waiting time for the processing in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> can be used efficiently and the wafer can be transferred efficiently, whereby throughput can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Further, the transfer mode of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> is selected on the basis of the processing time on the wafer W in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, so that the wafer is transferred by a technique corresponding to the processing time, and the wafer can be transferred efficiently regardless whether the processing time is shorter or longer than the transfer time. In other words, if it is intended to transfer the wafer in the second transfer mode, for example, in case where the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> have access to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> and the preliminary vacuum chamber <b>53</b> (<b>43</b>) individually, in the second transfer mode. As a result, while one substrate supporting unit <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>) moves, the other substrate supporting unit <b>53</b> (<b>43</b>) should stand by. Accordingly, it takes much time to transfer, and thus, throughput becomes lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Meanwhile, if the wafer is transferred in the first transfer mode in case where the processing time is longer than the transfer time, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> (<b>53</b>) have access to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> and the preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> (<b>15</b>), simultaneously, in the first transfer mode. As a result, the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> cannot perform other operations and should stand by until the process on the wafer is completed in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>. Accordingly, after completing the process on the wafer in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, operations are performed as follows: going for the processed wafer and the unprocessed wafer to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> and the preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> (<b>15</b>), respectively; returning the first and the second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> to the standard position; and revolving the first and second substrate supporting units <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> by specific angles. As mentioned above, since the long processing time cannot be used efficiently, the total processing time becomes long and throughput becomes lowered. Thus, it is effective in improving the transfer efficiency that the transfer mode of the second substrate transfer device is selected on the basis of the processing time on the wafer W in the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, in the substrate transfer device mentioned above, the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the second transfer chamber <b>16</b> are set to have specific degree of vacuum, but it takes too much time to exhaust therein up to the specific degree of vacuum. Thus, it is important to improve the transfer efficiency of the wafer in the transfer chamber <b>16</b>, for enhancing the total process throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Subsequently, in case where other processes are performed in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F, transfer of the wafer W will be explained. In this example, there is selected a process recipe in which a first process in which the processing time is shorter than the transfer time in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, a second process in which the processing time is longer than the transfer time in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D, and a third process in which the processing time is shorter than the transfer time in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>E and <b>2</b>F are performed. If such a processing recipe is selected, a transfer route or transfer mode of the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> that is stored in the transfer recipe storing unit <b>84</b> is automatically selected by the transfer recipe selecting unit <b>85</b>, on the basis of the corresponding processing recipe. In this case, the first transfer mode is selected in the first process since the processing time is shorter than the transfer time, the second transfer mode is selected in the second process since the processing time is longer than the transfer time, and the first transfer mode is selected in the third process since the processing time is shorter than the transfer time.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the first process is performed on the wafer W in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B while transferring the wafer W in the first transfer mode between the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>. The second process is performed on the wafer W in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D while transferring the wafer W in the second transfer mode between the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>. And, the third process is performed on the wafer W in the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>E and <b>2</b>F while transferring the wafer W in the first transfer mode between the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>E and <b>2</b>F by the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As mentioned above, even in case where other processes are performed in the vacuum chamber <b>2</b>, the wafer W can be transferred to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> efficiently, the total processing time may be shortened, and the throughput can be enhanced, since the transfer mode is selected according to the process of the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the aforementioned examples, the processes are performed in all the vacuum chambers, but unused vacuum chambers may be left. Further, in the aforementioned examples, the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> are employed alternately, but one preliminary vacuum chamber <b>14</b> (<b>15</b>) may be used continuously. Still further, the aforementioned examples explain that the wafer is transferred to the second transfer chamber <b>16</b>, for example, in case that one chamber corresponds to the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> of a substrate processing chamber and the other chamber corresponds to the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> of loading/unloading chamber. However, in case where a consecutive process is performed on the wafer by using the vacuum chambers <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>F continuously, for example, the wafer may be transferred between the vacuum chambers <b>2</b> in the first or second transfer mode. Here, the transfer time refers to the time required for transferring the wafer from one chamber before delivering and to the other chamber after that, when delivering the wafer in one chamber into the other chamber other than one chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, in the present invention, it may be possible that a recipe for processing and a transfer mode are written in the recipe itself in advance, in the control unit <b>8</b>, and, if a specific recipe is selected, the transfer mode may be selected at that time. In addition, a controlling panel, which is formed such that the transfer mode is selected manually, is provided, so that the operator may select the processing recipe and the transfer mode by oneself manually.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Still further, the second substrate transfer device <b>3</b> is not limited to the aforementioned configuration, but it may be of such a configuration that the first and second revolving units can revolve around a common revolution center, and the first and second substrate supporting units disposed in a same plane can advance and retreat by the first and second revolving units and the first and second advancement/retraction driving units. For example, a substrate transfer device, e.g., so-called block type arm, may be employed, which has a configuration such that the first and second substrate supporting units are equipped in the first and second robot link mechanisms formed to revolve, and the first and second substrate supporting units appear and disappear by extending and shrinking the robot link mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Still further, in the present invention, all the chambers installed around the transfer chamber having a substrate transfer device are substrate processing, chambers. For example, the present invention can be applied to an apparatus that a wafer is loaded into a corresponding transfer chamber from one substrate processing chamber and a wafer is unloaded from another substrate processing chamber. In addition, the substrate processing chamber is not limited to a sheet type vacuum processing chamber, but it may be a sectional space including, e.g., a vertical type batch furnace for performing a heat treatment with a batch furnace, and a loading area of, e.g., inert gas atmosphere. Still further, the object to be processed of the present invention is not limited to a semiconductor wafer, but the present invention may be applied to a processing on a large scale LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, another preferred embodiment of the present invention whose an object is to prevent a wafer from being contaminated due to particles would be explained. In this embodiment, additional construction is added to the substrate processing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a view for showing a configuration of the corresponding embodiment, and it describes omitted parts and newly added constructions in the aforementioned substrate processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this embodiment, a vacuum chamber <b>2</b> of a substrate processing chamber will be described as a chamber for performing dry etching. A gas supply unit <b>22</b> installed in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> (for the convenience of explanation, hereinafter, the vacuum chamber <b>2</b> will be described as the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>) is coupled to a high frequency power source <b>23</b> and forms an upper electrode, and a mounting table <b>21</b> is grounded and forms a lower electrode. A gas exhaust unit <b>24</b> forming a gas exhaust line is coupled to a bottom plane of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>. To this gas exhaust unit <b>24</b>, a pressure control unit <b>25</b>, an opening/closing valve <b>26</b>, and a vacuum pump <b>27</b> of a vacuum exhausting means are coupled in that order starting from the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> side. In addition, a pressure detection unit <b>28</b> for detecting the inner pressure of the chamber is installed in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A gas supply line <b>101</b> is coupled to the gas supply unit <b>22</b>, and an upstream thereof is divided into a plurality of branch lines <b>201</b>, <b>301</b>, and <b>401</b>. Here, the branch lines <b>201</b>, <b>301</b>, and <b>401</b> are coupled to a purge gas supply source for peeling of particles <b>202</b>, a purge gas supply source for pressure control <b>302</b>, and a process gas supply source <b>402</b>, respectively. The purge gas for peeling of particles functions to remove the particles, which will be peeled off from the interior of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> when letting the purge gas for pressure control or process gas flow thereafter, by using a viscous force thereof, in advance. As for the purge gas for peeling of particles, it is preferable that a gas having larger viscous force, i.e., molecular weight, than that to be supplied later including the purge gas for pressure control or process gas is employed. For example, there may be employed rare gas such as Xe (xenon) gas, Rn (radon) gas, Kr (krypton) gas, or the like, or CF based gas such as C5F8 gas, C4F8, or the like. In the present embodiment, C4F8 gas is used.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, as the purge gas for pressure control, e.g., N2 (nitrogen gas) is used, and, as the process gas, halogen based etching gas or the like is used. In the branch lines <b>201</b>, <b>301</b>, and <b>401</b>, a gas supply kit <b>205</b> having a flow rate control unit <b>203</b> and a valve <b>204</b>, a gas supply kit <b>305</b> having a flow rate control unit <b>303</b> and a valve <b>304</b>, and a gas supply kit <b>405</b> having a flow rate control unit <b>403</b> and a valve <b>404</b> are installed, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A part related to the second transfer chamber <b>16</b> will be explained. A gas exhaust unit <b>31</b> forming a gas exhaust line is coupled to a bottom plane of the transfer chamber <b>16</b>. A pressure control unit <b>32</b>, an opening/closing valve <b>33</b>, and a vacuum pump of a vacuum exhaust means <b>34</b> in that order starting from the transfer chamber <b>16</b> side are coupled to the gas exhaust unit <b>31</b>. In addition, a pressure detection unit <b>35</b> for detecting the inner pressure of the chamber is installed in the transfer unit <b>16</b>. Reference number <b>36</b> indicates a driving mechanism for opening and closing a gate valve G of a sluice valve, and reference number <b>37</b> is assigned to a transferring port for passing a wafer W between the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Atmospheres of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b>, and the opening/closing of the gate valve G are controlled by a control unit <b>80</b> formed of a computer. The control unit <b>80</b> functions to control the gas supply kits <b>205</b>, <b>305</b>, and <b>405</b> including the flow rate control units <b>203</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>403</b>, which are installed in the branch lines <b>201</b>, <b>301</b>, and <b>401</b> of the gas supply lines, and the like; to input pressure detecting values of the pressure detection units <b>28</b> and <b>35</b>, and, at the same time, control the inner pressures of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b>; and to open and close the gate valve via the driving mechanism <b>36</b>, by using a program memorized in a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The program requires as one of conditions for opening the gate valve G between the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b> that pressure in all the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b> are set to be less than 66.5 Pa (500 mTorr). As a result, the inner pressure of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is set to be an equal or less value than the aforementioned value, e.g., 26.6 Pa (200 mTorr). The program is formed to perform a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and the contents thereof will be described in the part where operations of the apparatus are explained.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, operations of the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Here, it will be explained in relation to the opening and closing of the gate valve G between the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and the transfer chamber <b>16</b> corresponding to main parts of the present embodiment, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the entire substrate processing apparatus, since it has already been explained in the previous embodiment how the wafer W, i.e., substrate, flows in the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Now, it is assumed that the processing on the wafer W<b>1</b> is completed in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>D, and the corresponding wafer W<b>1</b> is unloaded by the substrate transfer device <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, to thereby be in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. At this time, the gate valve G of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>D side is closed at first (step S<b>1</b>). Then, the valve <b>201</b> is opened and so-called full-purge is performed by flowing C4F8 gas of the purge gas for peeling of particles into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> with a flow rate of Q<b>0</b> by controlling the flow rate control unit <b>203</b> (step S<b>2</b>). While the substrate transfer device is operated, the opening and closing valve <b>26</b> is in the open state. Thus, C4F8 gas passes through the interior of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>, whereby particles attached to the wall or surface of the mounting table <b>21</b> are peeled off by the viscous force thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Here, an object for performing the full-purge is to peel off the particles in advance, which will be peeled off from the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> by the viscous forces of the purge gas for pressure control provided into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> before opening the gate valve G and the process gas provided after loading the wafer W, and to suppress the scattering of the particles when the gases passes through. At this time, it is required to let the purge gas pass through for peeling off the particles so as to have a viscous force greater than the viscous forces when letting the aforementioned gases pass through. The viscous force is proportional to the molecular weight of the purge gas and the square of the flow rate. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the maximum values of the viscous forces in advance when the purge gas for pressure control and the process gas pass through, on the basis of each flow rate and molecular weight thereof, and to let the purge gas for peeling of particles flow so as to obtain a viscous force larger than the maximum values.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Therefore, for the convenience of explanation, if the viscous force has the maximum value when the N2 gas for pressure control flows with a flow rate Q<b>1</b>, and N2 gas is employed as the purge gas for peeling of particles, it is necessary to let same with a flow rate larger than the flow rate Q<b>1</b> flow. In this example, C4F8 gas is employed as the purge gas for peeling of particles. Thus, if the flow rate Q<b>0</b> is larger than square root of the ratio of the molecular weights of N2 to C4F8 (28/200), larger viscous force can be obtained than that exerted when the N2 gas for pressure control with a flow rate Q<b>1</b> is flowing. As mentioned above, from the fact that the flow rate can be small to obtain large viscous force, i.e., larger viscous force can be obtained by increasing the flow rate, it is preferable that the molecular weight of the purge gas for peeling of particles is larger than that of the purge gas for pressure control. In addition, it is obvious by the following experimental example that the scattering of the particles is suppressed when the gas is supplied continuously, by performing such a full-purge.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">After performing the full-purge described above, for example, supplying the C4F8 gas is stopped, the valve <b>304</b> is opened, and N2 gas of the purge gas for pressure control flows in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> with a flow rate Q<b>1</b> by controlling the flow rate control unit <b>303</b>, and the inner pressure of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is adjusted to have a setting value (step S<b>3</b>). The setting value of the pressure is smaller than that of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> and larger than ½ of that. For example, if the setting value of the pressure in the transfer chamber is 26.6 Pa (200 mTorr), that of the substrate processing chamber is set for 20 Pa (150 mTorr).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Subsequently, the inner pressure P<b>0</b> of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> (the pressure detection value of the pressure detection unit <b>35</b>) is compared with that P<b>1</b> of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> (the pressure detection value of the pressure detection unit <b>28</b>), so that it is determined whether P<b>0</b> is larger than P<b>1</b> or not (step S<b>4</b>). After that, it is determined whether P<b>0</b> is less than 66.5 Pa (500 mTorr) (step S<b>5</b>) and P<b>0</b> is less than twice P<b>1</b>, i.e., the pressure difference therebetween is less than twice P<b>1</b> (step S<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As can be easily seen from the following experimental example, the reason why steps S<b>4</b> to S<b>6</b> are performed is for confirming whether such a condition is satisfied that the pressures of both vacuum chambers are less than 66.5 Pa (500 mTorr) and a higher one of the pressure detection values is less twice a lower one thereof when the valve is opened, since under such a condition, generation of the shockwaves becomes sufficiently small. Meanwhile, the pressure in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is made to be lower than that in the transfer chamber <b>16</b>, based on the experience that the scattering of the particles is reduced more than in an opposite case. However, it may be reasoned that if the shock waves enter into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> from outside, the influence of the viscous force of the air current provided into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is smaller than that in the case where the shock waves go out of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and the pressure in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> may be set to be larger than that in the transfer chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Through steps S<b>4</b> to S<b>6</b>, if it is confirmed that each of the conditions is satisfied, the gate valve G is opened (step S<b>7</b>), a next wafer W<b>2</b> is loaded into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> by the substrate transfer device <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 11</figref> (step S<b>8</b>), and the processing on the wafer W<b>2</b> is performed after closing the gate valve G (step S<b>9</b>). In the concrete example of such a processing, an etching gas of the process gas, e.g., CF based gas, is supplied into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>, and, at the same time, high frequency powers are applied between the gas supply unit <b>22</b> of the upper electrode and the mounting table <b>21</b> of the lower electrode so as to make the etching gas be in the plasma state, thereby performing an etching process on the surface of the wafer W<b>2</b> by using the plasma. After the etching process being completed, supplying the process gas is suspended, the process gas is exhausted from the processing chamber <b>2</b>, and, at the same time, the steps corresponding to steps S<b>3</b> to S<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> are performed. In other words, the interior of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is purged with N2 gas to adjust the pressure, the gate valve G is opened after confirming that the aforementioned conditions are satisfied, and the wafer W is unloaded from the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Further, it is commonly considered that steps S<b>4</b> to S<b>6</b> are performed in a predetermined order, but, in case where the inner pressure P<b>1</b> in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is greater than that P<b>0</b> in the transfer chamber <b>16</b>, the control unit <b>80</b> performs a process for lowering the inner pressure of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> by a predetermined amount through the pressure control unit <b>25</b> (step S<b>10</b>). Still further, if the pressure P<b>0</b> in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is greater than 66.5 Pa (500 mTorr), the interior of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is exhausted continuously. In case when the pressure in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> P<b>0</b> remains greater than 66.5 Pa (500 mTorr) even while the transfer chamber is continuously being exhausted for a predetermined time, e.g., an alarm is given, because of a concern that any problems may have developed (steps S<b>11</b> to S<b>13</b>). Still further, in case when P<b>0</b> is greater than twice P<b>1</b>, a step for increasing the pressure in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> by a predetermined value is performed by the pressure control unit <b>25</b> (step S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In accordance with the embodiment described above, the shock waves are sufficiently suppressed since the gate valve G is opened under such conditions that P<b>1</b> is less than P<b>0</b> and P<b>0</b> is less than twice P<b>1</b> (the pressure difference therebetween is less than twice). As a result, contamination of the wafer due to the particles can be suppressed. In addition, the purge gas for peeling of particles passes through the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> with viscous force larger than that exerted when the purge gas for pressure control and the process gas being supplied, so that the peeling due to the flowing of the purge gases can be suppressed in both cases when the purge gas for pressure control being supplied and a process being performed. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the wafer from being contaminated by the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In this example, the substrate processing chamber and the transfer chamber correspond to the first and second vacuum chambers, respectively. But, the present invention is applicable between the transfer chamber and the preliminary vacuum chamber. In this case, the purge gas for peeling of particles is supplied such that the viscosity thereof becomes greater than that exerted when the purge gas for pressure control is flowing.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Another preferred embodiment of the present invention whose an object is to prevent contamination of a wafer due to the particles, as described above, would be explained. This embodiment has a different program memorized in the control unit <b>80</b> in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows operations performed on the basis of the program of the example, and the condition for opening the gate valve G is that both inner pressures of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> and processing chamber <b>2</b> are less than 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr). Even in this case, the flow rate is adjusted such that the viscous force of the gas for peeling of particles is larger than that exerted when the process gas is supplied, since the processed wafer W is unloaded from the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> (step K<b>1</b>), and the purge gas for peeling of particles is supplied into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>, while the purge gas for pressure control is not supplied (step K<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">After supplying the purge gas for peeling of particles, supplying such purge gas is suspended, and the purge gas is exhausted until the inner pressure in the processing chamber <b>2</b> becomes less than a setting value (step K<b>3</b>). Subsequently, the inner pressure P<b>0</b> in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is compared with that P<b>1</b> in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>, so that it is determined whether P<b>0</b> is greater than P<b>1</b> (step K<b>4</b>), as in the previous embodiment. After that, if it is confirmed that P<b>0</b> is less than 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) (step K<b>5</b>), like the previous embodiment, the gate valve G is opened (step K<b>6</b>), the wafer W<b>2</b> is loaded into the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> (step K<b>7</b>), and the processing is performed on the wafer W<b>2</b> after closing the gate valve G (step K<b>8</b>). In addition, steps K<b>9</b> to K<b>12</b> correspond to the steps S<b>10</b> to S<b>13</b> of the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In such embodiment, the gate valve G is opened regardless of the pressure difference if the inner pressures in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> and transfer chamber <b>16</b> are less than 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr). As can be seen from the following experimental example, generation of the particles can be suppressed, in this case, too. In such a technique, both pressures are low, so that energy of the shock wave is small even if there is the pressure difference. Therefore, it is considered that the particles are hardly peeled off. In this example, both pressures are controlled to be less than 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr), but it is more preferable that the setting value is 9.98 Pa (75 mTorr), as will be seen from the following experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the present invention, it may be allowed to form the program in the control unit <b>80</b> such that modes in the flows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> are changed and performed. For example, in such a mechanism that the inner pressure in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> increases when the gate valve G between the preliminary vacuum chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and the transfer chamber <b>16</b> being opened, the pressure difference mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is preferably selected in case where the processing time performed in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is short, since it takes long time to lower the inner pressure of the transfer chamber <b>16</b>. On the other hand, it is preferable to select a very small amount of pressure mode in case where the processing time is long. Therefore, by changing the mode, a proper mode can be selected on the basis of the process, and thus contributing to enhance the throughput, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, an experiment for confirming the effect of the present invention will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, some portions <b>601</b> to <b>603</b> of the wall in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> are made of quartz so as to have light transmittance property, a laser can be illuminated to the interior of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> by a laser beam illumination device <b>501</b>, and, at the same time, the interior of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is formed to be photographed by using a CCD camera <b>502</b> as a light-receiving means of a scattered light due to particles. Each of reference numbers <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> indicates a slit, and reference number <b>504</b> is a light extinction device.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">By using such an experimental device, particle powders are attached to a lower plane of the gas supply unit <b>22</b>, and it is observed by the CCD camera <b>502</b> whether the particles are scattered or not when opening the gate valve G, while varying the pressures in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> and substrate processing chamber <b>2</b>. Then, a scattering probability is investigated by repeatedly performing it many times. The result is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates the pressure in the transfer chamber <b>16</b> and the vertical axis is the scattering probability of particles. Here, the inner pressure of the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is set within a range of the pressure described on the upper right side of the drawing, in each pressure in the transfer chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In case where the pressure P<b>0</b> of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is 66.5 Pa, the scattering probability of particles is as small as 20% (black circle) when the pressure P<b>1</b> of the substrate chamber <b>2</b> is 39.9 Pa. But, under the same condition, the scattering probability is 50% if P<b>0</b> is 79.8 Pa. In addition, if P<b>1</b> is 26.6 Pa (white square), the scattering probability is 25% when P<b>0</b> is 53.2 Pa, and the scattering probability is 0% when P<b>0</b> is 56 Pa. Considering the relation between the pressure difference and the scattering probability and each pressure from such results, it can be noted that the scattering of particles is difficult if both P<b>0</b> and P<b>1</b> are small, even though the pressure ratio is the same; the peeling of the particles can be suppressed by making the pressure difference less than twice, i.e., making a higher one of the pressure detection values less than twice a lower one thereof, if P<b>0</b> and P<b>1</b> are less than 66.5 Pa; and it is more preferable that both pressures becomes less than 53.2 Pa (400 mTorr).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, when the pressure P<b>0</b> of the transfer chamber <b>16</b> is 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr), the scattering probability is small, just a little bit more than 10% even if the pressure P<b>1</b> in the substrate processing chamber <b>2</b> is 1.86 Pa. And, when P<b>0</b> is 9.98 Pa (75 mTorr), the scattering probability is 0% even if the P<b>1</b> is 1.86 Pa. Thus, it can be known that the peeling of the particles can be suppressed if both pressure are 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr) or less, and preferably, 9.98 Pa (75 mTorr).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Still further, it is investigated whether there are particles or not, by supplying (passing) N2 gas into the substrate processing chamber while increasing the flow rate thereof step by step, while the gate valve G closed. The results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> can be obtained. In the right side of the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, arrows are provided. In all cases where the flow rate is being decreased from 500 sccm to 400 sccm, and from 800 sccm to 700 sccm, the particles are generated before decreasing the flow rate but they are not generated after decreasing it. In other words, if N2 gas flows with 500 sccm, for example, the viscous force becomes larger than the case of 400 sccm, so that all the particles to be peeled off are peeled if N2 gas flows with the flow rate smaller than that. It means that if N2 gas flows with 400 sccm thereafter, the particles are not peeled off. Therefore, it can be effective technique for suppressing the scattering of the particle that the purge gas for peeling of particles is supplied in advance, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Meanwhile, in the present invention, a practical substrate processing apparatus may be formed as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, for example. In other words, particle detection means is provided in the vacuum chamber by CCD camera or the like, and it may observed whether the particles are generated or not in the vacuum chamber, e.g., substrate processing chamber, by opening and closing the gate valve G. As the opening and closing timing for detecting the particles, it may be performed when the wafer exists in the vacuum chamber, or the wafer is not loaded in the vacuum chamber due to a change of lot.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, the detection result of the particle is reflected, i.e., inputted to the control unit <b>80</b>. In case where the particles are not detected, the pressure controlling mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> is invalid. On the other hand, in case where the particles are detected, the setting value is changed so that the pressure difference becomes small in the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or the setting value is changed so that both pressures are small in the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and the alarm may be given.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">While the invention has been shown and described with respect to the preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
