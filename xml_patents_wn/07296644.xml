<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a reduction-drive device used to such as a four wheel drive automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a conventional reduction-drive device, there is, for example, a device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The reduction-drive device <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> reduces an output of an electric motor <b>203</b> to transmit to left and right axle shafts and drive the left and right rear wheels. The electric motor <b>203</b> is served as a sub-drive source, and at a side of front wheels, an engine is served as a main drive source, and the left and right front wheels are driven by the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The motor reduction-drive device <b>201</b> rotatably supports a first transmission shaft <b>207</b>, that receives an output of the electric motor <b>203</b>, at a housing <b>205</b> of a stationary side. The first transmission shaft <b>207</b> has a reduction gear <b>211</b> composing a first reduction mechanism <b>209</b>. The reduction gear <b>211</b> is in mesh with another reduction gear <b>213</b> composing the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b>. The reduction gear <b>213</b> is provided to a second transmission shaft <b>215</b>. The second transmission shaft <b>215</b> is disposed in parallel to the first transmission shaft <b>207</b>, and is rotatably supported to the housing <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The second transmission shaft <b>215</b> is provided with a reduction gear <b>219</b> composing a second reduction mechanism <b>217</b>. The reduction gear <b>219</b> is in mesh with another reduction gear <b>221</b> of the second reduction mechanism <b>217</b>. The reduction gear <b>221</b> of the second reduction mechanism <b>217</b> is provided to a third transmission shaft <b>223</b>. The third transmission shaft <b>223</b> is disposed in parallel to the first and second transmission shafts <b>207</b>, <b>213</b> and is rotatably supported to the housing <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The third transmission shaft <b>223</b> is provided with a reduction gear <b>227</b> composing a third reduction mechanism <b>225</b>. The reduction gear <b>227</b> is in mesh with a ring gear <b>229</b> as another reduction gear of the third reduction mechanism <b>225</b>. The ring gear <b>229</b> is provided to a rear differential <b>231</b> as a differential device. A rotating shaft of the rear differential <b>231</b> is disposed in parallel to the first, second, third transmission shafts <b>209</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>223</b>. The rear differential <b>231</b> is connected in interlocking with the left and right rear wheels via axle shafts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, by driving of the electric motor <b>203</b>, the first transmission shaft <b>207</b> is driven to transmit torque to the second transmission shaft <b>215</b> via the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b>. From the second transmission shaft <b>215</b>, via the second reduction mechanism <b>217</b>, the torque is transmitted to the third transmission shaft <b>223</b>, and is transmitted to the rear differential <b>231</b> via the third reduction mechanism <b>225</b>. From the rear differential <b>231</b>, via the left and right axle shafts, the torque is transmitted to the left and right rear wheels, and the left and right rear wheels are driven by the electric motor <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The front wheel side is driven by the engine as the main drive source. Therefore, it is possible to travel as a hybrid automobile of a four wheel drive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, as the conventional reduction-drive device, there is also a device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In the same, for simplifying explanation, the composing parts corresponding to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> will be given the same reference numerals. In the motor reduction-drive device <b>201</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the first transmission shaft <b>207</b> and the second transmission shaft <b>215</b> are coaxially disposed, and the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b>A is composed with a planet gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the output of the electric motor <b>203</b> is transmitted to the first transmission shaft <b>207</b>, reduced at the first reduction <b>209</b>A, and transmitted to the second transmission shaft <b>215</b>. The torque transmission after the second transmission shaft <b>215</b> is the same as the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, since the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b> and <b>209</b>A is installed near the electric motor <b>203</b>, an attaching error of the electric motor <b>203</b> gives a direct influence to the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b> and <b>209</b>A, and improvements of acoustic vibration or durability have been limited owing to occurrences of vibration or abnormal sound in the first reduction mechanism <b>209</b> and <b>209</b>A (see, for example, JP-A-2001-287550).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, as a conventional reduction-drive device, there is, for example, a device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (see, for example, JP-A-2003-104073). The motor reduction-drive device <b>1201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> reduces an output of an electric motor to transmit to left and right axle shafts and drive, left and right rear wheels. The electric motor is served as a sub-drive source. At a side of front wheels, an engine such as an internal combustion is served as a main drive source, and the left and right front wheels are driven by the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The reduction-drive device <b>1201</b> rotatably supports a first transmission shaft <b>1207</b> at a housing <b>1205</b> of a stationary side. The first transmission shaft <b>1207</b> has a reduction gear <b>1211</b> composing a first reduction mechanism <b>1209</b>. The reduction gear <b>1211</b> is in mesh with another reduction gear <b>1215</b> of the first reduction mechanism <b>1209</b>. The reduction gear <b>1215</b> is supported by a second transmission shaft <b>1217</b>. The second transmission shaft <b>1217</b> is disposed in parallel to the first transmission shaft <b>1207</b>, and is rotatably supported to the housing <b>1205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second transmission shaft <b>1217</b> is provided with a reduction gear <b>1221</b> composing a second reduction mechanism <b>1219</b>. The reduction gear <b>1221</b> is in mesh with another reduction gear <b>1223</b> of the second reduction mechanism <b>1219</b>. The reduction gear <b>1223</b> is rotatably supported relatively to a differential case <b>1227</b> of a rear differential device <b>1225</b> via a bearing <b>1229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rear differential device <b>1225</b> supports a differential gear mechanism <b>1231</b> within the differential case <b>1227</b>. The differential case <b>1229</b> is rotatably supported to the housing <b>1205</b> by the bearing <b>1233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Transmission and break of torque between the reduction gear <b>1223</b> and the differential case <b>1229</b> is performed by an electromagnetic clutch <b>1235</b> using multi frictional plates.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, in case the electromagnetic clutch <b>1235</b> is under a torque transmitting condition, if driving an electric motor, a torque reduced through a first and second reduction mechanisms <b>1209</b>, <b>1219</b> is transmitted to a rear differential device <b>1225</b>. From the rear differential device <b>1225</b>, the torque is transmitted to left and right axle shafts. By this torque, driving of an engine is helped when starting travel or ascending travel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the electric motor is at rest, the electromagnetic clutch <b>1235</b> is switched to a torque cutting off condition. Even if, under this switching condition, rotation at the wheel side is transmitted to the rear differential device <b>1225</b>, the rotation is never transmitted to the first, second reduction mechanisms <b>1209</b>, <b>1219</b> and the electric motor.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For getting high output in the reduction-drive device <b>1201</b>, this can be in general accomplished by enlarging a scale of the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, there has been a problem that if building such a structure of merely carrying out the high reduction by the first and second reduction mechanisms <b>1209</b>, <b>1219</b>, abnormal noises easily occur in the reduction gears <b>1211</b>, <b>1215</b> or the reduction gears <b>1221</b>, <b>1223</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the reduction-drive device, the driving source may comprise an electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the reduction-drive device, the driving source may be mounted on an automobile having a main driving source for driving one of front and rear wheels, and a sub-driving source for driving the other of the front and rear wheels, and the driving source is the sub-driving source.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the reduction-drive device, the main driving source may be an internal combustion engine, and the sub-driving source is an electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the reduction-drive device, an output shaft of the first reduction mechanism may be coaxially disposed with the transmission shaft and outer side of the transmission shaft.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the reduction-drive device, the one side of the planetary carrier may be rotatably supported by the first side wall via a bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the reduction-drive device, the other side of the planetary carrier may be supported by the second housing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reduction-drive device may further comprise a carrier pin, and the planetary carrier may be unrotatably supported by the first side wall via the carrier pin.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the reduction-drive device, one of the sun gear and the transmission shaft may be supported by the planetary carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the reduction-drive device, the second reduction mechanism may comprise a pinion gear provided on an outer side of the first reduction mechanism and a ring gear provided on the distribution device.</p>

The reduction-drive device may further comprise a clutch mechanism provided between the first reduction mechanism and the second reduction mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The reduction-drive device may further comprise a clutch mechanism provided between the distribution device and the axle shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Since the second reduction mechanism is disposed between the electric motor and the first reduction mechanism so as to separate the first reduction mechanism from the electric motor, taking a distance, an error in setting-up of the electric motor may be restrained from effecting to the first reduction mechanism, and it is possible to suppress occurrences of vibrations or abnormal sounds in the first reduction mechanism, and to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, the second reduction mechanism is easily disposed between the electric motor and the first reduction mechanism, and it is possible to reduce the driving force of the electric motor by the first reduction mechanism and transmit the driving force reduced from the planetary carrier of the first reduction mechanism to the second reduction mechanism. The driving force can be further reduced by the reduction gear of the second reduction mechanism and the ring gear, and can be certainly transmitted to the differential device.</p>

Further, it is possible to improve the sound oscillating performance as well as the durability.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, the reduction-drive device can transmit rotating output at high speed of the drive source to the sun gear, and transmit, at reduction speed, high speed rotation of the sun gear from the internal gear via the planetary gear rotatably supported at the carrier provided as one body or integrally to the housing. Accordingly, while enabling the high reduction, it is less to invite occurrence of abnormal noises when gearing owing to improvement of supporting rigidity. Further, since the high speed rotation of the drive source is changed to the high reduction, the high output or the high rotation can be obtained though not making the drive source large scaled, and the heavy weight can be restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the sun gear and the output shaft of the drive source more or less deviate from the core by such as an attaching error, this deviation can be absorbed by deflection of the transmission shaft extending till the side of the drive source. Therefore, the engagement between the sun gear and the planetary gear can be steadily performed, enabling to more certainly restrain abnormal noises.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The high speed rotation of the drive source can be reduced in the plural steps between the sun gear and the internal gear, and the drive source can be made smaller in size.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since the drive source is the sub-drive source with respect to the other main drive source, the sub-drive source may be formed to be small in size and light in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since the main drive source is the internal combustion engine, and the sub-drive source is the electric motor, and one of the internal combustion engine and the electric motor drives one of the front wheels and the rear wheels, and the other drives the other wheels, it is possible to make small in size and light in weight the reduction-drive device of transmitting drive power force to one of the front wheels and the rear wheels in the four wheel drive automobile.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a skeleton plan view of the hybrid automobile applied with the motor reduction-drive device according to the first embodiment of the invention. As seeing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hybrid automobile <b>1</b> has the engine <b>3</b> as the main drive source and the electric motor <b>5</b> as the sub-drive source. In the first embodiment, the engine <b>3</b> is the drive source for driving the left and right front wheels <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, while the electric motor <b>5</b> is the drive source for driving the left and right rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>. It is also possible to drive the front wheels by the electric motor <b>5</b> of the sub-drive source, and drive the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> by the engine <b>3</b> of the main drive source.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The output of the engine <b>3</b> is issued into a front differential <b>17</b> as the differential device via a transmission <b>15</b>. To the front differential <b>17</b>, via left and right axle shafts <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, the front wheels <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> are connected in interlocking.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The output of the electric motor <b>5</b> is issued into the motor reduction-drive device <b>23</b>. To the outputting side of the motor reduction-drive device <b>23</b>, via the left and right axle shafts <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, the left and right rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> are connected in interlocking.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The electric motor <b>5</b> is supplied with current from a battery <b>29</b>. The electric motor <b>5</b> is supplied with current by a generator (not shown) generated when the engine <b>3</b> rotates to output, and when reducing speed of the automobile, the electric generation of the generator is charged in the battery <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, while traveling, torque is ordinarily transmitted to the front differential <b>17</b> via the transmission <b>15</b> by driving of the engine <b>3</b>. From the front differential <b>17</b>, via the left and right axle shafts <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, the torque is transmitted to the left and right front wheels <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, by the electric generation of the generator by rotation of the engine <b>3</b>, the electric motor <b>5</b> is supplied with current, and the output of the electric motor <b>5</b> is transmitted to the motor reduction-drive device <b>23</b> from which, via the left and right axle shafts <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, the torque is transmitted to the left and right rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Therefore, the hybrid automobile <b>1</b> can travel under the four wheel driving condition, by driving of the front wheels <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> by the engine <b>3</b> and auxiliary driving of the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> by the electric motor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When starting and accelerating to travel, the electric power supply is added to the electric motor <b>5</b> from the battery <b>29</b>, and smooth starting and accelerating are possible. When reducing the speed of the automobile, the battery <b>29</b> is charged with electric power by the generator to make preparation for subsequent starting and accelerating.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, as the other example, the automobile <b>1</b> may be driven without using a battery <b>29</b> but using an alternator generator provided on the engine <b>3</b> so that the electric power may be directly supplied from the alternator generator to the electric motor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The motor reduction-drive device <b>23</b> of the hybrid automobile <b>1</b> is, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view of the motor reduction-drive device.</p>

Between the end of the axis <b>81</b> and the through part <b>55</b> of the main part <b>39</b>, the seal member <b>59</b> is interposed. At the intermediate part of the axis <b>81</b>, the reduction gear <b>85</b> is integrally furnished. By the way, it is sufficient that the reduction gear is formed as a separate simplex member from the planetary carrier <b>63</b> and is secured to the carrier <b>63</b> rotating integrally.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A plurality of planetary gears <b>65</b> are furnished in the rotating circumferential direction of the planetary carrier <b>63</b>, and are rotatably held by the carrier pin <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The internal gear <b>67</b> made of steel is secured to the side of the cover <b>41</b> of the housing <b>31</b>, so that the internal gear <b>67</b> is unrotatable with respect to the housing <b>31</b>. The internal gear <b>67</b> is formed in the inner circumference of the ring member <b>87</b>. The ring member <b>87</b> is fitted in the side of the cover <b>41</b> of the housing <b>31</b>, and gearing teeth <b>89</b> of the outer circumference are in mesh with teeth <b>91</b> at the side of the cover <b>41</b> to stop rotation and position in the radius direction.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The transmission shaft <b>95</b> is placed within the hollow axis <b>81</b> under relatively rotating freedom, thus the hollow axis <b>81</b> (as an output shaft of the first reduction mechanism) is coaxially disposed with the transmission shaft <b>95</b> and outer side of the transmission shaft <b>95</b>. The transmission shaft <b>95</b> is connected by a spline with the output part <b>97</b> of the electric motor <b>5</b>.

The reduction gear <b>85</b> is formed with a helical pinion gear. The ring gear <b>99</b> is formed with a helical gear similarly to the reduction gear <b>85</b>. The second reduction mechanism <b>35</b> is desirable in gearing rigidity and can suppress occurrence of abnormal noises, since the reduction gear <b>85</b> and the ring gear <b>99</b> are formed with the helical gear. An outer diametrical side of the internal gear <b>67</b> composed in the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> places in a space facing to a side of the boss <b>103</b> of a later mentioned differential case <b>101</b>, and therefore, the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> itself can take large rotating reduction ratio, and contributes to accomplishing of a compact device of two-axle structure by combining with the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the outer circumference of the gearing part <b>123</b> is formed to be polygonal and furnished with a plurality of plane gearing faces <b>125</b>. Between the connecting part <b>121</b> and the gearing face <b>125</b>, rollers <b>127</b> are interposed respectively. The rollers <b>127</b> arranged as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are rotatably supported by a supporting member <b>129</b>. The supporting member <b>129</b> extends outside of the differential case <b>101</b> from a through-hole <b>131</b> of the differential case <b>131</b>, and engages a brake shoe <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The brake shoe <b>133</b> is wound on an outer circumference thereof with a ring shaped spring <b>135</b>. By the spring <b>135</b>, the brake shoe <b>133</b> is forced to the inner circumferential side. The brake shoe <b>133</b> is furnished at an inner circumference thereof with a slide plate <b>137</b> to which the brake shoe <b>133</b> is pressed. The slide plate <b>137</b> is rotatably supported to the outer circumference of the bearing supporter <b>50</b> of the housing <b>31</b>. With respect to the slide plate <b>137</b>, an electromagnet <b>139</b> is arranged at the outside of an end wall <b>52</b> of the housing <b>31</b>. The electromagnet <b>139</b> is fixedly secured to the outside of the housing <b>31</b> by means of screws <b>141</b>, so that providing of the electromagnet <b>139</b> or winding of a lead wire are easy, at the same time excellent in radiation, and stable in the braking performance. Incidentally, division structures are made by the housing <b>31</b> and a part including the end wall <b>52</b> (an inner face in a radius direction) and the bearing supporter <b>50</b> of the bearing <b>109</b>, and the divisional structures are made one body by means of a steel member and bolts, whereby an aluminum alloy member is possible to use to make the housing <b>31</b>, and the weight reduction can be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">An intermittent structure <b>143</b> (as a clutch mechanism) is composed of the connecting part <b>121</b>, the gearing part <b>123</b>, the rollers <b>127</b>, the supporting member <b>129</b>, the brake shoe <b>133</b>, the spring <b>135</b>, the slide plate <b>137</b>, and the electromagnet <b>139</b>. The intermittent structure <b>143</b> is included in the differential <b>37</b> and positioned between the second reduction mechanism <b>217</b> and the axle shafts <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Especially, an actuator constituted of the brake shoe <b>133</b>, the spring <b>135</b>, the slide plate <b>137</b> and the electromagnet <b>139</b> can be applied not only for a clutch mechanism constituted of the connecting part <b>121</b>, the gearing part <b>123</b>, rollers <b>127</b> and supporting member <b>129</b>, but also for the other clutch mechanisms such as a dog clutch and a friction clutch, even if the other clutch mechanisms may be applied to this reduction-drive device. This actuator can perform a good responsiveness and a stable clutch function for various types of clutch mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Accordingly, by rotation of the electric motor <b>5</b>, the driving force is transmitted from the output part of the electric motor <b>5</b> to the transmission shaft <b>95</b>. The sun gear <b>69</b> rotates thereby integrally and the planetary gear <b>65</b> rotates. While the planetary gear <b>65</b> is rotating, it revolves by engaging the internal gear <b>67</b>, and the carrier plates <b>71</b>, <b>73</b> reduce rotation with respect to the transmission shaft <b>95</b> through the carrier pin <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">By the reduced rotation of the carrier plate <b>73</b>, the reduction gear <b>85</b> rotates together, and the torque is transmitted to the ring gear <b>95</b>. The rotation is also reduced by gearing between the reduction gear <b>85</b> and the ring gear <b>99</b>, so that the torque is transmitted to the differential case <b>101</b> at the reduced rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the intermittent mechanism is connected, the torque is transmitted from the differential case <b>101</b> to the inner case <b>111</b>, and transmitted to the side of the axle shafts <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> via the pinion shaft <b>113</b>, the pinion gear <b>115</b>, and the side gears <b>117</b>, <b>119</b> so as to drive the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At differential rotation of the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, the side gears <b>117</b>, <b>119</b> play the differential rotation through the rotation of the pinion gear <b>115</b>, and the differential rotation between the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the intermittent mechanism <b>143</b> is cut off, even if the inner case <b>111</b> rotates, the torque is not transmitted to the differential case <b>101</b>, and the inner case <b>111</b> rotates relatively with respect to the differential case <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Intermittence of the intermittent mechanism <b>143</b> is performed by controlling conduction to the electromagnet <b>139</b>. When the electromagnet <b>139</b> is conducted, the slide plate <b>137</b> is attracted to the side of the electromagnet <b>139</b>, and closely contacted to the inside of the housing <b>131</b>. By this close contact, the brake shoe <b>133</b> displays frictional resistance to the slide plate <b>137</b> and exerts the frictional resistance over the support member <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Each of the rollers <b>127</b> supported by the support member <b>129</b> is effected with rotational control in the rotating direction of the differential case <b>101</b> by the support member <b>129</b>. At this time, if the differential case <b>101</b> further rotates, the rotation of the differential case <b>101</b> goes ahead of the inner case <b>111</b>, and the roller engages an engaging face <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the roller <b>127</b> engages the engaging face <b>125</b>, reaction force to the engaging face <b>123</b> acts on the connecting part <b>121</b> via the roller <b>127</b>. By this reaction, the engaging part <b>121</b> deforms to expand the diameter within a range of elastic deformation, and imparts pressure to the inside of the differential case <b>101</b> outside in a direction along the rotating radius.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Owing to this pressure, the frictional engagement is provided between the outside of the engaging face <b>121</b> and the inside of the differential case <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Accordingly, the frictional engagement between the outside of the engaging face <b>121</b> and the inside of the differential case <b>101</b> is added to the engagement between the engaging face <b>123</b> and the connecting part <b>121</b> provided by engaging the roller <b>127</b> with the engaging face <b>125</b>, so that the differential case <b>101</b> and the inner case <b>111</b> rotate together, and the torque can be transmitted to the side of the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the conduction to the electromagnet <b>139</b> is cut off, the slide plate <b>137</b> may rotate relatively to the bearing support <b>50</b> of the housing <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Since the slide plate <b>137</b>, the brake shoe <b>133</b>, and the support member <b>129</b> rotate as one body, each of the rollers <b>127</b> is not effected with the rotational control, so that it does not engage the engaging face <b>125</b>. The connecting part <b>121</b> is not forced to the inside of the differential case <b>101</b>, and the inner case <b>111</b> does not provide the frictional engagement to the differential case <b>101</b>, either. Therefore, the inner case <b>111</b> is free in relative rotation to the differential case <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Under the condition of this relative rotational freedom, when the electric motor <b>5</b> is at rest, even if the torque is transmitted from the side of the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and the axle shafts <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> to the side gears <b>117</b>, <b>119</b>, the inner case <b>111</b> only rotates via the pinion gear <b>115</b> and the pinion shaft <b>113</b> from the side gears <b>117</b>, <b>119</b>, and the rotation is not transmitted to the differential case <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Therefore, the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b> may be kept stopped, and the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b>, the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> and the electric motor <b>5</b> never rotate. It is accordingly possible to certainly check large energy loss caused by driving the reduction mechanisms <b>35</b>, <b>33</b> from the reverse direction as well as energy loss by driving the stopped electric motor <b>5</b> at the rear wheels <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and possible to attempt an improvement of a fuel consumption, and heighten the durability of the electric motor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Thus, since such a structure is realized that the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b> is arranged between the electric motor <b>5</b> and the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> so as to distribute the output of the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b> to the rear wheels <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> by means of the rear differential <b>37</b>, so that one piece of transmission shaft <b>95</b> exists at the side of the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> other than the rear differential <b>37</b>, and it is possible to reduce in size as a whole, and lighten the weight.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Since the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b> is disposed between the electric motor <b>5</b> and the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> so as to separate the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> from the electricmotor <b>5</b>, taking the distance, an error in setting-up of the electric motor <b>5</b> may be restrained from effecting to a positioning precision of the sun gear <b>69</b> of the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b>, and it is possible to suppress occurrences of vibrations or abnormal sounds in the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b>, and to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">That is, in the hybrid automobile <b>1</b>, the motor reduction-drive device <b>23</b> for transmitting the motive power to the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> may be reduced in size and lightened in weight. Further, it is possible to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Beside, since there is the margin of space in the rear differential <b>37</b> at the side of the electric motor <b>5</b>, it is very easy to provide the intermittent mechanism <b>143</b> of adding a free differential function to the rear differential <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The planetary carrier <b>63</b> is rotatably supported to the walls of the housing <b>31</b>, excellent in supporting rigidity, simple in the mechanism, and less to cause sounds. Reliability may be heightened.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The motor <b>5</b> and clutch mechanism <b>173</b> are adjacently positioned, interposing the main body <b>39</b>, so that their axes are disposed in parallel. Further, the first reduction mechanism <b>33</b> is positioned on an opposite side of the motor <b>5</b> with respect to the axial direction, interposing the second reduction mechanism <b>35</b>. Thereby, the clutch mechanism <b>143</b> and the motor <b>5</b> are disposed in an overlap position in which they are partially overlapped in the axial direction. Furthermore, the actuator (constituted of the brake shoe <b>133</b>, the spring <b>135</b>, the slide plate <b>137</b> and the electromagnet <b>139</b>) and the motor <b>5</b> also are disposed in an overlap position in which they are partially overlapped in the axial direction. Therefore, the reduction-driving device becomes compact in its axial direction.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Therefore, in this embodiment, if the rollers <b>127</b> are effected with rotational control via the supporting member <b>129</b>, each of the rollers <b>127</b> engages the engaging face <b>125</b>A with respect to rotation of the differential case <b>101</b>A, so that the differential case <b>101</b>A and the inner case <b>111</b>A rotate together.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Releasing the rotational control by the supporting member <b>129</b>, the engagement of the roller <b>127</b> with the gearing face <b>125</b>A is released, and the side of the inner case <b>111</b>A may rotate relatively to the differential case <b>101</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thus, also in this embodiment, similarly to the first embodiment, the first and second reduction mechanisms <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> are not forcibly rotated by the rear wheels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, and the fuel consumption may be increased.</p>

Specifically, the reduction gear <b>1098</b> is provided at the boss part <b>1091</b> of the rotating member <b>1088</b> between the ball bearings <b>1093</b>, <b>1097</b>. The reduction gear <b>1098</b> is formed with a helical pinion gear. The ring gear <b>1099</b> is formed with a helical gear similarly to the reduction gear <b>1098</b>. The second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b> is desirable in gearing rigidity and can suppress occurrence of abnormal noises, since the reduction gear <b>1098</b> and the ring gear <b>1099</b> are formed with the helical gear.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The rear differential <b>1037</b> is provided with the differential case <b>1101</b> having the ring gear <b>1099</b>. The differential case <b>1101</b> has the left and right boss parts <b>1103</b>, <b>1105</b>. In the differential <b>1101</b>, the boss parts <b>1103</b>, <b>1105</b> are turnably supported by the ball bearings <b>1107</b>, <b>1109</b> in the bearing supporters <b>1048</b>, <b>1050</b> of the housing <b>1031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the differential case <b>1101</b>, an inner case <b>1111</b> is received and is relatively rotatable with respect to the differential case <b>1101</b>. The inner case <b>1111</b> has a center of a rotating shaft coaxially with a center of a rotating shaft of the differential case <b>1101</b>, and is almost cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">To the inner case <b>1111</b>, a pinion gear <b>1115</b> is supported via a pinion shaft <b>1113</b>. The left and right side gears <b>1117</b>, <b>1119</b> are in mesh with and connected to the pinion gear <b>1115</b>. The side gears <b>1117</b>, <b>1119</b> are interlocked with the axle shafts <b>1025</b>, <b>26</b> at the side of the rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">At the end of the inner case <b>1111</b>, a connecting part <b>1121</b> is provided which is smaller in diameter than other parts. To the differential case <b>1101</b>, a gear <b>1123</b> is provided which places at the outer circumferential side of the connecting part <b>1121</b>. An inner circumferential side of the gear <b>1123</b> is as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the relation between the connecting part <b>1121</b> and the gear <b>1123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the inner circumference of the gearing part <b>1123</b> is formed to be polygonal and furnished with a plurality of plane gearing faces <b>1125</b>. Between the connecting part <b>1121</b> and the gearing face <b>1125</b>, rollers <b>1127</b> are interposed respectively. The arranged rollers <b>1127</b> are rotatably supported by a supporting member <b>1129</b>. The supporting member <b>1129</b> extends outside of the differential case <b>1101</b> from a through-hole <b>1131</b> of the differential case <b>1101</b>, and engages a brake shoe <b>1133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The brake shoe <b>1133</b> is wound on an outer circumference thereof with a ring shaped spring <b>1135</b>. By the spring <b>1135</b>, the brake shoe <b>1133</b> is forced to the inner circumferential side. The brake shoe <b>1133</b> is furnished at an inner circumference thereof with a steel-made slide plate <b>1137</b> to which the brake shoe <b>1133</b> is pressed. The slide plate <b>1137</b> is rotatably supported to the outer circumference of the bearing supporter <b>1050</b> of the housing <b>1031</b>. The slide plate <b>1137</b> functions a lining for the housing <b>1031</b> formed with s light metal, for example, aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Next, workings will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">By rotation of the electric motor <b>1005</b>, the driving force is transmitted from an output shaft <b>1082</b> of the electric motor <b>1005</b> to the transmission shaft <b>1084</b>. The sun gear <b>1069</b> rotates integrally by this transmission and the planetary gear <b>1065</b> rotates. The planetary gear <b>1065</b> rotates around the carrier pin <b>1075</b> at the stationary side, but it does not revolve. By the rotation of the planetary gear <b>1065</b>, the internal gear <b>1067</b> reduces rotation, and by this rotation, the rotating member <b>1088</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">By the rotation of the rotating member <b>1088</b>, the reduction gear <b>1098</b> rotates together, and the torque is transmitted to the ring gear <b>1099</b>. The rotation is also reduced by gearing between the reduction gear <b>1098</b> and the ring gear <b>1099</b>, so that the torque is transmitted to the differential case <b>1101</b> at the reduced rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The supporting member <b>1129</b> frictionally engages a slide ring <b>1137</b> via the brake shoe <b>1133</b>. By the frictional engagement, the rotation of the supporting member <b>1129</b> is delayed with respect to the differential case <b>1101</b>. By this delay, the rollers <b>1127</b> engages an engaging face <b>1125</b>, so that the differential case <b>1101</b> and the inner case <b>1111</b> rotate together, enabling to transmit the torque to the rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b> as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">When the rotating output of the electric motor <b>1005</b> stops, the rotation of the differential case <b>1101</b> also stops. Then, the rotation is input from the left and right rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b>, and even if the inner case <b>1111</b> rotates via the side gears <b>1117</b>, <b>1119</b>, the pinion gear <b>1115</b>, and the pinion shaft <b>1113</b>, since the roller <b>1127</b> makes an idle running in a valley of the engaging face <b>1125</b>, the roller <b>1127</b> does not engage the engage face <b>1125</b>. Therefore, the inner case <b>1111</b> may rotate relatively under freedom to the differential case <b>1101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Under this relative rotational freedom, when the electric motor <b>1005</b> is at rest, even if the torque is transmitted from the side of the rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b> to the axle shafts <b>1025</b>, <b>1027</b>, the side gears <b>1117</b>, and <b>1119</b>, the inner case <b>1111</b> only rotates via the pinion gear <b>1115</b> and the pinion shaft <b>1113</b> from the side gears <b>1117</b>, <b>1119</b>, and the rotation is not transmitted to the differential case <b>1101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Therefore, the second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b> may be kept stopped, and the second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b>, the first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b> and the electric motor <b>1005</b> never rotate by the rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b>. It is accordingly possible to certainly check large energy loss caused by driving the reduction mechanisms <b>1035</b>, <b>1033</b> in the reverse direction as well as energy loss by driving the stopped electric motor <b>1005</b> at the rear wheels <b>1025</b>, <b>1027</b>, attempt an improvement of a fuel consumption, and heighten the durability of the electric motor <b>1005</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In such a manner, it is possible to transmit the rotating output at high speed of the electric motor <b>1005</b> to the sun gear <b>1069</b>, and to transmit at reduction the high speed rotation of the sun gear <b>1069</b> via the planetary gear <b>1065</b> from the internal gear <b>1067</b>. Accordingly, while performing the high speed reduction, occurrences of abnormal noises are less to cause. Further, since the high speed rotation of the electric motor <b>1005</b> is reduced at high speed, the high output may be obtained, though the electric motor is not made large in size, and weight increase may be restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Beside, the carrier <b>1063</b> is supported to the stationary side, and since the internal gear <b>1067</b> is supported in the boss part <b>1085</b> of the carrier <b>1063</b> and the wall <b>1095</b> of the housing <b>1031</b>, the supporting rigidity of the internal gear <b>1067</b> is high, and the gearing between the internal gear <b>1067</b> and the planetary gear <b>1065</b> may be certainly made, causing no or little rattling.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Even if the sun gear <b>1069</b> and the output shaft <b>1082</b> of the electric motor <b>1005</b> more or less deviate from the core owing to such as an attaching error, the core deviation can be absorbed by deflection of the transmission shaft <b>1078</b> extending till the electric motor. In this case, the intermediate part <b>1084</b> of the transmission shaft <b>1078</b> is formed to be narrower in diameter than both ends, and therefore the deflection may be accelerated.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Therefore, the core deviation is difficult to extend to the gearing part between the sun gear <b>1069</b> and the planetary gear <b>1065</b>, and in particular, since both sides of the sun gear <b>1069</b> is supported to the stationary side by the needle bearing <b>1080</b>, the ball bearing <b>1086</b>, and the carrier <b>1063</b>, the gearing between the sun gear <b>1069</b> and the planetary gear <b>1065</b> can be certainly made.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Thereby, since the gearing at the first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b> causes no rattling or less rattling, abnormal noises can be certainly suppressed from the low speed rotation to the high speed rotation. Further, being no rattling or less rattling, the durability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b>, the reduction gear <b>1098</b> is supported at one side thereof by the housing <b>1031</b> via the ball bearing <b>1093</b> and the carrier <b>1063</b>, and is supported at the other side by the housing <b>1031</b> via the ball bearing <b>1097</b>, and therefore, the supporting rigidity is high, and the gearing between the reduction gear <b>1098</b> and the ring gear <b>1099</b> can be steadily carried out with no or little rattling.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Accordingly, from the low speed rotation to the high speed rotation, abnormal noises can be certainly suppressed in the second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b>. Further, being no or less rattling, the durability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Since abnormal noises can be suppressed, the electric motor <b>1005</b> can be rotated at high speed, and the high output and the high speed rotation are available by the miniaturized electric motor <b>1005</b> as the reduction drive device <b>1023</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The second reduction mechanism <b>10035</b> is placed between the electric motor <b>1005</b> and the first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b>, and the output of the second reduction mechanism <b>1035</b> is distributed to the rear wheels <b>1025</b>, <b>1027</b> by the rear differential device <b>1037</b>, so that such a structure is available that one piece of transmission shaft <b>1078</b> exists at the side of the first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b> other than the rear differential <b>1037</b>, and it is possible to reduce in size as a whole, and lighten the weight.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">That is, in the four wheel drive automobile <b>1001</b>, the reduction-drive device <b>1023</b> for transmitting the motive power to the rear wheels <b>1011</b>, <b>1013</b> maybe reduced in size and lightened in weight. Further, it is possible to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Beside, since there is a margin of space in the rear differential device <b>1037</b> at the side of the electric motor <b>1005</b>, it is very easy to provide the intermittent mechanism of adding a free differential function to the rear differential device <b>1037</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The electric motor <b>1005</b> is the sub-drive source for the other engine <b>1003</b>, so that the electric motor <b>1005</b> may be miniaturized and lightened in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b> can be taken off as one body together with the cover <b>1041</b> from the housing <b>1031</b>. By taking off as one body, it is easy to set up, disassemble and repair the first reduction mechanism <b>1033</b>.</p>

The planetary gear <b>1065</b>A may be formed in plural steps more than the two steps. The planetary gear <b>1065</b>A is rotatably supported by the carrier pin <b>1075</b> via the needle bearing <b>1087</b>A. The sun gear <b>1069</b> is in mesh with the first step gear <b>1065</b>Aa, while the internal gear <b>1067</b> is in mesh with the second step gear <b>1065</b>Ab.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The rotating input from the electric motor <b>1005</b> is reduced in two steps between the sun gear <b>1069</b>—the first step gear <b>1065</b>Aa and the internal gear <b>1067</b>—the second step gear <b>1065</b>Ab. Thus, the higher reduction can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Accordingly, in this embodiment, the similar effect to that of the third embodiment is displayed, beside, the high output can be obtained by the more miniaturized electric motor <b>1005</b>.</p>
