<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2003-43574, filed Jun. 30, 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor package and a method for manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a stack type ball grid array (BGA) package including one or more semiconductor chips and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic industries continue to seek products, such as mobile phones and PDAs that are lighter, faster, smaller, multi-functional, more reliable and more cost-effective. In order to meet the requirement of the electronic industries, semiconductor devices have become increasingly integrated. A representative semiconductor package using solder balls (instead of connecting pins) is a BGA package and a representative packaging process adopted in integrated semiconductor packages is a chip scale package (CSP).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Demand for more compact semiconductor devices with larger capacity has resulted in the development of stacked BGA packages. In general, a stacked BGA package have been adopted because of the possibility of increasing the memory capacity of a semiconductor package by two or more times, as a result of stacking two or more packages.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional stacked BGA package using a flexible printed circuit board <b>20</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional stacked BGA package may typically include the flexible printed circuit board <b>20</b> between a first package <b>10</b> and a second package <b>30</b>. The first and second packages <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> may include package bodies <b>12</b> and <b>32</b> with a semiconductor chip (not shown) and solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> exposed outside of the package bodies <b>12</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively. Also, the solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> may be arranged to correspond each other. The flexible printed circuit board <b>20</b> may include at least one first portion <b>21</b> which is placed between the solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b>, and a second portion <b>22</b> which are extended from the first portion <b>21</b>. The second portion <b>22</b> may be attached to a surface of the second package <b>30</b> surrounding a side portion of the second package <b>30</b>. In addition, the second portion <b>22</b> may include one or more external connection terminals <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> may be provided on both the top and bottom of each package <b>10</b> and <b>30</b>. Further, a passivation layer may be placed between the solder balls <b>14</b> and/or a film, such as a Cu film, may be placed between the solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, the conventional stacked BGA package has advantages, for example, decreasing the package size and/or increasing the capacity of a unit package, by forming the solder balls <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> on the bottom of the chips. However, the conventional stacked BGA package using the flexible printed circuit board <b>20</b> may extend the electrical connecting length between the first and second package <b>10</b> and <b>30</b>. In this case, the flexible printed circuit board <b>20</b> should be used to manufacturing the stacked BGA package.</p>
