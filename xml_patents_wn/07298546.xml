<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ultraviolet light source that amplifies signal light in an infrared-to-visible range by a fiber optical amplifier and converts the amplified light into ultraviolet light as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system. The present invention relates also to laser treatment apparatus and to exposure apparatus, each apparatus comprising an ultraviolet light source, respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, ultraviolet laser lights, which have short wavelengths and high temporal coherence, are used in various fields. For example, ultraviolet laser light are used in exposure apparatus in semiconductor-device and in surgical and laser treatment apparatus for such operations as performed in surgery, ophthalmology and dentistry. Ultraviolet laser light are used also in various measuring instruments and analyzers and in processing apparatus. Ultraviolet light sources used in such apparatus include KrF excimer laser, which has an oscillation wavelength at λ=248 nm, and ArF excimer laser, which has an oscillation wavelength at λ=193 nm. Although these excimer lasers are already comprised as light sources in various apparatus, they have problems of troublesome maintenance and high running costs because these lasers use fluorine gas as an operational medium besides their being expensive and large in size.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a study has been eagerly conducted for an all solid state ultraviolet light source that comprises as a signal light source a solid state laser oscillating in an infrared-to-visible range, that amplifies the light output from the solid state laser by a fiber optical amplifier, and that converts the amplified light into ultraviolet light having a predetermined wavelength as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system. As such an all solid state ultraviolet light source, a proposed ultraviolet light source comprises as a signal light source a DFB semiconductor laser oscillating stably in a band at wavelength λ=1.55 μm, amplifies the light output from the semiconductor laser to a desired light intensity by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (hereinafter abbreviated to “EDFA”), and converts the amplified light to ultraviolet light having a wavelength λ=193 nm, which is the eighth harmonic, as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system, which comprises a crystal for wavelength conversion (refer to, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-200747 and No. 2001-353176).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As EDFAs used in such an all solid state ultraviolet light source, known are a single-clad EDFA, which excites an erbium-doped single-clad and single mode fiber (EDF) by a semiconductor laser of single mode oscillation, and a double-clad EDFA, which excites a double-clad EDF by a semiconductor laser of multi-mode oscillation (refer to, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-200747 and No. 2001-353176).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Yet, prior-art EDFAs such as those mentioned above have the following problems. First of all, for a single-clad EDFA, the optical power of the single mode oscillation semiconductor laser that excites the EDFA is limited within a range of hundreds of mW, which is comparatively low, so signal light at a low repetition frequency of a few kHz and at a low duty must be used to generate a peak power higher than 10 kW (with a pulse width of up to 1 ns). The light output from the EDFA in this case, even if a high peak power is gained, achieves only a relatively low power of about 100 mW at the most as an average power. This is a problem indicating that the original amplifying ability of the fiber optical amplifier is not utilized fully.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, in a fiber-optical amplifier like that described above, it is a common practice to arrange a plurality of EDFAs in series connection in a multiple stage construction to achieve a predetermined peak power. However the ASE lights generated in the EDFA are added as DC noises to the signal-less parts between adjacent signal pulses, which leads to a significant reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal. Therefore, as an arrangement for removing DC noise components in a multi-staged EDFA, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element is provided between adjacent stages, and each modulating element is controlled to synchronize with a signal light source to supply signal light at a high signal-to-noise ratio to a rear stage EDFA. However, the construction of the EDFA becomes complicated, and the manufacturing cost of the EDFA also grows expensive. In addition, there is a problem of loss in the signal light caused by inserting the modulation elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, a double-clad EDFA comprises a first clad and a second clad. The first clad surrounds a core doped with a laser medium and functions as a coupler for excitation light, and the second clad is formed around the first clad to provide a waveguide to the first clad. As the first clad has a multi-mode and a relatively large cross-sectional area, it can efficiently couple high-power semiconductor lasers that have multi-mode oscillations, improving the power transmission of the excitation light, and thereby increases the pulse repetition frequency and the average output power. However, in a double-clad EDFA, the excitation efficiency per unit length is lower than a single-clad EDFA, which feeds excitation light directly into the core. Because of this, it is difficult to reduce the length of the fiber in a double-clad EDFA, so there is a problem of an increased loss in the signal light, which is caused by nonlinear effects such as a parametric process or a simulated Raman scattering, occurring in the fiber. As a result, a double-clad EDFA cannot achieve as high a peak power as a single-clad EDFA.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Ultraviolet Light Source</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At first, an embodiment of an ultraviolet light source according to the present invention is described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1˜FIG</figref>. <b>4</b>, each of which shows a section of the ultraviolet light source. The ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> comprises a laser light source <b>10</b>, which generates signal light in an infrared-to-visible range, an optical amplifier <b>20</b>, which includes a front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> and a rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> and amplifies the signal light generated by the laser light source <b>10</b>, and a wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b>, which converts the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier into ultraviolet light as an output in wavelength conversion. The ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> further comprises a single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source <b>26</b> for the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> of the optical amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The laser light source <b>10</b> comprises a solid state laser <b>11</b> and a controller <b>12</b>, which controls the operation of the solid state laser, and the laser light source <b>10</b> is a signal light source that outputs signal light in pulses to the light amplifier <b>20</b>. The solid state laser <b>11</b> can be, for example, an InGaAsP, Distributed Feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser, which oscillates at wavelength λ=1.55 μm in an infrared band. The oscillating wavelength of the above mentioned DFB semiconductor laser has temperature dependency of about 0.1 nm/degree C., so while the semiconductor laser is controlled at constant temperature, it outputs narrow-band infrared light at a single wavelength, for example, λ=1547 nm. The controller <b>12</b>, which is a driver that controls the DFB semiconductor laser <b>11</b>, supplies a driving signal with a pulse width of about 1 ns at repetition-frequency f=tens or hundreds kHz to the DFB semiconductor laser <b>11</b>, so that the DFB semiconductor laser <b>11</b> operates in pulse oscillation and outputs a pulse-like signal light at a peak power of about 10 mW to the optical amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An external modulator, for example, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element may be used to form optical pulses from an output of the DFB semiconductor laser <b>11</b> stably oscillating in CW mode. By such an arrangement, narrow-band signal light with little frequency chirp can be output to the optical amplifier <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The optical amplifier <b>20</b>, which is an amplifier that amplifies the signal light having a wavelength λ=1547 nm output from the laser light source <b>10</b>, comprises the above mentioned front stage and rear stage fiber optical amplifiers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, a polarization controller <b>24</b>, a compound module <b>25</b>, and the above mentioned excitation light source <b>26</b>, which excites the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b>. In the optical amplifier <b>20</b>, the front stage and rear stage fiber optical amplifiers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are connected with each other in series.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The polarization controller <b>24</b>, which is provided at the input part of the optical amplifier <b>20</b>, is a fiber type polarization controller, and controls the polarization of the signal light to suppress nonlinear processes like four-wave mixing or stimulated Raman scattering, which can occur at the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> is a preamplifier that amplifies the signal light of a peak power of about 10 mW output from the laser light source <b>10</b> up to about 1 kW. As the peak power of the light output is about 1 kW at this preamplifier part, a single clad erbium-doped fiber (EDF) is used as the fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>, and the output of a single mode semiconductor laser as excitation light is coupled to the EDF. This excitation light source for the EDF, which constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>, and a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM), which leads the excitation light to the fiber core are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For a stable optical amplification of the peak power from 10 mW to 1 kW (gain 50 dB), it is preferable that the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> comprise two stages of EDFAs. In this case, between the first stage EDFA and the second stage EDFA, a narrow-band filter is provided to remove ASE, which is generated at the first stage, and an isolator is inserted to suppress the oscillations at the first stage and at the second stage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that the signal gain decreases in the range where the peak power exceeds 1 kW because of nonlinear effects such as four-wave mixing or stimulated Raman scattering. Therefore, it is desirable that the fiber of the fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>, if the fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> comprises a single stage, or the fiber of the second stage, if the fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> comprises two stages, be a single clad EDF with high erbium concentration (Er concentration&gt;1000 ppm) and a large mode radius of about 10 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The signal light emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> enters the compound module <b>25</b>, in which a collimator lens <b>251</b>, a narrow-band filter <b>252</b>, an isolator <b>253</b>, a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) <b>254</b>, a collimator lens <b>255</b>, and a condenser lens <b>256</b> are assembled together into one unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Here, the narrow-band filter <b>252</b> is a filter that passes signal light only within a predetermined transmission bandwidth whose center is at the output wavelength of the DFB semiconductor laser <b>11</b>. As the narrow-band filter <b>252</b>, a narrow-band filter with a transmission bandwidth of, for example, about 1 nm is used to remove noise components like ASE that is generated at the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal light fed into the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b>. In addition, an isolator <b>253</b> is provided to isolate the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> from the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> for preventing oscillation caused by the backward propagation of the light coming from the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> and gain reduction caused by multiple reflections of the ASE.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Wavelength Division Multiplexer (hereinafter referred to as “WDM”) <b>254</b> is a device that mixes the signal light, which is emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> and is collimated by the collimator lens <b>251</b>, with the excitation light (pumping light), which is led from the excitation light source <b>26</b> through a fiber <b>268</b> and is collimated by the collimator lens <b>255</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a reflective type WDM, which superposes coaxially the signal light and the excitation light by transmitting the signal light having a wavelength λ=1547 nm, which is emitted from the fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>, and by reflecting the excitation light having a wavelength λ=1480 nm, which is led from the excitation light source (Raman fiber laser) <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fiber-type compound module <b>25</b>, which comprises the above described optical elements as a unit, has a high efficiency because of its design minimizing coupling loss and fusion splice loss. It also avoids nonlinear effect as fibers involved can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The excitation light source <b>26</b> is a single mode fiber laser, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a Raman fiber laser as an example. The Raman fiber laser <b>26</b> is an excitation light source for the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> and supplies excitation light having a wavelength λ=1480 nm at a single mode CW power of 10 W through a fiber <b>268</b> to the WDM <b>254</b>. Here, the Raman fiber laser is explained briefly. It is a laser that comprises a ytterbium-doped fiber laser and a cascade Raman resonator including FBGs. The output terminal of the ytterbium-doped fiber laser is connected to the cascade Raman resonator. It can output a laser light at a CW power of up to about 20 W and at wavelength λ=1480 nm in single mode.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the excitation light source <b>26</b> is operated in a range where the excitation light output therefrom exceeds 5 W in CW power, then instead of the reflective type WDM used in the compound module <b>25</b> described above, preferably, a fiber-fused type WDM <b>29</b> be provided separately in addition to a compound module <b>28</b>, which comprises an isolator and a band-pass filter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. By this arrangement, the optical amplifier can be durable even in a case where a high power excitation light source is used to generate an average power above 5 W.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the case where the reflective type WDM <b>254</b> is used, the coupling can be done not only by a forward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is the same as that of the signal light) but also by a backward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is opposite to that of the signal light) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, in the case where the fiber-fused type WDM <b>29</b> is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is preferable that a forward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is the same as that of the signal light) be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the fiber-fused type WDM <b>29</b> is used in a backward excitation, then signal light at a high peak power, which has been amplified, passes through the WDM <b>29</b>, inducing a nonlinear process. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve a high peak power.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, if a forward excitation is executed, then no nonlinear process is induced because signal light at a low peak power before its amplification passes through the WDM. In this case, it is possible to achieve a high peak power.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At the outlet of the EDF, where signal light at a high power passes, even though the power of the excitation light decreases while it passes through the EDF, the Raman fiber laser maintains a sufficiently high power for the signal light relatively and does not interfere with the amplification of the signal light occurring near the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The signal light emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> and the excitation light emitted from the Raman fiber laser <b>26</b>, which are combined coaxially at the WDM <b>254</b> in the above described way, are collected by the condenser lens <b>256</b> and then fed into the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> is the last stage amplifier, which amplifies the signal light at a peak power of 1 kW after the amplification by the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b> up to a peak power of about 20 kW. This fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> comprises a single clad EDF and operates with single mode high power excitation light, which is fed from the Raman fiber laser <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At the rear stage fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b>, the peak power of the input signal light is a already about 1 KW, which is amplified to become extremely high about 20 KW at the output of the amplifier. Therefore, the EDF comprises a single clad EDF doped with erbium at a high concentration (Er&gt;1000 ppm) and has a large mode diameter greater than about 10 μm to avoid nonlinear process in the fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph describing a relation between the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser and the power of the signal light (fundamental wave output at 1547 nm) output from the light amplifier. The signal light output from the optical amplifier is controlled by changing the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser. The repetition-frequencies of the signal light at 100 kHz and at 200 kHz are indicated by (---▪--- ) and by (<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.56mm" wi="8.47mm" file="US07298546-20071120-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>), respectively, and an LD excitation is indicated by (<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="3.56mm" wi="7.79mm" file="US07298546-20071120-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this arrangement, for example, when the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser <b>26</b> is at 10 W, the signal light having a repetition-frequency f=200 kHz with a pulse width of 1 ns and a peak power of 10 mW, which is input from the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>, is amplified to infrared light at a high power with a peak power of 15 kW and an average power of more than 3 W as an output.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By using a high power single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source for the last stage fiber optical amplifier in this way, the optical amplifier can achieve both a high peak power of more than 20 kW and a high average power of more than 2 W. In addition, a single clad and single mode EDF, which has a high excitation efficiency per unit length as EDF, can be used. Therefore, by shortening the fiber length of the EDFA, the device can be made smaller and lighter and the optical amplifier is realized with both a high peak power and a high average power.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, the pulse-repetition frequency of the signal light can be increased up to hundreds kHz, increasing the pulse signal ON time per unit time and decreasing the pulse signal OFF time per unit time. As a result, the DC noise component in the signal light decreases correspondingly, and the signal-to-noise ratio improves remarkably. Therefore, this system does not need active modulating elements like electro-optic modulating elements or acousto-optic modulating elements, which are provided in a prior-art multi-staged EDFA between adjacent stages to cut the DC noise component, and therefore it does not need a controller that synchronizes the operation of these modulating elements to pulses of the signal light. As a result, the optical amplifier can be simplified substantially, reducing manufacturing cost and realizing a high stabilization.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above described embodiment discloses an example that uses an EDF whose core is doped only with erbium. However, a Yb-codoped EDF, which is an EDF added with ytterbium (Yb) in addition to erbium, can be also used. In this case, the fiber optical amplifier <b>22</b> comprises a ytterbium-doped fiber laser as a single mode fiber laser for the excitation light source <b>26</b>. The ytterbium-doped fiber laser achieves a CW power of more than 10 W in single mode, so it can constitute a fiber optical amplifier that can output an average power of more than 2 W like the EDFA which comprises a Raman fiber laser as an excitation light source in the above described case.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> disclose examples that comprise an LD <b>23</b> as an excitation light source for the EDF that constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>. However, a Raman fiber laser can be used also as an excitation light source for the EDF that constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier <b>21</b>. In this case, a Raman fiber laser, which is different from the Raman fiber laser <b>26</b>, is provided additionally, or the fiber <b>268</b> provided to the Raman fiber laser <b>26</b> is branched, and this branch fiber is provided to a compound module (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The signal light having a wavelength λ=1547 nm amplified by the optical amplifier <b>20</b> is collimated once by a collimator lens <b>27</b> and then output to the wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b>, which is an optical system that converts the signal light in an infrared range coming from the optical amplifier <b>20</b> into ultraviolet light. As an example of wavelength-converting optical system that functions in this way, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an arrangement that converts the signal light (fundamental wave laser light Lr) having a wavelength λ=1547 nm input from the optical amplifier <b>20</b> into an ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength λ=193.4 nm, which is the eighth harmonic of the fundamental wave, as an output. This diagram is referred to in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b> comprises wavelength conversion crystals <b>31</b>˜<b>35</b>, lenses <b>41</b>˜<b>47</b>, each of which is provided between adjacent wavelength conversion crystals, respectively, to collect a laser light emitted from a wavelength conversion crystal and to feed it to a next wavelength conversion crystal in line, mirrors <b>51</b>˜<b>58</b> for separating or combining higher degree harmonics, and wave plates <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>, which adjust polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The fundamental wave laser light Lr having a wavelength λ=1547 nm input from the optical amplifier <b>20</b>, which is shown on the left side of the schematic diagram, passes through the wavelength conversion crystals <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> in the left-to-right direction in the diagram while it is being separated or combined by dichroic mirrors, which have a characteristic of wavelength selectivity. In this process, the fundamental wave (λ=1547 nm) undergoes wavelength conversion and is converted into the second harmonic (λ=773.5 nm), into the third harmonic (λ=515.6 nm), into the sixth harmonic (λ=257.8 nm), into the seventh harmonic (λ=221 nm), and into the eighth harmonic (λ=193.4 nm) in this listed order. Finally, the converted wave is output to the right side of the schematic diagram as ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength λ=194.3 nm, which corresponds to the eighth harmonic (eighth higher harmonic) of the fundamental wave.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first wavelength-converting section, which converts the fundamental wave into the second harmonic, comprises an LiB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>crystal (LBO crystal) as the wavelength conversion crystal <b>31</b>. The phase matching is achieved by tuning the temperature of the LBO crystal (Non-Critical Phase Matching (NCPM)). At the LBO crystal <b>31</b>, a Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is performed to generate the second harmonic (frequency 2ω, wavelength λ=773.5 nm), having frequency which is twice of the fundamental wave of the light.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second harmonic, which has been generated in wavelength conversion at the LBO crystal <b>31</b>, and the fundamental wave (ω), which has passed through the crystal <b>31</b> without wavelength conversion, are led into a wave plate <b>48</b>, where they are given delays of one wavelength and half a wavelength, respectively, and where only the polarization of the fundamental wave is rotated by 90 degrees. Then, they are passed through a condenser lens (achromat) <b>42</b>, which makes the light having these two wavelengths incident at the same point of a second wavelength conversion crystal <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second wavelength-converting section comprises an LBO crystal as the wavelength conversion crystal <b>32</b>, which is used by an NCPM at a temperature different from that for the LBO crystal <b>31</b> of the first wavelength-converting section. At the LBO crystal <b>32</b>, a Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) is performed to generate the third harmonic (3ω, λ=515.6 nm) from the second harmonic (2ω), which has been generated by the first wavelength-converting section, and the fundamental wave (ω), which has been transmitted without wavelength conversion (3ω=2ω+ω).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The third harmonic, which has been generated in wavelength conversion at the LBO crystal <b>32</b>, and the fundamental wave (ω), which has passed through the crystal <b>32</b> without wavelength conversion, are separated by a dichroic mirror <b>51</b>.

The sixth harmonic, which has been generated by the CLBO crystal <b>33</b>, is led through a mirror <b>53</b> and a condenser lens <b>45</b> to a dichroic mirror <b>54</b>, where it is coaxially combined with the fundamental wave (ω), and combined waves are fed into a fourth wavelength conversion crystal <b>34</b>. Incidentally, a β-BaB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>crystal (BBO crystal) may be used instead of the CLBO crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The fourth wavelength-converting section comprises a CsB<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>crystal (CBO crystal) as the wavelength conversion crystal <b>34</b>, which is used under angular phase matching condition to generate the seventh harmonic (7ω, λ=221 nm) from the fundamental wave (ω) and the sixth harmonic (6ω) by a sum-frequency generation (7ω=ω+6ω). The seventh harmonic, which has been generated in wavelength conversion at the CBO crystal <b>34</b>, and the fundamental wave (ω), which has passed through the crystal <b>34</b> without wavelength conversion, are separated by a dichroic mirror <b>55</b>. The seventh harmonic (7ω) is reflected by the dichroic mirror <b>55</b> and led through another mirror <b>57</b>, a condenser lens <b>47</b> and another dichroic mirror <b>58</b> to a fifth wavelength conversion crystal <b>35</b>. On the other hand, the fundamental wave (ω) passes through the dichroic mirror <b>55</b>, and its polarization is rotated by 90 degrees at a wave plate <b>49</b>. Then, it is passed through a condenser lens <b>46</b> and combined coaxially with the seventh harmonic by a dichroic mirror <b>58</b> and fed into the wavelength conversion crystal <b>35</b> of a fifth wavelength-converting section. Incidentally, instead of the CBO crystal, a CLBO crystal or a BBO crystal can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fifth wavelength-converting section comprises a CLBO crystal as the wavelength conversion crystal <b>35</b>, which is used under angular phase matching condition to generate the eighth harmonic (8ω, λ=193.4 nm) from the fundamental wave (ω) and the seventh harmonic (7ω) by a sum-frequency generation (8ω=ω+7ω). Incidentally, instead of the CLBO crystal, an LBO crystal may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this way, the fundamental wave laser light (amplified signal light) Lr having a wavelength λ=1547 nm, which is input from the optical amplifier <b>20</b> to the wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b>, undergoes sequential wavelength conversions while it is passing through the five wavelength-converting sections, and it is output as an ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength λ=193 nm, which is the eighth harmonic of the fundamental wave. As the wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b> performs wavelength conversions utilizing the property of the signal light input therein, it can output ultraviolet light at a high peak power and a high average power.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph describing a relation between the power of a fundamental wave having a wavelength 1547 nm and that of the eighth harmonic of the fundamental wave, which has a wavelength of 193 nm. The efficiency of the conversion from the fundamental wave having 1547 nm to the eighth harmonic having 193 nm is about 4.5%, which is relatively high, and this indicates that the fundamental wave light has a high quality.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is clear from the ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> described above that the present invention provides an all solid state ultraviolet light source which has a simple and compact construction and therefore does not require complicated maintenance work and which can output ultraviolet light at a high peak power and a high average power.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the above described embodiment, a DFB semiconductor laser, which operates at an oscillation wavelength of λ=1547 nm in an infrared range, is used as an example of laser light source <b>10</b>, which generates the signal light. Also, the wavelength-converting optical system <b>30</b> is illustrated as an arrangement that comprises five wavelength conversion crystals for converting the fundamental wave into the eighth harmonic having a wavelength λ=193.4 nm, which is equal to that generated by an ArF excimer laser. However, the laser light source <b>10</b> may be an Er-YAG laser or a laser for a visible light range, and the wavelength-converting optical system may comprise another well-known crystal arrangement (for example, fundamental waveω→2ω→4ω→8ω) or may take a fiber configuration. Moreover, the wavelength of the ultraviolet light emitted from the ultraviolet light source is not limited to a band at 193 nm. It may be, for example, in a 248 nm band, which is substantially equal to that generated by a KrF excimer laser, or in a 157 nm band, which is substantially equal to that generated by an F<sub>2 </sub>laser.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Laser Treatment Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Now, laser treatment apparatus that comprises the ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> according to the present invention, which has been described above, is described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The laser treatment apparatus <b>5</b> is an apparatus for treating such disorders as myopia and astigmatism by correcting irregularities in the convexity and concavity or curvature of the cornea. In this case, the cornea is irradiated with an ultraviolet laser light for a cornea-ectal ablation in Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) or for an inner ablation of the incised cornea in Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis (LASIK).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the laser treatment apparatus <b>5</b> basically comprises in an apparatus housing <b>60</b> an ultraviolet light source <b>1</b>, which is described above, an irradiation optical system <b>70</b>, which leads an ultraviolet laser light Lv output from the ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> to the surface (treatment site) of the cornea HC of an eyeball EY for irradiation, and an observation optical system <b>80</b>, which is used for observation of the treatment site.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The apparatus housing <b>60</b> is mounted on an X-Y stage <b>62</b> on a base <b>61</b>, so the apparatus housing <b>60</b> as a whole is movable with respect to the eyeball EY in the direction indicated by arrow X, i.e., the right and left direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the page carrying the drawing, i.e., the Y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the construction of the irradiation optical system <b>70</b> and that of the observation optical system <b>80</b>. The irradiation optical system <b>70</b> comprises a condenser lens <b>71</b>, which collects the ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength λ=193 nm emitted from the ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> to form a spot with a predetermined diameter on the eyeball EY, and a dichroic mirror <b>72</b>, which reflects the ultraviolet laser light from the condenser lens <b>71</b> so as to irradiate the surface of the cornea HC of the eyeball EY as an object to be treated. The dichroic mirror <b>72</b> is set to reflect light in the ultraviolet range and to pass light in the visible range through. Therefore, the ultraviolet laser light Lv is reflected and aligned coaxial to the optical axis of the observation optical system <b>80</b>, which is described below, for the irradiation of the cornea HC surface.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, the observation optical system <b>80</b> comprises an illumination lamp <b>85</b>, which illuminates the surface of the cornea HC of the eyeball EY, which is being treated, an objective lens <b>81</b>, which receives the visible light that has originated from the illumination lamp <b>85</b> and has reflected by the cornea HC and then has passed through the dichroic mirror <b>72</b>, a prism <b>82</b>, which reflects the light coming from the objective lens <b>81</b>, and an eyepiece <b>83</b>, which receives the light reflected by the prism for an image-formation. The operator can see a magnified image of the cornea HC through the eyepiece <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With this apparatus, the operator, for example, an ophthalmologist, can perform a laser treatment while he or she is watching through the observation optical system <b>80</b>. For example, while the operator is observing the eyeball EY, he or she shifts the apparatus housing <b>60</b> in the X coordinate and in the Y coordinate and irradiates the surface of the cornea HC, which is an object to be treated, with a spotlighting ultraviolet laser light to cause a ablation in the irradiated area. The movement of the X-Y coordinate table <b>62</b> is controlled by an operation controller (not shown) so that the apparatus housing <b>60</b> is shifted in the X coordinate and the Y coordinate, moving the spotlight, which is projected on the surface of the cornea HC. Therefore, a cornea-ectal ablation is performed accurately as a treatment correcting such as myopia or astigmatism or hyperopia.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">By the way, the size of the ablation in laser treatment changes greatly in correspondence to the power of the ultraviolet laser light Lv irradiating the cornea HC. For this reason, the power of the ultraviolet laser light source <b>1</b> is easily adjustable, for example, by controlling the pulse-frequency of the laser light source <b>10</b>, or by controlling the power of the excitation light of the optical amplifier <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the ultraviolet laser light can be turned ON and OFF by controlling the ON-OFF of the DFB semiconductor laser of the laser light source <b>10</b>. Otherwise, for this purpose, simply, a modulating element, for example, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element, or a mechanical shutter is provided for the optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Clearly from the above described laser treatment apparatus, the present invention provides laser treatment apparatus that is advantageous in maintenance and operability besides being compact and light-weight.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Now, exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, which comprises the above described ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> and is used for a photolithography in semiconductor-device production process, is described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

The exposure apparatus <b>100</b> comprises the above mentioned ultraviolet light source <b>1</b>, an illumination optical system <b>102</b>, a mask-supporting table <b>103</b> for supporting a photomask (reticle) <b>110</b>, a projection optical system <b>104</b>, a wafer-carrying table <b>105</b>, which supports a semiconductor wafer <b>115</b> as an object to be exposed, and a driving device <b>106</b>, which shifts the wafer-carrying table <b>105</b> horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, the ultraviolet laser light Lv output from the above described ultraviolet light source <b>1</b> is incident on the illumination optical system <b>102</b>, which comprises a plurality of lenses.

The light passing through the photomask <b>110</b> has an image of the circuit pattern, which is described on the photomask <b>110</b>, and this image is projected through the projection optical system <b>104</b> onto a predetermined part of the semiconductor wafer <b>115</b>, which is placed on the wafer-carrying table <b>105</b>. In this case, the circuit pattern on the photomask is subjected to reduction and is projected on the semiconductor wafer <b>115</b> by the projection optical system <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The amount of illumination light of the exposure apparatus is easily adjustable, for example, by controlling the pulse-frequency of the laser light source <b>10</b>, or by controlling the power of the excitation light of the optical amplifier <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the ultraviolet laser light can be turned ON and OFF by controlling the ON-OFF of the DFB semiconductor laser of the laser light source <b>10</b>. Otherwise, for this purpose, simply, a modulating element, for example, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element, or a mechanical shutter can be provided to control the optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It is clear from the above described exposure apparatus that the present invention provides exposure apparatus which is advantageous in compactness, maintenance and operability because it utilizes a small and light-weight ultraviolet light source, the apparatus offering a high degree of freedom in the placement of the ultraviolet light source.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, an ultraviolet light source according to the present invention comprises a single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source for a fiber optical amplifier. With this simple construction, the ultraviolet light source achieves both a high peak power and a high average power.</p>
