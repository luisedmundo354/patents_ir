<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to apparatus for protecting circuits from Electro Static Discharge (ESD) and, in particular, a network of snapback stages having controlled turnoff characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An integrated circuit may be subjected to an ESD event that can damage or destroy circuitry of the integrated circuit. Various types of ESD clamps have been devised which are typically connected in parallel to the circuitry to be protected and operate to shunt current around the circuitry to be protected during an ESD event. In order to provide effective protection while not interfering with the normal operation of the integrated circuit, the design of the ESD clamp must, among other things, take into account the breakdown voltage of the circuit to be protected and the normal operating voltage of the circuit. Normal operating voltages should not be sufficient to trigger the ESD clamp. Further, after the occurrence of an ESD event, the protection circuit should disengage, that is, unlatch, once normal operating voltages return.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional ESD protection or clamp circuit <b>10</b> connected to as to protect a exemplary circuit <b>14</b>. Circuit <b>14</b> has, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> example, an input connected to one integrated circuit pad <b>12</b>A and a circuit common connected to another pad <b>12</b>B. An ESD simulation circuit <b>16</b> is shown in accordance with the well-known Human Body Model (HBM) standard for simulating an ESD event produced by a human having a static charge. The HBM circuit includes a capacitor <b>18</b> of 100 picoFarads which is charged to approximately 5 kVolts. The charge on the capacitor <b>18</b> is transferred through a resistance <b>20</b> of 1.5 kΩ when the terminals <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B of the simulation circuit are applied to the pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B of the integrated circuit containing the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected. Assuming that the ESD protection circuit <b>10</b> is not present, the high voltage on the capacitor <b>18</b> will be applied directly to the input of the circuit <b>14</b>. This high voltage will cause the input of circuit <b>14</b> to break down thereby causing current to flow though the circuit. If this current is limited to a short duration, circuit <b>14</b> will usually not be permanently damaged. However, unless steps are taken, the current will flow for a sufficient duration and magnitude to cause over heating of circuit <b>14</b> and permanent damage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a curve <b>22</b> is depicted that represents the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a typical ESD protection circuit <b>10</b>, sometimes referred to as a snapback clamp. The primary objective of the ESD clamp circuit is to rapidly respond to an ESD event by shunting the large current (typically a few amperes) away from the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected so that any voltages generated in the circuit to be protected do not result in current flow through the circuit of sufficient magnitude to damage the circuit. Further, the ESD clamp circuit must not be triggered during normal operation and should unclamp at the end of the event so that normal operation can resume, as previously noted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An ESD event will cause the voltage across the clamp circuit <b>10</b> and protected circuit <b>14</b> to rapidly increase. The ESD event is capable of producing a current having a magnitude of I<sub>ESD</sub>, which can be as large as a few amperes. As the voltage across the ESD clamp <b>10</b> and the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected increases, the clamp will start to turn on significantly, that is trigger, at point <b>22</b>A of curve <b>22</b>. Clamp <b>10</b> is implemented so that the trigger point is below the breakdown voltage of circuit <b>14</b>, although very short duration voltage peaks in excess of the circuit breakdown do not result in damage. The ESD clamp will then enter a negative resistance or snapback area of operation and will continue conducting an increasing current until the voltage across the clamp has been reduced to a holding voltage indicated by point <b>22</b>B. The clamp current will ideally continue to increase until the current reaches the maximum current I<sub>ESD </sub>at point <b>22</b>C. If the maximum I<sub>ESD </sub>current is too large for the clamp, the clamp will eventually reach a breakdown voltage at point <b>22</b>D, with any additional current causing the clamp to be damaged or destroyed. Once the ESD event has ended, the ESD protection circuit <b>10</b> should unlatch thereby permitting normal operation of circuit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although there are a wide variety of circuits that can be used as ESD clamps, silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR) are frequently used for this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> depict one conventional implementation of an SCR type clamp circuit <b>10</b> commonly used in ESD applications. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B structure is sometimes called a low voltage triggered silicon controlled rectifier (LVTSCR). The exemplary LVTSCR if formed in a P type substrate <b>24</b>. An N well <b>26</b> is formed in the substrate <b>24</b>, with an N+ region <b>28</b> forming a contact to the N well. A P+ region <b>30</b> also formed in the N well <b>26</b>, separated from the N+ region by a shallow trench isolation (sti) region <b>32</b>A. An N+ extension <b>26</b>A is formed near one end of the N well <b>26</b> and is separated from P+ region <b>30</b> by a further shallow trench isolation region <b>32</b>B. N+ and P+ regions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are electrically interconnected by a metal track <b>34</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), with this connection forming the anode terminal of the LTVSCR. As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, metal track <b>28</b> is electrically connected to N+ region <b>28</b> and P+ region <b>30</b> by way of a plurality of respective contact openings <b>26</b>A and <b>30</b>A formed in the oxide layer (not designated) disposed over those regions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further N+ region <b>36</b> is formed in the P substrate <b>24</b> and spaced apart from the extension <b>26</b>A so as to form a channel region <b>24</b>A intermediate the N+ regions <b>36</b> and <b>26</b>A. A polysilicon gate <b>38</b> is disposed over the channel region <b>24</b>A and is separated from the channel regions by a thin gate oxide (not designated). A P+ region <b>40</b> is formed in the P substrate <b>24</b> and separated from region <b>36</b> by a shallow trench isolation region <b>32</b>C, with P+ region <b>40</b> forming a contact to the P substrate <b>24</b>. P+ region <b>40</b> and N+ region <b>36</b> are connected together by a metal track <b>42</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) which forms the cathode of the LVTSCR <b>10</b>. Again as can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the metal track is electrically connected to N+ region <b>36</b> and P+ region <b>40</b> by way of a plurality of respective contact openings <b>36</b>A and <b>40</b>A formed in the oxide layer (not designated) disposed over those regions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">LVTSCR <b>10</b>, as is the case for all SCR type structures, can be viewed as a PNP transistor merged with an NPN transistor, with the base of the PNP transistor and the collector of the PNP transistor being common and the collector of the PNP and the base of the NPN being common. P+ region <b>30</b>, N well <b>26</b> and P substrate <b>24</b> forming the respective emitter, base and collector regions of the PNP device. The N well region <b>26</b> further defines a resistor having one terminal which is part of the base on the PNP and a second terminal which is connected to the emitter by way of N+ region <b>28</b> and metal track <b>34</b>. The NPN device includes the N+ region <b>36</b>, the P substrate <b>24</b> and the N well <b>26</b> which form the emitter, base and collector of the device. A resistor is formed in the P substrate <b>24</b>, having one terminal that is part of the NPN base region and a second terminal connected to the emitter by way of P+ region <b>40</b> and metal track <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In operation, at the beginning of and ESD event, when the voltage is low, the PN junction between N well <b>26</b> and the P substrate <b>24</b> is slightly reversed biased. This reversed biased PN junction forms the common base-collector junction of the NPN and PNP devices. As the voltage increases, the leakage current increases when the PN junction begins avalanching. The junction voltage at which avalanching occurs is reduced by the highly doped N+ region <b>26</b>A. The leakage current flows through the N well <b>26</b> resistor disposed between the base and emitter of the PNP thereby tending to turn on the PNP device. The current is enhanced by the nMOS transistor formed by drain region <b>26</b>A, sometimes referred to as a floating drain, and source region <b>36</b>. This nMOS transistor, which is effectively connected in parallel with the NPN transistor, will produce an added current though the N well resistor <b>26</b> thereby adding to the current that turns on the PNP transistor. The gate <b>38</b> is sometime referred to as the trigger input of the LVTSCR device. The turn on voltage or trigger voltage is represented by point <b>22</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Eventually, the increase in current in the PNP and NPN transistors will increase the current gain of the two devices so that each device will cause the other device to turn on. This regenerative SCR action will continue thereby reducing the voltage across the LVTSCR until the voltage drops to a holding voltage represented by point <b>22</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As additional ESD current is conducted, the voltage across the LVTSCR will increase until the total I<sub>ESD </sub>current is shunted through the device, as shown by point <b>22</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Ideally, the device <b>10</b> has sufficient current conduction capability so that the voltage never reaches the thermal breakdown voltage of the represented by point <b>22</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The threshold voltage of the LVTSCR can be adjusted by various means, including controlling the gate-source voltage of the nMOS transistor. Gate <b>32</b> could by grounded thereby producing a relatively high threshold voltage. A resistive divider can also be used to bias the gate voltage. Further, an RC network can be used, with a capacitor of suitable size connected between the gate <b>38</b> and anode <b>34</b> and a resistor of suitable size being connected between the gate <b>38</b> and the cathode <b>42</b>. The RC circuit can also be formed by the parasitic capacitance of device <b>10</b> between the gate and anode so that only a gate to cathode resistor need by added to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Although prior art ESD protection circuits, such as the LVTSCR <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, provide adequate circuit protection in many applications, it has been found that such circuits fail to adequately protect circuits <b>14</b> under various operating conditions. There is a need for ESD protection approaches that provide more adequate protection.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring again to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the time response characteristics of the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> just after the occurrence of a simulated ESD event. Waveform <b>44</b> represents the voltage between pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B over time, with waveform <b>46</b> representing the voltage across capacitor <b>18</b> at a some time after the event has occurred. Initially, the large ESD voltage will exceed the trigger voltage of LVTSCR or protection circuit <b>10</b>, with the trigger voltage being represented by point <b>22</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, the protection circuit <b>10</b> will be triggered. The finite response time of the protection circuit permits a voltage at point <b>44</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to be momentarily produced between pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B that may exceed, to some extent, the breakdown voltage of the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected. This voltage is of sufficiently short duration so that the circuit <b>14</b> is not damaged by such breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the protection circuit <b>10</b> has turned on, the circuit will clamp thereby reducing the voltage to the holding voltage at point <b>22</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> at the 300 nanosecond range. At this point, the ESD protection circuit <b>10</b> is conducting large ESD currents in the ampere range while limiting the voltage in the range indicated between points <b>22</b>B and <b>22</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Eventually, at times determined by the RC time constant of resistor <b>20</b> and capacitor <b>18</b> of the HBM circuit <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the current through the protection circuit will begin to drop so that the voltage across the circuit will begin to increase as indicated by that portion of curve <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between points <b>22</b>D and <b>22</b>B. Eventually, the current through the protection circuit <b>10</b> will drop below the turn off current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of the protection circuit <b>10</b> so that the circuit will begin to turn completely off. This will cause the voltage across the protection circuit <b>10</b> to increase as indicated by curve <b>44</b> in the 300 to 600 nanosecond time period. At this point in time, a significant charge remains on capacitor <b>18</b> as indicated by curve <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, the voltage across the off, or partially off, protection circuit <b>10</b> will be permitted to increase, with the actual voltage depending upon the remaining charge on capacitor <b>18</b>. That remaining charge is a function, among other things, of the RC time constant of resistor <b>20</b> and capacitor <b>18</b> of the HBM circuit <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It would be possible to reduce the turn off current I<sub>TOFF </sub>off the protection device <b>10</b> by reducing the size of the device. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, LVTSCR protection device <b>10</b> has a contact region width of W<sub>C</sub>, with width W<sub>C </sub>being proportional to the value of the current values of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, for example, the turn off current I<sub>TOFF </sub>can be reduced by a factor of two by reducing the value of W<sub>C </sub>by the same factor of two. This will reduce and therefore delay the turnoff time of device <b>10</b> so that the residual voltage at turnoff will be at a sufficiently small value so as not to damage circuit <b>14</b>. However, the reduced size protection device <b>10</b> will also have a corresponding reduced maximum ESD event current I<sub>ESD </sub>conducting capability. Thus, adequate ESD protection will not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The approach in accordance with the present invention is to provide adequate protection with respect to the maximum ESD event current I<sub>ESD </sub>while avoiding the above described turn off problem. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary multistage snapback ESD protection network <b>48</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. In this exemplary embodiment, the network <b>48</b> includes three separate stages W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> of snapback circuits, with each stage including one snapback ESD protection such as the LVTSCR device <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. Depending upon the application, the number of stages can be reduced to two and increased to more than three. The network is implemented such that all three stages W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> are triggered to a conductive state at the beginning of an ESD event, with the stages having a total current conduction capability to accommodate the maximum ESD event current I<sub>ESD</sub>. Further, the stages are implemented so that, near the end of the ESD event, the stages turn off sequentially with one of the stages remaining conductive sufficiently long such that the residual voltage present on the HBM capacitor <b>18</b> is not large enough to damage the protected circuit <b>14</b>. In addition, the stages are implemented such that, during the controlled turn off sequence, the stage or stages remaining on have sufficient current carrying capacity so that they are not damaged by overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The exemplary stages W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> are each implemented using snapback devices, such as the LVTSCR device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. In order to facilitate a controlled turnoff sequence, the LVTSCR devices of stages W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> are preferably substantially identical other than having differing contact region widths W<sub>C</sub>. Assuming, for example, that a single LVTSCR device having a width W<sub>C </sub>of 100 microns would be sufficient to handle an anticipated maximum I<sub>ESD </sub>current for a particular application, the total width of devices W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> is selected to be 100 microns. W<b>1</b> is the smallest device of the network and has a width WC of 1 micron. Small device W<b>1</b> will be the last device to turn off in the turn off sequence and has a relatively low turn off current I<sub>TOFF</sub>. This will ensure that the HBM capacitor <b>18</b> is discharged to a sufficiently low voltage when the last LVTSCR device W<b>1</b> is turned off so that the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected will not be damaged. Intermediate size device W<b>2</b>, the second device to be turned off in the turnoff sequence, has a width W<sub>C </sub>of 5 microns and large device W<b>3</b>, the first device to be turned off, has a width W<sub>C </sub>of 94 microns. The width of W<b>2</b> is selected, such that, when W<b>2</b> and W<b>1</b> are the remaining conductive devices in the turn off sequence, both devices together have adequate current handling capability. Typically, the ratio of the contact region width W<sub>C </sub>of the largest device in the network to the smallest device in the network is at least ten to one. Thus, the ratio of turnoff current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of the largest device to the turnoff current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of the smallest device is typically at least ten to one.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to ensure that all three devices W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> turn on during an ESD event, the total effective resistance in series with the devices as measured from the integrated circuit pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B connected to the device <b>14</b> to be protected is controlled. The smallest device W<b>1</b> should be positioned closest to the pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B to establish a relatively low resistance path between pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B as defined by the resistance of the relevant portion of pad connection line <b>50</b>A, the connection (not designated) between line <b>50</b>A and the anode A of device W<b>1</b>, the connection between the cathode C of device W<b>1</b> and line <b>50</b>B and the relevant portion of pad connection line <b>50</b>B extending to pad <b>12</b>B. Assuming idealized zero resistance elements, the total effective resistance associated with device W<b>1</b>, resistance RD<b>1</b> (not depicted) is 0Ω. Intermediate device W<b>2</b> can be positioned further away from the pads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B, with resistance element RD<b>2</b> representing the total effective series resistance from pad <b>12</b>A to the anode A of device W<b>2</b> and the resistance from the cathode C of device W<b>2</b> to pad <b>12</b>B. Similarly, the largest device W<b>3</b> has a total effective series resistance represented by resistance element RD<b>3</b>. The values of the effective resistances are selected such RD<b>3</b>&gt;RD<b>2</b>&gt;RD<b>1</b>. This relationship could also be achieved, by way of further example, by connecting the anode A of W<b>3</b> through a resistance element to the anode of W<b>2</b> so that the effective series resistance associated with device W<b>3</b> includes the sum of the resistance element and RD<b>2</b>. As previously noted, effective ideal series resistance RD<b>1</b> is typically 0Ω, with RD<b>2</b> being 0.1Ω and RD<b>3</b> being 1.0Ω. In that the actual value of RD<b>1</b> will be non-zero, the values of RD<b>2</b> and RD<b>3</b> are increased accordingly to maintain the desired relative magnitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each device W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> of the network further includes a passive RC gate driver circuit connected to the gate or control electrode G. The driver circuit for device W<b>1</b> includes a resistor RG<b>1</b> connected between the gate electrode G and the cathode C. The parasitic capacitance between the anode A and the gate electrode form the capacitive component of the RC network of device W<b>1</b>. The driver circuits for devices W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> include respective resistances RG<b>2</b> and RG<b>3</b> that form respective RC networks for those devices. Since the value of the parasitic capacitances of W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> is proportional to the contact region width W<sub>C</sub>, the values of RG<b>1</b>, RG<b>2</b> and RG<b>3</b> are adjusted to provide the same RC time constant for each device so that the devices tend to turn on at the same time. Thus, RG<b>1</b> can be about 10 kΩ, with RG<b>2</b> and RG<b>3</b> being about 50 kΩ and 200 kΩ, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a waveform <b>54</b> representing the voltage across network <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> during an ESD event. At the beginning of the event, the small LVTSCR device W<b>1</b> is initially turned on, with resistances RD<b>2</b> and RD<b>3</b> functioning to keep larger devices W<b>2</b> and W<b>3</b> momentarily off until this occurs. Once device W<b>1</b> is conducting, device W<b>2</b> turns on, with resistor RD<b>3</b> functioning to keep W<b>3</b> off until this occurs. Finally, W<b>3</b>, the largest device turns on, conducting the majority of the ESD current at this point. This turn on sequence occurs rapidly, with the voltage across the network <b>48</b> being limited to about 12 volts as indicated by point <b>54</b>A of the waveform <b>54</b>. This voltage may be sufficiently large to breakdown the input to the circuit <b>14</b> to be protected, but the duration is so short that no permanent damage occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At about point <b>54</b>B of curve <b>54</b>, the ESD current flow through the network has decrease to a point at which the current is at the critical turnoff current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of large device W<b>3</b> but not smaller devices W<b>2</b> and W<b>1</b>. Thus, at point <b>54</b>B, the larger device W<b>3</b> turns off. The point at which W<b>3</b> turns off results in a small voltage spike across the network <b>48</b> which will not damage the circuitry being protected. At this point, the majority of the ESD current will be conducted by intermediate size device W<b>2</b>, which must be of sufficient size to safely handle the reduced ESD current at this point.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the network continues by pass the ESD current, the current drops to a value near the critical turnoff current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of device W<b>2</b> but still greater than the turnoff current for device W<b>1</b>. Thus, device W<b>2</b> will turn off, thereby resulting in the small voltage spike at point <b>54</b>D. The small device W<b>1</b> will continue to conduct the remaining ESD current until that current reaches the critical turnoff current I<sub>TOFF </sub>of device W<b>1</b>. At this point, the charge on the HBM capacitor <b>18</b>, as indicated by curve <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, has been reduced to a level sufficiently low such that the voltage across the network <b>48</b> increases only a small amount when all of the LVTSCR devices of the network are off. This is shown at point <b>54</b>C of curve <b>54</b>. Thus, the damage to the circuit to be protected, as previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is avoided. Typically, the smallest snapback device of the network should turn off at least 100 nanoseconds after the largest snapback device has turned off, although the turn off time difference will typically be significantly greater.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, an exemplary multistage snapback ESD protection circuit has been disclosed. Although one exemplary embodiment has been described in detail, various changes could be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, depending upon the application, the number of snapback stages can be decreased to two or increased to values greater than three. Further, snapback devices other than LVTSCR circuits can be used.</p>
