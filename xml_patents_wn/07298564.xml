<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A digital camera is constructed with multiple lenses mounted in a pair of tubular elements which are nested together for relative axial movement. Movement is provided by piezoelectric actuators mounted externally to a support tube on flexible printed circuit board elements. Each lens tube is provided with a drive rail which extends at least partially over the length of the lens tube and projects radially outward from the periphery of each of the tubes. The rails are accessible to the engagement pads of the piezoelectric actuators to allow the transmission of drive forces to each of the tubes.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an assembly of optical components for a miniature digital camera, including piezoelectric actuators for moving the optical components to provide focusing, zoom, and other functions. In particular an arrangement of the components is described that reduces the overall size and facilitates assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of Related Developments</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The components of electronic cameras require low power consumption, low weight and cost efficiency. These design criteria are challenged by the demand for optically adjustable cameras that provide autofocus, zoom optics, or both. These features require the relative movement of optical elements to provide the adjustment. The required motion is typically linear but may use a rotating motor combined with a motion-converting mechanism such as a lead-screw. The motion range is often in the order of millimeters. It is a purpose of this invention to provide a mechanism for adjusting the position of the optical elements in an electronic camera.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One component that has been used in numerous applications is a bimorph piezoelectric element, such elements are constructed of multiple layers of piezoelectric material wherein each layer is connected for independent excitation. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,958, a bimorph piezoelectric cantilever beam is used in combination with a magnifying lever for focusing a camera. However, the necessary stroke of such a focusing device results in a poor stiffness of the device. In electronic camera applications, space is a crucial factor. There is thus a need for simple drive elements that can operate in narrow spaces with limited mechanical support. It is a purpose of this invention to utilize a bimorph piezoelectric element to adjust the position of a lens in an optical system of a digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A camera system using a piezoelectric actuator is described in commonly owned, related U.S. Pat. No. 6,710,950, referenced above. The disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference. In this application, a lens element is mounted within a camera on a tubular member. The lens tube is in turn mounted on a support tube for movement along the longitudinal axis of the tubular member. The adjustment movement is provided by means of multiple bimorph piezoelectric elements, for example by three elements, spaced symmetrically around the circumference of the support tube. The piezoelectric elements are connected to and mounted on a flexible printed circuit board which may contain other electronic components associated with the lens drive system. The flexible printed circuit board is mounted on the support tube and is in turn connected to a voltage source such as a battery. The flexibility of the printed circuit board allows it to be formed to the shape of the support tube and for the piezoelectric element to be positioned in engagement with the lens tube.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The bimorph piezoelectric element used in the mechanism of the cited application is constructed of at least two layers of piezoelectric material which are independently energized to provide relative deformation between the two layers. This piezoelectric element is formed in the shape of a beam having an engagement pad extending transverse to the plane of the element from its midpoint. The beam is fixed to the circuit board close to ends or nodal positions. The beam comprises a pair of bimorph piezoelectric elements extending to either side of the engagement pad. Each of the bimorph elements have dual active layers. The differential deformation generated by energizing only one of the two layers will cause the piezoelectric elements to bend, moving the outer end of the engagement pad into contact with the movable lens tube. By altering the excitation of the piezoelectric elements, the engagement pad causes movement in an axial direction, thereby adjusting the position of the lens. A pattern of excitation is devised to provide movement in discrete steps.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the system of the cited application, a processor is connected in the printed circuit board to provide the main control for the digital camera and is constructed to generate a drive voltage pattern in accordance with the desired movement of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The movement generated by the piezoelectric element provides a high resolution, but there are no structural features that provide a reference in order to obtain accurate repeatability. The step length provided by the piezoelectric element can vary with operational and environmental conditions. In order to obtain the precision required in some optical designs, a position sensor is used to monitor the position of the movable tubes. An optical sensor is used to view a reflecting surface which is mounted on the moveable tube. The reflecting surface consists of a gray-scale incorporated into the surface treatment of the moveable tube. This configuration will provide accurate positional monitoring of a moveable tube.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a purpose of this invention to provide a miniature digital camera system of the type described above in which the components are arranged to facilitate their assembly in an over all package that is smaller. It is another purpose of this invention to provide a rail system external to the lens support tubes for engagement by piezoelectric actuators.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A digital camera is constructed with multiple lens mounted in a pair of tubular elements which are nested together for relative axial movement to provide a zoom function. The lens tube assembly is in turn mounted on a support tube. The lens tube assembly is moveable within said support tube with respect to an image plane to provide an autofocus function. Movement is provided by piezoelectric actuators mounted externally to the support tube on flexible printed circuit board elements. Each lens tube is provided with a drive rail which extends at least partially along the length of the lens tube and project radially outward from the periphery of each of the tubes. The rails are accessible to the engagement pads of the piezoelectric actuators to allow the transmission of drive forces to each of the tubes. Slots are constructed in the support tube to allow the drive rails to project through the support tube. The piezoelectric actuators are mounted to permit engagement by a pair of actuators on either side of the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rails are constructed having a wedge shaped cross section which narrows radially inward towards the axis of the system. The piezoelectric elements are mounted on opposing surfaces of U-shaped flexible printed circuit boards with a rail in between. In this manner, the piezoelectric elements are positioned for engagement with the tapered sides of the rail. A spring clip is provided in which is secured the printed circuit board. The clip exerts a spring force on the printed circuit board to bias the piezoelectric elements into engagement with the rail. This bias force also has a radial component which is applied outward on the tube element to maintain the tubes in axial alignment and minimize binding. Position sensors are mounted on the U-shaped printed circuit board in optical communication with reflective surfaces of respective lens tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the rails are positioned concentrically on the tube assembly. In a second embodiment the rails are positioned in the same quadrant of the tube assembly circumference. In the latter embodiment the engagement forces are applied eccentrically to the tube elements. To assist in maintaining tube alignment, wedge shaped grooves and mating surfaces are formed on the engaging surfaces of the lens tube assembly and the support tube.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, lens tubes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are nested together for sliding movement. As shown lens tube <b>5</b> is constructed with rounded surfaces <b>22</b> provided on the outer periphery of a trio of projections <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>. The projections <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> extend through mating slots <b>26</b>-<b>28</b> in lens tube <b>4</b>. Slots <b>26</b>-<b>28</b> are constructed with tapered surfaces <b>29</b> which engage opposing tapered surfaces <b>30</b> on projections <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of lens tubes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> is provided with a drive rail <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> respectively which extends at least partially over the length of the lens tubes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and project radially outward from the periphery of each of the tubes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rails <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are accessible to the engagement pads <b>33</b>-<b>36</b> of the piezoelectric actuators <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> to allow the transmission of drive forces to each of the tubes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the piezoelectric actuators <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> are independently mounted on flexible printed circuit boards <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. Printed circuit boards <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are formed in the shape of a U having opposing arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>. The printed circuit boards <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are constructed having circuit paths (not shown) to supply power to the piezoelectric actuators <b>13</b>-<b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the rails <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are constructed having a wedge shaped cross section which narrows radially inward towards the axis of the system. The piezoelectric elements <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> are mounted on opposing surfaces of U-shaped flexible printed circuit boards <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> with a rail <b>31</b> or <b>32</b> in between. In this manner, the piezoelectric elements are positioned for engagement with the tapered sides of the rail. Spring clips <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> are provided in which are secured the printed circuit boards <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. The spring clips <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> exert a spring force on the printed circuit boards to bias the piezoelectric elements into engagement with their respective rail. This bias force also has a radial component which is applied outward on the tube element to maintain the tubes in axial alignment and minimize binding. Optical sensors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are mounted on the U-shaped printed circuit boards in optical communication with reflective surfaces <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> of respective lens tubes <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, sensor ports <b>46</b> (not shown) and <b>47</b> are provided in support tube <b>7</b> to provide access for the optical sensors <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>. The optical sensors are responsive to provide a position indication for the lens tubes as they are moved by actuators <b>13</b>-<b>16</b>. Optical sensors are shown for illustration, but other types of position sensors may be adapted for the same purpose, for example, a resistive position sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For illustration of the basic structure of this invention, two lens tubes are shown, however, it should be understood, that more complex lens configurations may be constructed which would require a greater number of lens tubes. Multiple lens tubes may be nested for relative movement and driven as shown and described in this application. Each of the lens tubes may contain lens system comprised of multiple lens elements.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the rails are positioned concentrically on the tube assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a second embodiment the rails are positioned in the same quadrant of the tube assembly circumference, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In the latter embodiment the engagement forces are applied eccentrically to the tube elements. To assist in maintaining tube alignment, wedge shaped grooves <b>150</b> and <b>154</b> and mating surfaces <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> are formed on the engaging surfaces of the lens tube assembly and the support tube, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the optical system <b>101</b> of the second embodiment is constructed with dual lens tubes <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>. Lens tubes <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> contain the lenses of the optical system <b>101</b> mounted within support tube <b>107</b>. A cover tube <b>121</b> encloses the optical assembly. More lens tubes could be employed if a more complex optical system, i.e., more lenses, is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Similarly to the first embodiment, the optical system <b>101</b> is mounted on printed circuit board <b>108</b> to transmit light from an image (not shown) to an image sensor <b>110</b> at a image plane <b>111</b>. The printed circuit board may also contain the control circuit <b>162</b> for the digital camera and provide means to connect the optical system to a power source such as a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lens tubes <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> are nested for movement along axis y-y within support tube <b>107</b>. This movement includes sliding movement of lens tube <b>105</b> relative to lens tube <b>104</b> and movement of the lens tube <b>104</b> within support tube <b>107</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the lens tubes are nested in a different manner. Lens tube <b>104</b> has only a partial tubular surface <b>152</b> which has an outer surface <b>151</b> for engagement with a groove <b>150</b> on the inner surface of passage <b>112</b> in support tube <b>107</b>. The engaging surfaces provide a track in which the lens tube <b>104</b> is moved by the action of piezoelectric elements <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>. A rail <b>131</b> is constructed on the surface <b>152</b>, extending radially upward according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Rail <b>131</b> extends through a slot <b>137</b> constructed for this purpose in support tube <b>107</b>. Rail <b>131</b> is shaped with a wedge shaped cross section which provides surfaces for the engagement of the piezoelectric actuators <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>. These slanted surfaces <b>155</b> and <b>156</b> cause the engagement force of the piezoelectric actuators <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> to apply a radial outward component of force, which tends to maintain alignment of the lens tube <b>104</b> within the groove <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Lens tube <b>105</b> may be assembled by insertion through opening <b>157</b> in support tube <b>107</b> in a motion transverse to the axis y-y. Lens tube <b>105</b> is also constructed with an engagement surface <b>153</b> which extends axially on its outer periphery. A groove <b>154</b> is constructed in the inner surface of passage <b>112</b> approximately 90° from groove <b>150</b> to receive engagement surface <b>153</b>. A rail <b>132</b> extends radially outward from surface <b>153</b> through a slot <b>158</b> constructed in support tube <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a manner similar to the first embodiment piezoelectric actuators <b>113</b>-<b>116</b> are mounted on the opposing surfaces of U-shaped printed circuit boards <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>. Circuit boards <b>117</b> and <b>118</b> are secured to support tube <b>107</b> by spring clips <b>119</b> and <b>120</b>. A pair of outward extending flanges <b>160</b> and <b>161</b> may be formed on support tube <b>107</b> to receive printed circuit boards <b>117</b> and <b>118</b>. Clips <b>119</b> and <b>120</b> engage the flanges to secure the circuit boards in place. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, piezoelectric actuators <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> engage slanted surfaces <b>155</b> and <b>156</b> of rail <b>131</b> and are urged into engagement by bias force exerted by spring clip <b>119</b>. The radial component of this force urges the optical tube <b>104</b> outward and into engagement with groove <b>152</b>. An identical assembly secures the piezoelectric actuators <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> on support tube <b>107</b> and urges the actuators into engagement with rail <b>132</b>.</p>
