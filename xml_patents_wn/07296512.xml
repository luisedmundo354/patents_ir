Covington with the same title, the full disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/093,844 claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/557,853, filed Mar. 30, 2004.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a bellows structure for enclosing or covering slots through walls of a cotton module builder or packager, and more particularly, to bellows which prevent passage through, and compaction in, cotton in slots through walls of a cotton module builder or packager for movement of apparatus for distributing and compacting cotton within the module builder or packager.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cotton harvesting machines having an on-board cotton module building capability, also known as a cotton packager, include a cotton compacting chamber in which the compacted cotton module is built, formed by a floor and upstanding walls. Supported within this cotton compacting chamber is cotton compactor apparatus supported for vertical upward and downward movement for compacting cotton received in the chamber into the lower region thereof, forming the module. It is important for the thus formed cotton module to have a cohesive, unitary composition which will be free standing when unloaded from the cotton compacting chamber, and which will remain substantially intact when subsequently handled. In particular, it is desirable for the upstanding sides of the thus formed compacted cotton module to be firm and relatively smooth to facilitate the subsequent handling, and also the removal of the module from the compacting chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result, it is desirable for the structure and driving apparatus supporting the compactor apparatus to be located outwardly or outside of the compacting chamber. Such support structure and driver apparatus could be located above the compactor apparatus. However, the overall height of cotton harvesting machines must be limited so as to be able to pass through storage building doorways and under bridges, utility lines, and other overhead obstructions when moving from field to field. Therefore, it is sought to provide support structure and actuating drivers outside of the side walls of the compacting chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reference in this regard, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,530,199 and 6,536,197, wherein external driver apparatus for the movement of the compactor structure or apparatus include four fluid cylinders, arranged two on each side of the compacting chamber. Such cylinders are disclosed as being double cylinders, one of which is used to index the compactor apparatus upwardly as the height of the module is increased, and the other for moving the compactor apparatus downwardly from the indexed location against the cotton in the compacting chamber for compacting the cotton.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is contemplated to provide supporting structure and drivers on the exterior sides or ends of a module builder or packager connected to compactor apparatus within the cotton compacting chamber of the module builder or packager, for effecting downward movement under pressure and upper movement of the compactor apparatus. To accomplish this, it is contemplated that structural members will extend through vertical slots in walls of the module builder or packager, connecting the external structure to the compactor apparatus within the compacting chamber. However, a problem that can arise is passage of cotton from the compacting chamber through the vertical slots or passages, and/or collection and compaction of the cotton in the slots, so as to inhibit movement of the connecting structure through the slots, and also removal of the compacted body of cotton or module from the chamber due to integration with the cotton compacted into the slots. Additionally, it is contemplated that the structural members extending through the slots may vary in orientation as a result of uneven movement and tilting of the compactor apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, what is sought is structure for a compactor apparatus of a cotton module builder or packager including external support and driver elements, which provides the advantages and overcomes the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is disclosed is structure for compactor apparatus of a cotton harvester which provides the advantages and overcomes one or more of the disadvantages and problems set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compactor apparatus includes a frame to be disposed within the cotton compacting chamber of a cotton module builder or packager including one or more structural elements which are movable downwardly within the chamber against the cotton for compacting the cotton against the floor and walls of the chamber. The frame includes cross members, preferably at the front and rear ends of the chamber, which extend across the chamber and protrude outwardly therefrom through upwardly and downwardly extending slots or passages through the side walls defining the chamber. The ends of the cross members which protrude through the slots or passages on each side of the chamber are connected together by an exterior side structure so as to be jointly movable upwardly and downwardly within the slots or passages, such that the frame is correspondingly moved upwardly and downwardly within the interior of the compacting chamber. Importantly, to maintain the frame at a horizontal orientation within the compacting chamber, or at an orientation relative to the floor within a permissible range, the exterior side structure on each side of the compacting chamber is guided by at least one vertically extending guide member. The side structure and at least one guide member can include members cooperatively engageable during the movement of the side structure such as rollers or the like. The exterior side structure on each side of the compacting chamber is connected to the module builder by a suitable driver, such as a fluid cylinder or the like, for moving the exterior side structure, and the frame upwardly and downwardly as desired or required for compacting the cotton within the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The frame of the compactor apparatus located within the compacting chamber preferably includes, in addition to the structural elements for compacting the cotton, at least one cotton driver, such as an auger or the like, extending in a horizontal orientation, and actuatable for moving the cotton within the chamber for more evenly distributing it therein for forming a more even cotton module.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another preferred aspect of the invention, bellows are disclosed for disposition in slots through the walls of the cotton module builder or packager for operation in cooperation with cross members extending therethrough for prevent passage of cotton through the slots and compaction of cotton therein. The bellows can optionally include elements for connection to the compactor apparatus which allow some relative misalignment therebetween as a result of tilting movement of the compactor apparatus. Below the compactor apparatus, in the region of the compacting chamber in which the cotton is being compacted, the bellows have a rigid surface which faces the interior of the chamber, and is supported such that compacting forces will not compress or deform the bellows.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Ref erring now to the drawings, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, a cotton harvesting machine <b>10</b> is shown, including an on-board cotton module builder <b>12</b>, including compactor apparatus <b>14</b>. Generally, cotton harvesting machine <b>10</b> is self-propelled for movement over a field of cotton plants, and includes a plurality of cotton harvesting units <b>16</b> extending in a side-by-side array across a front end <b>18</b> of machine <b>10</b>. Cotton harvested by harvesting units <b>16</b> is conveyed by flows of air through ducts <b>20</b> which extend rearwardly and upwardly from harvesting units <b>16</b> to an upper region of a cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> of module builder <b>12</b>, in the well known conventional manner. The cotton conveyed into cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> will then collect on a floor <b>24</b> within chamber <b>22</b>, against which the cotton will be compacted by compactor apparatus <b>14</b>, as will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> is a four-sided cavity defined on the bottom by floor <b>24</b> and upwardly extending opposing front and rear end walls <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and side walls, represented by side wall <b>30</b>, extending therebetween. Walls <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> typically include openings or perforations therethrough, to allow passage and dissipation of the air used to convey the cotton into chamber <b>22</b>, while retaining the cotton therein. The upper region of cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> of module builder <b>12</b> is enclosed by a roof <b>32</b> which can also include openings or perforations for the passage of air but not cotton therethrough. Importantly, the side walls, as represented by side wall <b>30</b>, each include a vertical forward slot <b>34</b> adjacent front end wall <b>26</b>, and a vertical rearward slot <b>36</b> adjacent rear end wall <b>28</b>, slots <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> extending substantially the entire vertical height of the compacting chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, compactor apparatus <b>14</b> of module builder <b>12</b> includes a compactor frame <b>38</b> which is generally horizontal and substantially entirely disposed within cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b>, for movement downwardly against cotton contained therein for compacting the cotton against floor <b>24</b>. Compactor frame <b>38</b> includes a front cross member <b>40</b> disposed in chamber <b>22</b> adjacent front end wall <b>26</b>, and having opposite ends which extend through slots <b>34</b>. Similarly, a rear cross member <b>42</b> is disposed in chamber <b>22</b> adjacent rear end wall <b>28</b> and has opposite ends extending through slots <b>36</b>. A plurality of front and rear extending members <b>44</b> extend between and connect front and rear cross members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Additionally, preferably at least one, and most preferably, several augers <b>46</b> are supported for rotation on front and rear cross members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, and extend forwardly and rearwardly therebetween. Augers <b>46</b> can be rotated using any suitable commercially available drivers, such as a gear drive driven by a motor such as a fluid or electric motor, or directly by fluid or electric motors, as desired, for distributing the collected cotton in chamber <b>22</b> as required or desired. In this regard, it is particularly desirable to distribute the cotton evenly with respect to the plane of floor <b>24</b>, such that the resultant compacted cotton module will have a substantially uniform height along its length and width.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Compactor frame <b>38</b> of compactor apparatus <b>14</b> is supported in compacting chamber <b>22</b> on each side by an exterior side structure <b>48</b>, each structure <b>48</b> including a substantially horizontal, forwardly and rearwardly extending main beam <b>50</b> which extends between and connects front and rear cross members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. Each side structure <b>48</b> additionally includes a pair of braces <b>52</b> which extend downwardly and at converging angles from front and rear cross members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, and which are connected together by a gusset <b>54</b> located spacedly below about the middle of main beam <b>50</b>. Here, it should be noted that compactor frame <b>38</b> located within compacting chamber <b>22</b> and exterior side structures <b>48</b> on the exterior of the side walls represented by side wall <b>30</b> are movable upwardly and downwardly together.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The upward and downward movement of exterior side structures <b>48</b> and compactor frame <b>38</b> is preferably achieved and controlled by drivers <b>56</b> extending, respectively, between gusset <b>54</b> of each exterior side structure <b>48</b> and a support frame <b>58</b> supported by and extending upwardly from a frame <b>60</b> of module builder <b>12</b>. Drivers <b>56</b> each preferably comprise a fluid cylinder which receives fluid under pressure from a suitable pressurized fluid source, such as a fluid pump of machine <b>10</b>, for moving exterior side structure <b>48</b>, and thus compactor frame <b>38</b> of compactor apparatus <b>14</b>, upwardly and downwardly as required or desired for performing a cotton distributing and/or compacting operation. Each driver <b>56</b> includes a fluid cylinder <b>62</b> connected to support frame <b>58</b> and a rod <b>64</b> connected to gusset <b>54</b> of exterior side structure <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, rod <b>64</b> is shown in a retracted position in cylinder <b>62</b> such that exterior side structure <b>48</b> and compactor frame <b>38</b> are located at an elevated position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows rod <b>64</b> extended to a substantially extended position, to position side structure <b>48</b> and compactor frame <b>38</b> at a lowered position, representing about a maximum compacting position of compactor apparatus <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as noted above, it is a sought after feature of the present module builder <b>12</b> to form and produce complete cotton modules having a substantially uniform height over the front-to-rear and side-to-side extent thereof. Generally, the harvested cotton conveyed through ducts <b>20</b> into compacting chamber <b>22</b> will have a tendency to collect in the more rearward region of chamber <b>22</b>, such that distribution in a forward direction by augers <b>46</b> is typically required. However, the cotton, even though more evenly distributed within chamber <b>22</b>, can have various inconsistencies in density and other conditions which make various regions of the collected cotton more difficult or easy to compact relative to other regions. As a result, if the downward movement of compactor frame <b>38</b> is not restrained or controlled, compactor frame <b>38</b> can be tilted undesirably and lateral loads and stresses can be exerted against driver <b>56</b>, both in the forwardly and rearwardly, and side-to-side directions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To limit lateral loading, and facilitate the even distribution and compaction of the cotton within cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> by compactor apparatus <b>14</b>, each exterior side structure <b>48</b> includes upper guide roller assemblies <b>66</b>, and lower guide roller assemblies <b>68</b>, each of which rollingly engage and are movable upwardly and downwardly along vertical guide members <b>70</b> disposed at spaced locations adjacent each side of module builder <b>12</b>, for controllably guiding the upward and downward movement of side structures <b>48</b> and compactor frame <b>38</b>, for holding or maintaining compactor frame <b>38</b> in a substantial horizontal orientation as it compacts the cotton in chamber <b>22</b>. Guide members <b>70</b> are fixedly mounted to frame <b>60</b> by brackets <b>72</b> which comprise sleeves which receive the respective guide members <b>70</b> and hold them in upstanding position and orientation beside module builder <b>12</b>. Guide members <b>70</b> are fixedly mounted at the top to roof <b>32</b> of module builder <b>12</b>. Each guide member <b>72</b> is preferably maintained in such upstanding orientation and position in bracket <b>72</b> by a pin <b>74</b>, which can be removed to allow lowering guide members <b>70</b> with upper portions of module builder <b>12</b>, for reducing the overall height of machine <b>10</b> for transport on trucks and rail cars, and other purposes as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each upper guide roller assembly <b>66</b> includes a bracket <b>76</b> mounted to main beam <b>50</b> of exterior side structure <b>48</b> and is of bifurcated or U-shaped construction so as to receive a guide member <b>70</b> therethrough. Bracket <b>76</b> supports a pair of rollers <b>78</b> for rotation about forwardly and rearwardly extending axes on opposite sides of guide member <b>70</b>, for controlling or substantially limiting side-to-side movement of exterior side structure <b>48</b>, and thus compactor frame <b>38</b>. To facilitate contact between rollers <b>78</b> and guide member <b>70</b>, rollers <b>78</b> each preferably has a concave outer surface <b>80</b> which engages the guide member <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Similarly, each lower guide roller assembly <b>68</b> includes a bracket <b>82</b> mounted to brace <b>52</b> of exterior side structure <b>48</b> and is of bifurcated or U-shape construction so as to receive a guide member <b>70</b> therethrough. Bracket <b>82</b> supports a pair of rollers <b>78</b> for rotation about side-to-side extending axis on opposite sides of guide member <b>70</b>, for controlling or substantially limiting forward and rearward movement of exterior side structure <b>48</b>, and thus compactor frame <b>38</b>. To facilitate contact between rollers <b>78</b> and guide member <b>70</b>, rollers <b>78</b> each preferably has a concave outer surface <b>80</b> which engages the guide member <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Ref erring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a schematic representation of compactor apparatus <b>14</b> in a raised position above floor <b>24</b> is shown. Here, drivers <b>56</b> can be observed supporting exterior side structures <b>48</b> on opposite sides of compactor frame <b>38</b>, and the positions of guide members <b>70</b> relative to exterior side structures <b>48</b> is evident.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic representation showing compactor apparatus <b>14</b> in a lowered, compacting position, with compactor frame <b>38</b> supported by drivers <b>56</b> and exterior side structures <b>48</b>. Again, the position of guide members <b>70</b> adjacent exterior side structures <b>48</b> is evident.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, to contain the cotton and prevent passage through and compacting of cotton in slots <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, each slot <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> includes an upper bellows <b>84</b> which encloses the slot above cross member <b>40</b> or <b>42</b>, and a lower bellows <b>86</b> which encloses the slot beneath the cross member <b>40</b> or <b>42</b> constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention. Bellows <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> include elements movable with the respective cross member <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, and retractable and extendible elements for varying the height of the bellows during the movement of the cross member. Lower bellows <b>86</b> additionally include an interior surface which faces compacting chamber <b>22</b> which is of substantially rigid construction, to prevent the forces of compaction from forcing the cotton into the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, upper bellows <b>84</b> and lower bellows <b>86</b> in slot <b>34</b> at the front end of module builder <b>12</b> are shown, above and below front cross member <b>40</b> of compactor apparatus <b>14</b>, respectively. Here, cross member <b>40</b> is shown at a raised position, representative of a non-compacting position, such that upper bellows <b>84</b> are in a compacted or retracted state, and lower bellows <b>86</b> are in an extended state. Each of bellows <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> are contained in and guided for vertical movement by a pair of opposing vertically extending C-shape channels <b>116</b> telescopically received in guide channel portions <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> of a guide frame <b>92</b> mounted in occupying relation to slot <b>34</b>. Guide frame <b>92</b> is preferably mounted to frame <b>60</b> and front end wall <b>26</b> of module builder <b>12</b>, by a plurality of conventional fasteners, here including conventional bolts <b>94</b>. Upper bellows <b>84</b> preferably comprise commercially available bellows or way protectors, such as, but not limited to, those available under the Gortite tradename from A&amp;A Manufacturing, Inc. of New Berlin, Wisconsin, USA. Upper bellows <b>84</b> have a lower portion <b>96</b> which is attached or connected to cross member <b>40</b> for upward and downward movement therewith as denoted by arrow A, and an upper portion <b>98</b> suitably attached or connected to module builder <b>12</b> such as to roof <b>32</b> so as to remain stationary as cross member <b>40</b> is moved upwardly and downwardly, such that bellows <b>84</b> will expand during the downward movement, and contract or retract during the upward movement, respectively, to occupy and cover the space between opposing channels <b>116</b> to prevent passage of cotton therethrough and accumulation of cotton therein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Lower bellows <b>86</b> are preferably of different construction than upper bellows <b>84</b>, and instead include a rigid, box shape cover member <b>100</b> having a sectional extent when viewed from above only marginally smaller than the space defined between C-shaped guide channels <b>116</b> so as to be cooperatively slidable therebetween in covering relation to the space.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> of guide frame <b>92</b> are connected by lower intermediate panel <b>102</b> on the side which faces cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b>. Intermediate panel <b>102</b> is shorter in height compared to guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, to thereby form an opening <b>104</b> between the guide channels above intermediate panel <b>102</b>. Cover member <b>100</b> and C-shaped channels <b>116</b> are telescopically received between guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, such that cover member <b>100</b> can slide up and down within C-shaped channels <b>116</b> that are contained within guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, between a position extending upwardly therefrom in covering relation to opening <b>104</b>, and a lower position wherein all or a portion of cross member <b>40</b> will be located in opening <b>104</b>. In this way, a rigid, pressure resistant structure is provided in covering relation to slot <b>34</b> which will prevent passage of cotton therethrough and entry of cotton therein during the compaction process.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Cover member <b>100</b> is preferably connected to a lower end of cross member <b>40</b> by a linkage arrangement <b>106</b> including a link <b>108</b> having an upper end pivotally connected to cross member <b>40</b>, and a lower end pivotally connected to cover member <b>100</b>. This is desirable as cross member <b>40</b> can be subjected to loadings which can cause it to tilt or rotate within the space between guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, as denoted by arrows B, which movements are not desired to transferred to cover member <b>100</b>. This is advantageous as it allows the front-to-rear extent and sideward extent of cover member <b>100</b> to be only marginally smaller between those extents of the space defined between opposing channels <b>116</b>, such that there is less space therebetween for passage or collection of cotton.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, which are each a top view of lower bellows <b>86</b>, angle brackets <b>110</b> for attachment of guide frame <b>92</b> to frame <b>60</b> by bolts <b>94</b> is better shown. Angle brackets <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> for attachment to front end wall <b>26</b> at side wall <b>30</b> are also shown. C-shape channels <b>116</b> are also shown telescopically disposed within guide frame <b>92</b> and <b>88</b> at the opposite ends thereof and define the interface with cover member <b>100</b>. As noted above, channels <b>116</b> also serve as guide channels for containing and guiding the upward and downward movement of upper bellows <b>84</b>. Channels <b>116</b> can attach to roof <b>32</b> and move downwardly therewith, so as to be more telescopically received in guide frame <b>92</b> and <b>88</b> when roof <b>32</b> is lowered for transport.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, which is a bottom view of cover member <b>100</b>, outer surfaces of that member which oppose inner surfaces of channels <b>116</b> and inner surface of <b>102</b> in guide support <b>92</b>, include longitudinally extending strips <b>118</b> of a low friction polymer material to facilitate movement of member <b>100</b> in telescopic relation to channels <b>116</b> and guide frame <b>92</b>, and also to block passage of cotton between member <b>100</b> and the other components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Ref erring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, linkage arrangement <b>106</b> is better shown, including brackets <b>120</b> which connect to cover member <b>100</b> at the bottom and cross member <b>40</b> at the top for pivotally connecting those members together. Brackets <b>120</b> can be attached directly to cross member <b>40</b>, and to an end closure <b>122</b> which is suitably connected such as by fastening or welding in closing relation to the upper end of cover member <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that upper and lower bellows <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> at the rear of module builder <b>12</b> are constructed essentially in the above-described manner, and are retained in position and guided by similar guide frames.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, a representative guide frame <b>124</b> for bellows <b>86</b> at the rear are shown, including guide channels <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> defining a space therebetween for receiving C-shape channels <b>116</b> for guiding and controlling upward and downward movement of bellows <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>, and also an intermediate panel <b>102</b> on the side facing cotton compacting chamber <b>22</b> which does not extend the full height of the guide frame, so as to provide an opening <b>104</b> for receiving rear cross member <b>42</b>. Guide frame <b>124</b> is attached to rear end wall <b>128</b> of the module builder and side wall <b>30</b>, and frame <b>60</b>, in the above-described manner.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Here it should be noted that the bellows structure described herein has utility for a wide variety of other compactors, module builders and packagers and other structures, such as those disclosed in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,530,199 and 6,536,197, and therefore is not intended to be limited to use with the structure described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention.
