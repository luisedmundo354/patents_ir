<p id="p-0003" num="0002">None.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, this invention relates to a system for providing electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">More specifically, this invention is directed to a system particularly adapted to provide reliable electrical power for the operation of a remote telecommunications facility.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although it may be utilized in numerous applications, this invention is specifically adapted to provide power for the continuous operation of a remote telecommunications facility. With its core technology substantially composed of digital components, the telecommunications industry is heavily dependent on the continued supply of reliable electrical power. The critical nature of the functions performed by remote telecommunications facilities further emphasizes the need for a dependable power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most telecommunications facilities rely on a commercial power utility for electrical power and employ traditional devices, such as a transformer and switchgear, to safely receive and use the electrical power. To insure the facility's power supply is not interrupted, such as in the case of a blackout or other disturbance in the commercial power system, many telecommunications facilities have a system for providing backup power. Although various designs are used, many backup systems employ a diesel generator and an array of batteries. If power from the commercial utility is lost, the diesel generator takes over to supply power, and the battery array insures that power is maintained during the time it takes to switch from utility-supplied power to generator-supplied power. If the generator also fails, such as due to a mechanical malfunction or to the depletion of its fuel source, then the battery array is able to provide power for an additional period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are several disadvantages inherent in the current manner in which power is supplied to telecommunications facilities. First, the cost of local electrical utility service has risen dramatically in recent years and, by all accounts, will continue to rise. Thus, the cost of local electrical utility power is a large component of the facility's overall power expenses. Next, as the facility's power demands have increased, the number of batteries required to provide an adequate amount of power for a reasonable period of time has also increased. Clearly, the component cost of the system increases with the greater number of batteries required. In addition, the greater number of batteries required has significantly increased the space required to house the backup system, which has increased the spatial cost of the systems. Finally, it is known that generators suffer from certain reliability problems, such as failing to start when needed because of disuse or failed maintenance. Therefore, the reliability of the backup systems could be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The power system of the present invention overcomes these disadvantages by providing reliable electrical power that is not initially dependent on a commercial electrical utility and that does not employ an array of batteries. The system, therefore, is more cost efficient and requires less space than the present manner of providing power to facilities. The invention employs redundant sources of power, and thus, is uninterruptible. Also, the system employs power-generating components that have less of an impact on the environment than the current manner in which power is supplied. Moreover, the system may be constructed at a manufacturing site and then moved to the facility. Thus, the system of the present invention provides power to a telecommunications facility in a manner that is less expensive, that requires less space, that is movable, and that is environmentally friendly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention includes a power system that is designed to provide reliable electrical power to a facility, and specifically to a telecommunications facility.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the power system of the present invention initially comprises a photovoltaic cell module <b>10</b>. It should be understood a photovoltaic cell is operable to convert light into DC electricity. Therefore, DC electricity is output from module <b>10</b> at output <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the DC electrical output of module <b>10</b> is 43 Vdc. Module <b>10</b> will be discussed in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Output <b>20</b> of module <b>10</b> is coupled to the input <b>30</b> of an inverter <b>40</b>. As is known in the field, an inverter is operable to convert DC electricity into AC electricity. Thus, AC electricity is output from inverter <b>40</b> at output <b>50</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the AC electrical output from inverter <b>40</b> is 120 Vac.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Output <b>50</b> of inverter <b>40</b> is coupled to a first input <b>60</b> of a switch <b>70</b>. It should be understood that for clarity only one switch <b>70</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when there are actually a number of switches. Specifically, in the preferred embodiment, the power system contains seven switches <b>70</b> and, correspondingly, seven connections from output <b>50</b>. The second input <b>80</b> of switch <b>70</b> is coupled to a first output <b>90</b> of a panel board <b>100</b>, while the output <b>110</b> of switch <b>70</b> is coupled to a first end <b>120</b> of a circuit breaker <b>130</b>. As with switch <b>70</b>, only one circuit breaker <b>130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when there is actually one circuit breaker for every switch. Thus, in the preferred embodiment of the power system, there are seven circuit breakers <b>130</b>. Panel board <b>100</b> receives electrical power from a commercial electrical utility and contains a number of circuit breakers (not shown). The electrical power from the commercial electrical utility is passed through the circuit breakers to the outputs <b>90</b> and <b>400</b> of panel board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The position of switch <b>70</b> is determined by the output of module <b>10</b>. So long as the output of module <b>10</b> remains above a predetermined level, switch <b>70</b> will remain as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that is, switch <b>70</b> will provide a short-circuit between output <b>50</b> of inverter <b>40</b> and circuit breaker <b>130</b> and an open circuit to output <b>90</b> of panel board <b>100</b>. However, if the output of module <b>10</b> falls below the predetermined level, then switch <b>70</b> will provide a short-circuit between output <b>90</b> of panel board <b>100</b> and circuit breaker <b>130</b> and present an open circuit to output <b>50</b> of inverter <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second end <b>140</b> of circuit breaker <b>130</b> is coupled to one input <b>150</b> of a module <b>160</b>. Stated generally, module <b>160</b> contains an equal number of hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane units and super capacitors. A hydrogen generator uses electricity to convert water into hydrogen, and a proton exchange membrane converts hydrogen into electricity. In a hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane unit, a hydrogen generator and a proton exchange membrane are coupled together in one housing. Module <b>160</b> and its components will be discussed in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Input <b>150</b> represents one input to the hydrogen generator portion of one hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane unit. The hydrogen output from the hydrogen generator portion of this unit travels through pipe <b>170</b> to H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b>. Hydrogen travels from H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b> through pipe <b>190</b>, which includes two valves, <b>200</b> and <b>210</b>, to the proton exchange membrane portion of the unit. Valve <b>210</b> is a pressure-controlled valve that is operable to remain closed unless the pressure within H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b> is above a predetermined level. If the pressure within H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b> falls below a predetermined level, then valve <b>210</b> closes. Output <b>220</b> represents the output from the proton exchange membrane portion of one hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane unit. DC electricity is output on output <b>220</b>, which is coupled to DC bus <b>230</b>. It should be understood that there is one input <b>150</b>, one pipe <b>170</b>, one pipe <b>190</b>, one valve <b>200</b>, one valve <b>210</b> and one output <b>220</b> for each hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane unit in module <b>160</b>, although only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the preferred embodiment of the power system there are seven hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane units each with a super capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Two vent pipes <b>240</b> are also coupled to H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b>. Each pipe <b>240</b> contains a pressure-controlled valve <b>250</b>. Valve <b>250</b> is operable to remain closed unless the pressure within H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b> rises above a predetermined level in which case valve <b>250</b> opens and vents the hydrogen stored in header <b>180</b> to the atmosphere. If the pressure within H<sub>2 </sub>header <b>180</b> remains below the predetermined level, then valve <b>210</b> remains closed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A number of H<sub>2 </sub>storage tanks <b>260</b> are also coupled to header <b>180</b> through an equal number of pipes <b>270</b>. Each pipe <b>270</b> contains a valve <b>280</b>. Again, for clarity, only two storage tanks <b>260</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Power Distribution Unit (PDU) <b>290</b> is coupled to DC bus <b>230</b> through fuse <b>300</b>. Power distribution unit <b>290</b> contains connections into the telecommunications facility's power lines, and/or provides connections to the various telecommunications equipment. Power distribution unit <b>290</b> may also contain additional circuit breakers or other power switchgear or safety devices and/or circuits, including circuits to limit the voltage or current provided to the facility's power lines, and monitoring/measuring equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A first side <b>310</b> of a pressure controlled switch <b>320</b> is also coupled to DC bus <b>230</b>. The second side <b>330</b> of switch <b>320</b> is coupled to the output <b>340</b> of rectifier <b>350</b>. Switch <b>330</b> is operable to provide an open circuit so long as the pressure in header <b>180</b> remains above a predetermined level and a short circuit if the pressure in header <b>180</b> falls below the predetermined level. As is well known, a rectifier is operable to convert an AC electrical input to a DC electrical output. Thus, DC electricity is present at output <b>340</b>. The input <b>360</b> of rectifier <b>350</b> is coupled to a first side <b>370</b> of a circuit breaker <b>380</b>. The second side <b>390</b> of circuit breaker <b>380</b> is coupled to a second output <b>400</b> of panel board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows module <b>10</b> in greater detail. Module <b>10</b> contains a number of photovoltaic cell arrays <b>410</b>. As stated above, a photovoltaic cell is operable to convert light into DC electricity. One photovoltaic cell array that is suitable for the present invention is the SX series photovoltaic module produced by BP Solar International LLC of Linthicum, Md. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the preferred embodiment of the power system includes <b>14</b> arrays <b>410</b>. Each array is coupled to a number of circuit breakers <b>420</b>, and circuit breakers <b>420</b> are also coupled to a main bus <b>430</b>. Main bus <b>430</b> terminates at output <b>20</b>. As stated above, in the preferred embodiment of the power system, the DC electrical output at output <b>20</b> is 43 Vdc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows module <b>160</b> in greater detail. Module <b>160</b> contains a number of hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane units <b>440</b>. Input <b>150</b> is coupled to the hydrogen generator portion <b>450</b> of unit <b>440</b>. A water recycling storage tank <b>460</b> is also coupled to hydrogen generator portion <b>450</b> through a valve <b>470</b>. As stated above, hydrogen generator portion <b>450</b> is operable to use electricity received at input <b>150</b> with water received from water recycling storage tank <b>460</b> to produce hydrogen which is output in pipe <b>170</b> to header <b>180</b>. Hydrogen generator portion <b>450</b> is also coupled to ground. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) portion <b>480</b> of unit <b>440</b> receives hydrogen from header <b>180</b> through pipe <b>190</b>. Proton exchange membrane portion <b>480</b> is operable to convert hydrogen to DC electricity, which is output on output <b>220</b>. One PEM that is suitable for the present invention is the Nexa™ power module manufactured by Ballard Power Systems Inc. of Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The output of proton exchange membrane portion <b>480</b> is also coupled to a super capacitor <b>490</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the preferred embodiment of the power system, there are seven hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane units <b>440</b> and seven super capacitors <b>490</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The power system of the present invention may also contain a number of sensing and control mechanisms (not expressly shown) for determining which valves and/or switches to open or close. As is known, the sensing mechanisms may be separate devices or may be integral to the valves, switches and/or devices being monitored. Likewise, the control mechanism may be a separate device, such as a programmable logic controller, or may be part of one of the components already described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, module <b>10</b> produces DC electricity that it passes to inverter <b>40</b> for conversion to AC electricity. So long as the output of module <b>10</b> is above a predetermined level, switches <b>70</b> provide a short circuit between the output of inverter <b>40</b> and circuit breakers <b>130</b>. In this manner, module <b>10</b> supplies electrical power through inverter <b>40</b> to hydrogen generator portions <b>450</b> of units <b>440</b> in module <b>160</b>. If the output of module <b>10</b> falls below the predetermined level, then switches <b>70</b> provide a short circuit between panel board <b>100</b> and circuit breakers <b>130</b> so that hydrogen generator portions <b>450</b> of units <b>440</b> in module <b>160</b> receive electrical power from a commercial utility.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hydrogen generator portions <b>450</b> of units <b>440</b> in module <b>160</b> use the electricity supplied at inputs <b>150</b> with water supplied from storage tanks <b>460</b> to produce hydrogen that is passed to header <b>180</b> through pipes <b>170</b>. Initially, the hydrogen in header <b>180</b> is passed both to storage tanks <b>260</b> and to proton exchange membrane portions <b>480</b>. After storage tanks <b>260</b> are filled, however, hydrogen is passed solely to proton exchange membrane portions <b>480</b>. If the pressure in header <b>180</b> falls below a predetermined level, valves <b>220</b> close so that the amount of hydrogen in header <b>180</b> may be built up. In this situation, switch <b>320</b> also close so that PDU <b>290</b> receives electrical power from panel board <b>100</b> through rectifier <b>350</b>. Storage tanks <b>260</b> alone will provide hydrogen to proton exchange membrane portions <b>480</b> for some time if hydrogen generator portions <b>450</b> stop operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">So long as proton exchange membrane portions <b>480</b> receive hydrogen they will produce DC electricity. This DC electricity acts to charge super capacitors <b>490</b> so that super capacitors may provide electricity to DC bus <b>230</b> for period of time in the event proton exchange membrane portions <b>480</b> cease operation. In this manner, PDU <b>290</b> will continue to receive power during the time it takes to switch from proton exchange membrane produce power to power provided by panel board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed, the power system described above initially employs photovoltaic arrays to provide electrical power to a number of hydrogen generators. These generators, in combination with a number of storage tanks provide hydrogen for a number of PEMs. The hydrogen generator/proton exchange membrane units are efficient (both in terms of space and fuel), reliable and ecologically friendly. By relying on these units, the system avoids both the reliability problems and environmental hazards inherent in internal combustion generators and the costs and environmental concerns associated with commercial electrical power. The power system also provides redundant sources of power, specifically from a commercial electrical utility and, therefore, is uninterruptible. Finally, the system provides a number of super capacitors to provide electrical power during the time it takes to switch between power sources. By employing super capacitors and proton exchange membranes, the power system avoids the use of batteries thereby saving significant cost and space.</p>
