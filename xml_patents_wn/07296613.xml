<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application does not claim priority from any other application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention pertains to a molten metal mold casting system for use in the casting of ferrous and non-ferrous molds. More particularly, this invention provides a mold table sensing and automation system which provides multiple embodiments and aspects relating to bleedout detection, and the automation of other tasks utilizing a controlled arm or table mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Metal ingots, billets and other castparts are typically formed by a casting process which utilizes a vertically oriented mold situated above a large casting pit beneath the floor level of the metal casting facility, although this invention may also be utilized in horizontal molds. The lower component of the vertical casting mold is a starting block. When the casting process begins, the starting blocks are in their upward-most position and in the molds. As molten metal is poured into the mold bore or cavity and cooled (typically by water), the starting block is slowly lowered at a predetermined rate by a hydraulic cylinder or other device. As the starting block is lowered, solidified metal or aluminum emerges from the bottom of the mold and ingots, rounds or billets of various geometries are formed, which may also be referred to herein as castparts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While the invention applies to the casting of metals in general, including without limitation aluminum, brass, lead, zinc, magnesium, copper, steel, etc., the examples given and preferred embodiment disclosed may be directed to aluminum, and therefore the term aluminum may be used throughout for consistency even though the invention applies more generally to metals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While there are numerous ways to achieve and configure a vertical casting arrangement, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vertical casting of aluminum generally occurs beneath the elevation level of the factory floor in a casting pit. Directly beneath the casting pit floor <b>101</b><i>a </i>is a caisson <b>103</b>, in which the hydraulic cylinder barrel <b>102</b> for the hydraulic cylinder is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the components of the lower portion of a typical vertical aluminum casting apparatus, shown within a casting pit <b>101</b> and a caisson <b>103</b>, are a hydraulic cylinder barrel <b>102</b>, a ram <b>106</b>, a mounting base housing <b>105</b>, a platen <b>107</b> and a starting block base <b>108</b> (also referred to as a starting head or bottom block), all shown at elevations below the casting facility floor <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mounting base housing <b>105</b> is mounted to the floor <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the casting pit <b>101</b>, below which is the caisson <b>103</b>. The caisson <b>103</b> is defined by its side walls <b>103</b><i>b </i>and its floor <b>103</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A typical mold table assembly <b>110</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which can be tilted as shown by hydraulic cylinder <b>111</b> pushing mold table tilt arm <b>110</b><i>a </i>such that it pivots about point <b>112</b> and thereby raises and rotates the main casting frame assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. There are also mold table carriages which allow the mold table assemblies to be moved to and from the casting position above the casting pit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further shows the platen <b>107</b> and starting block base <b>108</b> partially descended into the casting pit <b>101</b> with castpart or billet <b>113</b> being partially formed. Castpart <b>113</b> is on the starting block base <b>108</b>, which may include a starting head or bottom block, which usually (but not always) sits on the starting block base <b>108</b>, all of which is known in the art and need not therefore be shown or described in greater detail. While the term starting block is used for item <b>108</b>, it should be noted that the terms bottom block and starting head are also used in the industry to refer to item <b>108</b>, bottom block is typically used when an ingot is being cast and starting head when a billet is being cast.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While the starting block base <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only shows one starting block <b>108</b> and pedestal <b>115</b>, there are typically several of each mounted on each starting block base, which simultaneously cast billets, special shapes or ingots as the starting block is lowered during the casting process, as shown in later Figures and as is known.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When hydraulic fluid is introduced into the hydraulic cylinder at sufficient pressure, the ram <b>106</b>, and consequently the starting block <b>108</b>, are raised to the desired elevation start level for the casting process, which is when the starting blocks are within the mold table assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lowering of the starting block <b>108</b> is accomplished by metering the hydraulic fluid from the cylinder at a predetermined rate, thereby lowering the ram <b>106</b> and consequently the starting block at a predetermined and controlled rate. The mold is controllably cooled during the process to assist in the solidification of the emerging ingots or billets, typically using water cooling means.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There are numerous mold and casting technologies that fit into mold tables, and no one in particular is required to practice the various embodiments of this invention, since they are known by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Mold tables come in all sizes and configurations because there are numerous and differently sized and configured casting pits over which mold tables are placed. The needs and requirements for a mold table to fit a particular application therefore depends on numerous factors, some of which include the dimensions of the casting pit, the location(s) of the sources of water and the practices of the entity operating the pit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The upper side of the typical mold table operatively connects to, or interacts with, the metal distribution system. The typical mold table also operatively connects to the molds which it houses.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When metal is cast using a continuous cast vertical mold, the molten metal is cooled in the mold and continuously emerges from the lower end of the mold as the starting block base is lowered. The emerging billet, ingot or other configuration is intended to be sufficiently solidified such that it maintains its desired shape. There is typically an air gap between the emerging solidified metal and the permeable ring wall. Below that, there is also a mold air cavity between the emerging solidified metal and the lower portion of the mold and related equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Since the casting process generally utilizes fluids, including lubricants, there is necessarily conduits and/or piping designed to deliver the fluid to the desired locations around the mold cavity. Although the term lubricant will be used throughout this specification, it is understood that this also means fluids of all types, whether a lubricant or not, and may also include release agents.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Working in and around a casting pit and molten metal can be potentially dangerous and it is desired to continually find ways to increase safety and minimize the danger or accident potential to which operators of the equipment are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect of the invention, it is an object to provide an automated system to perform tasks related to the casting process which may improve safety, through the use of an automated controlled mechanism which is referred to herein as a controlled arm, but which may include an articulated arm, a robotic arm, or an X-Y machine. While all of these may also be considered x-y machines or x-y devices, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the machines described herein and referred to as x-y machines may also include motion in a third dimension (the z direction). Use of the term x-y device herein, for purposes of this invention, therefore includes the above devices and devices with movement in the third or z direction. The two and three dimensional tasks referred to herein may include the insertion of mold plugs in the mold cavities, the drying, cleaning and/or oiling of the starting heads prior to commencement of casting, the application of release agents, as well as others.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The breakout detector <b>129</b> may be an electrical conductor fuse wire which may be configured within a system embodiment in any one of a number of different configurations. For instance, the breakout detector <b>129</b> may be a fuse wire sensor which conducts 24 VDC to a table mounted remote Input/Output (“I/O”) module (as shown in later figures), the insulated fuse wire may be configured to melt in the three hundred degrees Fahrenheit to four hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit temperature range. This would easily cause it to melt in response to a breakout condition. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any one of a number of different control circuits and/or voltages may be utilized within the scope of the invention, which is not limited to any one.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The melting of the breakout detector <b>129</b>, a fuse wire in this embodiment, may be configured to remove the 24 VDC from the input of the remote I/O module. In this configuration, a load resistor may be utilized to prevent the input signal from floating too high.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another aspect of the breakout detector <b>129</b> configuration, there may be a 24 VDC supply power to the insulated fuse wire inside the mold cavity or mold outlet. A load resistor to −24 VDC may then cause a partial melt-through to completely open and drop the input to the remote I/O to 0 VDC. This configuration may be most desirable on smaller mold tables due to the higher requirement for supply current on larger tables.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In yet another embodiment of this invention relative to the breakout detector <b>129</b> configuration, a +24 VDC supply power may be provided to the insulated fuse wire in the mold cavity or mold outlet, with a −24 VDC grounded to the mold cavity. A partial melt-through to the mold cavity will short the 24 VDC supply and complete the melt-through, completely opening the input to the remote I/O module. As in other configurations or embodiments, a load resistor may be utilized to prevent the input signal from floating undesirably high.</p>

The remote input/output rack <b>321</b> may be connected to the plc controller via wireless connections or via conductor <b>319</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an aspect of this invention, the bleedout detection sensor (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be a fuse wire <b>129</b>, which is an insulated temperature sensitive metal which can be selected based on a number of different factors, such as melting temperature. The fuse wire <b>129</b> may also be insulated by a plastic or other insulating material and threaded therein. In an aspect of the invention, a solder material may be used as the fuse wire. The fuse wire in this aspect can then be selected, determined or tailored to the specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While the insulation layer around the fuse wire, solder for instance, may be applied by dipping the solder, it may also be a preformed sheath type insulation layer or structure into which the solder or other predetermined material is placed. In another embodiment, the bleedout detector may be placed adjacent the mold framework or housing such that when a bleedout condition occurs the insulation between the sensor or bleedout detector and the mold housing is removed and a short condition is created to ground, which is the mold housing, and which thereby results in the input/output card detecting a short condition.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an aspect of the invention, the fuse wire may comprise a normal closed circuit loop around the mold cavity, and when its melting temperature is reached, it opens the normally closed circuit. Once the normally closed circuit is opened, the input/output card on the PLC detects an open or “no circuit” condition until the fuse wire is replaced. The input card on the PLC sends a bit to a controller, i.e. digital information, to a processor that displays the condition.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In other aspects of the invention, the breakout detection sensor may be: a twisted or adjacent pair of wires with at least one insulated, such that when a bleedout condition occurs, the insulation between the pair of wires is melted away and a short condition occurs, which in turn causes the input/output card to detect the short circuit condition.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment of this invention, the control system will operate the controlled arm or X-Y machine to obtain an air nozzle operatively attached to a source of compressed air, and sequentially move to each starting head for the mold table and release sufficient air to remove the liquid from the surface thereof. This may be done with the casting table over the starting heads or with the casting table moved or tilted away. The controlled arm or X-Y machine then obtains an oil or lubricant nozzle and sequentially moves to each starting head for the mold table and sprays an oil or lubricant on the starting head to prepare its surface for the casting process.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It will appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art the potential benefit that embodiments of this invention provide, which may be a people-less pit area. While numerous safety precautions are continually taken, there is always at least some danger when people are around high temperature material such as molten aluminum and/or heavy equipment. Embodiments of this invention will remove people from the area during operation and in the event of a bleedout. Prior methods include having an operator manually grab a mold plug, venture out on the mold table and insert the mold plug into the mold cavity to stop the flow of molten aluminum. Prior systems also generally required operators to manually venture to the pit area to apply air to the starting heads and lubrication to the starting heads before the table was placed over the heads, to prepare them for the casting process. Embodiments of this invention eliminate the need to have operators perform such tasks, has these tasks and others may be performed by the controlled arm or the x-y machine described above.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that there are any one of a number of different controlled arms and control systems for the controlled arms, which are available and which may be utilized in embodiments of this invention, with no one in particular being required to practice said embodiments.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Therefore, in a typical sequence in an embodiment of this invention, the controlled arm may be programmed to utilize an air nozzle on each starting head, either with the mold table moved out of the way or through the mold cavities. Once the air and other contaminants are removed, then the controlled arm may utilize a lubricant nozzle to apply a lubricant or oil to the starting heads, as is known in the art. Once the starting heads are sufficiently prepared, the mold table may be moved back over the starting heads, or tilted back down over the starting heads to begin the introduction of molten metal to the mold cavities to begin the casting process.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">During casting, each of the mold cavities then includes a bleedout detector to sense or detect a bleedout condition. Once a bleedout condition is detected, the controller identifies the mold cavity or mold cavities and instructs the controlled arm to obtain a mold plug from the mold plug framework and insert it in that or those mold cavities. The system may, but need not, also cause the casting process to be altered or stopped.</p>
