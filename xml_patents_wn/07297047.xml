<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a slurry delivery method and apparatus for polishing a substrate in a chemical mechanical polishing system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Chemical mechanical planarization, or chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), is a common technique used to planarize substrates. In conventional CMP techniques, a substrate carrier or polishing head is mounted on a carrier assembly and positioned in contact with a polishing article in a CMP apparatus. The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to the substrate urging the substrate against the polishing article. The article is moved relative to the substrate by an external driving force. Thus, the CMP apparatus effects polishing or rubbing movement between the surface of the substrate and the polishing article while dispersing a polishing composition to effect both chemical activity and mechanical activity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chemical mechanical planarization systems generally utilize a polishing head to retain and press a substrate against a polishing surface of a polishing material while providing motion therebetween. Some planarization systems utilize a polishing head that is moveable over a stationary platen that supports the polishing material. Other systems utilize different configurations including a rotating platen to provide relative motion between the polishing material and the substrate. A polishing fluid is typically disposed between the substrate and the polishing material during polishing to provide chemical activity that assists in the removal of material from the substrate. Some polishing fluids may also contain abrasives.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the challenges in developing robust polishing systems and processes is providing uniform material removal across the polished surface of the substrate. For example, as the substrate travels across the polishing surface, the edge of the substrate is often polished at a higher rate. This is due in part to the tendency of the substrate to nose drive, that is, centrifugal and frictional forces force the substrate to move toward to exterior of the support surface as the substrate moves across the support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An additional problem with polishing uniformity is the distribution of slurry on the polishing surface. If the slurry is unevenly distributed, the polishing surface may not evenly polish across the substrate surface. If too little slurry is used, the polishing surface may distort the features of the substrate surface. If too much slurry is applied, valuable slurry may be wasted. Therefore, a system for delivering a polishing fluid to a chemical mechanical polishing surface that adjustably distributes and conserves slurry is needed. As the slurry leaves the slurry distribution system, the pressure drop across the system may facilitate the production of gas bubbles in the line. To provide delivery that is uniform and not distorted by the production of gas bubbles is an important process development goal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention generally provides more uniform delivery of slurry to a chemical mechanical polishing system. More specifically, the present invention generally provides a method and apparatus for the delivery of slurry solution comprising an ultrasonic flow meter positioned between a fluid preparation manifold and a slurry delivery arm, and a shutoff valve positioned between a proportional valve and the slurry delivery arm. Also, the present invention generally provides a method and apparatus for the delivery of slurry solution including an ultrasonic flow meter positioned to receive fluid from a fluid preparation manifold, a proportional valve and stepper motor in communication with the flow meter, and a reverse flow restrictor in communication with the proportional valve and a slurry delivery arm.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides a slurry delivery method and apparatus for polishing a substrate in a chemical mechanical polishing system. In one aspect, the invention provides a slurry delivery method that utilizes a flow meter, proportional valve, and shut off valve to minimize flow meter error and suppress bubble formation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Examples of polishing systems which may be adapted to benefit from aspects of the invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. 6,244,935 issued Jun. 12, 2001 by Birang, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,574 issued Apr. 14,1998 to Tolles, et al., both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The REFLEXION®, REFLEXION LK®, and MIRRATM® systems available from Applied Materials, Inc. of Santa Clara, CA may also benefit from aspects of this invention. Although the polishing fluid delivery system <b>102</b> is described in reference to the illustrative polishing system <b>100</b>, the invention has utility in other polishing systems that process substrates in the presence of a polishing film.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts one embodiment of a polishing system <b>100</b> for polishing a substrate <b>112</b> having a polishing fluid delivery system <b>102</b> that controls the distribution of polishing fluid <b>114</b> across a polishing material <b>108</b>. The exemplary polishing system <b>100</b> includes a platen <b>104</b> and a polishing head <b>106</b>. The platen <b>104</b> is generally positioned below the polishing head <b>106</b> that holds the substrate <b>112</b> during polishing. The platen <b>104</b> is generally disposed on a base <b>122</b> of the system <b>100</b> and coupled to a motor (not shown). The motor rotates the platen <b>104</b> to provide at least a portion of a relative polishing motion between the polishing material <b>108</b> disposed on the platen <b>104</b> and the substrate <b>112</b>. Relative motion between the substrate <b>112</b> and the polishing material <b>108</b> may be provided by alternative mechanisms. For example, at least a portion of the relative motion between the substrate <b>112</b> and polishing material <b>108</b> may be provided by moving the polishing head <b>106</b> over a stationary platen <b>104</b>, moving the polishing material linearly under the substrate <b>112</b>, or moving both the polishing material <b>108</b> and the polishing head <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The polishing material <b>108</b> is supported by the platen <b>104</b> so that a polishing surface <b>116</b> faces upward towards the polishing head <b>106</b>. The polishing material <b>108</b> is fixed to the platen <b>104</b> by adhesives, vacuums, mechanical clamping, or other means during processing. Optionally, and particularly in applications where the polishing material <b>108</b> is configured as a web, belt, or linear polishing material, the polishing material <b>108</b> is fixed to the platen <b>104</b> and is releasable, typically by employing a vacuum disposed between the polishing material <b>108</b> and platen <b>104</b> as described in the previously incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,244,935.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The polishing material <b>108</b> may be a conventional or a fixed abrasive material. Conventional polishing material <b>108</b> is generally comprised of a foamed polymer and disposed on the platen <b>104</b> as a pad. In one embodiment, the conventional polishing material <b>108</b> is foamed polyurethane. Such conventional polishing material <b>108</b> is available from Rodel Corporation, located in Newark, Del.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Fixed abrasive polishing material <b>108</b> is generally comprised of a plurality of abrasive particles suspended in a resin binder that is disposed in discrete elements on a backing sheet. Fixed abrasive polishing material <b>108</b> may be utilized in either pad or web form. As the abrasive particles are contained in the polishing material, systems utilizing fixed abrasive polishing materials generally utilize polishing fluids that do not contain abrasives. Examples of fixed abrasive polishing material are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,950, issued Dec. 2, 1997 to Rutherford, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,312, issued Sep. 26, 1995 to Haas, et al., both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Such fixed abrasive material <b>108</b> is additionally available from Minnesota Manufacturing and Mining Company (3M), located in Saint Paul, Minn.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The polishing head <b>106</b> generally is supported above the platen <b>104</b>. The polishing head <b>106</b> retains the substrate <b>112</b> in a recess <b>120</b> that faces the polishing surface <b>116</b>. The polishing head <b>106</b> typically moves toward the platen <b>104</b> and presses the substrate <b>112</b> against the polishing material <b>108</b> during processing. The polishing head <b>106</b> may be stationary or rotate, isolate, or move orbitally, linearly, or a combination of motions while pressing the substrate <b>112</b> against the polishing material <b>108</b>. One example of a polishing head <b>106</b> that may be adapted to benefit from the invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,354 B1, issued Feb. 6, 2001 to Zuniga, et al., and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another example of a polishing head <b>106</b> that may be adapted to benefit from the invention is a TITAN HEAD™ wafer carrier, available from Applied Materials, Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The polishing fluid delivery system <b>102</b> generally comprises a delivery arm <b>130</b>, a plurality of nozzles <b>132</b> disposed on the arm <b>130</b> and at least one polishing fluid source <b>134</b>. The delivery arm <b>130</b> is configured to meter polishing fluid <b>114</b> at different flow rates along the arm <b>130</b> to control the distribution of polishing fluid <b>114</b> on the polishing surface <b>116</b> of the polishing material <b>108</b>. As the polishing fluid <b>114</b> is generally supplied from a single source, the polishing fluid <b>114</b> is disposed on the polishing material <b>108</b> in a uniform concentration but in varying volume across the surface of the polishing material <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The delivery arm <b>130</b> is generally coupled to the base <b>122</b> proximate to the platen <b>104</b>. The delivery arm <b>130</b> generally has at least a portion <b>136</b> that is suspended over the polishing material <b>108</b>. The delivery arm <b>130</b> may be coupled to other portions of the system <b>100</b> as long as the portion <b>136</b> is may be positioned to deliver polishing fluid <b>114</b> to the polishing surface <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The plurality of nozzles <b>132</b> is disposed along the portion <b>136</b> of the delivery arm <b>130</b> which is disposed above the platen <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the nozzles <b>132</b> comprise at least a first nozzle <b>140</b> and a second nozzle <b>142</b>. Typically, the first nozzle <b>140</b> is positioned on the arm <b>130</b> radially inward of the second nozzle <b>142</b> relative to the center of rotation of the polishing material <b>108</b>. The distribution of polishing fluid <b>114</b> across the polishing material <b>108</b> is controlled by flowing polishing fluid <b>114</b> from the first nozzle <b>140</b> at a rate different than the flow from the second nozzle <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Nozzles <b>132</b> are configured to provide a controlled amount of fluid at an adjustable delivery angle and a controlled droplet size to the surface of the polishing material <b>108</b>. The nozzles <b>132</b> have apertures that may be adjusted to provide flow at a specific angle, for example between 0 and 90° normal to the substrate. The apertures may also be adjusted to provide a specific droplet size, for example 15 Å. The improved control over the droplet size and angle of fluid delivery provides a more tailored slurry application to the polishing material <b>108</b>. This improved control facilitates a more uniform thickness, thinner film across the surface of the polishing material <b>108</b>. Because the film of polishing fluid is thinner and more controlled, less fluid than that required by conventional processes is needed to compensate for fluid losses due to centrifugal forces across the surface of the polishing material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The flow rates exiting the first and second nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may vary from each other. The flow rates may be fixed relative to each other or be independently adjustable. In one embodiment, the fluid delivery arm <b>130</b> includes a polishing fluid supply line <b>124</b> that has a tee connection between the first and second nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. A tee fitting <b>126</b> is coupled to the supply line <b>124</b> and has a first delivery line <b>144</b> coupled to first nozzle <b>140</b> and a second delivery line <b>146</b> branching therefrom that is coupled to the second nozzle <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At least one of the nozzles <b>132</b> is controlled by a flow control mechanism <b>150</b>. The flow control mechanism <b>150</b> may be a device which provides a fixed ratio of flow between the nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> or the flow control mechanism <b>150</b> may be adjustable to provide dynamic control of the flow rates. Examples of flow control mechanisms <b>150</b> include fixed orifices, pinch valves, proportional valves, restrictors, needle valves, restrictors, metering pumps, mass flow controllers and the like. Alternatively, the flow control mechanism <b>150</b> may be provided by a difference in the relative pressure drop between the fluid delivery lines <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> coupling each nozzle <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> and the tee fitting <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The polishing fluid source <b>134</b> is typically disposed externally to the system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the polishing fluid source <b>134</b> generally includes a reservoir <b>152</b> and a pump <b>154</b>. A flow control module <b>156</b> is located between the pump <b>154</b> and the base <b>122</b>. The pump <b>154</b> generally pumps the polishing fluid <b>114</b> from the reservoir <b>152</b> through the flow control module <b>156</b> and the supply line <b>124</b> to the nozzles <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The polishing fluid <b>114</b> contained in the reservoir <b>152</b> is typically deionized water having chemical additives that provide chemical activity that assists in the removal of material from the surface of the substrate <b>112</b> being polished. As the polishing fluid <b>114</b> is supplied to the nozzles <b>132</b> from a single source such as the reservoir <b>152</b>, the fluid <b>114</b> flowing from the nozzles <b>132</b> is substantially homogeneous, not varied in concentration of chemical reagents or entrained abrasives. Optionally, the polishing fluid may include abrasives to assist in the mechanical removal of material from the surface of the substrate. The polishing fluids are generally available from a number of commercial sources such as Cabot Corporation of Aurora, Ill., Rodel Inc., of Newark, Del., Hitachi Chemical Company, of Japan, and Dupont Corporation of Wilmington.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, the substrate <b>112</b> is positioned in polishing head <b>106</b> and brought in contact with the polishing material <b>108</b> supported by the rotating platen <b>104</b>. The polishing head <b>106</b> may hold the substrate stationary or may rotate or otherwise move the substrate to augment the relative motion between the polishing material <b>108</b> and substrate <b>112</b>. The polishing fluid delivery system <b>102</b> flows the polishing fluid <b>114</b> through the supply line <b>124</b> to the first and second polishing nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, configurations having dynamic, adjustable control mechanisms <b>150</b> such as proportional valves, needle valves, mass flow controllers, metering pumps, peristaltic pumps and the like, the distribution of polishing fluid <b>114</b> on the polishing material <b>108</b> may be tailored during the process. For example, the rate of polishing fluid from the first nozzle <b>140</b> may be applied to the polishing material <b>108</b> at a first rate during one portion of the process and adjusted to a second rate during another portion of the process. The rate of polishing fluid <b>114</b> delivery from the second nozzle <b>142</b> may also be varied during the polishing process. The adjustments of polishing fluid flows from nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are infinite. The use of additional nozzles disposed between the first nozzle <b>140</b> and the second nozzle <b>142</b> allows the uniformity profile to be further modified and locally shaped by providing more or less polishing fluid <b>114</b> at a nozzle disposed between the first nozzle <b>140</b> and the second nozzle <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally, a polishing fluid delivery system having dynamic control over the flow rates from the nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may include a metrology device <b>118</b> to provide process feed-back for real-time adjustment of the polishing fluid distribution. Typically, the metrology device <b>118</b> detects a polishing metric such as time of polish, thickness of the surface film being polished on the substrate, surface topography, or other substrate attribute.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the polishing material <b>108</b> may include a window <b>160</b> that allows the metrology device <b>118</b> to view the surface of the substrate <b>112</b> disposed against the polishing material <b>108</b>. The metrology device <b>118</b> generally includes a sensor <b>162</b> that emits a beam <b>164</b> that passes through the window <b>160</b> to the substrate <b>112</b>. A first portion of the beam <b>164</b> is reflected by the surface of the substrate <b>112</b> while a second portion of the beam <b>164</b> is reflected by a layer of material underlying the polished surface of the substrate <b>112</b>. The reflected beams are received by the sensor <b>162</b> and a difference in wavelength between the two portions of reflected beams are resolved to determine the thickness of the material on the surface of the substrate <b>112</b>. Generally, the thickness information is provided to a controller (not show) that adjusts the polishing fluid distribution on the polishing material <b>108</b> to produce a desired polishing result on the substrate's surface. One monitoring system that may be used to advantage is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 5,893,796, issued Apr. 13, 1999 by Birang, et al., and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the metrology device <b>118</b> may include additional sensors to monitor polishing parameters across the width of the substrate <b>112</b>. The additional sensors allow for the distribution of polishing fluid <b>114</b> to be adjusted across the width of the substrate <b>112</b> so that more or less material is removed in one portion relative to another portion of the substrate <b>112</b>. Additionally, the process of adjusting the flow rates from the nozzles <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may occur iteratively over the course of a polishing sequence to dynamically control the rate of material removal across the substrate <b>112</b> at any time. For example, the center of the substrate <b>112</b> may be polished faster by providing more polishing fluid to the center of the substrate <b>112</b> at the beginning of a polishing sequence while the perimeter of the substrate <b>112</b> may be polished faster at the end of the polishing sequence by providing more polishing fluid to the perimeter area.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional schematic view of a polishing fluid delivery system <b>200</b>. The system <b>200</b> is encased in a drawer <b>211</b>. The flow of fluid through the system <b>200</b> is administered by two pieces of equipment, a CLC controller <b>201</b> and a flow meter converter <b>202</b>. Fluid from a fluid preparation manifold (not shown) enters the system <b>200</b> through an inlet <b>203</b>. The fluid then flows through the shutoff valve <b>204</b> in communication with the inlet <b>203</b> and an ultrasonic flow meter <b>205</b>. The shutoff valve <b>204</b> is drained by tubing <b>210</b>. The flow meter <b>205</b> releases fluid to flow through tubing <b>206</b> and a proportional valve and stepper motor <b>207</b>. Fluid flows from the proportional valve and stepper motor <b>207</b> through the tubing <b>208</b> to leave the system <b>200</b> through outlet <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional schematic view of an alternative polishing fluid delivery system <b>300</b>. The system <b>300</b> is encompassed and supported by a drawer <b>310</b>. Integrated unit <b>301</b> provides both a CLC controller and flow meter converter. Fluid from a fluid preparation manifold (not shown) enters the system <b>300</b> through an inlet <b>302</b>. Fluid then flows directly into an ultrasonic flow meter <b>303</b>. From the flow meter <b>303</b>, the fluid flows through tubing <b>304</b>, then a proportional valve and stepper motor <b>305</b>. Tubing <b>306</b> connects the proportional valve and stepper motor <b>305</b> and a shutoff valve <b>307</b>. The fluid exits the system <b>300</b> to enter the slurry delivery arm through outlet <b>308</b>. The two way valve <b>307</b> has a drain <b>309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nitrogen in the purge line of the slurry delivery arm and the nitrogen introduced in the fluid delivery manifold can encourage formation of small bubbles in the fluid delivery system. These bubbles are especially troublesome as the fluid flows through the ultrasonic flow meter. The embodiment depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has improved slurry delivery characteristics over the embodiment depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because the two way valve <b>307</b> provides proper pressure drop conditions for the slurry traveling on to the slurry delivery arm. The embodiment depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may have pressure drop issues as the fluid is delivered to the slurry delivery arm. That is, the back pressure in the line to the slurry delivery arm may fill with bubbles, degrading the ability of the flow controller to provide a consistent volume of fluid because the integrity of the flow controller is compromised if it is filled with bubbles. Placing the shutoff valve between the flow controller and slurry delivery arm solves the pressure drop problem. Alternatively, a check valve, degasser, or other reverse flow restrictor to prevent backwards flow in the same location may solve the bubble formation problem.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiment depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also features a space saving design. The one piece integrated unit <b>301</b> that provides both a CLC controller and flow meter converter saves space over the two piece assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The embodiments depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> may have fluid flow of about 15 mL/min to about 1.5 L/min at a pressure greater than about 7 psi, preferably greater than about 15 psi.</p>
