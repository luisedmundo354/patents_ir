<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to fluid supply systems, and more particularly to a pressure gradient dosing system for a fluid supply system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PARENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following section is taken from the above noted parent applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The parent inventions are directed to a liquid filtration system and to a method of treating the liquid in the enclosed system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Filter assemblies are commonly used to protect combustion engines by filtering out contaminants and thereby preventing damage to the engine and other downstream components such as valves, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and related other components. To maintain engine performance and reliability, the filter assemblies must be replaced, often as frequently as every 2,000 to 4,000 vehicle miles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It can be equally important to add agents to the fuel to reduce damage to the engine and related downstream components and/or to enhance the performance of the engine. For example, since the early 1990's diesel fuel producers have significantly reduced the sulfur content in diesel fuel to reduce the environmental harm that was attributed to the burning of high sulfur content fuels. However, the naturally occurring sulfur in the diesel fuel also acted as a lubricant. The resulting low sulfur content diesel fuel caused increased wear on the diesel engine and, in particular, to the fuel pump and injectors, which in turn caused significant harm to the overall operation, performance, and efficiency of the engine and even to the environment. Consequently, various additives were developed to increase not only the lubricity but also to enhance fuel stability, fuel combustion, and engine performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is difficult to maintain a constant or desired level of the additive in the fuel. Typically an operator adds a bottled additive or additive concentrate to the vehicle fuel tank with each fuel fill-up. While many bottled fuel additives are commercially available, often operators do not consistently add the additive with each fill-up—the additive might not be readily available or the operator may forget to include the additive. Combining the additive with fuel in the fuel tank may not reliably provide a homogenous fuel/additive mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Fuel tanks do not include reliable methods for mixing fuel. Generally operators rely upon the turbulence created during a fill-up and by vehicle motion to mix the additive and fuel. Furthermore, the additive concentration in the fuel may vary, depending upon the amount of fuel in the fuel tank—assuming a set amount of additive is added with each fill-up.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various alternative methods have been developed to add the additives to fuel. One method includes providing a fuel additive in a filter assembly such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,554 issued to Martin et al., which adds the additive to the fuel under diffusion-controlled conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another method is disclosed by Davis in U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,942, which includes a filter assembly with a solid fuel additive that dissolves in the fuel as the additive contacts the fuel in the filter assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The parent inventions provide a novel method of treating fuel by capitalizing on the existence of or developing a fluid pressure gradient within the filter assembly. The pressure gradient can then be harnessed to continuously add the fuel additive to the fuel flowing through the filter assembly. Consequently, the parent inventions provide novel advancements and additionally provides a wide variety of benefits and advantages in the relevant subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While the above discussion has been directed toward filter assemblies, the parent inventions provide a novel filter assembly and method of treating the fluid flowing through that filter, regardless of whether that liquid is a fuel. The principles embodied in the parent inventions apply to filters in general and can be used in filter assemblies, hydraulic filters, lubricant filters, and/or coolant filters.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The parent applications relate to a novel filter assembly, the manufacture and use thereof. Various aspects of the parent applications are novel, nonobvious, and provide various advantages. While the actual nature of the parent applications covered therein can only be determined with reference to the claims appended thereto, certain forms and features, which are characteristic of the preferred embodiments disclosed therein, are described briefly as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one form, the parent inventions provide a filter that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber and including an inlet, an outlet, and a fluid pathway for a liquid flowing through the interior chamber. Liquid flowing through the fluid pathway generates a pressure gradient within the interior chamber such that in a first region of the interior chamber, the flowing liquid exhibits a first (higher) fluid dynamic pressure and in a second region the flowing liquid exhibits a second (lower) fluid dynamic pressure. The filter also includes a filter element disposed in the interior chamber in the fluid pathway between the inlet and the outlet and a container disposed within the interior chamber. The container has an exterior wall that defines an interior region. The container also includes a first opening with a first capillary tube extending from the exterior wall and a second opening through the exterior wall and spaced apart from the first opening. The first opening and said second opening each provide fluid communication between the interior chamber and the interior region. A liquid additive can be deposited in the interior region. The liquid additive can be selected to provide a benefit to at least one of a fuel, oil, lubricant, and coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another form the parent inventions provide a filter that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber and including an inlet and an outlet into the interior chamber; and a filter element disposed in the interior chamber between the inlet and the outlet, where the filter element partitions the interior chamber into two regions—an entering region proximate to the inlet and an exiting region proximate to the outlet. The filter also includes a container disposed within the interior chamber and defining an interior region. The container has a first capillary tube extending into the entering region and a second capillary tube providing fluid communication between the interior region and the interior chamber. A liquid additive, which has been selected to provide a benefit to the liquid flowing through the filter, can be deposited in the interior region of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The parent inventions also provide a method of supplying an additive to the liquid flowing through a filter assembly. The method comprises generating a dynamic fluid pressure gradient within the filter housing; providing an additive in a container within the filter housing; positioning an inlet port for the container proximate to an area of a first dynamic fluid pressure within the filter housing; and positioning an outlet port for the container proximate to an area of a second dynamic fluid pressure less than the first dynamic fluid pressure thereby inducing the liquid additive to flow out of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly that comprises a housing defining an interior chamber; a filter element disposed within the housing and that partitions the interior chamber into an inlet region and a filtered region. The container is positioned within the housing and defines a reservoir. The container includes a first opening that allows the fluid from the inlet region into the reservoir and a second opening allowing the additive or a mixture of the additive and the fluid to flow out of the reservoir toward the outlet to the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly for filtering a fluid. The filter comprises a housing defining an interior chamber, the housing including a nut plate having an inlet and an outlet for the fluid. The filter also includes a filter element that is permeable to the fluid and which is disposed within the housing; and a container that is also positioned within the housing. The container defines a reservoir configured for receipt of a liquid additive. The container also includes a first opening allowing fluid entering from the inlet to flow into the reservoir and a second opening allowing a liquid additive deposited within the reservoir to flow toward the outlet. The first opening and the second opening are configured to allow fluid to flow through the container at a fluid face velocity (and hence corresponding pressure drop) therethrough) of about less than 50% of the fluid face velocity of the primary flow through the filter element.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In still other forms, the parent inventions provide a filter assembly for filtering a fluid. The filter comprising: a housing defining an interior chamber, the housing including a nut plate having an inlet and an outlet for the fluid; a filter element permeable to the fluid and disposed within the housing; and a container positioned within the housing. The container defines a reservoir configured for receipt of a liquid additive and can further include a first opening allowing fluid entering from the inlet to flow into the reservoir and a second opening allowing a liquid additive deposited within the reservoir to flow to the outlet. The second opening is constricted relative to the first opening to attenuate the fluid flow into the container.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Present Application</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A pressure gradient dosing system is provided for a fuel supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one implementation, the invention arose during development efforts directed toward a need in light duty fleets, such as beverage delivery and refuse collection trucks, that are retrofitting aftertreatment devices on vehicles. Some fleets are using a fuel born catalyst to help particulate trap regeneration due to the duty cycles. The preventative maintenance cycles of the fleets may be 12,000 miles or six months, whichever comes first. Pressure gradient slow release filters have a liquid capacity to perhaps treat fuel for 5,000 miles (approximately 600 to 800 gallons of fuel), and hence filter capacity is a limiting factor in drain intervals. A dosing canister capable of holding enough additive to reach 12,000 miles (approximately 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of fuel) would be an advantage. Some fleets are having to go to diesel particulate filters for catalytic aftertreatment for reduction of emissions. Such fleets are typically installing mechanical dosing systems to provide a method of using a liquid fuel born catalyst. In order to achieve a 1,500 hour preventative maintenance cycle, an improved and lower cost option is needed. Current pressure gradient filters are limited for use in low mileage, low hour operating applications, such as beverage delivery trucks, refuse collection trucks, etc., and cannot effectively be used on heavy duty on-highway fleet applications. It is desired to provide a dosing system to treat vehicles that operate on 25,000 to 30,000 mile drain intervals and burn 3,800 to 4,600 gallons of diesel fuel. 2007 engines will likely be using diesel particulate filters with active regeneration, but still may need a way to passively regenerate the diesel particulate filter using a fuel born catalyst. A line of fuel additives that can be packaged in a dosing canister or housing for remote mounting on a heavy duty on-highway truck engine is desirable. A fleet could apply a winter conditioner using a dosing canister on a vehicle when winter is approaching and effectively provide winter gel protection. Furthermore, lubricity currently has a limitation of approximately 500 hours of operation, and a remote mounted dosing canister could double the preventative maintenance cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention also arose during continuing development efforts related to the above noted parent '408 and '513 applications, though is not limited thereto, and may be used as a pressure gradient dosing system for various fluid supply systems. The present invention may be used with or without the filter element of the noted parent applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Parent Applications</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The following section is taken from the above noted parent applications.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the parent applications, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated herein, and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the parent applications is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the described filters, cartridges, and processes, and any further applications of the principles of the parent applications as described herein, are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the parent applications relate.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a filter assembly <b>10</b> provided in accordance with the parent applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded, cross-sectional view of the same filter assembly <b>10</b>. Filter assembly <b>10</b> includes a housing or outer casing <b>12</b> defining an interior chamber <b>14</b>. A nut plate <b>16</b> is secured across an open end <b>13</b> of casing <b>12</b>. Nut plate <b>16</b> provides at least one inlet <b>18</b>, preferably a plurality of inlets, and at least one outlet <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, nut plate <b>16</b> includes a plurality of inlets <b>18</b> encircling a centrally-located outlet <b>20</b>. Both inlet(s) <b>18</b> and outlet <b>20</b> provide fluid communication with interior chamber <b>14</b> to allow a liquid such as, and organic based fuel, lubricant, or oil fluid; or an aqueous based coolant, to flow into and out of interior chamber <b>14</b>. Additionally, a filter element <b>22</b> and a vessel or container <b>24</b> and, optionally, biasing element <b>26</b>, are provided in interior chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Filter element <b>22</b> is positioned in a fluid pathway between the liquid entering through inlet <b>18</b> and exiting through outlet <b>20</b>. Additionally, filter element <b>22</b> can partition interior chamber <b>14</b> into a liquid entering region <b>28</b> and a liquid exiting region <b>30</b>. Filter element <b>22</b> is provided in the form of any known and commercially available filter material. Examples of a material that can be used as a filter element include paper (cellulose), cloth, polyester, wire mesh, plastic mesh, gradient density melt-blown polymeric materials, and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, filter element <b>22</b> is provided as a cylindrical sleeve formed of a pleated sheet of filter material. The cylindrical sleeve defines a centrally-located axis <b>23</b>. On either end of the cylindrical sleeve, filter element <b>22</b> is supported within interior chamber <b>14</b> with a first and second filter endcaps <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> to provide a fluid-tight seal. Consequently, a liquid flowing through filter assembly <b>10</b> must pass through filter <b>22</b> to flow from entering region <b>28</b> to exiting region <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Filter assembly <b>10</b> can also includes a water in fuel sensor and/or drain valve <b>35</b> in outer casing <b>12</b>. It will be understood that for some applications the filter assembly need not include a drain valve. However, when present, drain valve <b>35</b> can be used to drain out any water that has separated from a non-aqueous liquid such as the organic based fuels, oils, and lubricants. The separated water can collect in the bottom of the interior chamber <b>14</b>. The water droplets can flow down between the inside wall of casing <b>12</b> and the exterior wall of container <b>24</b>, which can have vertically extending spacers <b>37</b> to separate and centrally position container <b>24</b> in the interior chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a partial view in full section of the lower portion of filter assembly <b>10</b>, container <b>24</b> is positioned inside interior chamber <b>14</b>. A liquid additive <b>25</b> can be deposited in the interior chamber <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, container <b>24</b> is disposed between the closed end <b>27</b> of outer casing <b>12</b> and the lower endcap <b>32</b> of filter element <b>22</b>. Biasing element <b>26</b>, which is illustrated as a circular spring, biases container <b>24</b> against the lower endcaps <b>32</b> of filter element <b>22</b>, and, consequently, forces endcap <b>3</b> of filter element <b>22</b> against nut plate <b>16</b> or a seal disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Container <b>24</b> includes an exterior wall <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, exterior wall <b>34</b> includes a plurality of spacers <b>37</b> each configured as a small, axially-oriented rib. The spacers <b>37</b> provide a gap between the exterior wall <b>34</b> of container <b>24</b> and the interior wall of casing <b>12</b> so that separated water can fall down between the wall <b>34</b> where a drain valve <b>35</b> can be used to remove the accumulated water. Exterior wall <b>34</b> defines an interior region <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, container <b>24</b> defines a cylindrical reservoir or depot concentric about axis <b>23</b>. Container <b>24</b> can be provided as a two-piece (or more) structure(s), which pieces are interconnected via a connection. The connection can be a threaded connection sealed with adhesive, snap-fit, ultra-sonic welded, or spin-welded, as desired. In a preferred embodiment, container <b>24</b> will be provided as a two-piece structure with a spin-weld connection joining the two structures.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Entrance port <b>42</b> provides an opening through exterior wall <b>34</b>. Similarly, exit port <b>44</b> also provides an opening through wall <b>34</b>. Both entrance port <b>42</b> and exit port <b>44</b> provide a pathway for liquid in interior chamber <b>14</b> to enter and exit, respectively, interior region <b>40</b> of container <b>24</b>. Preferably both entrance port <b>42</b> and exit port <b>44</b> are located in a top wall portion <b>41</b> of container <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a preferred embodiment, entrance port <b>42</b> is provided as a small diameter tube or capillary tube <b>48</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, capillary tube <b>48</b> has a desired length to extend into interior chamber <b>14</b> and adjacent to filter element <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, capillary tube <b>48</b> provides a fluid conduit for liquid in entering region <b>28</b> to flow into interior region <b>40</b>. Preferably the length and/or diameter of capillary tube <b>48</b> is selected to take advantage of the fluid pressure generated by the liquid flowing through filter assembly <b>10</b> and to induce a portion of the liquid to enter interior region <b>40</b> at a desired flowrate.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, capillary tube <b>48</b> extends from container <b>24</b> towards inlet <b>18</b> between casing <b>12</b> and filter element <b>22</b>. In one preferred embodiment, capillary tube <b>48</b> extends the length of filter element <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the length of capillary tube <b>48</b> that extends beyond the exterior of container <b>24</b> is selected to be less than or equal to about three-fourths of the length of the filter element; or the length of capillary tube <b>48</b> is selected to be less than or equal to about one-half of the length of the filter element; still yet in another embodiment the length of capillary tube <b>48</b> is selected to be less than or equal to about one-fourth of the length of the filter element. The capillary tube end <b>49</b> can be provided in a variety of configurations including a round, oval, flattened configuration, or it can be configured to conform to the space between the exterior of the filter element and the interior of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Opposite end of capillary tube <b>48</b> can also extend into interior region <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, capillary tube <b>48</b> extends adjacent to the lower wall portion or bottom of container <b>24</b>. Tube <b>48</b> can extend a desired distance inside container <b>24</b> from the top wall portion <b>41</b> to the bottom wall portion <b>51</b>. In one embodiment, this distance is greater than about one half the distance between wall portions <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>, in other embodiments this distance is greater than about three fourths that distance. This prevents the incoming liquid from flowing directly across the top of container <b>24</b> toward exit port <b>44</b>. It is preferable that the incoming liquid mix sufficiently with the additive contained within container <b>24</b>. One method of promoting adequate mixing of the liquid and additive is to increase the period of time that the liquid remains in container <b>24</b> and/or increase the distance that the incoming liquid must flow in the interior region before exiting out exit port <b>44</b>. It will be understood that in alternative embodiments capillary tube <b>48</b> need not extend to the bottom of container <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the preferred embodiment, the difference in liquid density and the additive density can be utilized to achieve a more uniform release rate over time. (See below, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.) Generally, the liquid additive is denser than the liquid flowing through the filter assembly (regardless whether the liquid is organic or aqueous based). Consequently, the filtered liquid tends to “float” on the additive phase. Truncating the inlet tube near the top of the additive vessel, and extending the outlet capillary near the bottom of the vessel takes advantage of this property. During operation, the liquid enters the inlet vessel, floats, and remains (largely, with exception of the slow diffusion between phases) at the top of the vessel or layered on the liquid additive. As more of the liquid enters through the inlet vessel, the entering liquid displaces pure additive and pushing it out the outlet tube in nearly full-concentration yielding a very steady injection of active ingredient into the system.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Exit port <b>44</b> is provided in an upper wall portion of exterior wall <b>34</b> and is spaced apart from entrance port <b>42</b>. Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, exit port <b>44</b> is centrally positioned in exterior wall <b>34</b> to extend centrally into interior region <b>40</b>. However, it will be understood that exit port <b>44</b> can be positioned as desired in exterior wall <b>34</b> to extend into and/or through any portion of container <b>24</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, exit port <b>44</b> can be defined by a capillary tube <b>54</b> extending into interior region <b>40</b>. Capillary tube <b>54</b> provides a conduit between interior region <b>40</b> and interior chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, capillary tube <b>54</b> provides fluid communication between the liquid and an additive initially located in interior region <b>40</b> and entering region <b>28</b>. From entering region <b>28</b>, liquid can then flow through filter element <b>22</b> and into exiting region <b>30</b>. From there, the liquid can then flow through outlet <b>20</b> and back into the system—either a recirculating fuel, coolant, oil, or lubricant system or a single-pass fuel system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an alternative embodiment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), capillary tube <b>54</b> provides an exit for the liquid and additive in interior region <b>40</b> to flow to exiting region <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, capillary tube <b>54</b> provides direct fluid communication for a liquid and/or an additive mixture in interior region <b>40</b> and exiting region <b>30</b> and, ultimately, to outlet <b>20</b>. Consequently, in this embodiment, the liquid and additive in interior region <b>40</b> can bypass filter element <b>22</b>. This embodiment would offer a high gradient pressure, since the restriction of the filter element is now added to the dynamic pressure gradient (Pdyn). This embodiment can provide particular advantages, for example, for injecting a very viscous additive into the system. If desired, a small filter medium, such as a sintered porous plug, wire-mesh screen, or the like, can be included on the outlet tube to prevent any large particles that have bypassed the filter from causing damage to downstream components. The filter medium can be located on either end of the outlet tube.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Optionally, entrance port <b>42</b> and/or exit port <b>44</b> can be sealed with a soluble seal <b>43</b> and <b>45</b>, respectively. This allows filter assembly <b>10</b> to be storage stable, and in particular, this can inhibit loss of activity and/or volume of the additive in container <b>24</b>. In use, a liquid flowing through filter assembly <b>10</b> dissolves the seal material, allowing the liquid to enter into interior region <b>40</b> and mix with the additive therein. Alternatively, the soluble seal can be composed of a low melting material that melts when exposed to the normal operating temperatures of the fuel flowing through the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one embodiment when the liquid is an organic base fluid such as fuel, oil or a lubricant, the soluble seal is composed of a material such as a wax that is soluble in organic solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Optionally, a separate, second container illustrated as pre-charge reservoir <b>56</b> can be included in filter assembly <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, pre-charge reservoir <b>56</b> is positioned in or on container <b>24</b>. Pre-charge reservoir <b>56</b> is separated from the interior region <b>40</b> (and the liquid additive <b>25</b> therein) by partition <b>57</b> which can be the upper wall portion of container <b>24</b>. One end <b>58</b> of reservoir <b>56</b> can be open or alternatively end <b>58</b> can be covered with a mesh or other porous structure. An additive <b>59</b> can be deposited into pre-charge reservoir <b>56</b> and made available for immediate release into the liquid flowing through filter assembly <b>10</b>. Additive <b>59</b> can be the same or different from additive <b>25</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the additive <b>59</b> in the pre-charge reservoir is a solid or semi-solid material that dispenses or disperses into the liquid flowing through the filter assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The liquid additive <b>25</b> can be selected from any known and commercially useful composition that can provide beneficial properties to the particular liquid being filtered. The additive can be a liquid at ambient temperature or a solid component that has been dissolved in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable fuel additives for use in the parent applications but are not restricted to lubricity aids, ignition promoters, and the like.

Furthermore, it should be understood that the term “fuel” as used herein includes diesel, biodiesel, gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, or other petroleum distillates. Consequently, the additive can be selected to provide a benefit to any of these different fuel compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Additionally, the filter assemblies as described herein can be used with fuel delivery systems for combustion engines, including both diesel and gasoline engines, and/or for any other fuel storage and delivery device or system which may or may not be directly connected to a combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The additives for coolants, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, and oil can also be included in either the interior region <b>40</b> and/or the pre-charge reservoir <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Examples of aqueous coolant additives that can be used in the parent applications include one of more of the following without limitation: anticorrosion additives such as neutralized dicarboxylic acids, mercaptobenzothiazole, benzotriazole, tolyltriazole, and salts of molybdate, nitrite, nitrate, and silicate (preferably with ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, or alkali metal as the counter ion); and buffering agents which can be selected from any known or commonly used buffering agents, such as, borate salts and phosphate salts; as well as a variety of other additives, including defoamers, scale inhibitors, surfactants, detergents, and dyes. Examples of defoamers include components (alone or in combination) such as silicon defoamers, alcohols such as polyethoxylated glycol, polypropoxylated glycol or acetylenic glycols.

Surfactants for use in this parent applications include, for example, either alone or in combination alkyl sulfonates, acryl sulfonates, phosphate esters, sulfosuccinate, acetylenic glycol, and ethoxylated alcohols. Detergents include non-ionic and/or anionic components such as, for example, phosphate ester surfactants, sodium alkyl sulfonates, sodium aryl sulfonates, sodium alkyl aryl sulfonates, linear alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkylphenols, ethoxylated alcohols, carboxylic esters, and the like. Examples of the coolant additives are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,495, published US Patent Application 20030042208, and pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/611,332 and 09/611,413 both filed on Jul. 6, 2000, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In use, the liquid to be filtered flows in through one or more of inlets <b>18</b> in nut plate <b>16</b>, and from there into interior chamber <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a liquid flows into entering region <b>28</b> in the direction indicated by inflow arrows <b>60</b>. It has been observed that the liquid flowing through a filter such as filter assembly <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> exhibits a dynamic fluid pressure gradient within the interior chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating the dynamic fluid pressure predicted by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model at varying axial positions within a filter [all points taken at radial position midway in gap between filter shell ID (<b>12</b>) filter element pleat OD (<b>22</b>)]. The graph indicates that the fluid dynamic pressure is greatest near the top of the filter element endcap <b>31</b> where the axial velocity is highest. The dynamic pressure below the top endcap begins to diminish since the axial velocity decreases as fluid is carried inward through the filter. The y-axis on the graph is the CFD-predicted dynamic fluid pressure, in Kpa. The x-axis corresponds to the axial position in the filter measured with respect to the filter element at which the dynamic fluid pressure was reported via CFD. In the graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bottom endcap of the filter element is at 0.1 m and the top is at ˜0.225 m. The absolute value of the dynamic fluid pressure within the filter can vary depending upon a variety of factors that affect flow velocity in the gap between filter and housing, including: the overall length of the filter housing and/or filter element, the size of gap (annulus area) between the filter element and housing shell, the overall length of the filter housing and/or filter element, the configuration of the filter element (number of pleats, outer diameter of pleats, inner diameter of pleats, media thickness), the flowrate or volume of flowing through the filter casing and/or filter element, and the density of the flowing liquid. The dynamic pressure, Pdyn, can be calculated according to Equation 1:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Pdyn=</i>1/2×density×velocity<sup>2</sup>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where density is the liquid density and velocity is the velocity of the liquid flowing through the filter.
</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The parent applications take advantage of this observation by positioning entrance port <b>42</b> where Pdyn is at a relatively high pressure and locating exit port <b>44</b> in an area within the interior chamber that exhibits lower fluid pressure. Since the entrance port is aligned perpendicular with the direction of flow-(like a pitot tube), a stagnation zone forms in front of the tube causing the dynamic pressure to be converted to a static pressure which is harnessed to drive flow slowly into the tube and through the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the illustrated embodiment, entrance port <b>42</b> is defined by the open terminal end of capillary tube <b>48</b>. Capillary tube <b>48</b> extends from interior region <b>40</b> through wall <b>34</b> and up between filter element <b>22</b> and the interior wall of outer casing <b>12</b>. Placing the entrance port <b>42</b> at the terminus of capillary tube <b>48</b> in an area of relatively high fluid pressure induces the liquid flowing through the liquid filter to enter interior region <b>40</b>. In interior region <b>40</b>, the liquid can mix with the liquid additive. Thereafter, the liquid and additive mixture can exit through exit port <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, exit port <b>44</b>, as noted above, allows the liquid and additive mixture to re-enter the entering region <b>28</b> albeit in an area where the dynamic fluid pressure is less than the pressure in the area adjacent entrance <b>42</b> to capillary tube <b>48</b>. In this embodiment, the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region <b>40</b> flows through the filter element <b>22</b> before exiting the filter assembly through outlet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an alternative embodiment, exit port <b>44</b> provides direct fluid communication between interior region <b>40</b> and exiting region <b>30</b>. This allows the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region <b>40</b> to exit into exiting region <b>30</b> and from there be mixed with the bulk liquid in exiting region <b>30</b> into the fuel conduit (not shown) without passing through filter element <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, as noted above, a separate filter element can be included with exit port <b>44</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Providing entrance port <b>42</b> in an area of relatively high fluid pressure and positioning exit port <b>44</b> in an area of lower fluid pressure provides substantial benefits for adding additives to flowing liquid. The release rate of a liquid additive in container <b>24</b> can be tailored as described. In one preferred embodiment, the desired release rate remains relatively constant over a long time period. This effect can be modified by varying the initial viscosity of the liquid additive in container <b>24</b>. For example, if the initial viscosity of the liquid additive is substantially higher than that of the liquid flowing through filter assembly <b>10</b>, then as the liquid begins to mix with and dilute the additive in the interior of container <b>24</b>, the initial viscosity of the liquid and additive mixture slowly begins to decrease. The high viscosity inhibits rapid initial release of additive from container <b>24</b> due to the controlling restriction provided by the outlet capillary tube. The inlet capillary tube may also have a restriction, but since the liquid viscosity is much lower than that of the additive and the inlet tube is filled only with the liquid, the outlet capillary restriction largely controls/sets the flowrate that results from the fixed gradient pressure. However, over time, the relative amount of liquid in the liquid and additive mixture in container <b>24</b> increases. As the relative amount of the liquid component in the liquid and additive mixture increases, the viscosity of the resulting liquid and additive mixture decreases. The resulting decrease in viscosity causes the outlet capillary tube restriction to decrease which leads to corresponding increase in flowrate (of diluted fuel/additive mix), hence giving a more stable release of actual active ingredient (additive). At a given pressure gradient, the flowrate through the additive vessel having two capillary tubes in series (an inlet and an outlet) with differing viscosity in each tube (and neglecting any contribution of viscous drag offered by the vessel) can be modeled according to the following Equation 2:</p>

where Q=flowrate, P=gradient pressure, D<sub>1</sub>=inlet tube diameter, D<sub>2</sub>=outlet tube diameter, μ<sub>2</sub>=additive viscosity, L<sub>2</sub>=outlet tube length, L<sub>1</sub>=inlet tube length, and μ<sub>1</sub>=liquid viscosity. According to Equation 2, the desired flowrate can be easily adjusted by varying the tube geometries—especially the tube diameters, D<sub>1 </sub>and D<sub>2</sub>, since flow varies inversely with the tube diameters to the fourth power. In use, the additive viscosity μ<sub>2 </sub>will slowly decrease and the flowrate will increase. This effect will be more pronounced if the outlet tube provides the largest restriction to flow, for example, if D<sub>1 </sub>were small. It has been determined that it is typical to achieve a ˜three-fold increase in flow over the life of the filter/additive vessel when working with a ten-fold additive/fuel viscosity ratio. This three-fold increase in flow helps to counteract the decreasing active ingredient release rate due to the exponentially decaying concentration of active ingredient in the vessel.
</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are graphs which illustrate this effect for two cases where all other factors are equal, including additive vessel volume and total additive released in a 300-hour period. Only the inlet tube diameter is adjusted to achieve the correct total additive release. The first graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how the flowrate is constant for the case of a vessel that lacks an outlet capillary (since inlet pressure is constant and viscosity in the inlet tube is constant). When a capillary tube is added to outlet of the container, the initial flowrate is reduced—but the final flowrate has increased almost three-fold due to declining viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the “active ingredient” or additive injection rate for these same two cases. When the container does not include a capillary tube outlet, an exponential decay (about 80% decrease in this case) in the release rate of the additive is anticipated. When the container contains a capillary tube outlet, the injection rate curve is significantly flattened (˜50% decrease in the release rate of the additive) due to the rising flowrate offsetting the decreasing additive concentration of the diluted vessel mixture. For both cases, the total amount of additive released in the 300-hour time period is about equal. However, the case where the container includes a capillary outlet tube provides a more constant release rate over time. This can translate into better protection for the fuel system.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, the rate that liquid enters into container <b>24</b> can be varied. Increasing the pressure differential between entrance port <b>42</b> of exit port <b>44</b> will induce a more rapid in-flow and escape of the liquid and additive mixture from the interior region <b>40</b> of container <b>24</b>. Extending end <b>49</b> of capillary tube <b>48</b> closer to inlet <b>18</b> can increase the dynamic pressure. Similarly, terminating end <b>55</b> of capillary tube <b>54</b> in an area at lower pressure such as the area proximate to exiting region <b>30</b> can decrease the dynamic fluid pressure at exit port <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In another embodiment, varying the configuration and/or size of capillary tube <b>48</b> and/or capillary tube <b>54</b> can vary the pressure difference between the fluid entering and exiting container <b>24</b>.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Conversely, placing entrance port <b>42</b> and exit port <b>44</b> such that the relative pressure differential between the two is small provides for a low flow rate through container <b>24</b>.</p>

Since the liquid is less dense than the liquid additive, the liquid tends to “float” on the additive phase and the inlet tube is truncated near the top of the additive vessel, whereas the outlet capillary extends to near the bottom of the vessel. During operation, as the liquid enters the inlet vessel and “floats” and remains (with exception of the slow diffusion between phases) on the top of the vessel, displacing pure additive and pushing it out the outlet tube in nearly full-concentration yielding a very steady injection of active ingredient into system.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is still yet another embodiment of a filter assembly <b>150</b>. Filter assembly <b>150</b> can be provided substantially as has been described for filter assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>130</b>. Consequently, the same reference numbers will be used to denote like components. Filter assembly <b>150</b> includes a container <b>152</b> in an interior chamber <b>154</b>. Capillary tube <b>156</b> provides an inlet into the interior region <b>158</b> of container <b>152</b>. In this embodiment, capillary tube <b>156</b> extends in a direction parallel to and substantially along the entire length of filter element <b>22</b>. Upper endcap <b>158</b>, shown in an enlarged view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, includes a shroud <b>160</b> that extends downwardly and in a radially direction toward the upper end <b>162</b> of capillary tube <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In this embodiment, the endcap shroud <b>161</b> cooperates with filter shell <b>164</b> to constrict the flow and hence increase the velocity in close proximity to entrance of capillary tube <b>158</b>. This in turn increases the dynamic fluid pressure at end <b>162</b>. Consequently, the pressure difference between the entrance and exit from container <b>152</b> is greater than would be observed if the fuel were not constricted between filter endcap shroud and shell.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a cross-sectional view of yet another embodiment of a filter assembly <b>180</b> in accordance with the parent applications. Filter assembly <b>180</b> includes some of the same or similar components as discussed for filter assembly <b>10</b>; therefore, the same reference numbers will be used for the same components. Filter assembly <b>180</b> includes an outer casing or housing <b>182</b> that defines an interior chamber <b>184</b>. A filter element <b>22</b> and a vessel or container <b>186</b> are positioned in the interior chamber. Filter element <b>22</b> can partition the interior chamber <b>184</b> into a fluid entering region <b>188</b> and a fluid exiting region <b>190</b>. Additionally, filter assembly <b>180</b> can include a separable lower bowl <b>192</b> for water collection with a drain valve <b>193</b> to expel the collected water.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Container <b>186</b> includes an exterior wall <b>194</b> that defines an interior region <b>196</b>. An additive <b>198</b> such as has been described above is disposed in interior region <b>196</b>. A first, inlet <b>200</b> allows fluid to flow into interior region <b>196</b>. An outlet <b>202</b> allows the additive and/or a mixture of the fluid and additive to flow out of interior region <b>196</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, it can be observed that inlet <b>200</b> allows fluid from the fluid entering region <b>188</b> to flow into interior region <b>196</b> while the outlet <b>202</b> allows the additive and/or fluid additive mixture to flow out of the interior region and into the fluid exiting region <b>190</b>. Container <b>186</b> can be charged with the liquid additive through a closable or sealable opening <b>191</b> prior to final assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Inlet <b>200</b> is surrounded by a short, cylindrical boss covered by a filter element or filter media <b>204</b>. In this particular embodiment, inlet <b>200</b> need not be a capillary tube and need not extend into the interior region <b>196</b>. Rather inlet <b>200</b> is configured as a short, cylindrical opening having a diameter of approximately between 1 mm and about 10 mm. Filter media <b>204</b> can be formed of the same material as used for the filter element <b>22</b> or a different material as desired. The filter media <b>204</b> can be supported by cross ribs extending across the opening. The filter media <b>204</b> can be formed of a material or configured and/or sized to minimize the pressure drop across the inlet <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the fluid face velocity (and hence pressure drop, since restriction to flow across porous media is proportional to the velocity of flow) through inlet <b>200</b> is about 50% of that through filter element <b>22</b>; more preferably, less than about 25%; and still more preferably less than about 10% lower than that observed to flow through filter element <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As used herein the term fluid face velocity is defined as the “approach velocity” of a liquid flowing normal to the surface of the filter material according to Equation 3:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>FV</i>=volumetric flowrate/area [m/s]  (3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where FV is the fluid face velocity and volumetric flowrate is the volumetric flowrate of the fluid approaching the filter material.
</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Additionally, if desired, filter element <b>204</b> can be covered or sealed with a fluid soluble seal <b>206</b>. Seal <b>206</b> can be provided to inhibit accidental leakage of the additive <b>198</b> during storage and shipping and/or prevent contact of the additive to air prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Outlet <b>202</b> in this illustration includes a capillary tube <b>210</b>. Capillary tube <b>210</b> can operate to control the rate of release of the additive (or a mixture of fluid and additive) out of container <b>186</b>. Capillary tube <b>210</b> extends from the interior region <b>196</b> through outlet <b>202</b>. An exterior portion <b>212</b> of capillary tube <b>210</b> is surrounded by a support structure <b>214</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, support structure <b>214</b> is provided as a conical boss <b>216</b> which provides support and minimizes the risk of damage to the exterior portion <b>212</b> of capillary tube <b>210</b>. To further support and reduce the risk of plugging during assembly, the terminal end of capillary tube <b>210</b> be recessed in conical boss <b>216</b>. In one embodiment, support structure <b>214</b> includes a plurality of radially extending ribs <b>217</b>, which can extend beyond the terminal end of capillary tube <b>210</b>. While boss <b>216</b> is illustrated as a conical or a frustum conical configuration other configurations are contemplated. Boss <b>216</b> bears against a seal <b>218</b> about an inner portion of end cap <b>220</b>, which supports filter element <b>22</b>. Engagement between boss <b>216</b> and seal <b>218</b> provides a fluid-tight seal to prevent fluid flowing though the assembly from bypassing both filter element <b>22</b> and container <b>186</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, capillary <b>210</b> and boss <b>216</b> are centrally located in the top wall portion of container <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Capillary tube <b>210</b> extends into interior region <b>196</b>. In preferred embodiments, capillary tube <b>210</b> extends to a position in close proximity to the bottom wall portion <b>222</b> of container <b>186</b>. The length of capillary tube <b>210</b> can be varied as desired to control or limit the additive release rate. The capillary tube <b>210</b> defines a flow path for the additive and/or additive/fluid mixture in container <b>186</b>. In one embodiment, capillary tube defines a flow path that has a length greater than the depth of container <b>186</b>, measured from the upper wall portion to the lower wall portion.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The present embodiment of a filter assembly <b>180</b> provides distinct advantages. The illustrated embodiment provides particular advantages for additives, which are denser than the fluid flowing through the assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, the inlet <b>200</b> is provided as a cylindrical opening. This reduces the variation in the additive release rate of flow since the majority of the pressure gradient developed between the inlet <b>200</b> and the outlet <b>202</b> is across the capillary tube <b>210</b>. Thus, the capillary tube configuration can be tailored to control the release rate of the additive. This can include varying the length and/or diameter of capillary tube <b>210</b> to fine tune the release rate of the additive into the fluid. Increasing the diameter of capillary tube <b>210</b> increases the rate of release by a factor proportional to the (capillary internal diameter) 4. Increasing the length of capillary tube <b>232</b> decreases the rate of release by a factor inversely proportional to the capillary length.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Additionally typically during use the filter media retains particles from the fluid. Eventually near the end of the filter assembly's useful life span, the filter media may become sufficiently clogged with the particles that the pressure differential between the entering region <b>188</b> and the exiting region <b>190</b> significantly increases. This greater pressure differential forces any remaining liquid additive out of container <b>186</b> into the fluid where it can provide a benefit to the fluid rather than being disposed of when the filter assembly is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> which illustrates a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of a container <b>230</b>. In container <b>230</b>, capillary tube <b>232</b> is illustrated as extending all the way to the bottom wall portion <b>222</b> terminating in a spiral winding <b>234</b>. This, in effect, lengthens capillary tube <b>232</b> to accommodate a greater pressure differential while still maintaining the desired flowrate of the additive out of the interior region <b>196</b>. It should be understood that the spiral winding <b>234</b> can extend or spiral in any direction. However, it is preferred that the end of capillary <b>232</b> be positioned proximate to the bottom wall portion <b>222</b>. As noted above, typically the liquid additive is denser than the fluid flowing through the assembly. Consequently, positioning the end of the capillary tube near the bottom wall of container <b>230</b> ensures that all of the additive is released into the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a container <b>186</b> for use in filter assembly <b>180</b>. In this embodiment, container <b>186</b> includes a reservoir <b>240</b> formed in the upper wall portion <b>242</b>. A pre-charge additive can be deposited in reservoir <b>240</b> to be directly added to the fluid in filter assembly <b>180</b>. This provides an additional “additive boost” upon initial employment of the filter assembly <b>180</b>. As discussed above, the additive pre-charge deposited in reservoir <b>240</b> can, if desired, also be coated with a fluid soluble seal or seal material such as a wax for organic fluids or a water-soluble polymer for aqueous based fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a partial view, in cross-section of an alternative embodiment of a filter assembly <b>250</b>. In this embodiment, a container <b>252</b> is illustrated which includes a capillary tube <b>254</b> extending through a cylindrical boss <b>256</b>. An O-ring seal <b>258</b> on top of boss <b>256</b> seals against the lower end cap <b>220</b> to ensure a fluid-tight seal and prevent any fluid from bypassing both filter element <b>22</b> and container <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is an exploded, perspective view of the lower portion of container <b>186</b> and lower bowl <b>192</b>. It can be seen from this embodiment that container <b>186</b> includes a plurality of concentric ribs <b>264</b> positioned about the exterior wall <b>194</b>. This allows a space or gap between the exterior wall <b>194</b> of container <b>186</b> and housing <b>182</b> to allow any water to drain down into the lower bowl <b>192</b>. The water can then drain through channels <b>266</b> into bowl <b>192</b>. Bowl <b>192</b> can include a threaded stud <b>268</b>, which can be threadedly engaged with a threaded recess <b>270</b> in the lower portion of container <b>186</b>. In preferred embodiments, lower bowl <b>192</b> can be provided with a drain relief valve <b>193</b>. Additionally, lower bowl <b>192</b> can be provided with an electronic sensor to sense moisture contained therein or can be made of a clear material through which the water can be visually observed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Filter assembly <b>180</b> provides additional advantages in that it can be used with vacuum side filter applications. In vacuum side applications little fluid is present in the entrance region <b>188</b> between filter element <b>22</b> and shell wall <b>182</b>—the fluid at that location is mainly vapor. In a vacuum application, the liquid is generally confined to a zone approximately beneath endcap <b>220</b> and in the fluid exiting region <b>190</b>. Because the opening <b>200</b> is below the endcap <b>220</b>, the liquid is present to flow into container <b>186</b> through the inlet <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The parent applications provide distinct advantages to current delivery systems. The use of a liquid additive in the container allows the maximum amount of an additive to be included within a filter assembly because the liquid additive can completely fill the internal volume of the container where as solid additives do not. Furthermore, by harnessing the pressure gradient generated within a filter assembly in use, the rate of addition of the additive is much more independent of vibration variation that may occur during use. However, the rate of release of the additive as noted above can be adjustable by varying the length and/or diameters of the capillary tubes leading into and out of the container holding the fuel additive.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The parent applications also provide a method of adding beneficial additives to the liquid only with the liquid flowing through the filter. When the liquid is not flowing through the filter, diffusion of any additive out of the container has been measured to be negligible because of the extremely low molecular diffusion rate. The molecular diffusion rate is described by the binary diffusion coefficient, which in the above-described embodiments with the liquid/additive is on the order of 2e-6 cm2/s between the additive and the liquid phases, and the dynamic fluid pressure gradient is zero when there is no flow so convective transfer is also eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The parent applications also contemplate modifications as would occur to those skilled in the art. It is also contemplated that the devices and processes embodied in the parent applications can be altered, rearranged, substituted, combined, or added to other processes as would occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the parent applications.
