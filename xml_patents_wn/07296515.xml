<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to stamp devices for marking documents. More particularly, the present invention relates to self-contained hand-stamping devices movable from a closed position to an open position for stamping.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Documents frequently are marked with notational statements before placing in files, enclosing with correspondence, or using the document. Common notational statements include “COPY”, “FAX”, “FILE”, “PAID” and other such conventional office phrases for marking documents. In addition, the notational statement can be custom for a particular office; for example, the notational statement may be a set of initials of persons in a particular group for a routing list.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The notational statements are conventionally applied using a reproducible stamp. The stamps conventionally include a holder and a stamp die that attaches to the holder. The stamp die includes a reverse image of the notational statement to be marked on the document. The reverse image of the notational statement often is formed in relief in a molded rubber sheet. Inked pads are used for applying an ink coating to the notational statement, which is then pressed against the document to transfer the ink and thus an image of the notational statement. Stamps widely used today however feature stamp dies or marking structures that include pre-inked microporous thermoplastic resin layers and absorbent backing layers. The microporous layer includes the stamp relief of the notational statement to be stamped. The ink communicates through the microporous layer to provide an ink coating on the notational statement for application to a document.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While such stamps are successful in marking documents, there are drawbacks to such devices. Some stamps use projecting knobs for gripping by hand during the stamping process. These knob-type stamps however are awkward to hold. Other stamps have detachable covers over the stamp die. These covers tend to become misplaced leading to die exposure and accidental marking.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a self-contained hand-stamping device readily movable from a closed position to an open position for stamping. It is to such that the present invention is directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention meets the need in the art by providing a hand stamp for selectively positioning a stamp image for marking articles, comprising a housing that defines an interior channel and a window with a carrier received within the channel and movable relative to the housing from a first position to a second position, and a stamp body attached to the carrier and configured with a stamp image configured for receiving a coating of an ink from a supply for communicating the stamp image to an article upon pressing application against the article with the carrier in the second position aligning the stamp image with the window of the housing, with the first position enclosing the stamp image remotely non-aligned with the window within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent upon reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings and the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals indicate like parts, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates in perspective exploded view a first embodiment of a stamp <b>20</b> according to the present invention. The stamp <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>22</b> that defines an interior channel <b>24</b> and a window <b>26</b>. The housing <b>22</b> assembles from two opposing shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> that define matingly engageable edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The housing <b>22</b> defines an interior opening <b>28</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment is circular. The opening <b>28</b> is likewise defined by interior portions of the shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> having edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> are spaced-apart when the shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are engaged to define a slot <b>33</b>. Opposing portions <b>42</b> of the edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> each define spaced projections <b>44</b> and a intermediate recess <b>46</b>. The projections <b>44</b> and the recess <b>46</b> cooperatively define a detent, for a purpose discussed below. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing <b>22</b> is substantially disc shaped with an arcuate perimeter sidewall <b>47</b> and opposing substantially planar sides <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The channel <b>24</b> receives a carrier <b>50</b>. The carrier <b>50</b>, as discussed below, is moveable within the channel <b>24</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b> from a first position to a second position. The carrier <b>50</b> includes an interior guide or flange <b>52</b>. The guide flange <b>52</b> is received in the slot <b>33</b> defined by the edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. Opposing projections <b>54</b> extend from the guide flange <b>52</b>. The projections <b>54</b> bearingly pass over the respective projections <b>44</b> and are received in the respective recesses <b>46</b> to align the carrier <b>50</b> relative to the window <b>26</b> for operating the stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The carrier <b>50</b> includes at least one planar surface <b>56</b> that defines a cavity <b>58</b> for receiving a conventional stamp die <b>60</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the stamp die <b>60</b> is a pre-inked stamp pad having an image layer <b>62</b> and an ink absorbent layer <b>64</b>. The image layer <b>62</b> defines a relief of a notational statement in a conventional microporous ink-retaining thermoplastic resin pad. The ink absorbent layer <b>64</b> includes a supply of ink. The ink communicates through the image layer <b>62</b> for stamping. The stamp <b>20</b> can also gainfully use conventional rubber stamp pads that use separate ink pads for inking the relief to be stamped.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A guide member <b>66</b> engages the guide flange <b>52</b>. The guide member <b>66</b> includes a projecting block <b>68</b> and opposing spaced-apart pins <b>70</b>. The block <b>68</b> connects by being received in a slot or opening in the guide flange <b>52</b> and the pins <b>70</b> engage holes in the carrier <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the stamp <b>20</b> in perspective view. The housing <b>22</b> in this illustrated embodiment comprises a torus or doughnut-shaped housing with a planar window <b>26</b> or opening defined by a chord plane extending across a portion of the housing <b>22</b>. The carrier <b>50</b> likewise defines a toric body received in the housing <b>22</b>. The exterior surface of the housing <b>22</b> selectively includes an indicia <b>82</b> representing the stamp image. For example, the indicia <b>82</b> can be the text “copy” for a stamp image to mark the word “copy” on an article. In an alternate embodiment, the housing <b>22</b> has opposing side walls that provide a suitable substantially planar surface for printing graphics, labeling, or other text information.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates in perspective sectional view the stamp <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The mating shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> define the slot <b>33</b> between the opposing edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> on an interior of the housing <b>22</b>. The guide flange <b>52</b> of the carrier <b>50</b> travels in the slot <b>33</b>. The guide member <b>66</b> attached to the guide flange <b>52</b> facilitates moving the carrier <b>50</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b> from the first position with the stamp pad <b>60</b> received enclosingly within the housing and not aligned with the window <b>26</b> and the second position with the stamp pad <b>60</b> aligned within the window <b>26</b> for operation of the stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates in detailed sectional view the projections <b>44</b> and the recesses <b>46</b> on the edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> that receive the projections <b>54</b> of the guide flange <b>52</b>, as a detent for holding the carrier <b>50</b> in the second position with the stamp pad <b>60</b> aligned in the window <b>26</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. A similar detent structure can be included in an opposing portion of the housing for holding the stamp pad <b>60</b> in the first position for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the toric housing <b>22</b> of the stamp <b>20</b> in sectional view taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with the carrier <b>50</b> disposed for a travel in the channel <b>24</b>. The guide member <b>66</b> attaches to the guide flange <b>52</b> with the block <b>68</b> and the pins <b>70</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the guide member <b>66</b> in the illustrated embodiment is a saddle-shaped member having opposing sides that extend arcuately adjacent the exterior of the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the stamp <b>20</b> with the guide member <b>66</b> moved to the second position with the stamp pad <b>60</b> aligned in the window <b>26</b> for marking operation. In this position, the detent is operative. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the projections <b>54</b> are received in the recesses <b>46</b> between the aligned opposing projections <b>44</b> extending from the opposing edges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> of the shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates in perspective sectional view a second embodiment of the stamp <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the carrier <b>50</b> includes spaced-apart rails <b>80</b> that project outwardly through the cavity <b>24</b> to short of the interior surface of the shells <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The rails <b>80</b> guide the rotation of the carrier <b>50</b> in the channel <b>24</b> of the housing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further illustrates the guide member <b>66</b> in an alternate embodiment as a loop <b>66</b><i>a </i>extending from the flange <b>52</b> inwardly of the opening <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates in sectional view a third embodiment of the stamp <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the carrier <b>50</b> defines three planar surfaces <b>56</b> (denoted <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, and <b>56</b><i>c</i>) each having a cavity <b>58</b> (denoted <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>and <b>58</b><i>c</i>) for receiving a stamp pad <b>60</b> (denoted <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>h </i>and <b>60</b><i>c</i>) each having a respective image layer <b>62</b> (denoted <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>62</b><i>c</i>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>, the exterior wall of the housing <b>22</b> includes an indicia <b>82</b>, such as text or graphic, of the stamp on the image film <b>62</b>. Rotation of the guide member <b>66</b> into alignment with one of the respective indicia <b>82</b> indicates that the respective stamp pad <b>60</b> is aligned with the window <b>26</b>. In this embodiment, the edges <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> include three sets of detent elements including the projections <b>44</b> and recess <b>46</b> for holding the selective stamp image in the window <b>26</b>. The guide member <b>66</b> upon aligning with the indicia <b>82</b> provides a pointer indicating which of the stamp pads is positioned for marking articles. This embodiment also illustrates an opening <b>84</b> in the side walls of the guide member <b>66</b>. The indicia <b>82</b> is viewable in the opening <b>84</b> upon alignment of the stamp pad <b>60</b> in the window <b>26</b>. The planar walls <b>49</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a surface for printing of labels or graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hand stamp <b>20</b> described above, and illustrated in several embodiments selectively operates to position the stamp image <b>62</b> carried by the stamp pad <b>60</b> within the window <b>26</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates in side perspective view the stamp <b>10</b> in an operative position for selecting the stamp image <b>62</b> to align in the window <b>26</b> of the stamp housing <b>22</b> for use as a stamp, with a hand of a user illustrated in phantom and the thumb positioned adjacent an exterior portion of the housing <b>22</b>, the index finger extending through the opening <b>28</b> in alignment with the guide member <b>66</b>, and the other fingers on an opposing exterior portion of the housing. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>10</b>, the housing <b>22</b> is picked up by hand, with the index finger positioned in the curved guide member <b>66</b> with the thumb bearing on an outer surface of the housing <b>22</b>. The thumb is extended while in contact with the surface of the housing <b>22</b>. This causes the housing <b>22</b> to rotate relative to the carrier <b>50</b> held by the index finger pressing against the guide member <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The thumb is released from contact with the surface of the housing <b>22</b> and retracted and with bending the tip of the thumb is brought into bearing contact with another portion of the housing <b>22</b>. The thumb is extended again to rotate the housing <b>22</b> relative to the carrier <b>50</b>. This action is repeated until the stamp pad <b>60</b> becomes aligned with the window <b>26</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. The projections <b>54</b> of the guide flange <b>52</b> flexingly bypass the projections <b>44</b> of the detent. The projections <b>54</b> are received in the recess <b>46</b>. This holds the carrier <b>50</b> with the selected stamp pad <b>60</b> aligned in the window <b>26</b>. The housing <b>22</b> is then rotated so that the stamp pad <b>60</b> faces a document to be marked. The housing <b>22</b> is brought into contact with the document. The ink communicates from the ink pad <b>64</b> to the image film <b>62</b>, and transfers to the document.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon completion of marking documents with the stamp <b>20</b>, the thumb again is positioned on the housing <b>22</b> and extended to rotate the stamp pad <b>60</b> from alignment in the window <b>26</b> and inwardly enclosingly within the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is to be appreciated with respect to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> that movement of the housing <b>22</b> relative to the guide members <b>66</b> enables orienting the selected one of the stamp pad <b>60</b> in the window <b>26</b>. When the guide member <b>66</b> aligns with the indices <b>78</b> on the sidewall of the housing <b>22</b>, the associated stamp pad <b>60</b> is aligned with the opening <b>26</b> for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The toric housing <b>22</b> with the enclosed toric carrier <b>50</b> facilitates the operation of the stamp <b>20</b>, but is not a limiting feature, in that the housing may have various ornamental configurations. Further, the carrier <b>50</b> can be a movable belt disposed within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The foregoing specification describes the present invention that provides the hand-held housing that encloses the stamp member readily movable between the enclosed position and the exposed position for hand stamping. It is to be understood, however, that numerous changes and variations may be made in the construction of the converter within the spirit and scope of the present invention and that modifications and changes may be made therein without departing from the scope thereof as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
