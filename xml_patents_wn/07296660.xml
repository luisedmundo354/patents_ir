<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to elevators and more particularly to an elevator adapted for moving a person between two levels in a building.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Essentially every commercial building having more than one floor is equipped with a commercial elevator system. High-rise buildings have fast cable lifted elevators that are very complicated and expensive due to the necessary controls and safety features. In low-rise buildings, hydraulic elevators are often used and are normally very slow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Commercial units are designed to serve multiple floors by simply adding necessary electronics and mechanical components to allow the desired number of stops. These designs must be able to locate each floor and stop precisely at the same point independent of the load being carried. They must also travel relatively slowly in order to minimize the jolting sensation at start and stop. Although some designs allow for a ‘soft’ start (the electric motor power is ramped up and down at start and stop), the travel rate must still be relatively slow for safety reasons. The electronics required to locate each floor are costly as are the mechanical brakes necessary to hold the car on each floor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Elevators available for personal residences are typically scaled down versions of commercial elevators. By replicating the design of smaller commercial units, residential elevators retain those units inherent inefficiency when applied to a two-stop application. They are typically expensive and slow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need has been recognized for a simplified elevator system for the typical two-story residence. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,374 discloses an elevator system for a two-story building having two carriages mounted in a counterbalanced arrangement and both supported and moved by a pair of chains driven by a sprocket system. This arrangement shares many of the characteristics of commercial cable and drum lifted elevators including the need for controls to stop the carriages at the two floor levels, a braking system and safety features to allow a person to release doors in event of failure of the system.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An elevator for transporting a person between two floors of a building includes at least one carriage and a lifting system including a rotating lever arm and means for converting the rotational motion of the arm to vertical lifting motion of the carriage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a primary lever arm is rotated by an electric motor, preferably with a gearbox. A first end of the primary lever arm rotates on a primary shaft fixed to the building. A first sprocket wheel is fixed to the primary lever arm and concentric with and rotates on the primary shaft. A second sprocket wheel is coupled to the motor output shaft and is coupled by a chain belt to the first sprocket wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the rotating lever arm is an articulated lever arm including the primary lever arm and a secondary lever arm. The primary lever arm has a secondary shaft on a second end around which a first end of the secondary lever arm rotates. A third sprocket wheel is concentric to the primary shaft and fixed to the building and is coupled by a chain belt to a fourth sprocket wheel concentric to the secondary shaft and fixed to the secondary arm. The third sprocket wheel has twice as many sprockets or cogs as the fourth sprocket wheel. A lifting coupling, preferably a shaft, is carried on a second end of the secondary lever arm and is coupled to the carriage to move the carriage vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the rotating lever arm comprises only the primary lever arm. The secondary shaft becomes the lifting coupling or lifting shaft. In this embodiment, the lifting coupling is coupled to the carriage by a pivot bar or a slide rail to compensate for curved motion of the lifting shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the elevator includes two carriages coupled together by a cable and pulley system. When one carriage is located at one floor level, the other is located at a second floor level and vice versa. The disclosed lift system directly moves one carriage and the other carriage is moved through the cable and pulley system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A method of operating a residential elevator includes a control system and door sensors detecting the opening and closing of doors covering a hoist way, which may also be referred to as an elevator shaft, in which the carriage travels between floors. The control system detects a first opening and closing of a door in front of the carriage and activates a lift system to move the carriage to an opposite floor, e.g. from a first floor to a second floor. Upon detecting a second opening and closing of a door in front of the carriage, the control system places the lift system in a standby state. Upon detecting a third opening and closing of a door in front of the carriage, the control system again activates the lift system to move the carriage to an opposite floor, e.g. from a second floor to a first floor.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of elevators according to the present invention provide a means for transporting a person vertically between two levels. Generally this is referred to herein as moving a person between two floors, typically a first floor and a second floor of a building, typically a residence. In some countries this would be referred to as moving between the ground floor and the first floor, i.e. the first floor above the ground floor. However, the two levels or floors may be a basement and a ground floor, or a second and third floor or attic. The two floors do not have to be immediately adjacent, e.g. the two floors could be a first floor and a third floor or attic without a stop on an intermediate second floor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are front and side views, respectively, of the basic components of an elevator according to one embodiment. A first carriage <b>2</b> is shown positioned at a first floor level <b>4</b> and a second carriage <b>6</b> is shown positioned at a second floor level <b>8</b>. The carriages are in hoist way <b>9</b> extending from the first floor level <b>4</b> to the second floor level <b>8</b>. The two carriages <b>2</b>,<b>6</b> are connected together by a cable or wire rope <b>10</b> that is supported by a pair of pulleys <b>12</b> at the top of the system. The two carriages <b>2</b> and <b>6</b> counterbalance each other. The carriages will always move in opposite directions so that when one is located at the first floor <b>4</b> the other will be located at the top floor <b>8</b>. In other embodiments, the carriage <b>2</b> may be replaced with a simple counterweight to save space, although certain benefits of the two-carriage arrangement will be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the wire rope <b>10</b> comprises two separate wire ropes, each sufficiently strong to support the weight of a carriage <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> and an occupant. The second wire rope may be slightly longer than the first and act as a safety back up in case of failure of the first. If the length of the second rope is selected properly, in event of failure of the first rope, the carriage <b>2</b> may contact the bottom of hoist way <b>9</b> each time it moves down to the first floor level <b>4</b>. The resulting bump or jerk would be a signal to a user that there is a problem that requires a service call, i.e. to replace the failed wire rope. Alternatively, the wire ropes <b>10</b> may be of equal length if they are coupled to at least one of the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> with a pivot so that upon failure of one rope <b>10</b> the effective length of the rope plus pivot would increase.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, in one embodiment, a pair of safety platforms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are provided for the two carriages <b>2</b> and <b>6</b> respectively. When a carriage is located at the upper floor, the safety platform rests on top of the carriage and is carried up with it, as shown for safety platform <b>16</b> on top of carriage <b>6</b>. When a carriage moves down to the first floor, the safety platform catches on the second floor <b>8</b> level as platform <b>14</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. If a person should accidentally enter the second floor space above a carriage on the first floor, the safety platform prevents the person from dropping down on top of the carriage on the first floor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the safety platforms <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are shown having structural ribs <b>18</b> that extend across and under the platforms and extend a short distance beyond the edges of the platforms <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The ends of the ribs <b>18</b> engage crossbars <b>20</b> located at the second floor <b>8</b> level. The cross bars <b>20</b> are connected to vertical rails <b>22</b> that guide the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. The ribs <b>18</b> and cross bars <b>20</b> position the safety platforms <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> at the second floor <b>8</b> level when the respective carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> are located at the first floor <b>4</b> level. Holes <b>24</b> are provided in the safety platforms <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> to accommodate the supporting cables <b>10</b> and allow the cables to move through the platforms as the carriage moves down to the first floor <b>4</b> level.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is preferred that the safety platforms <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> be made of a transparent or translucent material such as clear or white Plexiglas or Lexan. In this embodiment, light fixtures <b>26</b> are provided at the top of each hoist way. The top of each carriage <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> is either open or made of transparent or translucent material to allow light from the fixtures <b>26</b> to illuminate the interior of the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. The transparent or translucent safety panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> allow light to pass through from the fixture <b>26</b> to the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. This arrangement avoids the need to provide electrical power to the carriages for lighting, which would require a moving electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second embodiment of the safety platforms would be platforms hinged to the side or rear of the hoist way <b>9</b> and flush with the top of the second level floor when in a lowered position. The platforms would be slotted to pass by the carriage lifting cables <b>10</b>. The platforms would flip up as a carriage moves from the lower level to the upper level and down as the carriage passes and moves to the lower level.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As an alternative to the safety platforms <b>14</b>,<b>16</b>, automatic door locks may be provided to prevent opening of doors when there is no carriage behind the doors or when the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> are in motion.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The elevator system of this embodiment includes four generally conventional residential interior doors which close on and cover the hoist way <b>9</b>, two on the first floor <b>4</b> and two on the second floor <b>8</b>. The doors preferably have spring-loaded hinges that hold the doors in a closed position unless a user pulls or pushes the doors open. In addition, a magnetic strip may be fixed to the leading inside edge of each door that will be attracted to vertical guide rails <b>22</b> to minimize door bounce and assist in holding each door in a closed position, preferably with sufficient force to deter small children from opening the doors. No latches are needed to hold the doors closed, but may be used if desired. The doors are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since they would cover all of the other elements of the system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a door <b>28</b> is shown on the first floor <b>4</b> closed in front of the carriage <b>2</b>, and a door <b>30</b> is shown on the second floor closed in front of the open hoist way <b>9</b> above carriage <b>2</b>. The system also includes four sensors, one for each of the four doors, to detect whether the doors are closed or open. Each sensor may be a magnetically actuated switch with each door carrying a magnet to actuate the switch. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a sensor <b>32</b> is shown for door <b>28</b> and sensor <b>34</b> is shown for door <b>30</b>. It is preferred that the back side of each door <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> be smooth and aligned with a smooth inner wall surface <b>29</b> extending between the top of door <b>28</b> and the bottom of door <b>30</b>. With this alignment and smooth surfaces, there are no edges on which a person's hand, foot, clothing, etc. could catch as the carriages <b>2</b> and <b>6</b> move between the two floors.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A light or other visual indicator is provided above each of the four doors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> an indicator light <b>36</b> is shown above door <b>28</b> and an indicator light <b>38</b> is shown above door <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the indicator light <b>36</b> would be turned on to indicate that the system is activated and that the carriage <b>2</b> is positioned behind door <b>28</b>, ready for use. The light <b>38</b> would not be activated because there is no carriage in the space behind door <b>30</b>. In this position, the carriage <b>6</b> is on the second floor and the light above its second floor door would be illuminated. Thus when the system is activated, one light on each floor will be on to indicate that the system is operating and to indicate which door has a carriage available behind it. While the carriages are in motion from floor to floor, all indicator lights will be off to indicate such movement and the fact that no carriage is available for use.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other electrical controls are also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and are described in detail below. These include an electrical control panel <b>40</b> that contains many of the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A reset button <b>42</b> is provided above the main floor doors to reset the system in the event one of the safety systems detects a problem and deactivates the control system. An electric motor <b>44</b> is provided for driving a lever arm lift system <b>46</b> to move the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> between the floors <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>. An upper limit switch <b>48</b> is provided for detecting when the lever system <b>46</b> reaches an upper position and a lower limit switch <b>50</b> is provided for detecting when the lever system reaches a lower position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate details of the structure of an articulated lever lift system <b>46</b> used in one embodiment. This lift system converts rotary motion into linear motion to move the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> vertically. The lift system <b>46</b> is supported on a wall <b>52</b> of a building, preferably by a steel frame <b>54</b> attached to the wall <b>52</b>. A primary shaft <b>56</b> is fixed to the frame <b>54</b> and thereby to the building. A primary arm <b>58</b> and a first sprocket wheel <b>60</b> rotate on the shaft <b>56</b>. The first sprocket wheel <b>60</b> is fixed to the arm <b>58</b> and rotates with it. A first chain belt <b>62</b> extends around the first sprocket wheel <b>60</b> and also engages a second sprocket wheel <b>64</b> connected to an output shaft of the motor <b>44</b>. It is preferred to have a speed-reducing gearbox <b>66</b> between the motor <b>44</b> and the sprocket wheel <b>64</b> to slow the output speed and increase available torque. Second sprocket wheel <b>64</b> is smaller than the first sprocket <b>60</b>, thereby providing rotary speed reduction and increased torque, in addition to that provided by the gear box <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, an output shaft of a drive motor and gearbox combination may be connected directly to the primary arm <b>58</b> to rotate it. The first and second sprocket wheels <b>60</b>, <b>64</b> and chain belt <b>62</b> could be eliminated. However, this requires a larger, stronger, and more expensive gearbox <b>66</b>. In other embodiments, the primary arm <b>58</b> can be rotated by a hydraulic cylinder, an air driven cylinder, or any other motor or machine capable of moving the primary arm, all of which are considered motive force generators for the purpose of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A secondary shaft <b>68</b> is fixed on an end of primary arm <b>58</b> opposite from the primary shaft <b>56</b>. A third sprocket wheel <b>70</b>, concentric with the primary shaft <b>56</b> and fixed to frame <b>54</b>, does not rotate on the shaft <b>56</b> and therefore does not rotate relative to frame <b>54</b> and the building wall <b>52</b>. A secondary arm <b>72</b> and a fourth sprocket wheel <b>74</b> rotate on the secondary shaft <b>68</b>. The fourth sprocket wheel <b>74</b> is fixed to the arm <b>72</b> and rotates with it. A second chain belt <b>71</b> is carried on the third and fourth sprocket wheels <b>70</b>, <b>74</b>. A third shaft <b>76</b>, also referred to as a lifting shaft, is fixed to an end of secondary arm <b>72</b> opposite the shaft <b>68</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third shaft <b>76</b> engages a link <b>78</b> attached to the carriage <b>6</b>, to move the carriage <b>6</b> between the first floor level <b>4</b> and the second floor level <b>8</b>. As discussed above, movement of the carriage <b>6</b> also moves the carriage <b>2</b> by way of the cables <b>10</b> and pulleys <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts the path of travel of the lifting shaft <b>76</b> as primary arm <b>58</b> rotates clockwise from vertical in 22.5-degree increments. In this embodiment, the primary arm <b>58</b> and secondary arm <b>72</b> are of equal effective length. The effective length of each arm is defined as the distance between pivot points on the arms. For example, the effective length of primary arm <b>58</b> is the distance between the center point of primary shaft <b>56</b> and the center point of secondary shaft <b>68</b>. The effective length of the secondary arm <b>72</b> is the distance between the center point of secondary shaft <b>68</b> and the center point of lifting shaft <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As primary arm <b>58</b> rotates clockwise, secondary arm <b>72</b> will rotate counterclockwise an amount equal to double the primary arm rotation relative to the primary arm <b>58</b>. This doubling of the degrees of rotation is caused by third sprocket wheel <b>70</b> having a diameter double the diameter, and therefore double the number of sprockets or cogs, as fourth sprocket wheel <b>74</b>. Third sprocket wheel <b>70</b> is fixed to frame <b>54</b> of the lift mechanism, that is it does not rotate relative to the frame <b>54</b>, Fourth sprocket wheel <b>74</b> is solidly attached to secondary arm <b>72</b> and rotates about the second shaft <b>68</b> connected to primary arm <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> at position <b>80</b>, as primary arm <b>58</b> rotates 22.5 degrees clockwise, secondary arm <b>72</b> will rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. In position <b>82</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 45 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. In position <b>84</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 67.5 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 135 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. In position <b>86</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 90 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b> and both arms are horizontal. In position <b>88</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 112.5 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 225 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. In position <b>90</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 135 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. In position <b>92</b>, the primary arm <b>58</b> has rotated 157.5 degrees clockwise from vertical, and the secondary arm <b>72</b> has rotated 315 degrees counterclockwise in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. When the primary arm <b>58</b> rotates 180 degrees to its lowermost vertical position, the secondary arm <b>72</b> will have rotated 360 degrees in relationship to primary arm <b>58</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the primary and secondary arms are of equal length, the secondary arm lifting shaft <b>76</b> travels in a straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also depicts how the lifting shaft <b>76</b>, and thus the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> will continuously accelerate through the first 90 degrees of primary arm <b>58</b> rotation and continuously decelerate during the second 90 degrees of primary arm <b>58</b> rotation. In this embodiment, the effective length of the primary and secondary arms <b>58</b>, <b>72</b> are both 27 inches for a combined length of 54 inches and results in a total lift distance of double that or 108 inches or 9 feet. This would be the required lift distance for a building with 8 foot lower level ceiling height plus one foot for the upper level floor thickness. That is, the distance between first floor level <b>4</b> and second floor level <b>8</b> would be nine feet.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during the first 22.5 degrees of primary arm rotation in a system with eight-foot lower level ceiling height, the connecting point <b>76</b> and thus carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> will move vertically approximately 3.9″. During the second 22.5 degrees of primary arm rotation or at 45 degrees, the connecting point <b>76</b> will move approximately 11.8″. During the next 22.5 degrees of primary arm rotation, the connecting point <b>76</b> will travel approximately 17.1″. During the last 22.5 degree segment of the first 90 degrees of primary arm rotation, the connecting point will travel 21.2″. During this initial 90 degrees of primary arm rotation, the connecting point, and thus the carriages, will travel 54″ or one half their total travel. Thus, the connecting point continuously accelerates as the primary arm <b>58</b> rotates through the first 90 degrees, since the distance traveled during each segment increases over the previous segment. As the primary arm <b>58</b> rotates through its second 90 degrees, the connecting point continuously decelerates to come to a smooth jolt free stop.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiment, the motor <b>44</b> is a substantially constant speed motor and therefore rotates the arm <b>58</b> at a substantially constant angular velocity. The speed may change somewhat in response to changing loads. The arms <b>58</b> and <b>72</b> convert the substantially constant angular velocity of the motor <b>44</b> and shaft <b>58</b> to variable speed vertical motion of the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. The motor <b>44</b> experiences very little loading at start up since the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> move only a short distance during the first few degrees of rotation of the lever arm <b>58</b>. The low starting load may in crease the lifetime of the motor <b>44</b> and the various mechanical components of the lifting system <b>46</b>. The low starting load also allows the motor to accelerate quickly to its substantially constant speed at start up.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In alternative embodiments, the motor <b>44</b> could be driven at a variable speed. For example, the motor <b>44</b> may be driven with a variable frequency drive, VFD, that changes motor speed by changing frequency. A VFD device may be used in place of the motor starters, for example down motor starter <b>96</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at little or no increase in cost. A VFD would allow the motor to be started and stopped smoothly by ramping the frequency up and down at the start and stop points, while allowing the motor to be operated at higher speed throughout the majority of the elevator travel. The net result is expected to be reduced overall time of travel without noticeable jolts at the start and stop.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the drive motor may have three operating regions, a start up or speed up region, a primary drive region and a stop or slow down region. In the start up region, the motor speed may increase from zero to a preselected maximum speed, by ramping up the frequency of the VFD from zero to a frequency that provides the preselected maximum speed. During the primary drive region, the motor speed may be maintained substantially constant at the preselected maximum speed by maintaining the frequency of the VFD at the frequency that provides the preselected maximum speed. In the stop region, the motor speed may decrease from the preselected maximum speed to zero by ramping down the frequency of the VFD from the frequency that provides the preselected maximum speed to zero. The start up and stop regions may comprise a small part of total drive range of the motor, for example about ten percent of the total drive range. The primary drive region may therefore comprise about ninety percent of the total drive range. The lever arms <b>58</b>, <b>72</b> will still provide the acceleration and deceleration functions during all three regions of motor operation and will provide high speed elevator travel in the middle of the primary range.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The lift mechanism of this embodiment provides an advantage in terms of the time required to move a person from one floor to another. Since it accelerates continuously from the start to the midpoint of travel and then decelerates from the midpoint to the end of travel, much higher speed can be attained without the user experiencing a sudden jolt at the start and stop points. In one embodiment, the nine feet of travel can occur smooth and jolt free in less than five seconds. In this embodiment, the carriages pass through the midpoint of travel at a maximum speed of 174 feet per minute, whereas many conventional residential elevators travel at a maximum speed of about twenty to about forty feet per minute. The maximum speed may be increased by use of a VFD as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic of an electrical system for controlling operation of the embodiment illustrated in the other figures. Parts that correspond to parts shown on the other figures are identified by the same reference numbers. The dashed line box <b>40</b> contains electrical components that are located in the control panel <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The basic operation of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>7</b> and assuming that a person on the first floor level <b>4</b> desires to move to the second floor level <b>8</b>. With carriage <b>2</b> located at the first floor level <b>4</b>, the indicator light <b>36</b> will be turned on and the user wilt know that carriage <b>2</b> is behind door <b>28</b>, ready for use. The user will pull door <b>28</b> open and enter the carriage <b>2</b>. Opening of the door <b>28</b> causes door switch <b>32</b>, the lower left door switch, to change position, which in turn toggles alternating relay <b>94</b> which sets the down motor starter relay <b>96</b> in a ready position. When the door <b>28</b> closes, the door switch <b>32</b> changes position again and the down motor starter relay <b>96</b> activates motor <b>44</b> to drive the lift system <b>46</b> and move the carriage <b>6</b> down to the first floor level <b>4</b> and connecting cables move carriage <b>2</b> up to the second floor <b>8</b>. When the primary arm <b>58</b> contacts the down limit switch <b>50</b>, the motor <b>44</b> stops. The user is then on the second level <b>8</b> and simply pushes the door <b>30</b> open and exits the carriage <b>2</b>. Upon opening the door <b>30</b>, the upper level door switch <b>34</b> causes the alternating relay <b>94</b> to change position, to an inactive position in which the motor starter cannot activate and thus motor <b>44</b> will not operate. Opening door <b>30</b> and activating switch <b>34</b> also switches latching relay <b>95</b> to ready the control system for the reverse or up travel of the lift system <b>46</b> and also turns on the indicator light <b>38</b> indicating that the carriage <b>2</b> is now behind door <b>30</b> and ready for use. Likewise, the carriage <b>6</b> is then on the first floor <b>4</b> and an indicator light above its door on the first floor turns on indicating that carriage <b>6</b> is ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At all times when the elevator is not being used, i.e. not occupied and moving, the two carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> will be ready, one on each floor. The user merely opens the door on his level that has an indicator light on, enters the carriage and closes the door. The user is then transported automatically to the other level and may exit by simply pushing the door open.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed above, the door switches, including switches <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, provide the signals to the control system indicating that a user has entered a carriage and is to be transported. The door switches also provide several safety functions and activate two relays that control the lighting system. If any of the doors are opened while the motor <b>44</b> is operating, the power safety relay <b>98</b> is deactivated and disconnects power from the entire control system including motor <b>44</b>, bringing the system to a stop. A person in a carriage <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> may exit by pushing either door open and crawling or climbing out. To restart the system, all four doors must be closed and the reset switch <b>42</b> must be manually actuated. Thus, the system cannot be started while someone is exiting a carriage through one of the doors. The switch <b>42</b> is preferably placed high and out of reach of children.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the system is not operating, i.e. not moving carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> between floors, and someone opens one of the two doors that do not have a light on, the power safety relay <b>98</b> is also deactivated and disconnects power from the control system. If this happens, the user should check behind all doors to be sure no one has entered the spaces where no carriage is located before actuating the reset switch.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The embodiments of the present invention may provide a number of advantages. As noted above, the movement of the carriages has no sudden starts and stops, i.e. no sudden accelerations. Instead, it is constantly accelerated during the first half of the travel distance and decelerates during the second half of travel. This also allows an overall high speed of travel that provides a very short time to move between floors. Despite the high speed, the user does not experience any jolts or jerks typical of many elevators.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since in the preferred embodiment, the design is only applicable between 2 levels, no controls or other electrical elements are needed in the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. This avoids the complexity and cost of providing power and signal lines that can move with the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> as they move between floors.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">No braking systems are needed. When the lifting system <b>46</b> stops at either the bottom or top, the lift system <b>46</b> has a tremendous mechanical advantage that prevents any downward movement of either carriage <b>2</b> or <b>6</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the up limit switch <b>48</b> and down limit switch <b>50</b> are positioned to allow the primary arm <b>58</b> to move slightly past top or bottom dead center. Mechanical stops are provided to prevent any further movement. Any force tending to move the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> would drive the arm <b>58</b> against the mechanical stop and thus further eliminate the need for a mechanical brake to hold the carriages at their respective positions.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The overall distance or length of travel is determined by the effective length of the primary arm <b>58</b> plus the effective length of secondary arm <b>72</b>. It is equal to two times the sum of the effective lengths of the arms. The combined length of the arms can therefore be selected to accommodate any ceiling height, e.g. the eight to twelve foot ceilings available in many residences. However, once the dimensions of the residence are known, it is straightforward to select the lengths of the arms to provide precisely the right distance of travel for the residence. By proper positioning of the lift mechanism <b>46</b>, the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> will be aligned with both floors.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is not required that the two arms <b>58</b> and <b>72</b> be exactly the same effective length. When they are the same length, the shaft <b>76</b> moves in a vertical substantially straight line as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If the arms are of different lengths, the shaft <b>76</b> will move in a curved path, with the amount of curve depending on the relative lengths. As a limiting case, if arm <b>72</b> and associated sprocket wheels are eliminated and secondary shaft <b>68</b> replaces or becomes lifting shaft <b>76</b>, the path would be a complete half circle. In general, this case is not practical since arm <b>58</b> would need to be 54 inches long or longer and would not fit in a space corresponding to the depth of the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>. However, in some embodiments the link <b>78</b> connecting shaft <b>76</b> to carriage <b>6</b> is pivotally connected to carriage <b>6</b>. That is, a lower end of the link <b>78</b> is carried on another shaft connected to the carriage <b>6</b>. This type of link <b>78</b> is preferred to compensate for any misalignment of parts upon installation. If the arms <b>58</b>, <b>72</b> are not of exactly equal length, or are intentionally made of unequal length, then the link <b>78</b> will pivot to compensate for any curved movement of the shaft <b>76</b>. The link <b>78</b> is also easily replaceable, or may have multiple pivot holes to allow adjustment of the position of the carriage if the lifting mechanism <b>46</b> is not installed at precisely the correct vertical position. By using a pivoted: link <b>78</b> that accommodates limited curved movement of the shaft <b>76</b>, the length of the secondary arm <b>72</b> can be adjusted to compensate for non-standard dimensions of the building.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If only one lever arm is used, its effective length would need to be 54 inches for a building with an eight foot first floor ceiling. It would have to be even longer for higher first floor ceilings. Normally this length is greater than the depth of the hoist way <b>9</b> and the lift system <b>46</b> would not fit on the side of the hoist way <b>9</b>. In this case, the lift system may be placed behind the carriages <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>, since the hoist way <b>9</b> has a width sufficient to accommodate both carriages <b>2</b> and <b>6</b>. The link <b>78</b> would be attached to the back of carriage <b>6</b>. As an alternative to the link <b>78</b>, a horizontal cross rail may be attached to the back of carriage <b>2</b> or <b>6</b>. The lifting shaft <b>76</b> may be coupled to the cross rail, e.g. with roller bearings, to accommodate the horizontal motion of the lifting shaft as it travels through a half circle path. The articulated lever arm lift system <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> is preferred primarily because it can be located at the side of a carriage <b>6</b> and provides a lifting shaft that moves substantially in a straight line. Also, in higher lift situations, more than two arms may be used to minimize lift depth.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Regardless of whether the lever arm is a single lever arm or an articulated lever arm, the lifting system <b>46</b> comprises a mechanical system that is capable of converting constant velocity rotational motion to vertical lifting motion with variable velocity that starts and stops with essentially zero velocity and accelerates and decelerates between the starting and stopping points to provide an overall high speed movement without any noticeable starting or stopping jolts or jerks. The lever arm system <b>46</b> may also work with a variable speed motor as discussed above to provide even higher speed movement over most of the travel distance while having a soft start and stop.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the present invention has been illustrated and described with respect to certain embodiments, it is apparent that various modifications can be made thereto and various other parts could be substituted for those shown herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
