<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/207,656, filed Jul. 26, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,390,104. The entire teachings of the above application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In automotive applications, sometimes electrical terminals are soldered to a surface, for example, a windshield, by an automated soldering machine. Typically, the electrical terminals are supplied to the automated soldering machine by a vibratory feeder. The vibratory feeder has a bowl into which a large supply of the electrical terminals are dumped. The vibratory feeder then moves the electrical terminals from the bowl to the automated soldering machine by vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some applications, for example on windshields, small electrical terminals are desirable in order to provide maximum visibility as well as to provide a more pleasing appearance. However, some small electrical terminals, for example, those having a design with a base pad about 10 mm by 14 mm in size or smaller, and a blade connector extending therefrom, tend to lock together when dumped into the bowl of the vibratory feeder. Some of these electrical terminals can become so tenaciously locked together that even the vibrations from the vibratory feeder cannot separate the electrical terminals from each other. Such locking together of electrical terminals can cause jamming of the automated soldering machine when electrical terminals that are locked together are fed into the machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an electrical terminal which generally does not lock together with other electrical terminals in an inseparable manner, and therefore is suitable for feeding into an automated soldering machine by a vibratory feeder. The electrical terminal includes a generally planar base pad having two opposed legs and an intermediate portion. The base pad legs have proximal and distal ends and are joined at the proximal ends to the intermediate portion. The base pad legs are spaced apart from each other to form a gap between the legs. The base pad legs have inner edges facing each other which extend away from each other moving away from the proximal ends of the base pad legs to the distal ends. A connector arm having a neck extends upwardly from the intermediate portion of the base pad between the base pad legs and terminates in a blade connector for engaging with a mating terminal. The neck has a proximal end with a width that is less than the gap between the proximal ends of the base pad legs by about ½ mm to 3 mm. The neck has a narrowing section moving away from the proximal end of the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In preferred embodiments, the electrical terminal is formed of sheet metal. The inner edges of the base pad legs are angled outwardly about 4° relative to each other. The neck has side edges which are angled inwardly towards each other. Each side edge of the neck is angled about 5° from the inner edge of an adjacent base pad leg. The side edges of the neck, after angling towards each other, extend outwardly to form a pair of protrusions between the neck and the blade connector. Preferably, the proximal end of the neck has a width that is less than the gap between the proximal ends of the base pad legs by about 1 to 1¾ mm. The base pad legs and the intermediate portion have outer edges which are at right angles to each other. The base pad has an outer perimeter that is no greater than about 10 mm by 14 mm and is often 10 mm by 13 mm. The connector arm is bent upwardly from the intermediate portion of the base pad and then bent laterally away from the intermediate portion. The base pad has a bottom surface with at least one standoff. A layer of solder can be applied on the bottom surface of the base pad.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a design that is suitable for use with small electrical terminals having a base pad 10 mm by 14 mm and smaller which does not inseparably lock together with other terminals, and at the same time, when soldered to a surface, has a solder joint with a pull strength within desirable ranges.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, electrical terminal <b>10</b> is an embodiment of an electrical terminal in the present invention that can be fed into an automated soldering machine by a vibratory feeder without the electrical terminal <b>10</b> locking together with other adjacent electrical terminals <b>10</b> in an inseparable manner. Vibrations from the vibratory feeder are generally sufficient to separate most electrical terminals <b>10</b> from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Electrical terminal <b>10</b> is formed from sheet metal and includes a planar base pad <b>12</b> having two legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>with proximal <b>13</b><i>a </i>and distal <b>13</b><i>b </i>ends that are joined at the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>to opposite ends of an intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>with the outer edges of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>being at right angles to the outer edge of intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The base pad legs <b>12</b> are separated from each other by a gap <b>24</b>. The base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>have inner side edges <b>26</b> on opposite sides of the gap <b>24</b> which are angled away from each other moving from the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>towards the distal ends <b>13</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A connector arm <b>14</b> extends upwardly from the intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>of base pad <b>12</b> from a location starting between the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The connector arm <b>14</b> has a neck <b>22</b> extending from the intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>and a blade connector <b>30</b> extending from the neck <b>22</b> for engaging with a mating electrical connector. Opposed stop protrusions or tabs <b>28</b> are positioned between the neck <b>22</b> and the blade connector <b>30</b> to prevent advancement of the mating electrical connector past the blade connector <b>30</b>. Both the blade connector <b>30</b> and the base <b>23</b> of the neck <b>22</b> of connector arm <b>14</b> are narrower than the gap <b>24</b> at the location between the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>by a minimal amount of space. The neck <b>22</b> angles inwardly before widening to form stop tabs <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A series of standoffs <b>20</b> extend from the bottom surface of the base pad <b>12</b>. A layer of solder <b>18</b> covers the bottom surface <b>16</b> which in turn can be coated with flux. When heated during soldering, the layer of solder <b>18</b> reflows to solder the electrical terminal <b>10</b> to the desired surface, often automotive glass, with the standoffs <b>20</b> ensuring that at least a predetermined volume of solder <b>18</b> is maintained between the bottom surface <b>16</b> of the base pad <b>12</b> and the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Electrical terminal <b>10</b> has a design that allows electrical terminals <b>10</b> engaged with each other to separate relatively easily. The combination of the widening gap <b>24</b> between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the narrowing neck <b>22</b> provides sufficient clearance between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the neck <b>22</b> of connector arm <b>14</b> so that other electrical terminals <b>10</b> do not become inseparably wedged or jammed therebetween. In addition, the outwardly angled configuration of the inner side edges <b>26</b> of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>is a design that allows other electrical terminals <b>10</b> engaged between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>to slide easily off rather than remain entangled. One feature that makes this possible is that the inner side edges <b>26</b> are provided with smooth surfaces to promote sliding. Another feature is that the outwardly angled side edges <b>26</b> extend outwardly along the full length of the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>and are not able to retain other electrical terminals <b>10</b> therebetween as firmly as when side edges are parallel to each other, because the outwardly angled surfaces of side edges <b>26</b> allow more degrees of movement of objects therebetween than if the side edges <b>26</b> were to be parallel to each other. The outer edges of base pad <b>12</b> are smooth with rounded corners to further promote sliding of the electrical terminals <b>10</b> relative to each other instead of entanglement.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The gap <b>24</b> between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>is sized to be minimally larger than both the neck <b>22</b> and blade connector <b>30</b> of connector arm <b>14</b>, so that in combination with the outwardly angled inner side edges <b>26</b>, the neck <b>22</b> and blade connector <b>30</b> of other electrical terminals <b>10</b> cannot become wedged or jammed between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Providing the neck <b>22</b> with side edges <b>22</b><i>a </i>which angle towards each other, forms a narrowing section which increases clearances between the neck <b>22</b> and the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first electrical terminal <b>10</b>A can have a second electrical terminal <b>10</b>B nested thereon without the neck <b>22</b> of the second electrical terminal <b>10</b>B becoming wedged or jammed between the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the first electrical terminal <b>10</b>A. Such nesting can cause prior art electrical terminals to jam together.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Extending the neck <b>22</b> of connector arm <b>14</b> upwardly from the base pad <b>12</b> before extending the connector arm <b>14</b> outwardly provides enough clearance between the connector arm <b>14</b> and the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to prevent other electrical terminals <b>10</b> from wedging or jamming therebetween. In addition, the connector arm <b>14</b> is bent with smooth radiuses to provide surfaces that promote sliding of other electrical terminals <b>10</b> therefrom rather than catching or capturing of the other electrical terminals. Although the stop tabs <b>28</b> can extend wider than the gap <b>24</b> between base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the stop tabs <b>28</b> are positioned on the connector arm <b>14</b> far enough away from the base pad <b>12</b> so that the ability of stop tabs <b>28</b> to entangle with portions of other electrical terminals <b>10</b> is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The design of electrical terminal <b>10</b> is suited for small electrical connectors where the difference in width between the base pad <b>12</b> and connector arm <b>14</b> is not very large. In some embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the width of base pad <b>12</b> is only about 2 times larger than the width of blade connector <b>30</b>. As a result, with such a small footprint of base pad <b>12</b> in relation to the width of connector arm <b>14</b>, it is desirable to maximize the size or surface area of the base pad <b>12</b> to obtain a strong solder joint while at the same time have a design that does not cause inseparable locking between electrical terminals <b>10</b>. This becomes difficult when the footprint of the base pad <b>12</b> is about 10 mm by 14 mm and smaller because the connector arm <b>14</b> is bent upwardly from the intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>hear the center of base pad <b>12</b> thereby drastically reducing the solderable surface area of base pad <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to compensate for the reduced solderable surface area, the gap <b>24</b> at the location between the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>is only minimally larger than the base <b>23</b> of neck <b>22</b> of connector arm <b>14</b>. The fact that the connector arm <b>14</b> extends from base pad <b>12</b> close to the central region of base pad <b>12</b> directs any forces exerted on connector <b>14</b> by mating electrical connectors to the central region of base pad <b>12</b>. More force is required to separate a soldered joint if directed at the center of the base pad <b>12</b> than if directed at a side edge. Side edge directed forces cause a pealing action which requires less force to separate a soldered joint than a centrally directed force. In addition, by providing base pad <b>12</b> with standoffs <b>20</b>, each electrical terminal <b>10</b>, when soldered, is spaced apart from the surface to which the electrical terminal <b>10</b> is being soldered by at least the height of the standoffs <b>20</b> so that the solder joint includes at least a suitable predetermined amount of solder <b>18</b> between the base pad <b>12</b> and the surface. This ensures that the solder joint can have a certain predetermined amount of strength.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment of electrical terminal <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, base pad <b>12</b> has a footprint that is about 10 mm by 13 mm. The intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>of base pad <b>12</b> is about 2.7 mm wide. The outer corners of base pad <b>12</b> are rounded with a 0.8 mm radius which further aids in the ability of the electrical terminal <b>10</b> to separate from other electrical terminals <b>10</b>. The base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>are about 3 mm wide at the proximal end <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The inner edges <b>26</b> of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>face each other and are at an angle θ relative to each other moving from the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the distal ends <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Typically, the angle θ ranges from about 2° and 6°, with 4° being common. When θ is about 4°, each inner side edge <b>26</b> is angled relative to the central axis A of electrical connector <b>10</b> about 2°. The standoffs <b>20</b> have a diameter of about 1 mm and are about 0.2 mm high. Although four standoffs <b>20</b> are shown, more than four or fewer than four standoffs <b>20</b> can be employed. The solder <b>18</b> is typically 27% Sn, 70% Pb and 3% Ag and is 0.35 mm thick, but other suitable solder compositions can be employed, including lead free solders. The layer of solder <b>18</b> can be omitted from electrical connector <b>10</b>, and in such a case, a supply of solder must be introduced later during the soldering process.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The connector arm <b>14</b> is bent upwardly from the intermediate portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>of base pad <b>12</b> at about a 1.9 mm radius to a height of about 5 mm and is then bent outwardly at about a 1.9 mm radius to form an outwardly and upwardly 15° angled portion that extends about 14.2 mm. Neck <b>22</b> of connector arm <b>14</b> has side edges <b>22</b><i>a </i>which are separated at the base <b>23</b> of neck <b>22</b> from the side edges <b>26</b> of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a </i>by notches <b>34</b> in base pad <b>12</b>. The notches <b>34</b> are sized to provide the neck <b>22</b> with a base <b>23</b> that is about ½ mm to 3 mm narrower than the gap <b>24</b> between the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>, with about 1 mm to 1¾ mm being more typical. Making the neck <b>22</b> narrower than the gap <b>24</b> by such an amount provides enough clearance to prevent inseparable locking of electrical terminals <b>10</b> together while at the same time maximizing the solderable surface area of base pad <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the notches <b>34</b> have a radius of about 0.38 mm resulting in a neck base <b>23</b> that is about 1.52 mm less than gap <b>24</b> at the proximal ends <b>13</b><i>a </i>of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The side edges <b>22</b><i>a </i>of neck <b>22</b> angle inwardly towards each other starting from the base <b>23</b>. The side edges <b>22</b><i>a </i>of neck <b>22</b> extend at an angle φ between the side edge <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the side edge <b>26</b> of the adjacent base pad leg <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The angle φ is typically between 3° and 7°, with 5° being common. The blade connector <b>30</b> is about 6.3 mm wide and 8.5 mm long. The tip <b>30</b><i>a </i>of blade connector tapers to a width of about 4.5 mm and is angled on the top and bottom surfaces at about 10°. The blade connector <b>30</b> includes a locking hole <b>32</b> for engaging a protrusion of a mating electrical connector. Locking hole <b>32</b> is positioned about 4.2 mm away from the tip <b>30</b><i>a </i>and has a diameter about 2 mm. The side edges <b>22</b><i>a </i>of neck <b>22</b>, after angling inwardly towards each other, angle outwardly to form stop tabs <b>28</b>. The distance between the outer edges of the two stop tabs <b>28</b> is about 7.8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Electrical terminal <b>10</b> is typically formed of sheet metal such as tempered 110/102 copper about 0.78 mm thick and plated 0.2 to 0.4 mil thick for power applications such as window defrosters. For non-power applications, such as for antennas, electrical terminal <b>10</b> can be formed of sheet metal about 0.38 mm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, electrical terminal <b>40</b> is another embodiment of an electrical terminal in the present invention which differs from electrical terminal <b>10</b> in that connector arm <b>36</b> has a neck <b>38</b> which is only bent upwardly and does not include a second radius bend.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, electrical terminal <b>45</b> is yet another embodiment of an electrical terminal in the present invention which differs from electrical terminal <b>10</b> in that connector arm <b>42</b> has a neck <b>44</b> which is bent horizontally or parallel to base pad <b>12</b>. As is apparent, the electrical terminals in the present invention can include connector arms which can be bent in many different configurations depending upon the situation at hand. In some applications, the connector arms can be bent to extend in the direction pointing away from the distal ends <b>13</b><i>b </i>of base pad legs <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although the electrical terminals in the present invention have been shown in the figures to have edges with straight or angled contours, alternatively, side edges <b>26</b> and <b>22</b><i>a </i>as well as the outer perimeter of base pad <b>12</b> can include curved surfaces. In addition, the electrical terminals can be made of other suitable types of sheet metal instead of copper, such as steel, aluminum, etc., and can be of other suitable thicknesses than those described above. In some embodiments, the electrical terminals can be formed by molding. Although the design of the electrical terminals is suitable for small base pad <b>12</b> sizes 10 mm by 14 mm and less, electrical terminals with base pads <b>12</b> larger than 10 mm by 14 mm are also envisioned. Furthermore, connector arm <b>14</b> can terminate in any other suitable male or female connector configurations such as pin connectors, snap sockets, etc.</p>

For example, features of the different embodiments of the electrical terminals in the present invention can be combined or omitted. In addition, although specific dimensions have been provided, it is understood that dimensions can vary to suit the application at hand. Furthermore, although the electrical terminal in the present invention is typically soldered to automotive glass, it is understood that the electrical terminal can be soldered to any suitable surface or substrate.</p>
