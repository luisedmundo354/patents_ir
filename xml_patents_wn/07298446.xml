<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to liquid crystal displays (LCD) and, in particular, to an LCD cell and the corresponding method of manufacturing thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Technical Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical LCD device is made up of two primary optical subassemblies: an LCD cell and a back-light module (BLM). BLM provides basic display light illumination for the display system while manipulation of birefringence of liquid crystal molecules in the LCD cell controls the light transmittance across the cell under different intensities and colors for each of the display pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An LCD cell is basically a component that provides a liquid crystal-containing space between two transparent substrates. A sealing material is used to enclose the thin rectangular liquid crystal-containing space corresponding to the display area of the LCD device and also serves to secure the substrates relative to each other. The manufacture of an LCD cell involves the application of the sealant along predefined rectangular path around the display area utilizing a small-caliber dispenser nozzle. The sealant is subsequently hardened in a curing process in which cross-linking results in the polymerization of the sealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the popular LCD cell manufacturing processes involves the filling of liquid crystal into the containing space in a vacuum-induced injection scheme. Such a process requires leaving a small opening at a selected location of the rectangular enclosing sealant. Normally the opening is shaped to allow for guided injection of liquid crystal into the containing space. Protrusions in a shaped opening frequently result in the accumulation of liquid crystal residue around themselves after liquid crystal is filled into the containing space via the opening, which is subsequently sealed such as by a resin-based material. Liquid crystal droplets outside of their intended containing space constitute problems to the LCD cell manufacturing. They constitute substantial contaminants and should be avoided. Also, such residues outside of the liquid crystal-containing space represent the waste of expensive material.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One method capable of reducing LCD cell production costs via avoidance of liquid crystal residue wastes is related to the one-drop filling (ODF) of liquid crystal into its intended containing space. An ODF scheme involves preparing a rectangular sealant enclosure over the surface of one of the transparent substrates, placing sufficient droplets of liquid crystal over the surface of either one of the two substrates, and aligning and securing the two together in a sealed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Predetermined amount of liquid crystal material to be delivered in the droplets assist to reduce the waste of liquid crystal. The filling of liquid crystal into the containing space is also much faster than achievable in the vacuum-induced injection scheme described above. The reduction in both the material amount and the processing time results in significantly reduced manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, capacity of the liquid crystal-containing space between the two transparent substrates alters due to various factors including, for example, slight twisting of either or both of the substrates. If the amount of liquid crystal delivered by the drops is insufficient, the containing space becomes correspondingly larger than it should be, air bubbles may form in the cell. On the other hand, if the containing space is relatively smaller than for the delivered liquid crystal droplets, the amount of the liquid crystal material becomes excessive, gravity mura may easily arise in the displace area of the cell. Regardless of whether it is excessive or insufficient liquid crystal in the containing space, an LCD cell is discarded as defective. Conventional ODF schemes allow no room for repair of these defective LCD cells. They are simply thrown away and wasted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is therefore the need for an LCD cell and its corresponding method that can be processed in a manufacturing operation allowing for rework for enclosing an optimized amount of liquid crystal in the cell for defect-free display operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention thus provides a liquid crystal display cell for a liquid crystal display device comprising: a first transparent substrate; a second transparent substrate; and a sealing member, wherein said sealing member being sandwiched between and fixedly binding said first and second transparent substrates in a structural alignment for image displaying operation of said liquid crystal display cell; and said sealing member forming a perimeter encircling a display area of said liquid crystal display cell and having a discharge port at a location on said perimeter; said perimeter enclosing an optimized amount of liquid crystal obtained after the excessive liquid crystal trapped within said perimeter during the manufacture of said liquid crystal display cell is discharged out of said liquid crystal display cell through said discharge port; and said perimeter sealedly enclosing said optimized amount of liquid crystal therein after said discharge port is plugged for defect-free implementation of said image displaying operation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides a liquid crystal display cell for a liquid crystal display device comprising: a first transparent substrate; a second transparent substrate; and a sealing member, wherein said sealing member being sandwiched between and fixedly binding said first and second transparent substrates in a structural alignment for image displaying operation of said liquid crystal display cell; and said sealing member forming a perimeter encircling a display area of said liquid crystal display cell and having an array of a plurality of storage chambers formed along a location on said perimeter; said perimeter enclosing an optimized amount of liquid crystal obtained after the excessive liquid crystal trapped within said perimeter during the manufacture of said liquid crystal display cell is discharged into at least one of said plurality of storage chambers through openings broken between the containing space of said perimeter and the storage space of each of said at least one storage chambers; and said perimeter sealedly enclosing said optimized amount of liquid crystal therein after said discharge for defect-free implementation of said image displaying operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention further provides a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display cell for a liquid crystal display device comprising the steps of: a) deploying a sealing member on a first substrate; said sealing member forming a perimeter encircling a display area of said liquid crystal display cell; b) delivering at least one drop of liquid crystal on either one of said first substrate and a second substrate; c) assembling said first substrate and said second substrate wherein said first and second substrates sandwiching said sealing member and are aligned for image displaying operation of said liquid crystal display cell; d) breaking a discharge port on said perimeter; e) discharging any excessive liquid crystal trapped within said perimeter out of said liquid crystal display cell through said discharge port; and e) plugging said discharge port of said sealing member thereby obtaining an optimized amount of liquid crystal enclosed in said perimeter for defect-free implementation of said image displaying operation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention further provides a method of rework manufacturing a liquid crystal display cell for a liquid crystal display device comprising the steps of: a) deploying a sealing member on a first substrate; said sealing member forming a perimeter encircling a display area of said liquid crystal display cell and having an array of a plurality of excessive liquid crystal storage chambers positioned at a location adjacent to said perimeter; b) delivering at least one drop of liquid crystal on either one of said first substrate and a second substrate; c) assembling said first substrate and said second substrate wherein said first and second substrates sandwiching said sealing member and are aligned for image displaying operation of said liquid crystal display cell; d) breaking at least one opening between the containing space of said perimeter and the storage space of each of said at least one storage chambers; and e) discharging any excessive liquid crystal trapped within said perimeter into at least one of said plurality of storage chambers thereby enclosing an optimized amount of liquid crystal in said perimeter for defect-free implementation of said image displaying operation.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, multiple LCD cells of the present invention can be made from a single mother glass. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a section of a mother glass <b>100</b>, which is used as the basic substrate for the batch construction of LCD cells including cell <b>110</b> shown in its entirety. Each of the individual cells fabricated on the mother glass <b>100</b> can be separated physically in a later processing stage as will be described subsequently.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At this early stage of fabrication on the mother glass, each of the cells is seen defined by a sealing member generally encircling its own display area. An LCD cell constructed in accordance with the teaching of the present invention comprises a pair of transparent substrates aligned parallel to each other and forming a liquid crystal-containing space in between. In this depicted example, the two substrates include substrate <b>102</b> cut from the mother glass <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The two substrates are fixed to each other by a sealing member <b>111</b>, which has an excess liquid crystal discharge port <b>113</b>. As is shown, sealing member <b>111</b> for cell <b>110</b> is configured into a rectangular enclosure generally deployed along the edge of its boundary on the mother glass <b>100</b>. The sealing member <b>111</b> can be applied over the surface of the mother glass <b>100</b> as a viscous material using an automatic dispenser that comprises a nozzle of predetermined sealant discharge orifice size. After the sealing member <b>111</b> is cured in the subsequent processing stage, it serves to seal the liquid crystal-containing space between the two substrates.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment of the LCD cell in accordance with the present invention such as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, substrate <b>102</b> (cut from the mother glass <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) has a plurality of color filter sections arranged in a matrix of display pixels on the internal surface thereof. Generally identified by the reference numeral <b>212</b> in the drawing, each of the color filter sections may comprise independent filters for each of the three primary colors. In between every pair of consecutive color filter sections <b>212</b> in the matrix, segments of a light-shielding framework <b>214</b> is formed to avoid mutual interference between neighboring image display pixels. A transparent electrode layer <b>216</b> hosting a network of electrodes is formed covering both the color filter sections <b>212</b> and the light-shielding framework <b>214</b> over the entire surface area of the substrate <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Over the internal surface of the other substrate <b>102</b> opposite to <b>204</b>, as also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is another matrix of thin-film transistors (TFT) as well as a matrix of pixel electrodes. Generally indicated by reference numeral <b>218</b> in the cross-sectional view, each of the transistors in the matrix is connected to a network of parallel data and gate lines (both not shown in the drawing). As is comprehensible, each of the thin-film transistors <b>218</b> for a corresponding color filter section <b>212</b> can be located adjacent to where a pair of data and gate lines intersect. Similarly, each of the pixel electrodes <b>220</b> is placed within the gridwork defined by the intersecting data and gate lines and substantially aligned with a corresponding color filter section <b>212</b>. All the TFTs, together with their corresponding color filter sections <b>212</b> and pixel electrodes <b>220</b> are arrayed in a display matrix corresponding to the image pixel matrix system within the display area of the LCD cell.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another preferred embodiment of the LCD cell in accordance with the present invention as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (which has elements sharing reference numerals with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the pair of substrates may include one featuring a color-filter-on-array (COA) filtering system and another paired opposite substrate with a corresponding common electrode <b>216</b>. The positions of the pixel electrode <b>220</b> and color filter <b>212</b> can be exchanged in a different implementation.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plane view schematically showing the delivery of at least one drop <b>301</b> of liquid crystal in the containing space of the LCD cell in an ODF procedure. Amount of liquid crystal delivered in the at least one drop <b>301</b> is predetermined to match the volumetric capacity of the liquid crystal-containing space. Preferably, the delivery amount is slightly larger than the exact amount and also to cover the tolerance among different sets of substrate pairs for the mass production of the inventive LCD cells.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Subsequently, a second substrate is placed on top of the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

The placement of the top substrate in position spreads the liquid crystal in the containing spaces for all cells batch-fabricated on the mother glass. For example, liquid crystal drops <b>301</b> delivered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> become the filling liquid crystal <b>206</b> in the LCD cell <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The placement of the top substrate also completes the construction of the sealed liquid crystal-containing space. The sealing member <b>111</b> may then be hardened to combine the two substrates in a permanently fixed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After the two substrates are secured relative to each other, the entire assembly is subject to a cutting procedure. The cutting can be performed along the cutting line generally identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the dashed line. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, this cutting to release the multiple LCD cells from the mother glass can be performed along the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> without breaking the discharge port <b>113</b>. This prevents the contamination by excessive liquid crystal coming out of the containing space during this mass separation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A subsequent cutting can then be performed directly cutting through the channel mouth of the discharge port <b>113</b> when an individual LCD cell such as cell <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be processed. The result of this subsequent cutting achieves an LCD as is schematically illustrated in the plane view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Normally, the discharge port <b>113</b> allows for the containment of the discharge of excess liquid crystal delivered in the ODF process. With adequate control of the ODF delivery amount, the excessive liquid crystal can be contained entirely within the containing space. This leaves no contaminating liquid crystal residue over the external surface of the sealing member <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If, however, excessive liquid crystal is more than can be contained within the containing space, it can be discharged off the LCD cell without problem once the discharge port <b>113</b> is cut open. Methods such as cleaning known in the art can then be used to completely remove all excessive liquid crystal off the cell. After this, the discharge port <b>113</b> can be sealed utilizing a plugging sealant <b>114</b> and achieving an LCD cell assembly <b>610</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> containing adequate amount of liquid crystal for optimized image display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a plane view schematically showing the sealing of the discharge port of the containing space of the LCD cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, the main enclosing sealing member <b>111</b> for the containing space and the plugging sealant <b>114</b> for the discharge port <b>113</b> are radiation-hardened sealant.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although not shown in the drawings, an LCD cell constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may have the deployment of a matrix of regularly-populated spacers between its two substrates with a distribution density much higher than possible in the conventional cells. Spacers are used inside the liquid crystal-containing space of the cell to assist to support the rigidity of the thin and large-area substrates in order to prevent both from collapsing toward each other.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Spacer population density inside the liquid crystal-containing space for conventional LCD cells manufactured employing ODF procedure is typically less than 0.15%, measuring the total spacer footprint area with respect to overall LCD cell display area. Lower spacer population density allows for relatively larger process window, which leads to easier manipulation and better result of ODF schemes in the fabrication of LCD cells. On the other hand, higher spacer population density results into higher cell mechanical rigidity. In accordance with the teaching of the present invention, the spacer population density becomes a disengaged factor for ODF process window in the manufacturing of an LCD cell. It is therefore, in accordance with the present invention, possible to deploy spacers in the cell at a population density much higher than the typical 0.15% conventionally achievable. In a preferred embodiment, it is possible to deploy spacers at a density up to nearly 2% of the total display area. This leads to an extremely rigid cell structure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second preferred embodiment is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.

Not every LCD cell cut loose from the mother glass requires this rework processing of excessive liquid crystal discharge. However, such rework does provide improvement to the overall costs of LCD cell manufacture due to the possibility of easy salvage of cells with excessively-filled liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The result of this rework-cutting achieves an LCD as is schematically illustrated in the plane view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.

The opening can be facilitated by, for example, burning the opening section utilizing a laser beam of adequate power and wavelength. Such a laser beam can open up the discharge port without inflicting damage to the other components of the cell close to the location of this burn-opening partly due to the fact that substrates enclosing the liquid crystal are transparent glass-based.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In case of laser beam opening of the discharge port <b>313</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the opening section of the sealing member <b>311</b> can be reduced to ball-like residuals <b>313</b><i>c </i>at the edges of the opening.

Also as is comprehensible, discharge of excessive liquid crystal from the main containing space <b>1106</b> into the opened storage chamber can be automatic as a result of internal pressure in the containing space due to the excessiveness of the enclosed liquid crystal. Alternatively, external pressure may also be employed to discharge the excess of liquid crystal in the containing space into the storage chamber opened.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In case one storage chamber <b>1113</b>A is insufficient to receive the entire excessive amount needs to be discharged from the main containing space, more storage chambers can be opened to the main space.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Consider, for example, the case of an LCD cell manufactured to hold more than necessary amount of liquid crystal within its containing space. In this case, a first chamber <b>1213</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> can be opened to the main containing space by breaking down its wall toward the containing space. This can be implemented utilizing, for example, the laser irradiation method described above. When the chamber <b>1213</b>A is opened to the main containing space <b>1206</b> the cell <b>1210</b>, a predetermined amount of excessive liquid crystal can be discharged into this chamber.

If, however, one single storage chamber <b>1213</b>A is not sufficient to reduce the total liquid crystal amount down to normal, more storage chambers can be used. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a second storage chamber <b>1213</b>B is opened to receive its share of excessive liquid crystal from the main containing space of the cell assembly <b>1210</b>. The rework scheme of opening up storage chambers to the main containing space can be repeated until the right total amount of liquid crystal in the cell's main containing space is achieved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts an example of another rework in accordance with the present invention.</p>

This is relatively easy since ODF procedure to fill liquid crystal is normally conducted in a vacuum operating space. Such negative pressure assists in the automatic sucking of excessive liquid crystal into themselves from the main containing space. This negative-pressure arrangement in all storage chambers is advantageous in that the withdraw of excessive liquid crystal from the cell main containing space produces no contaminating liquid crystal droplets to be removed off the LCD cell assembly. All the excessive liquid crystal material remains on-board, virtually eliminating the contamination problem for the subsequent fabrication processing steps of the cell assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferably, the main enclosing sealing member <b>711</b> for the containing space and the sealant for the array of excessive liquid crystal storage chambers <b>713</b> are radiation-hardened sealant.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As is known to those in the art, lower spacer population density allows for relatively larger process window, which leads to easier manipulation and better result of ODF schemes in the fabrication of LCD cells. On the other hand, however, higher spacer population density means higher cell mechanical rigidity, a highly-desirable characteristics. Spacer population density inside the liquid crystal-containing space of conventional LCD cells produced employing ODF procedure must, due to fabrication process window considerations, be below approximately 0.15%, measuring the total spacer footprint area with respect to overall LCD cell display area. In LCD cells manufactured in accordance with the teaching of the present invention, this disadvantageous limitation does not apply. Preferred spacer population density inside the liquid crystal-containing space of present invention can be advantageously much higher than that of the conventional cells.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">While the above is a full description of the specific embodiments, various modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents may be used. Although the LCD cell structure of the present invention allows for the reworking adjustment of the release of the excessiveness of the liquid crystal into the storage space, it does not imply that all cells manufactured require this rework processing. This is particularly true in an established and experienced LCD manufacturing facility implementing the idea of the present invention. With this possibility of allowing a rework, cells that would originally have to be discarded due to the enclosure of an incorrect amount of liquid crystal can now be salvaged and reworked into a fully-qualified cell. Therefore, the above description and illustrations should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention which is defined by the appended claims.</p>
