<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a solid polymer electrolyte membrane type fuel cell and to a fuel cell stack constituted by stacking a plurality of the fuel cell units, and more specifically, relates to a technique for absorbing expansion and contraction of the fuel cell stack in the stacking direction of separators.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fuel cells include a solid polymer electrolyte membrane type fuel cell constituted by providing a pair of electrodes on opposite sides of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane and sandwiching the outside thereof by a pair of separators.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this fuel cell, a passage for a fuel gas (for example, hydrogen) is provided on the entire surface of a separator provided facing one electrode, a passage for an oxidant gas (for example, air including oxygen) is provided on the entire surface of a separator provided facing the other electrode, and a passage for a cooling medium is provided on either one of the surfaces of separators opposite to a surface facing the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the fuel gas is supplied to the reaction surface of one electrode, hydrogen is ionized and moves to the other electrode via the solid polymer electrolyte membrane. Electrons generated during the reaction process are taken out to an external circuit, and are used as direct-current electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the oxidant gas is supplied to the other electrode, the hydrogen ions, the electrons and the oxygen react with each other to thereby generate water.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The surface on the opposite side of the electrode reaction plane of the separator is cooled by the cooling medium flowing between the separators.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since these reactant gases and the cooling medium should flow in respectively independent passages, a sealing technique, which separates each passage, is important.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The portions to be sealed include, for example, the peripheries of communication holes formed penetrating through the separator so as to distribute and supply the reactant gas and the cooling medium to each fuel cell unit in the fuel cell stack, the outer peripheries of membrane electrode assembly formed of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane and a pair of electrodes arranged on opposite sides thereof, the outer peripheries of a coolant passage plane of the separator, and the outer peripheries of front and back faces of the separator. As the sealing material, an elastic and adequately resilient material, for example, an organic rubber, is adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Conventionally, a fuel cell having a membrane electrode assembly by sandwiching a solid polymer electrolyte membrane by a pair of electrodes and sandwiching the outside thereof by a pair of separators, comprises a membrane electrode assembly (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) constituted by sandwiching a solid polymer electrolyte membrane having a larger outer size between a pair of gas diffusion layers each having the same size, and the outer size thereof is smaller than that of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 8-148169. In this type of fuel cell <b>40</b>, the passage for the fuel gas <b>41</b> and the passage for the oxidant gas <b>42</b> are sealed by sandwiching with a pair of O-ring the portion of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane <b>45</b>, which is protruded from the outer peripheries of the anode electrode <b>43</b> and the cathode electrode <b>44</b>. However, in such a sealing structure, a problem arises in that sealing of passages may fail if a pair of O-rings each disposed on both side of the solid polymer electrolyte member are insufficiently aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, if two O-rings on both surface of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane are disposed out of positions, the pressure of both O-rings press the solid polymer membrane and the solid polymer electrolyte membrane <b>45</b> is be deformed such that the surface pressure of the O-rings becomes insufficient to provide a hermetic seal. In addition, an unfavorable phenomenon will be caused by deformation of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane in that the solid polymer electrolyte membrane will be peeled off from the anode electrode <b>43</b> and the cathode electrode <b>44</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned problems and to provide fuel cell units and a fuel cell stack formed by stacking a plurality of fuel cell units, wherein those fuel cell units and a fuel cell stack have an improved sealability between the membrane electrode assembly and separators, a reduced cost, and an improved thickness in the direction of stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to solve the above problems, the present invention is described in two groups of aspects. The first group includes the first embodiment and the second aspect includes embodiment from the second to the eighth embodiments. However, the present invention is not limited to one group and the two aspects can be combined.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to solve the above problems, the first aspect of the present invention provides a fuel cell which comprises a pair of separators (for example, a first separator <b>3</b> and a second separator <b>4</b> in the embodiment) sandwiching outsides of a membrane electrode assembly composed of a pair of electrodes provided on both sides of a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, an outer seal member sandwiched by a pair of separators at a position surrounding an outer periphery of the membrane electrode assembly, an inner seal member sandwiched by one (for example, the second separator <b>4</b> in the embodiment) of the pair of separators and an outer periphery of the electrolyte membrane, and a backing member (for example, an anode electrode in the embodiment) opposing to the inner seal member interposing the electrolyte membrane, wherein a step is formed at contact surfaces (a first plane portion <b>22</b> and a second plane portion <b>23</b> in the embodiment) of the inner seal member and the outer seal member on one of the pair of separators.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the fuel cell according to the first aspect of the present invention, since the outer seal member surrounding the periphery of the membrane electrode assembly tightly seals a space between the first and second separators, and the inner seal member which is arranged at the outer periphery of the electrolyte membrane constituting the membrane electrode assembly at the inner side of the outer seal member tightly seals the space between the separator and the electrolyte membrane, the space between separators are separated on both side of the electrolyte membrane into two separated regions, one of which is located at the anode side and the other one is located at the cathode side.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the inner seal member and the second separator sandwiches the electrolyte membrane together with the backing member, the thin electrolyte membrane is reinforced by the backing member so that it can be protected from being deformed by a pressure through the inner seal member. In addition, since the electrolyte membrane is not deformed, the inner seal member is able to maintain sufficient surface pressure to attain the sufficient sealing ability.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above case, in contrast to the outer seal member tightly which seals the space between two separators, the inner seal member performs tight sealing between two separators including the electrolyte membrane and the backing member in between, so that a difference in thickness is generated between the inner seal member and the outer seal member. For example, even when the thickness of the inner seal member is set to a minimum thickness including a deformable portion for sealing, the thickness of the outer seal member which must seal a wider space than that for the inner seal member becomes excessively thick.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In both separators in contact with the outer seal member and the inner seal member, if the heights of the contact planes with both seal members are changed, that is, if a step is formed between respective contact planes, it becomes possible to reduce the thickness of the outer seal member, which results in reducing the material consumption of the seal member and reducing the product cost. In addition, since it is possible to reduce the thickness of the outer seal member while maintaining the necessary thickness for the inner seal member, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the fuel cell unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a fuel cell according to the second aspect of the present invention, the anode electrode or the cathode electrode is used as the backing member of the electrolyte membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the second aspect of the present invention, the fuel cell uses a backing member of the electrolyte membrane the anode electrode or the cathode electrode, without using a separate element.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Application of the anode electrode or the cathode electrode to the electrolyte membrane without using a separate element as the backing member makes it possible to reduce the number of parts in the fuel cell and to reduce the product cost.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the third aspect of the present invention, the present invention proposes to use the second separator as a backing member for reinforcing the electrolyte membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Application of the second separator to the electrolyte membrane as the backing member without using a separate element makes it possible to reduce the number of parts in the fuel cell and to reduce the product cost.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fourth to tenth aspects of the present invention propose a fuel cell stack, formed by stacking a plurality of fuel cells according to one among the first to the third aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the thickness of the individual fuel cell is reduced as described above, the thickness of the fuel cell stack can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the reduced thickness for a fuel cell times the number of stacked fuel cells for forming the fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second group includes eight aspects from the eleventh to the eighteenth aspect. The eleventh aspect of the present invention provides a fuel cell comprised of an electrode assembly sandwiched between a pair of separators (for example, a first separator <b>103</b> and a second separator <b>104</b> in the embodiment) composed of an electrolyte membrane sandwiched between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode, and provided with an outer seal member sandwiched between a pair of separators at a position surrounding the outer periphery of the electrode assembly, an inner seal member sandwiched between one of the separators (for example, a second separator <b>104</b> in the embodiment) and the outer periphery of the electrolyte membrane, and a backing member (for example, an anode electrode <b>107</b> in the embodiment) in opposition to the inner seal member and interposing the electrolyte membrane, wherein there is a step between the contact surface (for example, an inner plane portion <b>135</b> in the embodiment) with the backing member and the contact surface (for example, outer plane portion <b>136</b> in the embodiment) with the outer seal member on one of the separators (for example, a first separator <b>103</b> in the embodiment) in opposition to the other separator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the fuel cell according to the eleventh aspect of the present invention, since the outer seal member surrounding the periphery of the electrode assembly tightly seals a space between the separators and the inner seal member arranged at the outer periphery of the electrolyte membrane constituting the electrode assembly at the inner side of the outer seal member tightly seals the space between one of the separators and the electrolyte membrane, the space between the separators is separated on both sides of the electrolyte membrane into a space on the anode electrode side and a space on the cathode electrode side.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this case, in contrast to the outer seal member tightly sealing the space between the pair of separators directly, since the inner seal member tightly seals the space between the pair of separators while sandwiching the electrolyte membrane and backing member in between, a difference results in their thickness. For example, in the case the inner seal member is set to the minimum thickness that ensures the minimum required amount of deformation to achieve adequate sealing, the outer seal member, which must seal a wider space than that for the inner seal member, becomes excessively thick.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, in the separator that contacts the backing member, the thickness of the outer seal member can be reduced by making the height of the contact surface of the backing member and the height of the contact surface of the outer seal member different, namely by providing a step. As a result, the amount of material that composes the seal members can be decreased and costs can be reduced. In addition, since the thickness of the outer seal member can be reduced while maintaining the thickness of the inner seal member, the thickness of the fuel cell can be reduced. The assembly quality when the fuel cells are stacked is improved since the rigidity of the separators is increased as a result of providing the step. In this case, formation of the seal members becomes easier if the contact surfaces with both seal members on one of the separators are made to be flat.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the twelfth aspect of the present invention, the fuel cell comprises a step of the same orientation as the step of one of the separators (for example, inner plane portion <b>135</b> and outer plane portion <b>136</b> in the embodiment) on the contact surfaces with both seal members (for example, inner place section <b>122</b> and outer plane portion <b>123</b> in the embodiment) on the other separator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above-described fuel cell of the present invention, since the fuel cell comprises on both separators that compose the fuel cell, the assembly quality when stacking the fuel cells is further improved since the rigidity of both separators is improved. In addition, since the orientation of the step of one of the separators is the same as the orientation of the step of the other separator, the space between the two separators can be maintained nearly constant, thereby allowing a reactive gas or cooling medium to flow smoothly between them.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the fuel cell according to the thirteenth aspect of the present invention, in the above-described fuel cell, a peripheral reinforcing member (for example, a reinforcing member <b>137</b> in the embodiment) is provided on the surface of the electrolyte membrane on the side that contacts the inner seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, since the fuel cell further comprises a reinforcing member on the periphery of the surface of the electrolyte membrane on the side that contacts the inner seal, the electrolyte membrane can be further reinforced in the direction of thickness, thereby further improving its durability with respect to stress.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the fourteenth aspect of the present invention, the present invention proposes a fuel cell wherein the backing member is the anode electrode or the cathode electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the above-described fuel cell, since the backing member is also used as the anode electrode or cathode electrode arranged adjacent to the electrolyte membrane instead of being provided as a separate member, the number of parts can be decreased and the product cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the fifteenth aspect of the present invention, the fuel cell comprises an integrated member which is integrally constituted by the inner seal member and the outer seal member.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the above-described aspect, since the inner seal member and outer seal member constitute an integral member, the number of parts can be decreased and the production time can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the sixteenth aspect of the present invention, the fuel cell comprises the outer seal member and the inner seal member as separate members.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, since the outer seal member and the inner seal member can be formed separately, the degree of freedom during handling is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the seventeenth aspect of the present invention, fuel cell comprises the outer seal member and the inner seal member on respective separators.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the above-described invention, the degree of freedom in handling is improved in the same manner as the invention described in the sixteenth aspect of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The eighteenth aspect of the present invention provides a fuel cell stack which is formed by stacking a plurality of the fuel cells according to above described fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the eighth aspect of the present invention, the assembly quality of the fuel cell stack is improved since the rigidity of the separators that compose the fuel cell is increased as previously described. In addition, the amount of material that composes the seal members can be decreased and costs can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The anode electrode <b>7</b> and cathode electrode <b>9</b> are constituted by, for example, laminating a catalyst layer made of a platinum alloy mainly formed by platinum, on a gas diffusion layer of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>, wherein the gas diffusion layer is formed by a porous carbon cloth or a porous carbon paper.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The aforementioned electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> is formed as a rectangle and the anode electrode <b>7</b> is formed covering the total surface area of the electrolyte membrane or covering a larger area than the total area of the electrolyte membrane protruding from the edge of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>. The cathode electrode <b>9</b> is formed in a smaller area than that of the anode electrode. These electrolyte membrane, anode electrode, and cathode electrode are formed such that the center of gravity of each element coincides and each element has the same dimensions from the edge of the electrolyte membrane. The anode electrode <b>7</b> thereby covers the entire surface of one surface of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> like a backing, and in contrast, the outer periphery of the other surface of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> is exposed and the inside of this surface is covered by the cathode electrode <b>9</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the fuel cell according to the present embodiment, a step is formed between the first plane portion <b>22</b> and the second plane portion <b>23</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As a result, the inner seal member <b>6</b> and the outer seal member <b>5</b> are formed so as to have the same cross section. In this arrangement, both seal members are preferably provided with the same height, which is the minimum required for obtaining a sufficient hermetic seal.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in FIG., <b>3</b>, the inner seal member <b>6</b> is formed in an approximately rectangular shaped ring to be in contact with the exposed portion of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> of the membrane electrode assembly <b>3</b>. The outside seal member, in contrast, is formed by a plurality of approximately rectangular rings comprising a large and approximately rectangular ring portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>surrounding the membrane electrode assembly, and a plurality of rectangular ring portions <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>g </i>surrounding the inlet ports <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b> and the exhaust ports <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> for the fuel, oxidant gas, and cooling medium.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">All ring portions <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>g </i>are united in an integrated form, partially sharing the overlapping portions of respective rings, and thereby the sealing area is limited in a minimum area. In addition, the inner sealing member <b>6</b> and the outer sealing member <b>5</b> are integrated by connecting to each other through a connecting portion <b>25</b>, and thereby the reduction of the number of parts are realized.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, provisions of the outer sealing member <b>5</b> and the inner sealing member <b>6</b> allows defining and tight sealing or liquid tight sealing of the supply ports <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and exhaust ports <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> of the fuel gas, oxidant gas, and cooling medium and the corrugated portion <b>10</b>. Furthermore, in order to circulate and exhaust the fuel gas and oxidant gas through respective passages <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> formed between corrugated portions <b>10</b> by inputting from respective supply ports <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and in order to exhaust these gases from respective exhaust ports <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, communication portions <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are formed for communicating between intermediate portions of each supply port and each passage and intermediate portions between each exhaust port and each passage, detouring around the outer sealing member <b>5</b> and the inner sealing member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>12</b>, in these communicating portions <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>, the communication portion <b>26</b> of the oxidant gas, for example, is formed by crossing a bridge member <b>29</b> on a concave portion <b>28</b> in the direction along the seal members <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The aforementioned concave portion <b>28</b> is formed by partially indenting the first plane portion <b>22</b> and the second plane portion <b>23</b> at a wider width than the total width of the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b>, and the bridge member <b>29</b> is formed to be narrower in the width than the width of the concave portion and is formed to be wider in the width than the total width of the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b>. The surface plane of the bridge member <b>29</b> is formed covering the concave portion <b>28</b> having a step in the level so as to connect the first plane portion <b>22</b> and the second plane portion <b>23</b> without difference in the level, and both ends of the bridge member are received in respective positioning recesses <b>30</b> formed on both sides of the concave portion <b>28</b> by a depth corresponding to a plate thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the aforementioned construction, the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> allow circulation of the oxidant gas only at the communication portion <b>26</b> and the other portions are maintained at the tightly sealed state such that the oxidant gas supplied from the supply port <b>12</b> can be circulated on the surface of the cathode electrode <b>9</b> through the communication portion <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective view showing a communication portion adjacent to the oxidant gas inlet port, including a partial cross-section along the line B-B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. By constituting the fuel stack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the oxidant gas which is flowed in from the oxidant gas inlet ports <b>12</b> opening while communicating in the direction of the stacking direction of the fuel cells as shown by arrows in the figure, is branched into a plurality of oxidant gas passages <b>20</b> formed between respective separators <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, in order to make a detour around the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, similarly to the oxidant gas, the fuel gas supplied from the supply port <b>11</b>, can be circulated in the passage <b>19</b>, which is defined between the first separator <b>3</b> and the anode electrode <b>7</b>, by forming a communication portion <b>27</b> by crossing a bridge member <b>32</b> on the concave portion <b>31</b> formed by partially depressing the first separator <b>3</b>, defining the passage <b>19</b> of the fuel gas.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the fuel gas stack formed by stacking a plurality of fuel cells, a seal member <b>33</b> is disposed between the first separator <b>3</b> of one fuel cell <b>1</b> and the second separator <b>4</b> of the other adjacent fuel cell <b>1</b> in order to define supply ports <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and exhaust ports <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> of the fuel gas and the oxidant gas and to define a cooling medium passage from the inlet port <b>13</b> to the exhaust port <b>16</b> of the cooling medium. The seal member is disposed between two rear surfaces of respective second plane members <b>23</b> of two adjacent fuel cell units in order to support the seal member <b>33</b> in a stable and reliable manner because two separators <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are formed by press molding the metal plates.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Hereinafter, operations and effects of the fuel cell <b>1</b> and the fuel cell stack <b>18</b> according to the first embodiment are explained.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the fuel cell <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, since the anode electrode <b>7</b> forming the membrane electrode assembly <b>2</b> supports one surface of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>, the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> is not deformed and is held in place by addition of the pressure of the inner sealing member. Accordingly, not only the hermetic seal between the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> can be maintained, but also a force is not applied to both electrodes <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> to be peeled from the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>, and the membrane electrode assembly is maintained at a sound state.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the above case, if it is desired to hold the aforementioned hermetic seal just by sandwiching the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> and the anode electrode <b>7</b> between the inner seal member <b>6</b> and the first separator <b>3</b>, a difference in height is caused, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, between a space between the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> and the second separator <b>4</b> to be sealed by the inner sealing member <b>6</b> and a space between the first separator <b>3</b> and the second separator <b>4</b> to be sealed by the outer seal member <b>5</b>. If the height of the inner seal member <b>6</b> is set at a minimum required height for sealing the space, the height of the outer seal member <b>5</b> for sealing a higher space than that of the space for the inner sealing member <b>6</b> becomes so high that it requires useless seal material.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the present embodiment, since a step is formed between the first plane portion <b>22</b> and the second plane portion <b>23</b>, the difference of the height between the space to be sealed by the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the space to be sealed by the inner seal member <b>6</b> can be reduced. In particular, when the height of the step is made identical with the total thickness of the thickness of the anode electrode <b>7</b> and the thickness of the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>, both space heights to be sealed by the outer and inner seal member <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> can be the same. Consequently, heights of the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> can be the same as that of the minimum height for sealing the space, which results in saving the material and reducing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the fuel cell according to the present embodiment, when compared with the fuel cell shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, which does not have a step, it is possible to reduce the thickness between both separators <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> by the size of the step.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The above effect is obtained due to the reduction of the space itself between the first separator <b>3</b> and the second separator which has been sealed by outer seal member <b>5</b>, whose thickness has been unnecessarily thick when the seal member <b>33</b> between two fuel cells is set at a minimum size, by dropping a part of the first plane portion <b>22</b> in contact with the inner seal member <b>6</b> in the plane portion <b>17</b> of the second separator <b>4</b> in contact with both outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As a result, although the respective passages <b>19</b> to <b>21</b> become narrower, no problems arise because sufficient areas can be secured for these passages <b>19</b> to <b>21</b> by optimizing the pitches and so on of the corrugated portion <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">That is, it is possible to say that the thickness of a fuel cell is determined by the outer seal members disposed back to back on both sides of the separators <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> and the thickness of the seal member <b>33</b> for sealing two fuel cells. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the outer seal members while maintaining the thickness of the seal member <b>33</b> for sealing to adjacent fuel cells is at a minimum thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Moreover, since the fuel cell stack <b>8</b> according to the present embodiment is constituted by stacking a plurality of fuel cells having a reduced thickness as described above in the direction of thickness, the total thickness of the fuel cell stack becomes thin by an amount corresponding to the reduced thickness of a fuel cell times the number of fuel cells being stacked. Since the number of fuel cells of the fuel cell stack is normally around <b>100</b>, the effect of reducing the thickness of a fuel cell is enormous. As a result, it is possible to reduce a setting space to a large extent when a fuel cell stack <b>18</b> is loaded on a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Note that the present invention is not limited to use an anode electrode <b>7</b> as shown in the above embodiment as the backing member for the electrolyte membrane. which contacts the inner seal member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In place of the anode electrode, for example, it is possible to insert a cathode electrode in between the first separator <b>3</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the above embodiment, the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> are integrated by connecting using a connecting portion <b>25</b> in order to reduce the number of parts of the fuel cell assembly. However, the present invention is not limited to this constitution, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, it is a matter of course to produce and arrange the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> as separate parts for sandwiching the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, it is possible to adopt a structure to directly sandwich the electrolyte membrane between the inner seal member <b>6</b> and a backing plane portion <b>34</b>, which is formed by protruding downwardly a part of the first separator <b>3</b> opposing to the inner seal member <b>6</b> interposing the electrolyte membrane <b>8</b> by a thickness of the anode electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, although, in the above embodiment, a structure is adopted in which both of the outer seal member <b>5</b> and the inner seal member <b>6</b> are supported by the plane portion <b>17</b> of the second separator <b>4</b>, it is possible, instead, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, to provide the outer seal member on the first separator <b>3</b> and to provide the inner seal member on the second separator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the above embodiment, a description was provided that it is preferable to set the difference of the level between the first plane portion <b>22</b> and the second plane portion <b>23</b> at an amount corresponding to a sum of thickness of the anode electrode <b>7</b> and thickness of the electrolyte membrane. However, in place of the above structure, the difference of the level may be suitably selected based on various reasons such as for ensuring spaces of passages <b>19</b> to <b>22</b> for oxidant gas, fuel gas, and cooling medium.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, the seal members <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> may be adhered to separators at the time of assembly, or may be assembled integrally with the separators.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition, although the separators in the above embodiment are formed by metal plates, instead, compact carbon materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The second group of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A fuel cell according to the second embodiment is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, constructed by sandwiching a membrane electrode assembly <b>102</b> with a pair of separators (first separator <b>103</b> and second separator <b>104</b>), by tightly sealing the space between the first separator <b>103</b> and the second separator <b>104</b> with an outer peripheral sealing member <b>105</b> so as to surround the membrane electrode assembly <b>102</b>, and by tightly sealing the space between the second separator <b>104</b> and the membrane electrode assembly <b>102</b> with an inner peripheral sealing member <b>106</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As a result, outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> allow oxidant gas to only circulate through connecting portion <b>126</b>, while the remainder is maintained in a tightly sealed state such that oxidant gas supplied from supply port <b>112</b> is able to circulate on the surface of cathode electrode <b>109</b> through the communication portion <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, similarly for the fuel gas, by composing the communicating portion <b>127</b> so that a bridge member <b>132</b> crosses over a concave portion <b>131</b>, which partially indents the first separator that defines fuel gas passage <b>119</b>, fuel gas supplied from supply port <b>111</b> is able to circulate through passage <b>119</b> formed between the first separator <b>103</b> and anode cathode <b>107</b>. The surface of bridge member <b>132</b> itself has a step so that inner plane portion <b>135</b> and outer plane portion <b>136</b> are connected over the concave portion <b>131</b> without the presence of a level difference, and both ends of the bridge member <b>132</b> are housed in positioning recesses <b>134</b> formed on both sides of the concave portion <b>131</b> by a depth corresponding to the plate thickness of bridge member <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In addition, in the fuel cell stack <b>118</b> composed by stacking fuel cells, a seal member <b>133</b> is disposed between the first separator <b>103</b> and second separator <b>104</b> of adjacent fuel cells <b>101</b> for defining the supply ports <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> and the exhaust ports <b>114</b> and <b>115</b> as well as the cooling medium passage <b>121</b> from the cooling medium supply port <b>113</b> to the cooling medium exhaust port <b>116</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). This fuel cell-interposed seal member <b>133</b> is disposed on the rear surface of plane portion <b>117</b> disposed within the same plane by taking advantage of the fact that separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are formed by press-forming steel plates.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The following provides an explanation of the operation and effects of fuel cell <b>101</b> and fuel cell stack <b>118</b> according to the present embodiment composed in the manner previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the fuel cell <b>101</b> according to the present embodiment, since one surface of the electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> that composes the electrode assembly <b>102</b> is supported by the anode electrode <b>107</b>, electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> is not deformed and remains in place even if subjected to the pressure of inner seal member <b>106</b> that presses against said electrolyte membrane <b>108</b>. Thus, in addition to the tightly sealed state between electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> being maintained, electrode assembly <b>102</b> is held in a sound state without the application of force in the direction that causes separation of electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> from electrodes <b>107</b> and <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the present embodiment, since a step is provided between inner plane portion <b>135</b> and outer plane portion <b>136</b>, the difference between the height of inner seal member <b>106</b> and outer seal member <b>105</b> can be reduced. In particular, by making the level difference between inner plane portion <b>135</b> and outer plane portion <b>136</b> equal to the combined thickness of the thickness of anode electrode <b>107</b> and the thickness of electrolyte membrane <b>108</b>, the heights of the cross-sections of both seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> can be made the same. As a result, not only the cross-sectional height of inner seal member <b>106</b>, but also that of outer seal member <b>105</b> can be made to be the minimum required height, thereby making it possible to conserve on the material that composes seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> and in turn reduce costs.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Moreover, in the fuel cell <b>101</b> according to the present embodiment, the thickness between separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> can be reduced by the size of the step. This is because, in the case the thickness of seal member <b>133</b> disposed between fuel cells is made to have the minimum thickness, by further raising the inner plane portion <b>135</b> contacting the peripheral edge of anode electrode <b>107</b> (backing member) relative to the outer plane portion <b>136</b>, the space itself between the first separator <b>103</b> and the second separator <b>104</b>, which had been tightly sealed by outer seal member <b>105</b> having a thickness greater than required, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As a result, although passages <b>119</b> through <b>121</b> of each portion become narrower, these passages <b>119</b> through <b>121</b> themselves are able to ensure sufficient areas by adjusting the pitch and so forth of corrugated portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Namely, with the exception of the plate thickness of separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> considered to be required for strength or other reasons it can be said that the thickness of fuel cell <b>101</b> is determined by the thickness of outer seal member <b>105</b> and fuel cell-interposed seal member <b>133</b> disposed back-to-back on both sides of separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. Thus, since the thickness of outer seal member <b>105</b> can be reduced while maintaining the minimum thickness for fuel cell-interposed seal member <b>133</b>, the thickness of fuel cell <b>101</b> can be reduced correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In addition, since the rigidity of the separator <b>103</b> is enhanced by the providing of a step on said separator <b>103</b>, the assembly quality when stacking fuel cells <b>101</b> is improved. As a result, the handling ease of fuel cell <b>102</b> can be improved. Moreover, since the contact surfaces with both seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> on the separator <b>104</b> become flat, seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> can be molded easily.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In addition, since the fuel cell stack <b>108</b> according to the present embodiment is composed by stacking a plurality of the fuel cells <b>101</b> having a reduced thickness as described above in the direction of thickness, the total thickness of the fuel cell stack <b>108</b> can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the reduced thickness of each fuel cell times the number of fuel cells stacked. Since the number of fuel cells stacked is, for example, about <b>100</b>, this effect becomes enormous. Thus, installation space when installing fuel cell stack <b>118</b> in a vehicle can be reduced considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Furthermore, although the anode electrode <b>107</b> is disposed as a backing member on the back of electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> that contacts inner seal member <b>106</b> in the present embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">For example, instead of anode electrode <b>107</b>, cathode electrode <b>109</b> may be inserted between the first separator <b>103</b> and the inner seal member <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a third embodiment according to the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the second embodiment. Furthermore, those members of the third embodiment that correspond to members of the second embodiment are indicated with the same reference symbols, and their explanations are omitted for the sake of convenience. The third embodiment differs from the second embodiment with respect to the presence of a step on not only the separator <b>103</b>, but also on the separator <b>104</b>. More specifically, there is a step on the contact surfaces with both seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> of separator <b>104</b>. Plane portion <b>117</b> of separator <b>104</b> is divided into an inner plane portion <b>122</b> that contacts inner seal member <b>106</b> and an outer plane portion <b>123</b> that contacts outer seal member <b>105</b>. In addition, a step is similarly formed on the bridge member <b>129</b> in the same manner as separator <b>104</b>, and is divided into inner plane portion <b>122</b> and outer plane portion <b>123</b>. In this manner, as a result of forming a step not only on separator <b>103</b> but also on separator <b>104</b>, in addition to the previously described operation and effects afforded by the first embodiment, since the rigidity of both separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> is improved the assembly quality when staking fuel cells <b>101</b> is further improved. In addition, since the orientation of the step of separator <b>104</b> is the same as the orientation of the step of separator <b>103</b>, and inner plane portion <b>122</b> is formed to be higher than outer plane portion <b>123</b>, the space between both separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> can be maintained nearly constant, thereby allowing reactive gas and cooling medium to circulate between these separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the first embodiment. In this third embodiment, although there are steps on both separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> in the same manner as the third embodiment, the orientations of these steps of separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are opposite that of the third embodiment. More specifically, the steps on separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are formed to as to become lower moving from the outside to the inside. As a result, the heights of outer plane portions <b>123</b> and <b>136</b> are greater than the heights of inner plane portions <b>122</b> and <b>135</b>. Thus, in addition the operation and effects afforded by the first and second embodiments, the position of outer seal member <b>5</b> and the position of the backing member (the peripheral edge of anode electrode <b>107</b> in this case) can be made to overlap along the laminated direction of fuel cells <b>101</b>, thereby making it possible to reduce the thickness of each fuel cell <b>101</b> by the amount of that overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a fifth embodiment of the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the second embodiment. This fifth embodiment differs from the second embodiment only with respect to providing a reinforcing member <b>137</b> on not only separator <b>103</b>, but also on separator <b>104</b>. More specifically, a peripheral reinforcing member <b>137</b> on the surface of electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> that contacts cathode electrode <b>109</b> to the outside of the inner seal member <b>106</b>. In this manner, by providing a reinforcing member on the surface of the electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> that contacts the inner seal member <b>106</b>, in addition to the operation and effects afforded by the first embodiment, electrolyte membrane <b>108</b> can be further reinforced in the direction of thickness, thereby further improving durability with respect to stress. Furthermore, although the reinforcing member is composed with the same material as cathode electrode <b>109</b> in the present embodiment, the material of the reinforcing member is not limited to this, but rather can be changed to the use of a material such as plastic, rubber or carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a sixth embodiment of the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the second embodiment. This sixth embodiment differs from the second embodiment with respect to the backing member <b>138</b> of the anode electrode <b>107</b> being formed from a different material than that of anode electrode <b>107</b>. More specifically, together with the anode electrode <b>107</b> being formed to roughly the same size as the cathode electrode <b>109</b>, a peripheral backing member <b>138</b> is provided on the outer periphery of anode electrode <b>107</b>. In this manner, by forming the backing member <b>138</b> from a different material than that of anode electrode <b>107</b>, in addition to the operation and effects afforded by the first embodiment, the cost of anode electrode <b>107</b> can be reduced and a stronger material can be selected, thereby making it possible to both reduce cost and improve durability. Furthermore, similar to the reinforcing member described above, examples of materials that can be used for backing member <b>138</b> include plastic, rubber and carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a seventh embodiment of the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view equivalent to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the first embodiment. This seventh embodiment differs from the second embodiment with respect to the outer seal member <b>105</b> and the inner seal member <b>106</b> being separate members. More specifically, outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> are provided in a state in which they are separated from separator <b>104</b> and bridge member <b>106</b>, respectively, so that together with outer seal member <b>105</b> being opposed to outer plane portion <b>136</b> of separator <b>103</b>, inner seal member <b>106</b> is opposed to inner plane portion <b>135</b>. As a result of outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> being in the form of separate members in this manner, in addition to the operation and effects afforded by the first embodiment, since outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> can be formed independently, the degree of freedom of handling is improved. In addition, since different materials can be used for outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b>, the optimum seal materials can be selected for each.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows a eighth embodiment of the present invention that is a longitudinal cross-sectional view equivalent to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> of the first embodiment. This eighth embodiment differs from the seventh embodiment with respect to outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> being formed on separate separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. More specifically, outer seal member <b>105</b> is formed on separator <b>104</b>, while inner seal member <b>106</b> is formed on separator <b>103</b>. As a result of forming outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> on separate separators <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> in this manner, similar to the sixth embodiment, outer seal member <b>105</b> and inner seal member <b>106</b> can be formed independently, thereby improving the degree of freedom of handling.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As has been described above, although various embodiments of the fuel cell and fuel cell stack of the present invention have been explained, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but rather various modifications can be made as described below. For example, although the case of forming a peripheral seal member for the cathode side diffusion layer <b>136</b> was explained, this may also be provided on the anode side diffusion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In addition, although it was described in the embodiments that the level difference between inner plane portion <b>135</b> and outer plane portion <b>136</b> is preferably set to be equal to the sum of the thickness of anode electrode <b>107</b> and electrolyte membrane <b>108</b>, it may be suitably adjusted instead for reasons such as securing passages <b>119</b> through <b>122</b> for oxidant gas, fuel gas, cooling medium and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In addition, seal members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> may be adhered to the separators during assembly or they be integrally formed with the separators.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Moreover, although the separators are composed from metal plates, they may also be produced using a fine carbon material instead.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Moreover, the aforementioned embodiments may also be composed by suitably combining their contents.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As described above, the present invention according to the first embodiment exhibits the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The first aspect of the present invention provides a fuel cell, in which both side surfaces of the electrolyte membrane is not sandwiched by seal members, but one surface of the electrolyte membrane is provided with a backing member, so that the electrolyte membrane does not deform so that it is possible to define tightly sealed passages on both side surface of the membrane electrode assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In addition, it is possible to reduce a step as the difference in the level between the space to be sealed by the inner seal member and the space to be sealed by the outer seal member. As a result, it is possible to optimize the thickness of respective seal members which results in reducing useless material cost, and reducing the interval between separators which results in reduction of the thickness of the fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the fuel cell according to the second aspect of the present invention, the anode electrode or the cathode electrode is used as the backing member, so that the above effects are obtained without increasing the number of constituting parts while reducing the product cost.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the fuel cell according to the third aspect of the present invention, the backing member is formed by the other separator, it is possible to reduce an anode electrode or a cathode electrode, which does not contribute to power generation and to further reduce the product cost further. In particular, since the separator is formed by, for example, press forming a metal plate, the shape of the separator may be freely modified and the separator is a preferable element for use as the backing member of the electrolyte membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Since a fuel cell stack according to the fourth aspect of the present invention is formed by stacking a plurality of the fuel cells according to first to fourth aspect, whose thickness is reduced as described above, the total thickness can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the reduced thickness for a fuel cell times the number of fuel cell units of the fuel cell stack. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the setting space of the fuel cell stack when it is loaded in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Since the fuel cell according to the tenth aspect comprises a step whose height is the same as that of the total thickness of the electrolyte membrane and the thicker electrode among a pair of electrode, the total thickness of the fuel cell can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Furthermore, the fuel cell of the present invention according to embodiments from the second to the eighth embodiment exhibit the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In the fuel cell according to the eleventh aspect, the amount of material used to compose the seal members can be decreased, and costs can be reduced. In addition, since the thickness of the outer seal member can be reduced while maintaining the thickness of the inner seal member, the thickness of the fuel cell can be reduced. Since the rigidity of the separators provided with the steps can be increased, the assembly quality when stacking the fuel cells can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Since the assembly quality when stacking the fuel cells can be further improved as shown in the twelfth aspect, and since the space between the two separators can be maintained nearly constant, reactive gas and cooling medium is able to circulate smoothly between them.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In the fuel cell according to the thirteenth aspect the electrolyte membrane can be further reinforced in the direction of thickness, thereby further improving the durability with respect to stress.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">According to the fourteenth aspect, the number of parts can be decreased and the product cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">According to the fifteenth aspect, the number of parts can be decreased and production time can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Since the fuel cell according to the sixteenth or seventeenth aspects of the present invention, the outer seal member and the inner seal member can be formed independently, thereby improving the degree of freedom of handling.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">According to the fuel cell stack of the eighteenth aspect of the present invention, the assembly quality of the fuel cell stack is improved. In addition, the number of composite materials of the seal members can be decreased and costs can be reduced.</p>
