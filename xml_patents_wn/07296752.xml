<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a mounting apparatus, and in particular to apparatus for removably mounting normally hand-held portable devices on arm or leg extremities of the human body.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that today many people rely on normally hand-held portable devices in their everyday lives for doing inventories; keeping track of keeping track of stock and appointments; communicating with friends, family and business associates; accessing and retrieving important information, and even playing games in spare moments. To accomplish these important tasks, the individual carries a cellular telephone, a PDA or personal digital accessory, or even a hand-held computer to name a few of the more common hand-held portable devices in typical everyday lives. To date, we carry these devices in pockets or purses where they are out of the way but inaccessible, or at our waists slung from our belts where they are more accessible but still unusable and always in the way of our hands, coats, desks, counter tops and countless other waist-high obstacles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention overcomes limitations of the prior art by providing a strap-on apparatus for mounting any of the normally hand-held portable devices in easy reach in a convenient, accessible but out of the way place on our bodies, such as an arm or leg extremity, though the apparatus may be strapped-on a shoulder or other part of the body as well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The strap-on mounting apparatus of the present invention includes a substantially rigid chassis having a frame that is formed by a pair of spaced-apart brackets that are structured to removably mount the mounting apparatus on an arm or leg extremity using, for example, a pair of flexible couplings such as conventional ties, straps or belts laced through molded slots in the brackets. The brackets help to stabilize the body mounting apparatus on the wearer's body. The chassis rotatably supports a substantially rigid cradle that is structured for removably mounting an actual normally hand-held portable device, such as a cellular telephone, a PDA or personal digital accessory, a hand-held computer, or another of the hand-held portable devices typically carried by people on their person. The cradle is rotatable relative to the chassis between different relative orientations. For example, the cradle is rotatable relative between a normal operational orientation that is substantially cross-wise to the body extremity and a normal stored orientation that is substantially aligned with the body extremity, with the cradle passing through a continuous series of intervening rotational orientations any of which may be useful as an operational orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, the cradle is rotatably coupled to a central wheel face of a chassis by a pair of connectors passing through substantially concentric arcuate or part-circular grooves or slots that are formed through the wheel face. When the connectors are threaded connectors, nuts on the connectors can be tightened for tensioning or pre-loading the interface between the cradle and the chassis to stiffen the relative rotation and keep the cradle from swinging under its own weight. Alternatively, wave or spring washers are positioned between the connector and the chassis for tensioning or pre-loading the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other aspects of the invention are detailed herein.</p>

Mounting apparatus <b>10</b> includes a substantially rigid chassis <b>14</b> having a frame <b>16</b> (more clearly shown in subsequent figures) that is formed by a pair of spaced-apart brackets <b>18</b> that are structured to removably mount the mounting apparatus <b>10</b> on an arm or leg extremity <b>12</b> using, for example, a pair of flexible couplings <b>20</b>. By example and without limitation, the flexible couplings <b>20</b> are provided as conventional ties, straps or belts laced through molded slots <b>22</b> in brackets <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the chassis <b>14</b> is placed on the wearer's shoulder with one of the straps <b>20</b> wrapping under that arm and the other strap <b>20</b> traveling across the chest and under the wearer's opposite arm. The brackets <b>18</b> help to stabilize the body mounting apparatus <b>10</b> on the extremity <b>12</b> or other body part, such as the wearer's shoulder. Chassis <b>14</b> rotatably supports a substantially rigid cradle <b>24</b> that is structured for removably mounting an actual normally hand-held portable device D such as a cellular telephone, a PDA or personal digital accessory, a hand-held computer, or another of the hand-held portable devices typically carried by people on their person. Cradle <b>24</b> is rotatable relative to chassis <b>14</b> between different relative orientations <b>25</b>. For example, the cradle <b>24</b> is rotatable relative to chassis <b>14</b> between a normal operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a </i>that is substantially cross-wise to the body extremity <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a normal stored orientation <b>25</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is substantially aligned with the body extremity <b>12</b>, with the cradle <b>24</b> passing through a continuous series of intervening rotational orientations <b>25</b><i>r </i>(shown here) any of which may be useful as an operational orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the cradle <b>24</b> rotated relative to chassis <b>14</b> into the normal operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a </i>that is substantially cross-wise to the body extremity <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Cradle <b>24</b> is rotatably coupled to chassis <b>14</b> through a substantially rigid central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the frame <b>16</b>. The chassis frame <b>16</b> includes the central wheel <b>30</b> supported between the pair of spaced-apart brackets <b>18</b> having the straps <b>20</b>. Cradle <b>24</b> is rotatably coupled to an outer surface or face <b>32</b> of central wheel <b>30</b> of the chassis frame <b>16</b>. The wheel face <b>32</b> includes a substantially smooth and planar contact surface <b>34</b> that permits the cradle <b>24</b> to rotate smoothly and easily. Cradle <b>24</b> is rotatably coupled to the smooth face <b>32</b> of central.wheel <b>30</b> of the chassis frame <b>16</b> by one or more connectors <b>36</b>. By example and without limitation, cradle <b>24</b> is rotatably coupled to central wheel face <b>32</b> by at least two connectors <b>36</b> passing through arcuate or part-circular grooves or slots <b>38</b> that are formed through the wheel face <b>32</b>. By example and without limitation, two connectors <b>36</b> pass respectively through two different substantially concentric slots <b>38</b> that are formed through the wheel face <b>32</b> separated by spokes <b>40</b>. Slots <b>38</b> are sized having a clearance width <b>42</b> relative to the connectors <b>36</b> such that the connectors <b>36</b> move easily along the arcs of the respective slots <b>38</b>, as indicated by the arrows <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The cradle <b>24</b> having the device D installed therein is thus rotatable through the continuous series of intervening rotational orientations <b>25</b><i>r </i>between the normal stored orientation <b>25</b><i>b </i>and the normal operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a</i>. Connectors <b>36</b> are secured to of a spine portion <b>48</b> of cradle <b>24</b> adjacent to back plane <b>28</b> by respective retainers <b>50</b>. For example, the connectors <b>36</b> are screws sized to have a clearance fit with the clearance width <b>42</b> of the respective slots <b>38</b> and are secured to the back plane <b>28</b> of the cradle <b>24</b> using respective retainers <b>50</b> provided as square or hex nuts. Optionally, the retainers <b>50</b> are conventional lock nuts that lock by elastic or plastic flow of a portion of the nut material, or an adhesive coating is applied to the threads to lock the retainers <b>50</b> in a desirable arrangement with the respective connectors <b>36</b>. Alternatively, the connectors <b>36</b> are rivets or another fastener of a type having a narrow shank between enlarged ends so that the retainers <b>50</b> are fixed in a desirable arrangement with the respective connectors <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The retainers <b>50</b> are tightened relative to the respective connectors <b>36</b> to control the positioning of the cradle <b>24</b> relative to the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of chassis frame <b>16</b>, either tighter to restrict ease of rotation through the continuous intervening rotational orientations <b>25</b><i>r </i>between the normal operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the normal stored orientation <b>25</b><i>b</i>, or looser to promote ease of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The enlarged ends of the connectors <b>36</b>, i.e., the retainers <b>50</b>, may be seated in respective counter-bores <b>52</b> recessed below the surface of the cradle back plane <b>28</b> to avoid interference with the device D. When the retainers <b>50</b> are configured as square or hex-shaped nuts, the counter-bores <b>52</b> may be formed with a matching square or hex shape for securing the fasteners against rotation while mating screw connectors <b>36</b> are installed to secure the cradle <b>24</b> to the chassis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the body mounting apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention without the hand-held portable device D being installed in the cradle <b>24</b>. The cradle <b>24</b> is illustrated by example and without limitation being positioned in the normal operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a </i>substantially cross-wise to the body extremity <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing the interior of the body mounting apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention without the hand-held portable device D being installed in the cradle <b>24</b>. Mounting apparatus <b>10</b> is illustrated with the chassis <b>14</b> having the frame <b>16</b> formed by the pair of spaced-apart brackets <b>18</b> that are structured to removably mount the mounting apparatus <b>10</b> on an arm or leg extremity <b>12</b> using the straps <b>20</b>. Cradle <b>24</b> is rotatably supported by chassis <b>14</b> for removably mounting almost any normally hand-held portable device D. By example and without limitation, the connectors <b>36</b> are fashioned with respective retainer heads <b>54</b> that are oversized relative to the clearance width <b>42</b> of respective slots <b>38</b> so as to capture the cradle <b>24</b> against the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the chassis frame <b>16</b>. Washers <b>56</b> are optionally inserted over the respective the. connectors <b>36</b> between the respective retainer heads <b>54</b> and a back surface <b>58</b> of the chassis central wheel <b>30</b> opposite from the contact surface <b>34</b>. The washers <b>56</b> are, for example, conventional flat metal washers provided to avoid rotation of the connectors <b>36</b> and keep the retainer <b>50</b> from loosening when they are nuts threaded onto screw connectors <b>36</b>. Alternatively, the washers <b>56</b> are of a conventional non-stick or slippery material, for example, nylon or Teflon®, which ease rotation of the cradle <b>24</b> relative to the chassis central wheel <b>30</b>, as well as keeping the retainer <b>50</b> from loosening when they are nuts threaded onto screw connectors <b>36</b>. According to another alternative, the washers <b>56</b> are conventional spring washers, such as wave or bellville washers, that operate between the respective retainer heads <b>54</b> and the chassis central wheel <b>30</b> for tensioning or pre-loading the interface <b>60</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) between the cradle <b>24</b> and the chassis central wheel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cradle <b>24</b> is illustrated as including a substantially rigid integral connector interface structure <b>62</b> formed exterior to a back or under surface <b>64</b> of the spine <b>48</b> opposite from the cradle back plane <b>28</b> and device retention structure <b>26</b>. The connector interface structure <b>62</b> is structured to receive the connectors <b>36</b> after insertion through the respective slots <b>38</b> in the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the frame <b>16</b> between spokes <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Interface structure <b>62</b> interfaces with the chassis contact surface <b>34</b> through one or more interface surfaces <b>66</b>. For example, the interface structure <b>62</b> optionally includes a pair of pedestals or bosses <b>68</b> that are integrally formed on the exterior surface <b>64</b> of the cradle spine <b>48</b>. The connectors <b>36</b> are inserted through respective spaced-apart fastener clearance holes <b>70</b> contained in the bosses <b>68</b>, respectively. Interface surfaces <b>66</b> are formed on the bosses <b>68</b> as a pair of substantially co-planar smooth and planar spaced-apart interface surfaces <b>66</b>. Interface surfaces <b>66</b> interface with the substantially smooth planar contact surface <b>34</b> portion of the face <b>32</b> of the central wheel <b>30</b>. Optionally, the bosses <b>68</b> space the cradle exterior back surface <b>64</b> away from the face <b>32</b> of the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the frame <b>16</b> such that only the end interface surfaces <b>66</b> of the respective bosses <b>68</b> interface with the substantially smooth planar contact surface <b>34</b> portion of the face <b>32</b> of the central wheel <b>30</b>. Optionally, as illustrated here, the cradle <b>24</b> includes two or more of the interface structures <b>62</b> so that the user can select between the interface structures <b>62</b> for securing the cradle <b>24</b> in one of a variety of different arrangements with the chassis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated here, the arcuate or part-circular grooves or slots <b>38</b> are interrupted only by the spokes <b>40</b> between an inner or hub portion <b>72</b> of the wheel <b>30</b> inside the slots <b>38</b>, and an outer or felly portion <b>74</b>. Thus, the slots <b>38</b> extend nearly 180 degrees around the central wheel portion <b>30</b>. The connectors <b>36</b> cooperate with the slots <b>38</b> to permit the cradle <b>24</b> to rotate nearly the full 180 degrees relative to the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the chassis frame <b>16</b>. However, in normal use relative rotation of the cradle <b>24</b> can be limited to about 90 degrees or even as little as about 75 degrees and may still perform the intended function adequately. Therefore, in a practical apparatus <b>10</b>, the slots <b>38</b> can be shortened to stiffen the chassis frame <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the number of connectors <b>36</b> cooperating with the slots <b>38</b> can be increased to increase security of the cradle <b>24</b>. An increased number of connectors <b>36</b> may even smooth the rotation of the cradle <b>24</b> relative to the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of the chassis frame <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Optionally, one or more detents <b>76</b> are extended into the one or both slots <b>38</b> to releasably capture the respective connectors <b>36</b> for restraining the cradle <b>24</b> in a selected orientation relative to the chassis <b>16</b>, including the operational orientation <b>25</b><i>a</i>, the stored orientation <b>25</b><i>b</i>, or one of the continuous series of intervening rotational orientations <b>25</b><i>r </i>therebetween.</p>

The connectors <b>36</b> are illustrated as being screws with respective threaded shanks <b>78</b> passing through the respective clearance slots <b>38</b> in the central wheel <b>30</b> portion of chassis frame <b>16</b> and through corresponding respective spaced-apart fastener clearance holes <b>70</b> contained in the bosses <b>68</b>, respectively. The connectors <b>36</b> are illustrated having respective retainer heads <b>54</b> seated against back surface <b>58</b> of the chassis central wheel <b>30</b> opposite from the cradle <b>24</b>. The optional washers <b>56</b> are illustrated between the respective retainer heads <b>54</b> and back surface <b>58</b> of the chassis central wheel <b>30</b>. Respective retainers <b>50</b> are provided as nuts on the threaded shanks <b>78</b> seated inside the respective pedestals or bosses <b>68</b> of the interface structure <b>62</b>. The nut retainers <b>50</b> can be moved along the connector shanks <b>78</b> toward or away from the respective retainer heads <b>54</b> for increasing or decreasing compression of the cradle <b>24</b> against the contact surface <b>34</b> of chassis central wheel <b>30</b>. Cradle <b>24</b> is thus rotatably secured to the chassis frame <b>16</b> against the contact surface <b>34</b> of the outer surface or face <b>32</b> of central wheel <b>30</b> by the threaded shanks <b>78</b> of the respective connectors <b>36</b> being slidable along the respective arcs <b>42</b> of the slots <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While illustrated by example as one pair of spaced-apart fastener clearance holes <b>70</b>, the connector interface structure <b>62</b> is not to limited the exemplary embodiment depicted.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the body mounting apparatus <b>10</b> of the invention that illustrates by example and without limitation the peripherally toothed ratchet disk <b>88</b> in combination with the cooperating ratchet detent <b>90</b>. The ratchet disk <b>88</b> includes means for maintaining orientation with the cradle <b>24</b>. For example, a key <b>96</b> projects from the ratchet disk <b>88</b> through the central aperture <b>86</b> in the chassis central wheel <b>30</b> and into a complementary keyway <b>98</b> formed in or through the cradle interface structure <b>62</b>. The key <b>96</b> and keyway <b>98</b> cooperate to maintain orientation between the ratchet disk <b>88</b> and the cradle <b>24</b>, while the ratchet detent <b>90</b> cooperates with the ratchet disk peripheral teeth <b>92</b> to temporarily fix the cradle <b>24</b> orientation relative to the chassis <b>14</b>.</p>
