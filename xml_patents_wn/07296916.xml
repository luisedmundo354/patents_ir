<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following co-owned and copending U.S. patent applications are incorporated herein by reference: ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,608; ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,605.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a lighting or illumination assembly. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a lighting or illumination assembly that uses an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Illumination assemblies are used in a variety of diverse applications. Traditional illumination assemblies have used lighting sources such as incandescent or fluorescent lights, for example. More recently, other types of light emitting elements, and light emitting diodes (LEDs) in particular, have been used in illumination assemblies. LEDs have the advantages of small size, long life, and low power consumption. These advantages of LEDs make them useful in many diverse applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For many lighting applications, it is desirable to have one or more LEDs supply the required light intensity and/or distribution. For example, several LEDs can be assembled in an array having small dimensions to provide a high illuminance in a small area, or the LEDs can be distributed over a larger area to provide a broader and more uniform illuminance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">LEDs in an array are commonly connected to each other and to other electrical systems by mounting the LEDs onto a printed circuit board substrate. LEDs may be populated onto a substrate using techniques that are common to other areas of electronics manufacturing, e.g., locating components onto circuit board traces, followed by bonding the components to the substrate using one of a number of known technologies, including wave soldering, reflow soldering, and attachment using conductive adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Common LED packages used to hold LED die include one or more LEDS mounted in a ceramic or plastic package, with electrical connections provided through wires or solder bonds such as surface mounted packages or T-1 3/4-type “jellybean” packages, etc. However, these techniques and designs sometimes provide poor thermal conductivity from the LED package to a heat sink, and the circuitized substrates used can be expensive and sometimes provide poor light reflectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">High thermal conductivity can be important for increasing the light output of an LED and extending its operating lifetime. Further, the reflectivity of the substrate can also be important in applications where the LED illuminates an optical cavity and a significant fraction of the light emitted by the LED reflects off the circuit substrate inside the optical cavity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The embodiments described herein are particularly useful for the manufacture and use of LED arrays that are utilized for lighting purposes or for information display.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an illumination assembly that includes a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and a reflective layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate. The assembly also includes a patterned conductive layer positioned between the reflective layer and the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate and electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate, and at least one LED including a post that is attached to the thermally conductive substrate. The at least one LED is thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate through the post and electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of making an illumination assembly, including providing a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and positioning a patterned conductive layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate such that the patterned conductive layer is electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate. The method further includes positioning a reflective layer such that the patterned conductive layer is between the reflective layer and the first major surface, providing at least one LED including a post, and attaching the at least one LED to the thermally conductive substrate such that the at least one LED is adjacent the reflective layer. The at least one LED is thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate through the post and electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a display including an illumination assembly. The assembly includes a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and a reflective layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate. The assembly further includes a patterned conductive layer positioned between the reflective layer and the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate and electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate, and at least one LED including a post that is attached to the thermally conductive substrate. The at least one LED is thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate through the post and electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer. The display further includes a spatial light modulator optically coupled to the illumination assembly, where the spatial light modulator includes a plurality of controllable elements operable to modulate at least a portion of light from the illumination assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure is applicable to illumination assemblies, and is more particularly applicable to illumination assemblies that provide illumination using LEDs. The illumination assemblies disclosed herein may be used for general lighting purposes, e.g., to illuminate an area, or for providing information to a viewer by selective illumination of different areas of the assembly as in an information display. Such assemblies are suitable for use in backlight displays, signs, and other lighting applications that require a significant amount of light.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The illumination assemblies of the present disclosure include an LED that is designed to be attachable to a substrate using a number suitable techniques, e.g., ultrasonic welding, press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. The substrates are thermally conductive such that heat can be conducted away from the LED. In some embodiments, the substrates are also electrically conductive, thereby providing a circuit pathway for the LED. Further, in some embodiments, the assemblies can include a reflective layer proximate a major surface of the substrate to reflect at least a portion of light emitted by the LED. Further, some embodiments include an LED having a post that can provide a direct thermal connection to the substrate. In an exemplary embodiment, this direct thermal connection can allow a portion of heat generated by the LED to be directed away from the LED and into the substrate in a direction substantially orthogonal to a major surface of the substrate, thereby reducing the amount of generated heat that is spread laterally away from the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-section view of one embodiment of an LED <b>20</b>. The LED <b>20</b> includes a die <b>22</b> mounted within an LED body <b>24</b> that includes a reflective surface <b>25</b>. The LED <b>20</b> also includes a first electrode <b>26</b> and a second electrode <b>28</b> that are both electrically connected to the die <b>22</b>, and a post <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the terms “LED” and “light emitting diode” refer generally to light emitting semiconductor elements with contact areas for providing power to the diode. Different forms of inorganic semiconductor light emitting diodes may be formed, for example, from a combination of one or more Group III elements and of one or more Group V elements (III-V semiconductor). Examples of III-V semiconductor materials that can be used in an LED include nitrides, such as gallium nitride or indium gallium nitride, and phosphides, such as indium gallium phosphide. Other types of III-V materials can also be used, as can inorganic materials from other groups of the periodic table.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The LEDs may be in packaged or non-packaged form, including, for example, LED dies, surface-mounted LEDs, chip-on-board LEDs and LEDs of other configurations. Chip-on-board (COB) refers to LED dies (i.e., unpackaged LEDs) mounted directly onto the circuit substrate. The term LED also includes LEDs packaged or associated with a phosphor where the phosphor converts light emitted from the LED to light at a different wavelength. Electrical connections to the LED can be made by wire bonding, tape automated bonding (TAB), or flip-chip bonding. The LEDs are schematically depicted in the illustrations, and can be unpackaged LED dies or packaged LEDs as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">LEDs can be top emitting, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,935 (Shimizu et al.). Alternatively, LEDs can be side-emitting, such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0,233,665 A1 (West et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">LEDs can be selected to emit at any desired wavelength, such as in the red, green, blue, ultraviolet, or infrared spectral regions. In an array of LEDs, the LEDs can each emit in the same spectral region, or can emit in different spectral regions. Different LEDs may be used to produce different colors where the color of light emitted from the light emitting element is selectable. Individual control of the different LEDs leads to the ability to control the color of the emitted light. In addition, if white light is desired, then a number of LEDs emitting light of different colors may be provided, whose combined effect is to emit light perceived by a viewer to be white. Another approach to producing white light is to use one or more LEDs that emit light at a relatively short wavelength and to convert the emitted light to white light using a phosphor wavelength converter. White light is light that stimulates the photoreceptors in the human eye to yield an appearance that an ordinary observer would consider “white.” Such white light may be biased to the red (commonly referred to as warm white light) or to the blue (commonly referred to as cool white light). Such light can have a color rendering index of up to 100.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The LED <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may include any suitable LED die <b>22</b>. For example, the LED die <b>22</b> can include distinct p- and n-doped semiconductor layers, substrate layers, buffer layers, and superstrate layers. The primary emitting surface, bottom surface, and side surfaces of the LED die <b>22</b> are shown in a simple rectangular arrangement, but other known configurations are also contemplated, e.g., angled side surfaces forming, for example, a truncated pyramid shape that can either be upright or inverted. Electrical contacts to the LED die are also not shown for simplicity, but can be provided on any of the surfaces of the die as is known.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although the LED <b>20</b> is depicted as having one die <b>22</b>, the LED <b>20</b> can include two or more dies <b>22</b>, e.g., a red-emitting die, a green-emitting die, and a blue-emitting die. In some embodiments, the LED die <b>22</b> may be a flip-chip design such that both electrical contacts are on a bottom surface of the die <b>22</b>. In such an embodiment, any suitable technique may be used to electrically connect the die <b>22</b> to the first and second electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the LED <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment, the LED <b>20</b> may include a wire bond LED die <b>22</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic cross-section view of and LED <b>120</b> that includes a one-wire bond LED die <b>122</b>. The die <b>122</b> is electrically connected to a first electrode <b>126</b> through a wire <b>127</b> that is attached to a top surface of the die <b>122</b>. A bottom surface of the die <b>122</b> is electrically connected to a second electrode <b>128</b> of the LED <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the LED die <b>122</b> can also have two or more wire bonds on any suitable surface or multiple surfaces of the die <b>122</b> that electrically connects the die <b>122</b> to the first and/or second electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> and/or post <b>130</b>. Any suitable wire or wires may be used to connect the die <b>122</b> to the first electrode <b>126</b>. Further, any suitable technique may be used to attach the wire <b>127</b> to the die <b>122</b> and the first electrode <b>126</b>. The LED <b>120</b> also includes an LED body <b>124</b> including a reflector <b>125</b>, and a post <b>130</b>. All of the design considerations and possibilities described herein with respect to the LED die <b>22</b>, body <b>24</b>, first and second electrodes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and the post <b>30</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> apply equally to the LED die <b>122</b>, body <b>124</b>, first and second electrodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, and the post <b>130</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the LED body <b>24</b> includes reflective surface <b>25</b> that captures edge-emitted light from the LED die <b>22</b> and bends it forward. Any suitable material or materials may be used to form the LED body <b>24</b>, e.g., metal, polymeric, etc. The reflective surface <b>25</b> may be specularly or diffusely reflective. In some embodiments, the reflective surface <b>25</b> may include a multi-layer polymer reflective film such as Vikuiti™ ESR film available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The LED <b>20</b> also includes a post <b>30</b> that is thermally connected to the LED die <b>22</b>. The post <b>30</b> can act as a low thermal resistance pathway for heat to be directed from the die <b>22</b> and out of the LED <b>20</b>. The post <b>30</b> may be in contact with the die <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the post <b>30</b> may be thermally connected to the die <b>22</b> through a thermally conductive adhesive or other material.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any suitable material or materials may be used to form the post <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> includes a thermally conductive material, e.g., copper, nickel, gold, aluminum, tin, lead, silver, indium, zinc oxide, beryllium oxide, aluminum oxide, sapphire, diamond, aluminum nitride, silicon carbide, graphite, magnesium, tungsten, molybdenum, silicon, polymeric binders, inorganic binders, glass binders, and combinations thereof. The post <b>30</b> may also contain a working fluid for higher heat transfer rates. The post <b>30</b> may thus be considered a heat pipe, where the fluid transport is by capillary flow or two-phase liquid/boiling system. Further, in some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> may be electrically conductive. Any suitable electrically conductive material or materials may be used to form electrically conductive post <b>30</b>, e.g., copper, nickel, gold, aluminum, tin, lead, silver, indium, and combinations thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the post <b>30</b> may be both thermally and electrically conductive.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the electrically conductive post <b>30</b> can be segmented to provide electrical isolation of parts of the post <b>30</b>. It may be preferred that such segmentation is done in the longitudinal manner so each segment has good thermal conductivity. For example, a cylindrical post could be composed of two half-cylinders of thermally and electrically conductive material, e.g., aluminum, laminated together with a dielectric layer or region interposed between them to form a highly thermally conductive post along the length but with relatively limited thermal conductivity across the post diameter and with no electrical conductivity across the post diameter. More than two segments of the post are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The post <b>30</b> can take any suitable size or shape. In some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> can take a cylindrical shape. Alternatively, the post <b>30</b> can take a tapered shape. Further, in some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> may include one or more threads as is further described herein. Although the post <b>30</b> is depicted as including a single post or unitary body, the post <b>30</b> can include two or more posts, each in contact with the thermally conductive substrate <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> may include one or more protuberances that may aid in mounting the LED <b>20</b> to a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The LED body <b>24</b> may be permanently attached to the post <b>30</b> using any suitable technique, e.g., adhering, bonding, welding, etc. In some embodiments, the post <b>30</b> may be integral with the LED body <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the LED body <b>24</b> may be removably attached to the post <b>30</b>. Any suitable technique may be used to removably attach the LED body <b>24</b> to the post <b>30</b>. For example, the post <b>30</b> may include one or more threads, and the LED body <b>24</b> may also include one or more threads such that the body <b>24</b> may be threaded onto the post <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the LED body <b>24</b> may be friction-fit onto the post <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, LEDs can be connected to power sources and substrates using conventional circuit boards and films. While LEDs share many of the same requirements as most other electronic components, there are differences. First, LEDs can be expensive, and the most cost-effective designs for building lighting systems using LEDs can have high junction to heat sink thermal resistance, which can increase thermal degradation of the LED. Second, LEDs often illuminate an optical cavity, where the light may experience several reflections off the circuit board substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To help prevent light absorption in the assembly, circuit substrates may be manufactured by coating a circuit board with a highly reflective coating, e.g., a titania filled coating or a reflective film. However, both of these types of coatings need to be patterned for the LED to make electrical and thermal contact with the circuit board through the coating. This patterning of the reflective coating or film can be expensive and may not provide good thermal conductivity from the LED to the circuit board substrate</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An alternative circuit board substrate is one where the mounting of the LED to the circuit also makes good thermal contact with the circuit board and also patterns the reflector.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In general, the LEDs of the present disclosure can be attached to a substrate using a number of suitable techniques, e.g., ultrasonic welding, RF welding, thermosonic welding, press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. Such LEDs are designed to be quickly and easily attached to various substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-section view of one embodiment of an illumination assembly <b>200</b>. The assembly <b>200</b> includes a thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>, a reflective layer <b>240</b> including at least one aperture <b>248</b>. The reflective layer <b>240</b> is positioned proximate a first major surface <b>214</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. The assembly <b>200</b> also includes a patterned conductive layer <b>250</b> positioned between the reflective layer <b>240</b> and the first major surface <b>214</b>, and at least one LED <b>220</b>. The assembly <b>200</b> further includes a support layer <b>242</b> having at least one aperture <b>249</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> includes the first major surface <b>214</b> and a second major surface <b>215</b>. The substrate <b>212</b> may include any suitable material or materials that are thermally conductive, e.g., copper, nickel, gold, aluminum, tin, lead, silver, indium, zinc oxide, beryllium oxide, aluminum oxide, sapphire, diamond, aluminum nitride, silicon carbide, graphite, magnesium, tungsten, molybdenum, silicon, polymeric binders, inorganic binders, glass binders, polymers loaded with thermally conductive particles that may or may not be electrically conductive, capillary flow heat pipes, two-phase heat transport devices, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>212</b> can be weldable (e.g., ultrasonically weldable) to another material or materials, e.g., weldable to aluminum, copper, metal coated ceramic or polymer, or thermally conductive filled polymer. The substrate <b>212</b> can include any suitable size and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> may also be electrically conductive. Such an electrically conductive substrate may include any suitable electrically conductive material or materials, e.g., copper, nickel, gold, aluminum, tin, lead, silver, indium, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> can serve a combination of purposes, including making an electrical connection to the LED <b>220</b>, providing a direct thermal pathway away from the LED <b>220</b>, providing heat spreading laterally away from the LED <b>220</b>, and providing electrical connections to other systems, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> can be flexible. In such embodiments, it may be preferred that the reflective layer <b>240</b> and the patterned conductive layer <b>240</b> are also flexible. A suitable flexible material having a polyimide insulative substrate with copper conductive layers thereon is 3M™ Flexible Circuits, available from 3M Company.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> can be a unitary material or, alternatively, one or more layers of material that, as a whole, provide a thermally conductive substrate. In some embodiments, the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> can include tabs or fins that are formed through the substrate <b>212</b> that provide increased heat dissipation due to the increased surface area. In other embodiments, the first and/or second major surfaces <b>214</b>, <b>215</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> can be etched or provided with grooves to also provide greater surface area for cooling. Tabs can be formed in the substrate <b>212</b> such that they extend from the second major surface <b>216</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. Such tabs can increase convective cooling efficiency of the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> and can also decrease the heat transfer between LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Proximate the first major surface <b>214</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> is the reflective layer <b>240</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the reflective layer <b>240</b> is positioned on a first major surface <b>244</b> of the support layer <b>242</b>. In general, at least a portion of light emitted by the at least one LED <b>220</b> can reflect off of the reflective layer <b>240</b> and be directed away from the substrate <b>212</b>. It may be preferred that the reflective layer <b>240</b> reflects at least 80% of light incident thereon. It may be more preferred that the reflective layer <b>240</b> reflects at least 95% of light incident thereon. It may be even more preferred that the reflective layer <b>240</b> reflects at least 99% of light incident thereon. The reflective layer <b>240</b> may be specularly or diffusely reflective.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the illumination assembly <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a reflective layer <b>240</b>, in some embodiments, it may be desirable that the reflective layer <b>240</b> exhibits low reflectivity. For example, low reflectivity layers may provide greater contrast for assemblies that include an array of individually addressable LEDs used, e.g., for active signage applications. For such active signs used in high ambient light conditions, low reflectivity at specific wavelengths may be tuned to the specific emission wavelength of the LED light sources so that the reflective layer is highly reflective at those wavelengths but absorptive over the broader spectrum, thereby providing an increase in light output while still reducing the amount of ambient light reflected by the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Suitable materials for such low reflectivity layers include carbon filled polymers, especially low index polymers including polyolefins and fluorocarbons, and polymers filled with dyes or pigments or both. The polymer surfaces may be antireflective to reduce reflectivity. Suitable antireflection methods are interference coatings known in the art to reduce reflectivity, including suitably designed layers of high and low index materials, single layers of low index materials, boehmite made by hydrolyzing a thin coating of aluminum, solgel coatings, moth's-eye microstructured coatings, and graded index coatings.

Any suitable technique may be used to attach the LED <b>220</b> to the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>, e.g., ultrasonic welding, RF welding, thermosonic welding, bonding, soldering, laser welding, etc. For example, the LED <b>220</b> may be ultrasonically welded to the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. Ultrasonic welding is typically used to join multiple parts together using vibrations converted into heat energy. Common types of ultrasonic welding are plunge and continuous welding, for example, scan or rotary welding. In plunge welding, an ultrasonic horn plunges (travels towards the parts) and transmits vibrations into a top part. In continuous welding, the ultrasonic horn is typically stationary or rotating and the part is moved beneath it. Each of the ultrasonic welding types involves a horn.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">All horns impart energy to the parts to be welded at a selected wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. A rotary horn includes a shaft with input and output ends, and a welding portion mounted on and coaxial with the output end. The diameter of the welding portion is typically greater than the diameter of the shaft. The welding portion has a cylindrical weld face having a diameter that expands and contracts with the application of vibration energy. Typically, a rotary horn is cylindrical and rotates about a longitudinal axis. The input vibration is in the axial direction and the output vibration is in the radial direction. The horn and anvil are close to each other, and the anvil can rotate in the opposite direction of the horn. The part (or parts) to be welded passes between the cylindrical surfaces at a linear velocity, equal to the tangential velocity of the cylindrical surfaces. Matching the tangential velocities of the horn and the anvil with the linear velocity of the material tends to minimize the drag between the horn and the material.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Any suitable ultrasonic welding apparatus and technique may be used to attach the LED <b>220</b> to the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. In general, the post <b>230</b> of LED <b>220</b> is positioned proximate the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. Ultrasonic energy is applied to the LED <b>220</b> such that the heat generated by the ultrasonic energy causes the post <b>230</b> to attach to the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In typical backlit displays where illumination assemblies are positioned within or proximate an optical cavity, light emitted by LEDs or other light sources may experience several reflections off of the circuit board substrate. Such circuit board substrates may be manufactured with a highly reflective coating on the circuit board, including, for example, a titania filled coating or a reflective film. Either of these types of reflectors need to be patterned for the LED to make electrical and thermal contact with the circuit board. This patterning is typically expensive, and, because of the nature of the circuit board, may still have poor thermal conductivity from the LED junction to the board. In the assemblies of the present disclosure, the reflective dielectric layer need not be pre-patterned with an aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Instead, the process of ultrasonically bonding, for example, the LED <b>220</b> to the substrate <b>212</b> can cause a portion of the reflective layer <b>240</b> to be removed such that the post <b>230</b> comes into contact with and attaches to the substrate <b>212</b>. This can significantly reduce the cost incurred by patterning another type of reflective layer. A thin coating of non-oxidizing material such as gold can be used on one or both of the post <b>230</b> and the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> to enhance environmental stability of the electrical interface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thermally and electrically conductive adhesives, solder re-flow, and Au/Sn eutectic bonding are among other techniques that can be used to attach the LED <b>220</b> to the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b>. Solder typically has a lower thermal resistance than an adhesive, but not all LEDs have solderable base metallization. Solder attachment also has the advantage of LED self-alignment, due to the surface tension of the molten solder aligning the LED during processing. However, some LEDs may be sensitive to solder reflow temperatures, making an adhesive more appropriate. Lower temperature solders known in the art can be used for assemblies where good thermal conductivity is essential but conventional reflow temperatures of greater than 200° C. cannot be tolerated.</p>

Thus, in addition to conducting heat away from the LED <b>220</b>, the thermally conductive substrate <b>212</b> is also an active element of the electrical circuits of the illumination assembly <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In general, the LED <b>320</b> may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate <b>312</b> by first attaching the post <b>330</b> to the substrate <b>312</b> using any suitable technique, e.g., press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. If the reflective layer <b>340</b> includes aperture <b>348</b> and the support layer <b>342</b> includes aperture <b>349</b>, then the post <b>330</b> is positioned in the apertures <b>348</b>, <b>349</b> and brought into thermal connection with the substrate <b>312</b>. In other embodiments, the apertures <b>348</b>, <b>349</b> may be formed through the reflective layer <b>340</b> and support layer <b>342</b> during the attachment process as is further described herein. After the post <b>330</b> is attached to the substrate <b>312</b>, the LED body <b>324</b> may be attached to the post <b>330</b> using any suitable technique. In one embodiment, the LED body <b>324</b> and the post <b>330</b> include threads such that the body <b>324</b> can be threaded onto the post <b>330</b> until the first electrode <b>326</b> and the second electrode <b>328</b> are electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer <b>350</b> through contacts <b>354</b>. Alternatively, the LED body <b>324</b> can be friction-fit onto the post <b>330</b>, or the LED body <b>324</b> can include retention protuberances or other devices known in the art for attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Any suitable device or technique can be used to prevent the LED <b>320</b> from becoming detached from the thermally conductive substrate <b>312</b>. For example, the post <b>330</b> can include one or more protuberances to help fixedly attach the LED <b>320</b> to the substrate <b>312</b>. In other embodiments, the post <b>330</b> can include one or more threads for threading or screwing the LED <b>320</b> into the thermally conductive substrate <b>312</b> as described in co-owned and copending U.S. patent application entitled ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,605.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, a support layer may not be required. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic cross-section view of another embodiment of an illumination assembly <b>400</b>. The assembly <b>400</b> includes a thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>, a reflective layer <b>440</b> positioned proximate a first major surface <b>414</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>, a patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> positioned between the reflective layer <b>440</b> and the first major surface <b>414</b>, and at least one LED <b>420</b>. All of the design considerations in regard to the thermally conductive layer <b>212</b>, the reflective layer <b>240</b>, the patterned conductive layer <b>250</b>, and the at least one LED <b>220</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> apply equally to the thermally conductive layer <b>412</b>, the reflective layer <b>440</b>, the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b>, and the at least one LED <b>220</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the assembly <b>400</b> does not include a support layer (e.g., support layer <b>242</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Instead, the reflective layer <b>440</b> is positioned on standoffs <b>416</b> that are positioned between the first major surface <b>414</b> of the thermally conductive layer <b>412</b> and the reflective layer <b>440</b>. The reflective layer <b>440</b> may be laid on the standoffs <b>416</b>, or the reflective layer <b>440</b> may be attached to the standoffs using, e.g., an adhesive. Any suitable reflective layer described herein may be used with the assembly <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> is positioned on the first major surface <b>414</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that, to prevent the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> from coming into electrical contact with the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>, a dielectric layer may be required between the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> and the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>. Any suitable dielectric layer may be utilized. Further, any suitable technique may be used to form such a dielectric layer on the first major surface <b>414</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>, e.g., chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> may be any suitable type of conductive layer, e.g., patterned conductive layer <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> can include a metallic mesh that is laid onto or attached to the first major surface <b>414</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, for reflective layers that are nonconductive (i.e., dielectric layers), the standoffs <b>416</b> may not be required. Instead, a reflective dielectric layer <b>440</b> may be positioned directly on the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the at least one LED <b>420</b> is electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b> through first and second electrodes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>. Such electrodes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> are electrically connected to conductors <b>452</b> of the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b>. Any suitable technique may be used to electrically connect the LED <b>420</b> with the patterned conductive layer <b>450</b>. For example, the first and second electrodes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> may be ultrasonically bonded to conductors <b>452</b>. Alternatively, the LED <b>420</b> may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b> such that the first and second electrodes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> remain in non-bonded electrical connection with conductors <b>452</b>. In other embodiments, the first and second electrodes <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> may be soldered to conductors <b>452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Any suitable LED or LEDs may be used with the assembly <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For example, the assembly <b>400</b> can include an LED that includes a post a portion of which is embedded in the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b> (e.g., LED <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Such an LED may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate using any suitable technique, e.g., press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. Further, such a post may have a first end that extends beyond the second major surface <b>415</b> of the thermally conductive substrate <b>412</b> similar to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The illumination assemblies of the present disclosure may be used in any suitable manner for providing illumination. For example, some or all of the illumination assemblies described herein may be used to provide illumination for displays. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates a display assembly <b>500</b> that includes an illumination assembly <b>510</b> optically coupled to a display device <b>520</b>. The illumination assembly <b>510</b> may include any illumination assembly described herein, e.g., illumination assembly <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

In some embodiments, the spatial light modulator may include a deformable mirror device (DMD), which is an example of a reflection-type light modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The display device <b>520</b> may include any suitable optical and non-optical elements for producing a display image, e.g., lenses, diffusers, polarizers, filters, beam splitters, brightness enhancement films, etc. The illumination assembly <b>510</b> may be optically coupled to the display device <b>520</b> using any suitable technique known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the display device <b>520</b> may be directly lit by the illumination assembly <b>510</b> In other words, the display device <b>520</b> can be positioned between the illumination assembly <b>510</b> and a viewing position, e.g., those direct-lit displays described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0228106 (Stevenson et al.).
