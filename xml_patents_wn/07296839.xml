<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) from now abandoned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/440,543 filed on Jan. 16, 2003, by Daniel J. Scheerhorn, entitled “Snap-In Coupling Assembly,” the full disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to structures and mechanisms for coupling or connecting one component to another component. In particular, the present invention relates to structures or mechanisms for pivotally coupling or connecting one component to another component. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to a vehicle console having a cover pivotally coupled to a body.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multitude of structures or assemblies are known to exist for coupling or connecting two components to one another. One example of where two components are coupled to one another is that of an armrest of a vehicle such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,314. In this particular example, a cover is coupled to a console. In addition to being simply attached to the console, the cover is also pivotally supported relative to the console. As depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,314, this is achieved by the utilization of a pair of torque fittings that are crimped about a rod secured to the cover and that are further screwed to the console.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This known mechanism for coupling the cover component to the console component has several drawbacks. In particular, screwing the torque fittings to the console is tedious and time consuming, increasing assembly cost. The screws themselves must be inventoried, and reduce the aesthetic attractiveness of the armrest. Disassembling the armrest cover from the console is also complicated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a coupling assembly <b>10</b> which may be utilized in any of a variety of overall assemblies to connect to members or components to one another. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a coupling assembly <b>10</b> prior to complete assembly. Coupling assembly <b>10</b> generally includes component <b>14</b>, projection <b>16</b>, coupling member <b>18</b> and component <b>20</b>. Component <b>14</b> may comprise any structure or assembly which is intended to be coupled to component <b>20</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, the term “coupled” means the joining of two members directly or indirectly to one another. Such joining may be stationary in nature or movable in nature. Such joining may be achieved with the two members or the two members and any additional intermediate members being integrally formed as a single unitary body with one another or with the two members or the two members and any additional intermediate member being attached to one another. Such joining may be permanent in nature or alternatively may be removable or releasable in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Projection <b>16</b> extends from component <b>14</b>. Projection <b>16</b> may be integrally formed as part of a single unitary body with component <b>14</b>, may be pivotally attached to component <b>14</b>, may be fixedly attached to component <b>14</b> or may simply extend through component <b>14</b> and project from component <b>14</b>. Although illustrated as being generally rectangular in shape and rectangular in cross section, projection <b>16</b> may have a variety of alternative configurations and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Projection <b>16</b> generally includes at least one detent surface <b>22</b> configured to mate with a corresponding detent-engaging surface provided on coupling member <b>18</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated, projection <b>16</b> includes at least one bore <b>24</b> providing surface <b>22</b>. Alternatively, surface <b>22</b> may be provided by inwardly formed recesses extending into one or both sides of projection <b>16</b> or other conventionally known structures configured to provide a mechanical interlock.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Coupling member <b>18</b> generally comprises a member configured to mechanically interlock with projection <b>16</b> and at the same time, mechanically interlock with component <b>20</b> so as to couple components <b>14</b> and <b>20</b> to one another. In the example embodiment shown, member <b>18</b> connects to both projection <b>16</b> and component <b>20</b> without a need for optional fasteners such as screws, rivets and the like and without adhesives. Coupling member <b>18</b> generally includes portion <b>26</b>, portion <b>28</b>, pivot portion <b>30</b>, detent-engaging surface <b>32</b>, and detent-engaging surface <b>34</b>. Portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> extend opposite to one another and are configured to generally extend on opposite sides of projection <b>16</b>. Portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are pivotally coupled to one another by pivot portion <b>30</b>. Pivot portion <b>30</b> enables portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> to be pivoted to a closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which detent-engaging surface <b>32</b> engages detent surface <b>22</b> and an open position in which portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are separated from one another to an extent sufficient such that detent-engaging surface <b>32</b> is out of engagement with detent surface <b>22</b> and such that member <b>18</b>, if not additionally secured by other means, may be removed from projection <b>16</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated, portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are integrally formed as part of a single unitary body with one another and are connected to one another by portion <b>30</b> which comprises a living hinge. In such an embodiment, portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be molded or otherwise formed of a first material, while portion <b>30</b> is formed from a different, more flexible material. In yet other embodiments, portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be formed from a single material (including a common mixture of materials), wherein pivot portion <b>30</b> is shaped and/or dimensioned so as to form a living hinge. Although less desirable, in still other embodiments, portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be pivotally coupled to one another by other conventionally known or future developed hinges, hinge structures and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Detent-engaging surface <b>32</b> extends from portion <b>26</b> and is configured to engage detent surface <b>22</b> of projection <b>16</b> so as to mechanically interlock or secure member <b>18</b> to projection <b>16</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated, detent-engaging surface <b>32</b> is provided by a knob or projection <b>36</b> that is configured to extend at least partially into the bore <b>24</b> providing detent-engaging surface <b>22</b>. Although projection <b>36</b> is illustrated as extending from portion <b>26</b>, projection <b>36</b> may alternatively extend from portion <b>28</b>. In other embodiments, both portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be provided with projections <b>36</b> which extend into a single bore <b>24</b> or which extends into distinct spaced apart bores <b>24</b>. In lieu of the projection and bore locking structure shown, projection <b>16</b> and portions <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> may be mechanically locked to one another by other conventionally known detent and detent-engaging surfaces such as hooks and recesses or the like. Furthermore, although projection <b>16</b> is illustrated as including a detent, while member <b>18</b> is configured as including a detent-engaging surface, this association may be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Detent-engaging surfaces <b>34</b> generally comprise surfaces associated with member <b>18</b> that are configured to engage corresponding detents provided in component <b>20</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated, detent-engaging surfaces <b>34</b> are provided by hooks or projections <b>38</b> extending from portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Projections <b>38</b> are preferably formed from a material or are appropriately shaped or dimensioned such that projections <b>38</b> are resiliently flexible so as to enable projections <b>38</b> to elastically deform until an engagement with the detent surface is provided in component <b>20</b>. Although less desirable due to increased complexity, in alternative embodiments, projections <b>38</b> may comprise distinct members coupled to member <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, such distinct members may be movably coupled to member <b>18</b> and may further be resiliently biased to an outwardly extending position (as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a retracted position enabling insertion of member <b>18</b> into a portion of component <b>20</b>. Such resilient biasing may be accomplished by the use of springs and the like. In alternative embodiments, projections <b>38</b> may be relatively rigid, wherein portions of component <b>20</b> adjacent to the detent surfaces are resilient in nature by the appropriate selection of materials and appropriate dimensioning or by the use of springs or other resiliently biasing mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Component <b>20</b> generally comprises any structure, member or assembly which is desired to be coupled to component <b>14</b>. Component <b>20</b> generally includes a recess, cavity or channel <b>50</b> and at least one detent surface <b>52</b>. Channel <b>50</b> is generally configured to receive member <b>18</b>. In addition, channel <b>50</b> is preferably configured such that upon receipt of member <b>18</b>, the interior walls or surfaces <b>54</b> of channel <b>50</b> engage member <b>18</b> to retain portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> in the closed position, thereby preventing dislodgment or disengagement of detent surface <b>22</b> and detent-engaging surface <b>32</b>. As a result, it is not critical that portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> be further secured in the closed position by additional means such as welding or the use of adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Detent surfaces <b>52</b> generally comprise surfaces formed along cavity <b>50</b> which are configured to engage detent-engaging surfaces <b>34</b> of member <b>18</b> when member <b>18</b> is inserted into slot or channel <b>50</b> so as to prevent inadvertent withdrawal of member <b>18</b> from channel <b>50</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated, detent surfaces <b>52</b> are provided by a pair of notches or recesses <b>58</b> extending outwardly from channel <b>50</b>. Recesses <b>58</b> are sized so as to receive at least a portion of projections <b>38</b>. Recesses <b>58</b> are preferably located such that member <b>18</b> is substantially received within channel <b>50</b> and such that component <b>14</b> is in relatively close proximity to component <b>20</b>. In alternative embodiments, the space between components <b>14</b> and <b>20</b> may be varied depending on the particular application of coupling assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In lieu of being provided by recesses <b>58</b>, detent-engaging surfaces <b>52</b> may be provided by a variety of other known depressions, cut-outs or notches. In particular embodiments, at least portions of the interior surface of channel <b>50</b> may be made from a material or otherwise structured so as to be deformable or resiliently flexible, wherein during insertion of member <b>18</b> into channel <b>50</b>, projections <b>38</b> outwardly deform or outwardly flex such surfaces so as to create opposing detent surfaces. In such an embodiment, insertion of member <b>18</b> into channel <b>50</b> would be facilitated but withdrawal of member from channel <b>50</b> would be substantially impeded. In such an embodiment, the resilient nature of the interior surfaces of channel <b>50</b> may be provided by the utilization of resiliently flexible material or may be provided by the utilization of movable surfaces along channel <b>50</b> which are resiliently biased by springs towards a projection-engaging and member-retaining position. Furthermore, although member <b>18</b> is illustrated as including detent-engaging surfaces <b>34</b> and component <b>20</b> is illustrated as including detent surfaces <b>52</b>, this association may be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, although member <b>18</b> is illustrated as a male member configured to be inserted into a generally female component <b>20</b>, this relationship may also be reversed. For example, the lower end of member <b>18</b> may be extended downwardly and may be provided with a cavity configured to receive a projection extending from component <b>20</b>, wherein insertion of the projection of component <b>20</b> into the cavity of member <b>18</b> prevents portions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> from pivoting away from one another and further retains detent-engaging surface <b>32</b> in engagement with detent surface <b>22</b>. In such an embodiment, the projection extending from component <b>20</b> and the projection receiving recess of member <b>18</b> would be provided with corresponding detent and detent-engaging surfaces for retaining member <b>18</b> upon the projection of component <b>20</b>. An example of this alternative structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Coupling assembly <b>10</b> provides an inexpensive and clean mechanism for attaching two components to one another without being overly complicated, without requiring multiple pieces, such as screws, and without requiring extensive time to attach or detach components. Coupling assembly <b>10</b> is especially beneficial in those applications where projection <b>16</b> is formed from a material or is dimensioned such that projection <b>16</b> cannot be easily and directly coupled to another component such as component <b>20</b>. For example, in applications where projection <b>16</b> is made from a material difficult to mold or otherwise form, member <b>18</b> provides an easy add-on that enables projection <b>16</b> and component <b>14</b> to be coupled to component <b>20</b>. In other applications where component <b>16</b> is so thin that achieving necessary tolerances to snap projection <b>16</b> in place to component <b>20</b> is difficult, member <b>18</b> provides an easy add-on to projection <b>16</b>, enabling such coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> illustrate a vehicle console <b>110</b> employing the structures and features of coupling system <b>10</b>.

In particular, in one embodiment, those portions of projections <b>116</b> that face rod <b>123</b> are coated with a polymeric material. The coating can be an epoxy-based material or a polyester having from about 15-20% and nominally 17% of PTFE compounded with a base polymeric material. The thickness of the coating of one embodiment may be from about 0.0005 to 0.001 inch thick. Because projections <b>116</b> are preferably formed from a resilient material such as Martinsite, projections <b>116</b> resiliently return to their initial shape upon receiving excessive loading.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Projections <b>116</b> generally comprise elongate tabs extending from cover <b>114</b> and includes detent surfaces <b>122</b> which are formed by apertures <b>124</b> extending through projections <b>116</b>. Although projections <b>116</b> are each illustrated as including three apertures <b>124</b> which are generally circular in shape, projections <b>116</b> may have greater or a fewer number of apertures <b>124</b> having a variety of different shapes and sizes.

An explanation of the construction of cover assembly <b>230</b>, including base <b>240</b>, cover <b>260</b>, and slide <b>280</b>, is best understood by initially discussing the construction of slide assembly <b>280</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Slide assembly <b>280</b> comprises a generally U-shaped solid steel rod <b>282</b> having a first elongated leg <b>281</b>, a second elongated leg <b>283</b>, and an integral base leg <b>284</b>. Attached to the base leg is a pair of projections <b>116</b> for mounting and, therefore, slide assembly <b>280</b> to the top of rear wall <b>224</b> of body <b>220</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Projections <b>116</b> define a hinge for coupling the cover assembly <b>230</b> to body <b>220</b>. Each projection <b>116</b> has an inner surface which is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene to control the rotation of base leg <b>284</b> and, therefore, the pivot opening of cover assembly <b>230</b> with respect to console body <b>220</b>. The slide assembly <b>280</b> further includes a pair of sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> which can be extruded aluminum members having a generally C-shaped cross section, each with an open bottom slot <b>291</b> and <b>293</b>, respectively, and an interior cross section which corresponds to that of polymeric intermediate slides <b>295</b> and <b>297</b> on rod legs <b>281</b> and <b>283</b> to provide a sliding interface between sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> and U-shaped rod <b>282</b> via the polymeric cylindrical slides <b>295</b> and <b>297</b>. Slides <b>295</b> and <b>297</b> can be of any suitable lubricious polymeric material, such as a silicone-filled acetal such as CELCON.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The slide assembly <b>280</b>, once molded, is secured to both the cover <b>260</b> and base <b>240</b> by inserting the sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> through openings <b>262</b> and <b>264</b> in end wall <b>261</b> of the integrally molded polymeric cover <b>260</b> and through semicylindrical guide bosses <b>263</b> and <b>265</b> spaced along the surface <b>267</b> of cover <b>260</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The trailing edges <b>296</b> of each of the sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> are lockably held within the bosses of cover <b>260</b> by snap-locking tangs <b>266</b>, which engage the edges <b>296</b> of the sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b> to lockably hold the sleeves in fixed position with respect to cover <b>260</b>. The legs <b>281</b> and <b>283</b> of rod <b>282</b> are secured to base <b>240</b> within semicylindrical troughs <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> by means of fastening screws <b>245</b>, which extend through apertures <b>247</b> in troughs <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> in the base <b>240</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Fasteners <b>245</b> extend through slots <b>291</b> and <b>293</b> of sleeves <b>292</b> and <b>294</b>, respectively, thereby allowing cover <b>260</b>, which is lockably mounted to the sleeves, to slide along legs <b>281</b> and <b>283</b> with fasteners <b>245</b> securing rod <b>282</b> to base <b>240</b> and clearing the sleeves <b>292</b>, <b>294</b> during such motion.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Cover <b>260</b> defines an armrest in a preferred embodiment and includes, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> and <b>13</b>, a foam polymeric padded section <b>270</b> with a suitable flexible covering upholstery material <b>272</b>, which can be leather, fabric, vinyl or the like, which extends around the outer peripheral edges <b>268</b> of cover <b>260</b> and is tucked into locking engagement in a peripheral trough <b>269</b> therewith by means of a locking ring <b>274</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Base <b>240</b> and the body of cover <b>260</b> are each integrally molded of a suitable polymeric material such as polycarbonate, thermoplastic resin, or the like, typically used in the automotive environment for interior components.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With base <b>240</b> secured to rod <b>282</b>, which is pivotally mounted to the console wall <b>224</b>, the entire cover assembly, including base <b>240</b> and slidable cover <b>260</b>, can be pivoted to a raised open position exposing storage compartment <b>228</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, by disengaging latch <b>248</b> from catch <b>229</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The cover <b>260</b> can also be slid with respect to base <b>240</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, to multiple detented positions by the detent mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The detent mechanism includes a leaf spring <b>300</b> having a base <b>302</b> which is secured to surface <b>241</b> on base <b>240</b> by suitable attachment means, such as by rivets or the like. Leaf spring <b>300</b> includes a roller follower <b>304</b> at an opposite end which extends upwardly into engagement with a rib <b>276</b> integral with cover <b>260</b> and having a plurality of spaced notches <b>278</b> extending downwardly from the center area of cover floor <b>267</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As cover <b>260</b> is moved with respect to base <b>240</b> by slide <b>280</b>, follower <b>304</b> selectively detents into notches <b>278</b> to releasably hold the cover in an adjusted position, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the cover <b>260</b> includes a downwardly extending wall <b>271</b> which defines a stop preventing the cover <b>260</b> from being withdrawn from the slide assembly <b>280</b> by engaging the edge <b>305</b> of leaf spring <b>300</b>. This prevents removal of the cover from slide assembly <b>280</b>, which is secured to the base <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The top surface <b>243</b> of base <b>240</b> may include a recessed cup holder <b>250</b> and a storage tray <b>252</b>, such that when cover <b>260</b> is moved to a forward position, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the base, which remains over storage compartment <b>228</b>, provides access to additional vertically stacked storage areas or features which supplement the main storage compartment <b>228</b> associated with console <b>410</b>.</p>
