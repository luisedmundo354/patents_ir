<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Oil and gas wells extend from the surface to one or more subterranean formations of rock containing oil and/or gas. The well is typically cased by cementing a steel or other suitable casing in the wellbore. The casing stabilizes the sides of the wellbore, prevents pollution of fresh water reservoirs and/or prevents fluids from zones other than oil and gas producing zones from entering the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cementing operations pump wet cement slurry down a wellbore to fill the space between the casing and the rock walls. The cement protects the casing and prevents water and other fluids from flowing vertically in the space between the casing and rock walls of the wellbore. Typically, cementing operations are designed and supervised by engineers. Laboratory technicians test and select the cement slurry and additives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cement compositions are designed for a variety of wellbore conditions, which may vary in depth, temperature and pressure. In designing a cement composition for a wellbore, a number of potential slurries are typically tested in a laboratory for pumpability, safe placement time and compressive strength. The compressive strength is used as a measure of the ability of the cement composition to provide long-term zonal isolation. Field observations have shown that during life of the well many cemented wells failed as seen by buildup of pressure behind a cemented pipe, leakage of fluids from the formation into the wellbore via cracks and from channels generated in areas where the cement debonded from the casing or formation. Such problems may be remedied by squeezing sealants, such as cement slurries or silicate fluids, into the flowpaths and allowing them to set. Cement sheath failure may be due to cyclical pressure and temperature changes experienced by cement sheath from various well operations such as completion, pressure testing, fracturing and remedial operations. Simulation of cement sheath durability in realistic, large-scale wellbore models has been performed using a full-scale wellbore model in which cement is pumped between a full-size liner and a pipe representing the subterranean formation of the wellbore. The full-scale models have been performance tested by cycling pressure and temperature under wellbore conditions.</p>

The variable temperature system <b>124</b> may be connected to and controlled by controller <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During the cement shrinkage test, temperature of the variable temperature system <b>124</b> and/or temperature block <b>40</b> are set and/or adjusted to a curing condition. The curing condition is a temperature change and/or other specific cure conditions for which the sample cement composition <b>110</b> is being designed. For example, the curing condition may also comprise a pressure change.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the sample cement composition <b>110</b> cures, cement shrinkage may be measured by noting a drop in level of dye liquid in the pipette <b>120</b> as a function time. After curing is complete, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> may be tested for durability at an operational condition. The operational condition is a drilling, completion, production and/or other operational condition for which the sample cement composition <b>110</b> is being designed.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For the sheath failure test, temperature of the temperature block <b>40</b> and/or variable temperature system <b>124</b> are set and/or adjusted to an operational condition. The temperature of the temperature block <b>40</b> may be set to correspond to that of the formation(s) surrounding the wellbore while the temperature of the variable temperature system <b>124</b> is cycled to match those of/or expected in the wellbore. Actual and/or expected temperature cycles of the wellbore may also be accelerated during testing.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">During the sheath failure test, dye liquid flows from the autoclave <b>152</b> into distributor <b>100</b> and is distributed across the base of the sample cement composition <b>110</b>. The dye liquid flows through any micro-annulus fractures, cracks or other permeability formed in the sample cement composition <b>110</b> during the sheath failure test. The sheath failure test may continue for a predetermined or other suitable period of time or until dye is observed in the dye catch container <b>154</b> indicating sheath failure of the sample cement composition <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Upon completion of the sheath failure test, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> may be removed from the test cell <b>42</b> and examined to determine the failure path. For example, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> may be sectioned and dye traces examined to determine failure path through the sample cement composition <b>110</b>. The time until sheath failure for the sample cement composition <b>110</b> and/or failure path may be recorded and used to determine relative durability of the sample cement composition <b>110</b> to other sample cement compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a durability test for the sample cement composition <b>110</b> in the test cell <b>42</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For the sheath failure test, pressure in the inner pipe <b>52</b> and temperature of the temperature block <b>40</b> may be set and/or adjusted to an operational condition. The volume control pump <b>162</b> pumps fluid from fluid supply <b>164</b> to regulate pressure in the inner pipe <b>52</b> and thus applied to the sample cement composition. For example, pressure cycling may match those of the wellbore or be otherwise suitably based on those of the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sheath failure testing may continue for a specified or other suitable period of time or until dye is observed in the dye catch container <b>154</b>. After completion of the sheath failure test, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> may be removed from the test cell <b>42</b> and examined to determine the failure path. The time until sheath failure and/or failure rate may be recorded as a function of volume of fluid collected versus time and used to compare the durability of sample cement composition <b>110</b> to other sample cement compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, sheath failure may be tested with pressure and temperature variation applied to the sample cement composition <b>110</b> by the inner pipe <b>52</b>. In this embodiment, the variable temperature system <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be used with a back flow valve (or other suitable circulation and pressure control) coupled to the bottom stem <b>72</b><i>b </i>or elsewhere in the fluid return line of the variable temperature system <b>124</b>. The pump <b>126</b> and back flow valve may be used to vary pressure in the inner pipe <b>52</b> and thus on the sample cement composition <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a method for designing a cement composition for a cementing operation in a wellbore. The method begins at step <b>180</b> in which laboratory screening of a number of sample cement compositions is performed. In one embodiment, one or more sample cement compositions <b>110</b>, for example, 10 or 20 or more, may be screened using the laboratory apparatus <b>10</b> and test cell <b>42</b>. The laboratory screening may comprise cement shrinkage, sheath failure or other suitable testing in response to variable and/or cyclic pressure, temperature or other stress conditions. During laboratory screening, new sample cement compositions <b>110</b> may be designed based on tested sample cement compositions <b>110</b>. For example, additives, density and/or strength may be adjusted between sample cement compositions <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Based on laboratory screening, a subset of the sample cement compositions may be selected for full-scale testing. In one embodiment, each of the selected sample cement compositions <b>110</b> may have performed well under the variable stress conditions expected during curing and operational conditions in the wellbore. For example, the selected sample cement compositions <b>110</b> may comprise those with the least cement shrinkage and the greatest durability. In another embodiment, the selected sample cement compositions <b>110</b> may comprise the least expensive compositions with suitable performance during testing. The full-scale testing may be performed using a full or other large-scale wellbore model in which cement is pumped between a full-size liner and a pipe, epoxy, sand or other suitable material representing the subterranean formation of the wellbore. The full-scale model may be performance tested by cycling pressure and temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Proceeding to step <b>182</b>, full-scale testing is performed. Full-scale testing may be performed by cementing a section of a full-size liner in a block representing the rock formation of the wellbore. Full-scale testing may be performed in the field with pressure and temperature changes cycled as described herein to correspond to core and operational conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Step <b>184</b> leads to the end of the process by which a large number of sample cement compositions <b>110</b> may have been tested under cyclic pressure and temperature conditions to provide an improved one or more cement compositions for full-scale testing or use in the cementing operation in the wellbore. Accordingly, the final slurry design may be enhanced. At step <b>184</b>, a best performing or other suitable sample cement composition <b>110</b> is selected for the cementing operation in the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a method for testing sample cement compositions <b>110</b> in test cell <b>42</b>. The method begins at step <b>190</b> in which the test cell <b>42</b> is prepared. As previously described, the test cell <b>42</b> may be prepared by installing the mesh screen <b>102</b> and sand <b>104</b>, saturating the sand <b>104</b> and pouring the sample cement composition <b>110</b> into the test chamber <b>56</b>. Thereafter, the test chamber <b>56</b> may be sealed by fastening the top end cap <b>54</b><i>a </i>to the outer pipe <b>50</b> and connecting the test cell <b>42</b> to the variable temperature and/or pressure systems <b>124</b> and <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Proceeding to step <b>192</b>, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> is tested for cement shrinkage during curing at a curing condition. During curing, the pressure and/or temperature of the outer pipe <b>50</b> and/or inner pipe <b>52</b> may be controlled to correspond to the curing condition. Cement shrinkage of the sample cement composition <b>110</b> may be measured using the pipette <b>120</b> and recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>194</b>, the sample cement composition <b>110</b> is tested for durability at an operational condition. Durability testing may be performed by determining sheath failure or other permeability change of the sample cement composition <b>110</b> in response to operational conditions of the wellbore. As described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the results from shrinkage testing and durability testing may be used to select a cement composition for the cementing operation in the wellbore or used to select a plurality of samples for full-scale or other suitable testing.</p>
