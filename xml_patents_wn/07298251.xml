<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of contact-less identification such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and, in particular, to hand held RFID readers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Identification and tracking of tangible objects are essential in a multiplicity of industries. Automatic identification systems are replacing manual identification as automatic systems are more accurate, more efficient and more cost-effective. A key feature of automatic identification systems is remote or contact-less identification. Remote identification improves the accuracy of inventory identification, dramatically reduces the effort required, and allows potentially instant verification of inventory. Typical remote identification systems include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Incorporating RFID technology reduces the time, cost and effort for performing identification and tracking when compared to manual methods while significantly improving the accuracy. RFID technology also provides a safer means for identification and tracking both in hazardous environments and identification and tracking of hazardous materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, a typical RFID systems consists of a transmitter (tag) and a receiver (reader). The tag can be either a passive identification device or an active identification device. A passive tag typically is powered by an external means. One embodiment powers the tag from the reader via a magnetic field generated by the reader. A typical active RFID tag contains its own battery for power. A tag is affixed to an object to be identified. The transmitter sends a radio frequency interrogation signal that activates the tag and the tag emits a signal that identifies the object to which it is attached. The reader could be able to distinguish the identification signals from a single tag or a group of RFID tags. RFID tag readers can be found in two manifestations: hand held readers and fixed readers. The selection of a fixed or handheld reader depends on the application in which it is used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When designing a handheld reader, there are a multiplicity of factors that need to be taken into account. One of the paramount considerations is that the size, weight, and shape of the reader is manageable by a typical user without excessively compromising the functionality of the reader. A key area for size reduction is the antenna used by a handheld reader. The antenna is used to excite the tag in order to elicit a response that identifies the item to which the tag is attached. Unfortunately, reductions in antenna size also result in reductions in antenna efficiency. Antenna efficiency is a measure of the amount of signal power that an antenna radiates to its environment relative to the amount of power supplied to the antenna. It is desirable to keep antenna efficiency as high as possible as low antenna efficiency requires higher power transmitters and this directly reduces battery life in a handheld reader. Frequently, the antenna size is so small and antenna efficiency is so low that the performance of the handheld reader as measured by its usable range is inadequate for many applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the reasons stated above and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for a hand held RFID reader that provides better performance over existing RFID readers in a variety of environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of the antenna gain pattern of a compact antenna that enables receiving signals by a hand held RFID reader, indicated generally at <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the gain is sub-optimal in that the antenna gain never approaches unity. This indicates that the antenna does not efficiently receive or transmit signals. Low antenna efficiency can degrade battery life in portable devices such as an handheld RFID reader by requiring a higher power transmitter to achieve a radiated signal power equivalent to that produced by a lower power transmitter and a more efficient antenna. Also, low antenna gain impacts the apparent usable range of the receiver as some of the signal that reaches the antenna is lost and causes the receiver to be unable to detect weak signals. The overall result of this is lower performance in the handheld reader and the performance may become sufficiently impaired as to affect the usability of the handheld reader.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration of the antenna gain pattern of a full-sized dipole antenna, indicated generally at <b>200</b> that enables receiving signals in a hand held RFID reader. Antenna gain pattern <b>200</b> indicates the antenna gain is nearly unity at a range of angles. This indicates that the antenna has a preferred orientation for optimum gain and is very efficient at receiving signal from those directions. In a typical RFID reader, the antenna is oriented so that the antenna “points” in the direction from which RFID tag signals are most likely to originate. This results in efficient radiation of transmitted signals and also results in best sensitivity of the reader when receiving signals from tags. Generally speaking, a full-sized antenna has higher gain than a compact antenna and results in improved performance of the RFID reader vis-à-vis a compact antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a hand held RFID reader, indicated generally at <b>300</b>. As illustrated, the hand held RFID reader in <b>300</b> comprises a housing <b>305</b>, power source <b>307</b>, antenna <b>310</b>, a transceiver <b>312</b>, an interface module <b>314</b>, a processor <b>315</b>, a bus <b>316</b>, a memory <b>317</b>, a display <b>318</b> and an input/output device <b>320</b>. Power source <b>307</b> provides power required for the operation of the hand held RFID reader <b>300</b>. In one embodiment, antenna <b>310</b> is coupled to transceiver <b>312</b> using a coaxial feed-line <b>311</b>. Transceiver <b>312</b> both receives and generates the radio frequency signals from antenna <b>310</b>. The interface module <b>314</b> facilitates the communication of signals between the transceiver <b>312</b> and other modules in the reader.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, display <b>318</b> and input/output device <b>320</b> are coupled to processor <b>315</b> and memory <b>317</b> through bus <b>316</b>. Display <b>318</b> is used to display RFID tag identification information and sundry other information received from interface module <b>314</b>. Input/Output device <b>320</b> could be used to select which programs stored in memory <b>317</b> to run in order to perform desired operations and could also allow the reader to be connected to outside devices via input/output device <b>320</b> for purposes such as loading new programs, offloading data from tags that have been read, and other tasks as desired. The programs accessed in memory <b>317</b> are processed in processor <b>315</b>. Data may be entered at the input/output device <b>320</b> using a keypad, touch screen, or other type of data entry device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, dipole antenna <b>310</b> of the RFID reader <b>300</b> receives signals transmitted by RFID tags. The tag signals contain tag identification and other information. The tag signals received at dipole antenna <b>310</b> are received by transceiver <b>312</b>. Transceiver <b>312</b> passes the data contained within the terminated RFID tag signal to interface module <b>314</b>. Interface module <b>314</b> receives the data from the tags and presents this data to internal databus <b>316</b> where it is manipulated by processor <b>315</b>. Processor <b>315</b> may translate the data to a format recognizable by display <b>318</b>, prepare the data for input/output device <b>320</b>, store the data in memory <b>317</b>, or any admixture of the aforementioned processes. In one embodiment, display <b>318</b> displays a list of all the RFID tag information carried by the signals from the tag and received at the RFID reader. In another embodiment, RFID reader <b>300</b> creates a list of RFID tags that is has received after interrogating the RFID tags and then compares the received list of RFID tag identification to a pre-selected list of RFID tag information stored in memory <b>317</b> to check for the presence or absence of specific RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of one embodiment of a dipole antenna assembly, indicated generally at <b>400</b>. As illustrated, dipole antenna assembly <b>400</b> comprises a coaxial feed-line <b>311</b>, a balun <b>412</b> and antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b>. Antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> receive signals from RFID tags and couples the signal to coaxial feedline <b>311</b>. Coaxial feed-line <b>311</b> carries the signal to a transceiver located within the RFID reader. Balun <b>412</b> is a balanced-unbalanced transformer. Balun <b>412</b> enables coupling balanced antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> to unbalanced coaxial cable <b>311</b>. In one embodiment, antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> are made of equal lengths. In a full-sized antenna, each of antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> are very nearly equal in length and the length is governed by the frequency at which the antenna is designed to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of the dipole antenna installed inside a hand held RFID reader <b>500</b> with the back cover <b>504</b> removed. As illustrated, hand held RFID reader <b>500</b> includes a non-conductive hand held RFID reader housing <b>510</b>, a separation <b>511</b> between antenna wire <b>410</b> and the inner edge <b>513</b> of the housing. An identical separation exists between antenna wire <b>514</b> and the inner edge <b>513</b> of the housing. The size of the separation <b>511</b> is not important. The coaxial cable <b>311</b> passes through an orifice <b>512</b> into an inner cavity <b>514</b>. In one embodiment, the orifice is replaced with a connector that effectively connects the coaxial cable <b>311</b> to the inner cavity. In this illustration, the dipole antenna assembly <b>400</b> includes antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b>, a balun <b>412</b>, and a coaxial feed-line <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> are wrapped along a perimeter <b>511</b> of the inner edge <b>513</b> inside housing <b>510</b> of hand held RFID reader <b>500</b> to provide a compact design for hand held RFID reader <b>500</b>. Placing of full sized dipole antenna assembly <b>400</b> in this manner inside hand held RFID reader <b>500</b> takes advantage of the antenna gain inherent in a full-sized antenna and enables better performance of hand held RFID reader <b>500</b>. Antenna wires <b>410</b> and <b>414</b> are coupled to a balun <b>412</b> which in turn is coupled to a coaxial feed-line <b>311</b>. Hand held RFID reader housing <b>510</b> includes an inner cavity <b>514</b> that contains the necessary components required for the operation of the RFID reader <b>500</b>. In one embodiment, coaxial feed-line <b>311</b> enters into inner cavity <b>514</b> through an orifice <b>512</b> to connect with a transceiver located within inner cavity <b>514</b>, balun <b>412</b> is mounted on housing <b>510</b>. Other embodiments are possible. Back cover <b>504</b> attaches to the back of housing <b>510</b> and protects antenna assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of the front of a hand held RFID reader, indicated generally at <b>600</b>. In this embodiment, the front view of hand held RFID reader <b>600</b> includes housing <b>510</b>, display <b>602</b>, key pad <b>604</b> and keys <b>606</b>. Display <b>602</b> lists the RFID tag information captured by the hand RFID reader <b>600</b>. Key pad <b>604</b> includes a number of individual keys <b>606</b> that may be used to operate the RFID reader and may also be used to enter data that is to be programmed into the RFID tag. Other embodiments are possible where the usage of the keypad and display vary from this illustrative example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustration of one embodiment of an environment where handheld RFID readers are used, indicated generally at <b>700</b>. In this illustrated, environment <b>700</b> includes building <b>720</b>, a reflecting wall <b>730</b> forming an enclosure <b>740</b>, a person <b>750</b> carrying a hand held RFID reader <b>760</b>, RFID tags <b>722</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>722</b>-N that are attached to objects. Transmitted RFID tag signals are received by hand held RFID reader <b>760</b> carried by person <b>750</b>. The RFID tags transmit unique identification numbers and possibly additional information related to or derived from the object to which they are attached.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation, person <b>750</b> moves within enclosure <b>740</b> of building <b>720</b> to capture the transmitted RFID tag information using hand held RFID reader <b>760</b>. In one embodiment, building <b>720</b> is an ammunition magazine with an igloo shaped structure. RFID tags <b>722</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>722</b>-N are attached to ammunition containers which may or may not have metal casings. The RFID tags transmit signal and some of the transmitted signals are received directly at hand held RFID reader <b>760</b> whereas others are reflected by either the wall <b>730</b> or other objects which could be the items to which RFID tags <b>722</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>722</b>-N within enclosure <b>740</b> of building <b>720</b> are attached.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Because of possible multiple reflections (multipath) of transmitted RF signals from both the tags <b>722</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>722</b>-N and the handheld reader <b>760</b>, the strength of the signal received by the handheld reader may be very weak. If a compact antenna were used in the handheld reader, the attendant reduction in antenna gain could cause these signals to be sufficiently weak as to prevent accurate reception and correct decoding. Because of the higher antenna gain of a full-sized dipole antenna, the handheld reader is capable of reading RF signals that are much weaker than could be read by a handheld reader with a compact antenna. Thus, the useful range of the handheld reader is increased and this increases the utility of the handheld reader.</p>
