<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a developing device used in an image forming apparatus such as copying machine, printer or facsimile that utilizes electronic photography technique and, more particularly, to a developing device of non-contact developing system wherein a toner included in a developing agent held onto a magnetic roller is caused to deposit on the surface of a developing roller and then move onto an electrostatic latent image, thereby developing the electrostatic latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There have been various methods employed by image forming apparatuses that utilize electronic photography technique. Single-drum color superposition system where images of different colors are formed successively on a single photosensitive body has been regarded as a promising technique that makes high-quality color imaging possible, since it allows full-color image formation with less color registration error by precisely depositing the toners of different colors one after another on the photosensitive body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, meanwhile, much attention has been focused on tandem-drum system where images are formed with toners of different colors on a plurality of corresponding photosensitive bodies, and the images formed on the respective photosensitive bodies are superposed one after another on a transfer member in synchronization with feeding of the transfer member, thereby to form a full-color image. Although this system has an advantage of high-speed operation, there is such a disadvantage that one set of imaging means such as photosensitive bodies and a developing device must be provided for each color and arranged in tandem, thus resulting in larger size of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To counter this problem, such a compact tandem engine image forming apparatus is proposed that is provided with imaging means made smaller in size by decreasing the space between the photosensitive bodies. In the compact tandem engine image forming apparatus, it is advantageous to dispose the developing device in vertical construction in order to decrease the horizontal size of the imaging means. In other words, it is preferable that the members such as the developing roller, a magnetic roller, stirring-transfer means, etc. that constitute the developing device are disposed right above or obliquely above the photosensitive body, rather than in the same plane as the photosensitive body as in the case of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of a developing system that employs a two-component developing agent, however, decreasing the apparatus in size results in such problems as the deposition of carrier onto the photosensitive body and scattering of the toner. When the developing device is made smaller in vertical construction, in particular, circulation, of the developing agent, namely supply of the developing agent from a position near the stirring-transfer means to the developing roller, becomes so complicated that the problems of deposition of the carrier onto the photosensitive body and scattering of the toner become more conspicuous, thus imposing a limitation to the size reduction of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Means for solving the problems of deposition of the carrier onto the photosensitive body are described in Patent Documents 1 through 3 described below that propose a developing device and an image forming apparatus provided with the developing device (hybrid developing system). The developing device comprises stirring-transfer means, a magnetic roller and a developing roller that are disposed in a housing, which contains a two-component developing agent. The stirring-transfer means transfers the developing agent while stirring it. The magnetic roller transfers the developing agent while holding it on the circumferential surface thereof. The developing roller is disposed to oppose the magnetic roller at a predetermined space therefrom and attracts the toner included in the developing agent held by the magnetic roller to deposit electrostatically thereon. With this system, deposition of the carrier onto the photosensitive body is suppressed and the problem of depletion of the carrier becomes less likely to occur, since the carrier does not fly toward the photosensitive body and returns to the magnetic roller even when a small amount of carrier moves from the magnetic roller to the developing roller and deposits thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the hybrid developing system described above, residual toner that has not been used in development and remains on the developing roller is scraped off by a magnetic brush provided on the magnetic roller, while some of the residual toner may not be completely cleaned and remain on the developing roller. When the residual toner is not completely cleaned, part of the previous picture may remain as a ghost in the next development process in the so-called hysteresis phenomenon (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). If the residual toner is not completely cleaned after development, there also occurs a problem that the toner sticks onto the developing roller and does not fly to the photosensitive body.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a developing device that is capable of preventing imaging defect (ghost) from taking place and toner from sticking onto the developing roller, a full-color image forming apparatus that is provided with the same, and a two-component developing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">The developing device of the present invention comprises stirring-transfer means, a magnetic roller and a developing roller that are disposed in a housing which contains a two-component developing agent comprising a magnetic carrier and a non-magnetic toner. The stirring-transfer means transfers the developing agent while stirring it. The magnetic roller has a magnetic sleeve and a plurality of magnetic poles disposed along the circumferential direction within the magnetic sleeve, and transfers the developing agent while holding it on the surface of the magnetic sleeve. The developing roller is disposed to oppose the magnetic roller at a predetermined space therefrom and attracts the toner included in the developing agent that is held by the magnetic roller to deposit electrostatically thereon. The non-magnetic toner has a volumetric mean particle size in a range from 6 to 11 μm, and proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm is 8% by number or less.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">The inventor of the present application found that imaging defect (ghost) and sticking of the toner onto the developing roller can be prevented from taking place and good images can be obtained by controlling the volumetric mean particle size of the non-magnetic toner and particle size distribution on the side of small particle size within ranges suitable for the hybrid development system. When the proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm is higher than 8% by number, problems such as imaging defect (ghost) and sticking of the toner onto the developing roller become more likely to occur. When the volumetric mean particle size of the toner is less than 6 μm, it may become difficult for the toner to fly from the developing roller to the photosensitive body, thus resulting in lower image density. When the volumetric mean particle size of the toner exceeds 11 μm, on the other hand, resolution of the image may become lower.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">The magnetic carrier of the present invention preferably has saturation magnetization of 35 to 50 emu/g and volumetric mean particle size of 35 to 50 μm. This makes it possible to reliably prevent the carrier from sticking onto the photosensitive body, for the carrier to separate more efficiently from the magnetic roller, and to form a more uniform thin toner layer on the developing roller.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">The developing device of the present invention preferably has such a vertical constitution as the stirring-transfer means is disposed in the first quadrant and the developing roller is disposed in the third quadrant of an orthogonal coordinate system having the origin at the center of rotation of the magnetic roller. This constitution makes it possible to decrease the image forming apparatus in size. Moreover, such a constitution may be employed as the developing device and the toner container to be mounted on the developing device can be easily installed in and removed from the image forming apparatus from above, and simplify the jamming processing and other mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">The developing device of the present invention is preferably used in a tandem engine color image forming apparatus provided with a plurality of imaging means arranged in a substantially horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">A developing device of the present invention and a tandem engine color image forming apparatus provided therewith will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">The developing device of the present invention is based on the hybrid development system described above, where a two-component developing agent consisting of a magnetic carrier and a non-magnetic toner is contained. The non-magnetic toner of the developing agent has a volumetric mean particle size in a range from 6 to 11 μm, and proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm is 8% by number or less. The magnetic carrier of the present invention preferably has saturation magnetization of 35 to 50 emu/g and volumetric mean particle size of 35 to 50 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">The toner of too large particle size results in low resolution. When particle size of the toner is too small, on the other hand, it may become difficult for the toner to fly from the developing roller to the photosensitive drum, and a proper image density cannot be achieved. Therefore, volumetric mean particle size of the toner is preferably in the range described above. When the proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm is higher than 8% by number, the toner sticks onto the developing roller surface thus leading to such problems as imaging defect (ghost) and low image density. In order to achieve a more finely formed magnetic brush on the magnetic roller surface and supply a sufficient amount of toner by the magnetic brush to the developing roller, volumetric mean particle size of the carrier is preferably in the range described above.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">The volumetric mean particle size of the toner is measured by using Coulter Counter Multisizer II E (manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). 0.1 to 5 ml of a surface surfactant is added as a dispersant to 100 to 150 ml of an electrolyte solution (1% solution of NaCl in water prepared using extra pure sodium chloride), and 0.5 to 50 mg of specimen (toner) is added to suspend in the solution. Then the solution is subjected to dispersion process for about 1 to 3 minutes with an ultrasonic dispersing machine, before determining the particle volume distribution of the particles measuring from 2 to 40 μm in size by means of the Coulter Counter Multisizer II E using a 100 μm aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">The volumetric mean particle size of the carrier can be measured by using a laser diffraction/scatter particle size distribution measuring instrument (for example, LA-500 manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. After weighing 10 g of specimen, the specimen is put little by little into a sample holder containing 100 ml of methanol as a medium, while stirring. The sample solution is caused to flow into a laser irradiation chamber <b>33</b> by a circulation pump <b>32</b> while stirring and dispersing the sample solution in an ultrasonic dispersion bath <b>31</b>. Laser beam emitted by a He—Ne laser <b>34</b> is spread by a beam spreader <b>35</b> and directed into the laser irradiation chamber <b>33</b>. Then diffracted light ray M is focused by a collector lens <b>36</b> onto a detector <b>37</b> where it is detected. Detected signal is processed by an AD converter <b>39</b>, then by an arithmetic operation unit <b>38</b> that calculates the particle size distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">Saturation magnetization of the carrier is measured by means of a vibrating sample magnetometer (model VSM-P7-15 manufactured by TOEI INDUSTRY CO., LTD.). An exclusive container filled with the specimen is weighed and set on a sample holder, and saturation magnetization is measured in the applied magnetic field of 3.98×10<sup>5 </sup>A/m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">When scraping the residual toner, that has not been used in development process, off the developing roller by means of the magnetic brush of the developing agent formed on the magnetic roller, it is effective to increase the scraping force by using a carrier having a higher magnetic flux density. In the developing device of the present invention, however, it is preferable to use a carrier having low magnetic flux density, namely a carrier having saturation magnetization in the range described above, in order to remove the residual toner from the developing roller, deposit fresh toner that is sufficiently charged onto the developing roller, and form a uniform and thin toner layer on the developing roller. Use of the carrier having low magnetic flux density makes it possible to form a soft magnetic brush so as to form a uniform and thin toner layer on the developing roller. When a carrier having a higher saturation magnetization is used, on the other hand, it becomes difficult to separate the carrier from the magnetic roller resulting in such a defect as the pitch pattern of proximate stirring-transfer means (such as paddle mixer) appears in the picture. Such an unevenness caused in mixing (pitch pattern) can be eliminated by using the carrier having low saturation magnetization which reduces the magnetic restrictive force and makes it easier to separate the carrier from the magnetic roller.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The greatest problem of the carrier having low magnetic flux density, namely sticking of the carrier, can be solved by employing the hybrid developing system where the toner is transferred from the magnetic brush formed on the magnetic roller onto the developing roller so as to form a thin toner layer on the developing roller, while the toner flies to the photosensitive body, since in this case the carrier does not fly to the photosensitive body even when a small amount of the carrier from the magnetic roller deposits on the developing roller. In other words, it is known that sticking of the carrier occurs in an area of the same color when the carrier has a low resistivity. According to the present invention, volume resistivity of the carrier is set to a value from about 10<sup>8 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>Ω·cm and a gap is provided between the developing roller and the photosensitive body, so that only the toner from the magnetic roller is caused to deposit on the developing roller and the carrier does not deposit on the developing roller, thereby causing only the toner to fly. Should a small amount of the carrier moves from the magnetic roller to the developing roller and deposits thereon, the carrier does not fly toward the photosensitive body but returns to the magnetic roller. As a result, it is not necessary to provide a constitution for replenishing the developing agent or recover the sticking carrier since depletion of the developing agent does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">The carrier having a low magnetic flux density can be manufactured by increasing an impurity of ferrite carrier, while a composition that includes Sn has been recently proposed as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 11-202559. A carrier having saturation magnetization of 35 emu/g or less includes a higher concentration of impurity that makes it necessary to set the firing conditions to tight tolerance, and therefore sufficient ferrite reaction cannot be achieved. As a result, the carrier tends to have rough surface which leads to such problems as volume production becomes unstable when the carrier surface is covered with a coating material, and variability in the electric resistance that makes it inappropriate for practical use.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0052">A positively charged organic photosensitive material (positive OPC), a-si photosensitive material or the like may be used as the photosensitive material of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>. When the positive OPC is used, ozone is less likely to be generated and stable charging can be achieved. A positive OPC having single-layer structure, in particular, experiences less variation in the photosensitivity characteristic and provides stable picture quality even when the film thickness changes after being used over a long period of time, and is suitable for a system having a long service life. The positive OPC used in a system having a long service life is preferably formed in a film having thickness in a range from 20 to 40 μm. In the case of film thickness of less than 20 μm, when the film thickness decreases to about 10 μm, black spots will appear conspicuously due to insulation breakdown. When the film thickness is more than 40 μm, sensitivity decreases, thus making a cause of lower image density.</p>

Thus the developing agent held on the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> touches the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> as a layer of constant thickness. The magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> is under a predetermined DC bias voltage V<b>1</b> applied thereto by the first DC power source <b>136</b>, and the developing roller <b>140</b> is under a predetermined DC bias voltage V<b>2</b> applied thereto by the second DC power source <b>142</b>. Therefore, a thin layer is formed on the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> solely from the toner attracted thereto by the potential difference V<b>1</b>-V<b>2</b> between the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the developing roller <b>140</b>. A toner layer of about 1.0 to 1.5 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>is formed on the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> by setting the DC bias voltage V<b>1</b> of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> to 400 V and setting the DC bias voltage V<b>2</b> of the developing roller <b>140</b> to a level of 100 to 150 V. At this time, proper level of charging the developing agent is from about 10 to 20 μC/g. When the charge is less than 10 μC/g, the toner scatters conspicuously. When the charge is more than 20 μC/g, the toner that forms the thin layer is difficult to fly to the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">The toner deposited on the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> can be caused to fly to the electrostatic latent image formed on the circumferential surface of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> and effect development, by applying the bias voltage comprising DC voltage and AC voltage to the developing roller <b>140</b>. In order to prevent the toner from scattering, the AC bias voltage is applied to the developing roller <b>140</b> immediately before the development process. Specifically, the predetermined AC bias voltage is applied to the developing roller <b>140</b> by the AC power source <b>144</b> immediately before the development process, so as to superpose on the predetermined DC bias voltage V<b>2</b> that has been applied to the developing roller, <b>140</b> by the second DC power source <b>142</b>. Balancing of the image density, reproduction of dots and removal of fog can be achieved by setting the AC bias voltage Vp-p (peak-to-peak voltage) to 1.5 kV and frequency f to 3.0 KHz. Development ghost can be suppressed by setting the duty ratio to 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Measurement of the potential of the toner layer on the developing roller <b>140</b> across the surface shows about 320 V, indicating that development is effectively carried out by a voltage of 250 V, that is 320 V-70 V (voltage of photosensitive material after maximum exposure). The gap between the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> is set to 400 μm. While the gap between the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b> and the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> is controlled in accordance to the particle size of the magnetic carrier, for example, when the two-component developing agent consisting of the magnetic carrier having volumetric mean particle size of 35 μm and 10% non-magnetic toner is used, the gap is set to a value between 400 to 500 μm so that the magnetic brush makes contact with the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b>. When the gap between the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> is too small, the two-component developing agent cannot pass through the gap between the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the developing roller <b>140</b> and overflows. When the gap is too large, on the other hand, the two-component developing agent cannot make contact with the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b>, making it difficult to recover the toner from the developing roller <b>140</b>. When the development operations are repeated under this condition, the toner sticks to the circumferential surface of the developing roller <b>140</b> and cannot fly to the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>. These problems can be alleviated by setting the gap to a value between 400 to 500 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">Since the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b> made of a magnetic material is disposed so as to substantially oppose, at an outside position in the radial direction, the clipping magnetic pole N<b>3</b> disposed on the stationary permanent magnet <b>134</b> of the magnetic roller <b>130</b>, magnetic field is formed in the space between the magnetic roller <b>130</b> and the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b>. By controlling the transfer property of the magnetic brush formed on the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and applying knurling or sand blast treatment to the surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> so as to increase the transfer performance in this constitution, it is made possible to relax the gap margin between the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">The two-component developing agent contained in the first rotary spiral blade member <b>112</b> is sucked up through adsorption by the circumferential surface of the rotating magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, thereby forming the magnetic brush. As the magnetic brush that has passed through the space between the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b> passes along the developing roller <b>140</b>, only the non-magnetic toner is supplied to the developing roller <b>140</b>. The magnetic brush, from which only the non-magnetic toner is supplied to the developing roller <b>140</b>, is transferred into the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b> while being adsorbed onto the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, before being removed from the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and returning into the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b>. The two-component developing agent that has returned into the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b> is transferred while being stirred together with other two-component developing agent by the first and second rotary spiral blade members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> along the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b> and the second developing agent stirring chamber <b>114</b>, respectively. When there is shortage in the quantity of the toner in the developing chamber, the toner is replenished from the toner container <b>100</b>A by the known manner. This process needs to be repeated in order to copy a color image on a number of sheets of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0071">In order to remove the magnetic brush from the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, it is the easiest way to remove it downward (in the direction of gravity). However, this results in laterally longer construction of the developing device <b>100</b> which compromises the size reduction of the image forming apparatus and is not desirable. As described previously, in the developing device <b>100</b> of this embodiment, for the purpose of size reduction of the image forming apparatus, the first and second rotary spiral blade members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are disposed in the first quadrant and the developing roller <b>140</b> is disposed within the third quadrant. For this reason, it is necessary to lift and remove the magnetic brush from which only the toner has been supplied to the developing roller <b>140</b> in the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, from below to a position above the horizontal position on the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, specifically from the third quadrant and the fourth quadrant up to the first quadrant.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0072">The magnetic brush may be removed from the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> by disposing the permanent magnets of the same polarity stationary inside, and forming the minimum magnetic force region described above. When the magnetic brush is lifted to the horizontal position, however, even if the minimum magnetic force region generated by the repulsive magnetic force exists, if the minimum magnetic force region is near the horizontal position, the magnetic brush does not fully return to the developing chamber (the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b>), and a part of the magnetic brush, namely the magnetic carrier and/or non-magnetic toner, leaks from the developing chamber downward (into the fourth quadrant). When the minimum magnetic force region is disposed at a position near the second quadrant, in contrast, the magnetic brush cannot be fully removed but passes through the gap between the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b>, thus resulting in an undesirable state of separation failure where the same magnetic brush continues to remain on the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>. In the event of separation failure, the image density significantly decreases after developing on merely several sheets of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">According to the present invention, the region where least perpendicular magnetization is the lowest, namely the minimum magnetic force region, is formed between the pair of magnetic poles N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b> of the same polarity by the repulsing magnetic force of the pair of magnetic poles of the same polarity in the stationary permanent magnet <b>134</b> incorporated in the magnetic roller <b>130</b>. By locating the minimum magnetic force region within a range of angles from 35 to 60 degrees in the first quadrant, two problems of the separation failure of the developing agent and the leakage from the developing chamber downward (into the fourth quadrant) as described above can be solved simultaneously. Specifically, in the development process, the magnetic brush from which only the non-magnetic toner is supplied to the developing roller <b>140</b>, is transferred into the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b> while being adsorbed onto the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b>, before being removed from the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> in the region of 0 tesla and returning into the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b>. Since the minimum magnetic flux density region is located within a range of angles from 35 to 60 degrees in the first quadrant, the magnetic brush can surely return to the developing chamber (the first developing agent stirring chamber <b>112</b>), thus avoiding the leakage of a part of the magnetic brush, namely the magnetic carrier and/or non-magnetic toner, from the developing chamber downward (into the fourth quadrant). Also because the magnetic brush is removed while being adsorbed onto the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and passing through the region of angles from 35 to 60 degrees in the first quadrant, the problem of separation failure where the same magnetic brush passes through the gap between the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> and the layer thickness regulating blade <b>117</b> and continues to remain on the circumferential surface of the magnetic sleeve <b>132</b> is also solved.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">Though the pair of magnetic poles N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b> of the same polarity are disposed in the first quadrant in the embodiment shown, the invention is not limited to this constitution. What is important is to locate the minimum magnetic force region that is formed between the pair of magnetic poles N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b>, within a range of angles from 35 to 60 degrees in the first quadrant, and the position of the pair of magnetic poles N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b> along the circumference may be determined in accordance to the specific developing device.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0100">In samples Nos. 7 and 8, where the number proportions of toner particles measuring 4 μm or less was 10%, scraping of the toner from the developing roller by the magnetic roller was not sufficient, thus resulting in development ghost.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">Sample No. 9 showed scatter of much toner and significantly poor 1-dot reproducibility, because the toner had volumetric mean particle size of 14 μm (Table 1) and proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm was 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">Sample No. 10 showed a low image density such as the initial image density below 1.0 because the toner had volumetric mean particle size of 5 μm. This is because small particle size of the toner makes the toner difficult to fly from the developing roller to the photosensitive body.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">From the test results described above, it can be seen that in the hybrid development system where the two-component developing agent consisting of the magnetic carrier and the non-magnetic toner is used, it is preferable that the non-magnetic toner has a volumetric mean particle size of 6 to 11 μm and proportion of toner particles not larger than 4 μm is 8% or less, in order to prevent imaging defect (ghost) and sticking of the toner onto the developing roller from occurring.</p>
