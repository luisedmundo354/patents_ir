<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A low-pressure wellhead system with tubular heads and mandrels secured independently using threaded unions. A casing mandrel is secured to a wellhead by a first threaded union. Likewise, a tubing head spool is secured to the casing mandrel using a threaded union. A tubing hanger is also secured to the tubing head spool using a threaded union. An adapter flange may also be secured to the tubing hanger by a threaded union. Because this low-pressure wellhead is faster and easier to assemble and provides full bore access, there is less rig downtime, thus rendering the well completion process faster and more economical.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/812,446 filed Mar. 29, 2004, now abandoned the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">MICROFICHE APPENDIX</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to wellhead systems and, in particular, to a low-pressure wellhead system and a method for completing low-pressure wells.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Independent screwed wellheads are well known in the art. The American Petroleum Institute (API) classifies a wellhead as an “independent screwed wellhead” if it possesses the features set out in API Specification 6A as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,194 (Smith) entitled Independent Screwed Wellhead with High Pressure Capability and Method.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The independent screwed wellhead has independently secured heads for each tubular string supported in the well bore. Each head is said to be “independently” secured to a respective tubular string because it is not directly flanged or similarly affixed to the casing head. Independent screwed wellheads are widely used for production from low-pressure production zones because they are economical to construct and maintain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While independent screwed wellheads have gained widespread acceptance in low-pressure applications, the ever-increasing demands for low-cost petroleum products mean that oil and gas companies must find innovative ways of further reducing exploration and extraction costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore highly desirable to provide a simple, cost-effective wellhead system and completion method which minimize drilling and completion expenses, thereby rendering the extraction of subterranean hydrocarbons more economical.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a wellhead system for facilitating the operations of drilling, completing and extracting subterranean hydrocarbons from a low-pressure well. The system includes a plurality of tubular heads independently secured by threaded unions, each tubular head supporting a mandrel for suspending a tubular string in the well. Each mandrel is secured to the tubular head by a threaded union.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention also provides a low-pressure wellhead system including an independent screwed wellhead having independently secured tubular heads for supporting respective tubular strings in a well bore; and a plurality of threadedly secured mandrels supported by the tubular heads, the mandrel securing and suspending the tubular strings in the well bore.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention further provides a method of completing a low-pressure wellhead.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For the purposes of this specification, the expressions “wellhead system”, “tubular head”, “tubular string”, “mandrel”, and “threaded union” shall be construed in accordance with the definitions set forth in this paragraph. The expression “wellhead system” means a wellhead (also known as a “casing head”) mounted atop a conductor assembly which is dug into the ground and which has, optionally mounted thereto, various Christmas tree equipment (for example, casing head housings, casing and tubing head spools, mandrels, hangers, connectors, and fittings). The wellhead system may also be referred to as a “stack” or as a “wellhead-stack assembly”. The expression “tubular head” means a wellhead body used to support a mandrel such as a tubing head spool or a wellhead (also known as a casing head). The expression “tubular string” means any casing or tubing, such as surface casing, production casing or production tubing. The expression “mandrel” means any generally annular mandrel body such as a production casing mandrel (hereinafter the “casing mandrel”) or a tubing hanger (also known as a tubing mandrel or production tubing mandrel). The expression “threaded union” means any threaded connection such as a nut, sometimes also referred to as a lockdown nut or retaining nut, including wing-nuts, spanner nuts, and hammer unions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Prior to boring a hole into the ground for the extraction of subterranean hydrocarbons such as oil or natural gas, it is first necessary to “build the location” which involves removing soil, sand, clay or gravel. Once the location is “built”, the next step is to “dig the cellar” which entails digging down approximately 40-60 feet, depending on bedrock conditions. The “cellar” is also known colloquially by persons skilled in the art as the “rat hole”.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conductor <b>12</b> is inserted (or, in the jargon, “stuffed”) into the rat-hole that is dug into the ground or bedrock <b>10</b>. The upper portion of the conductor <b>12</b> that protrudes above ground level is referred to as a “conductor nipple” <b>13</b>. A conductor ring <b>14</b> (also known as a conductor bushing) is fitted atop the upper lip of the conductor nipple <b>13</b>. The conductor ring <b>14</b> has an upper beveled surface defining a conductor bowl <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A conductor window <b>16</b>, which has discharge ports <b>15</b>, is connected to the conductor nipple <b>13</b> via a conductor pipe quick connector <b>18</b> which uses a pair of locking pins <b>19</b> to fasten the conductor window <b>16</b> to the conductor nipple <b>13</b>. When fully assembled, the conductor window <b>16</b>, the conductor ring <b>14</b> and the conductor <b>12</b> constitute a conductor assembly <b>20</b>. At this point, a drill string (not shown, but well known in the art) is introduced to bore a hole that is typically 600-800 feet deep with a diameter large enough to accommodate a surface casing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after drilling is complete, a surface casing <b>30</b> is inserted, or “run”, through the conductor assembly <b>20</b> and into the bore. The surface casing <b>30</b> is connected at an upper end to landing lugs <b>32</b> which have a lower beveled surface shaped to rest against the conductor bowl <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The surface casing <b>30</b> is run into the bore until the lower beveled surface <b>34</b> of the landing lugs <b>32</b> contacts the conductor bowl <b>14</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the surface casing <b>30</b> is a tubular string having an outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the conductor <b>12</b>, thereby defining an annular space <b>33</b> between the conductor and the surface casing. The annular space <b>33</b> serves as a passageway for the outflow of mud when the surface casing is cemented in, a step that is well known in the art. Mud flows back up through the annular space <b>33</b> and out the discharge ports <b>15</b> located in the conductor window <b>16</b>. The annular space <b>33</b> is eventually filled up with cement during the cementing stage so as to set the surface casing in place.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A wellhead <b>36</b> (also known as a “casing head”) in accordance with the invention is connected to the surface casing <b>30</b> above the landing lugs <b>32</b> to provide a wellhead-surface casing assembly. The wellhead <b>36</b> has side ports <b>37</b> (also known as flow-back ports) for discharging mud during subsequent cementing operations (which will be described below). The wellhead also has a casing bowl <b>38</b>, which is an upwardly flared bowl-shaped portion that is configured to receive a casing mandrel, as also will be explained below. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wellhead <b>36</b> is connected by threads to a landing tool <b>39</b>. The landing tool <b>39</b> is used to insert the wellhead-surface casing assembly and to guide this assembly down into the bore until the landing lugs contact the conductor bowl. Once the surface casing <b>30</b> is properly cemented into place, the landing tool <b>39</b> is unscrewed from the wellhead <b>36</b> and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conductor window <b>16</b> is then detached from the conductor <b>12</b> by disengaging the locking pins <b>19</b> of the quick connector <b>18</b>. After the conductor window <b>16</b> has been removed, as shown, what remains is the wellhead-surface casing assembly (i.e., the wellhead <b>36</b>, the landing lugs <b>32</b>, and the surface casing <b>30</b>) sitting atop the conductor ring <b>14</b> and the conductor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a drilling flange <b>40</b> in accordance with the invention and a blowout preventer <b>42</b>, together providing a pressure-control stack, secured to the wellhead <b>36</b> by a threaded union <b>44</b>, such as a lockdown nut or hammer union. The wellhead <b>36</b> has a pin thread that engages a box thread of the threaded union <b>44</b>. The blowout preventer (BOP) is secured to a top flange of the drilling flange <b>40</b>. A ring gasket <b>41</b>, which is either metallic or elastomeric, is compressed between the BOP <b>42</b> and the drilling flange <b>40</b> to provide a fluid-tight seal. The drilling flange <b>40</b> further includes locking pins <b>46</b>, which are received in transverse bores in the drilling flange <b>40</b> and which are used to lock in place test plugs and bushings as will be described below. The drilling flange <b>40</b> and blowout preventer <b>42</b> are mounted to the wellhead <b>36</b> in order to drill a bore into or adjacent to the subterranean hydrocarbon formation. But before drilling can be commenced, the pressure-integrity of the pressure-control system, or “stack”, must be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the insertion of a test plug <b>50</b> for use in testing the pressure-integrity of the stack. The pressure-integrity testing is effected by plugging the stack with the test plug <b>50</b>, closing all valves and ports (including a set of pipe rams and blinds rams on the BOP) and then pressurizing the stack. The test plug <b>50</b> is inserted using a test plug landing tool <b>55</b> which is threaded to the test plug <b>50</b> at a threaded connection <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A bottom sealing portion <b>51</b> of the test plug is shaped to sit in the casing bowl <b>38</b>. Machined into the bottom sealing portion <b>51</b> is a pair of annular grooves <b>52</b> into which O-rings may be seated to provide a fluid-tight seal between the test plug <b>50</b> and the casing bowl <b>38</b>. The test plug further includes fluid passages <b>53</b> through which fluid may flow during pressurization of the stack. The fluid passages <b>53</b> are located in an upper shoulder portion <b>54</b> of the test plug <b>50</b>. The upper shoulder portion <b>54</b> of the test plug abuts a drilling flange shoulder <b>45</b> and is locked in place by the locking pins <b>46</b>, thereby securing the test plug in the stack. The landing tool <b>55</b> is removed and the stack is pressurized to at least an estimated operating pressure. If all seals and joints withstand the test pressure, the test plug is removed and the drill string is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, after the pressure-integrity of the stack is tested, preparations for drilling are commenced. This involves the insertion of a wear bushing <b>60</b> using a wear bushing landing tool <b>62</b>. The wear bushing landing tool <b>62</b> includes an insertion joint <b>64</b>, which is used to guide the wear bushing <b>60</b> to the correct location the drilling flange <b>40</b>. The wear bushing landing tool <b>62</b> also has a bushing support <b>66</b> threadedly connected at a bottom end of the insertion joint <b>64</b> for releasably supporting the bushing. The wear bushing <b>60</b> is inserted into the drilling flange <b>40</b> and is then locked in place using the locking pins <b>46</b>. A head of each locking pin <b>46</b> engages an annular groove <b>68</b> to lock the wear bushing <b>60</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the wear bushing <b>60</b> is locked in place, the wear bushing landing tool <b>62</b> is retracted, leaving the wear bushing <b>60</b> locked inside the drilling flange <b>40</b>. The stack is thus ready for drilling operations. A drill string (not illustrated, but well known in the art) is introduced into the stack so that it may rotate within the wear bushing. Drilling of a bore to the production depth may then begin.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, once drilling of the bore is complete, a production casing <b>70</b> is run into the well bore through the stack. The production casing <b>70</b> is run into the well bore until a production casing mandrel <b>72</b> in accordance with the invention, is seated in the casing bowl <b>38</b> of the wellhead <b>36</b>. As illustrated, the casing mandrel <b>72</b> is threadedly secured to the top end of the production casing <b>70</b>. A landing tool <b>74</b> is threadedly secured to the casing mandrel <b>72</b> above the production casing <b>70</b>. The landing tool <b>74</b> is used to lower the casing mandrel into the casing bowl <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The production casing <b>70</b> is a tubular string having a smaller diameter than that of the surface casing <b>30</b>. An annular space <b>75</b> is thus defined between the production casing <b>70</b> and the surface casing <b>30</b>. This annular space <b>75</b> is filled with cement to “cement in” the production casing. After the casing mandrel <b>72</b> is seated in the casing bowl <b>38</b>, the production casing <b>70</b> is cemented in. Drilling mud is evacuated through the side ports <b>37</b> (also known as flow-back ports, discharge ports or outflow ports). Cementing is complete when cement begins to discharge from the side ports <b>37</b>. Once the production casing <b>70</b> is cemented the landing tool <b>74</b> is detached and retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, after the casing mandrel <b>72</b> is seated and the production casing <b>70</b> cemented in, the drilling flange <b>40</b> and the blowout preventer <b>42</b> are removed by unscrewing the threaded union <b>44</b>. When the drilling flange <b>40</b> and blowout preventer <b>42</b> are removed, the casing mandrel <b>72</b> is exposed atop the wellhead <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates how the casing mandrel <b>72</b> is secured to the wellhead <b>36</b> using another threaded union <b>78</b>, such as a spanner nut or a hammer union. The threaded union <b>78</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> has an inner shoulder <b>79</b> which abuts with an outer shoulder <b>77</b> of the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. The threaded union <b>78</b> has box threads <b>76</b> that engages pin threads on at a top of the wellhead <b>36</b>. When the threaded union <b>78</b> is tightened, the inner shoulder <b>79</b> is drawn downwardly on the outer shoulder <b>77</b>, thus securing the casing mandrel <b>72</b> to the wellhead <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Generally, prior to extracting the subterranean hydrocarbons, it is either necessary or advantageous to stimulate the well by acidizing or fracturing the subterranean hydrocarbon formation. Stimulation techniques such as acidizing or fracturing the formation are well known in the art and will thus not be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Before commencing fracturing operations, an adapter pin <b>80</b> in accordance with the invention is secured by a pin thread <b>82</b> to a box thread of the casing mandrel <b>72</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The adapter pin <b>80</b> includes a pair of annular grooves <b>84</b> in which O-rings are seated for providing a fluid-tight seal between the adapter pin <b>80</b> and the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. The adapter pin <b>80</b> also has an upper pin thread <b>86</b> for engaging a box thread of a frac stack adapter flange, which will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates how a “frac stack” <b>90</b> is mounted to the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. A frac stack is a device well known in the art for injecting fracturing fluids into a well bore. Fracturing of the well involves the pumping into the well of proppants such as bauxite and sand and/or high-pressure fluids that break up or open the subterranean hydrocarbon formation. Fracturing is well known in the art as an effective technique for stimulating the production of a well. The frac stack <b>90</b> is secured by a flanged connection to a frac stack adapter flange <b>92</b> which is located on the underside of the frac stack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The frac stack adapter flange <b>92</b> is, in turn, secured to the casing mandrel <b>72</b> using another threaded union <b>94</b>. The frac stack adapter flange <b>92</b> also has a box thread <b>96</b> which engages the pin thread <b>86</b> of the adapter pin <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the casing mandrel <b>72</b>, adapter pin <b>80</b> and adapter flange <b>92</b> provide full-bore access to the production casing <b>70</b>. This permits all aspects of well completion to proceed without interruption. Thus, logging tools, perforating guns, packers, plugs and any other downhole tool can be run into the production casing <b>70</b> without removing the frac stack <b>90</b>. This permits well completion to be effected without the delays that are encountered using prior art wellhead systems. Consequently, well completion time is significantly reduced and well completion costs are correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As is well understood in the art, the completed well is a “live” well and is normally pressurized by natural well pressure. Consequently, the frac stack cannot be removed until the casing is sealed off to prevent the escape of well fluids to atmosphere. After fracturing and flow-back are complete, a wireline plug, or some equivalent packer, is set in the casing to seal off the casing. In addition, water may be pumped into the casing over the plug as an additional safety measure before the frac stack is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The frac stack <b>90</b>, the frac stack adapter flange <b>92</b> and the lockdown nut <b>94</b> are then detached and removed. The adapter pin <b>80</b> is also detached and removed to make way for a tubing head spool <b>100</b> which is secured to the casing mandrel <b>72</b> using another threaded union <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The tubing head spool <b>100</b> supports a production tubing string as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the tubing head spool <b>100</b> has lower pin thread <b>102</b> for connection to the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. The tubing head spool also has a pair of annular grooves <b>104</b> in which O-rings are seated for providing a fluid-tight seal between the tubing head spool <b>100</b> and the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. Above the annular grooves <b>104</b> is a radial shoulder <b>106</b>, which engages an inner shoulder <b>122</b> of the lockdown nut <b>120</b> when the lockdown nut is tightened. The tubing head spool <b>100</b> also has a pair of flanged side ports <b>108</b>. At the top end of the tubing head spool <b>100</b> is a beveled shoulder <b>110</b> for receiving a tubing hanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. A set of pin threads <b>112</b> on the top end of the tubing head spool <b>100</b> engage a box thread of a threaded union <b>160</b> described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a production tubing <b>130</b> is run inside the production casing <b>70</b> all the way down to the subterranean hydrocarbon formation (which is referred to as a production zone). In order to accomplish this, the casing plug, and overbearing fluid if used, must be removed. The plug (and fluid) is removed by mounting a changeover (not shown) such as a Bowen union or the like to a top of the tubing head <b>100</b> and mounting a blowout preventer (BOP) stack (not shown) to the changeover. The BOP, permits the casing plug to be retrieved and the tubing to be run into the well without “killing” the well, in a manner that is known in the art. After the tubing is run into the well it is suspended by a tubing hanger <b>132</b> connected to a top end of the tubing string. Fluid seals <b>135</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) between the tubing hanger <b>132</b> and the tubing head spool <b>100</b> prevent the escape of well fluids from the annulus between the production tubing string <b>130</b> and casing <b>170</b>. A wireline plug is run into the production tubing string <b>130</b> to provide a fluid seal before the BOP stack is removed. Water may be pumped into the tubing string over the wireline plug for extra security. The tubing hanger <b>132</b> (also referred to as a tubing mandrel) is secured to the tubing head spool <b>100</b> by another threaded union <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the tubing hanger <b>132</b> is connected by a threaded connection to a production tubing string landing tool <b>134</b>, which is used to insert and guide the tubing hanger <b>132</b> through the BOP stack so that it sits on top of the beveled shoulder <b>110</b> near the top of the tubing head spool <b>100</b>. The production tubing string <b>130</b> is used as a conduit for extracting hydrocarbons from the production zone of the well.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the tubing hanger <b>132</b> (which secures and suspends the production tubing string <b>130</b> in the well) is secured to the tubing head spool <b>100</b> by the threaded union <b>140</b>. The tubing hanger <b>132</b> has a pair of annular grooves <b>135</b> in which O-rings are seated to provide a fluid-tight seal between the tubing hanger <b>132</b> and the tubing head spool <b>100</b>. An annular packing <b>136</b> is compressed beneath the lockdown nut <b>140</b> between the tubing hanger <b>132</b> and the tubing head spool <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once the production tubing <b>130</b> has been run down to the production zone and the tubing hanger <b>132</b> secured, the wellhead system can be completed by attaching to the top of the stack one of various pieces of flow-control equipment, such as a master valve, choke, flow tee or other such flow-control device (none of which are shown, but which are all well known in the art). In order to attach a flow-control device, an adapter flange <b>150</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, is first mounted to the top of the stack. The adapter flange <b>150</b> is secured to the tubing hanger <b>132</b> by a threaded union <b>160</b>. The adapter flange <b>150</b> has a pin thread <b>152</b> for engaging a corresponding box thread on the tubing hanger <b>132</b>. The adapter flange <b>150</b> also has a pair of annular grooves <b>154</b> in which O-rings are seated to provide a fluid-tight seal between the adapter flange <b>150</b> and the tubing hanger <b>132</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the adapter flange <b>150</b> also has an annular shoulder <b>156</b> against which the threaded union <b>160</b> abuts. The adapter flange <b>150</b> further includes flange <b>158</b> at the top end for connection to one of various types of flow-control devices. An annular groove <b>159</b> is machined into the top surface of the adapter flange <b>150</b> for receiving a metal ring gasket to provide a fluid-tight seal at the flanged joint between the adapter flange <b>150</b> and the flow-control device.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the completed wellhead system with the adapter flange <b>150</b> secured by the threaded union <b>160</b> to the tubing hanger <b>132</b>. The stack is now ready to receive a flow-control device such as a flow-tee, choke or master valve. After the flow-control device is installed, a wireline is used to retrieve the plug from the production tubing string <b>130</b>, and the well is ready for production. Importantly, the entire well completion process using a low-pressure wellhead system in accordance with the invention is accomplished without interruption and without killing the well, which has important economic benefits and generally improves production from the well.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The wellhead system employs four threaded unions for securing the tubular heads and the mandrels. The first threaded union <b>78</b> secures the casing mandrel <b>72</b> to the wellhead <b>36</b>. The second threaded union <b>120</b> secures the tubing head spool <b>100</b> to the casing mandrel <b>72</b>. The third threaded union <b>140</b> secures the tubing hanger <b>132</b> to the tubing head spool <b>100</b>. The fourth threaded union <b>160</b> secures the adapter flange <b>150</b> to the tubing hanger <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The advantages of the wellhead system and method described and illustrated above are numerous. Because each of the mandrels and tubular heads is threadedly secured using threaded unions, the wellhead system is quick and easy to set up. This minimizes rig downtime and thus renders the extraction of subterranean hydrocarbons more economical.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A further advantage of this wellhead system and method is the rapid interchangeability of its heads. Because the mandrels and tubular heads are independently secured with threaded unions, the wellhead system permits rapid interchangeability of heads and fittings. For example, in the event that a production zone needs to be re-stimulated, the wellhead system can be easily re-tooled with a frac stack. Since the tubular heads are secured with threaded unions, the stack is easy to dismantle and reassemble, thereby reducing rig downtime.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Yet a further advantage of this wellhead system and method is the facility with which extraction operations can be moved from one production zone to another. Due to the design of the wellhead system, the stack can be readily re-tooled for different operations such as drilling, perforating, fracturing, and production setup. This wellhead system and method therefore reduces the time and cost required to complete a multi-zone well. As a result, exploitation of a low-pressure well becomes more economical.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As explained above, the wellhead system and method described and illustrated above is a “full bore open” design. The “full bore open” design permits direct insertion of various downhole tools such as a logging tool, a perforating gun, plugs, packers, hangers and any other downhole tools or equipment required for well completion or re-completion. Because tools can be directly inserted, the “full bore open” design reduces rig downtime and well completion costs.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the wellhead system may be configured with other types or arrangements of threadedly secured heads and mandrels. The embodiments of the invention described above are therefore intended to be exemplary only. The scope of the invention is intended to be limited solely by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
