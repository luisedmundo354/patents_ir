<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a print data creating method of creating print data including print data for information communication, which indicates information itself independently of a medium for information communication, and print data for function display, which is associated with, for example, an instruction to use or handle the medium, and a print system for the method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some cases, print data, including print data used for information communication and print data for function display, is created to obtain a print result larger in size than the largest print sheet that a printer can handle. In general, a print result larger in size than the largest print sheet that the printer can handle can be obtained as follows. Print data is divided into parts, which are then separately printed a number of times, thus performing division printing. A plurality of printed paper sheets are properly laid out and pasted on each other. This operation makes it possible to obtain a print result larger in size than a print result obtained by printing within the original print sheet. The operation is called poster printing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To realize this poster printing, e.g., to enlarge a document page handled by an application and divide it into parts to be printed on a plurality of paper sheets, a margin to paste up is set on at least one side of each paper sheet so as to facilitate pasting operation, thus performing printing. In some printers, the printable area is smaller than the size of a paper sheet. For this reason, a margin is left on a paper sheet after printing, and becomes an unnecessary area in pasting operation. In an extreme case, printed information is covered by a margin upon pasting operation. For this reason, printing is performed with a cut margin set in advance to allow the margin portion to be cut.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, to facilitate cutting and pasting operations, dashed lines are printed on the print data sides of margins to paste up and cut margins, or character strings like “overlap width” and “cut here” are respectively printed on a margin to paste up and a cut margin. Alternatively, instead of character strings, graphic patterns such as icons representing “overlap width” and “cut here” are printed on margins. In this specification, such character strings and graphic patterns like icons will be generically called patterns hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the above conventional techniques, the following problems are left to be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, in printing a document with a pattern, the bitmap data of the pattern is created by a printer driver and is superimposed on the bitmap data of each page of the document. The resultant data is then sent to a printer. Therefore, a large storage area is required for the printer driver to combine bitmap data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, assume that in a network environment, an application creates print data on the client side, and the printer driver operates on the server side. In this case, if the server does not have the font of a character string as a pattern, an icon image, or the like designed by the user on the client side, a document with a pattern cannot be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In distributing “confidential” documents as in a case wherein data including print data for information communication and print data for function display are printed, the character “confidential” may be sealed on each page of the document. Since it is expensive to manually affix a seal on each page of printed matter, an electronic mark “confidential” or the like is generally printed together with a document. A mark such as “confidential” is called a stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In printing a document with a stamp, an application must have an input portion for receiving a character string or the like representing a stamp to combine the stamp designated by the user in creating the print data of each page of the document, and transmit the resultant data to the printer. In order to improve this operation, a technique of implementing a stamp function using a printer driver is available. According to this technique, an interrupt is generated in the execution of the printer driver in response to a command added in the printer driver to temporarily interrupt the operation. Control is then transferred to a sub-application to make it draw a stamp, thereby providing a stamp drawing command for the printer driver. The printer driver then superimposes the drawing data of the stamp on the print data of a document page created by the application.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the above-described conventional technique has the following drawbacks. In the above conventional technique, in printing a document with a stamp, the bitmap data of the stamp is created by the printer driver and superimposed on the bitmap data of each document page, and the resultant data is sent to the printer. Therefore, the printer driver requires a large storage area to combine bitmap data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, assume that in a network environment, an application creates print data on the client side, and the printer driver operates on the server side. In this case, if the server does not have the font of the stamp or the like designated by the user on the client side, the document with the stamp cannot be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">There have been demands for a technique of printing documents upon printing various marks, frames, and images (to be generically referred to as patterns hereinafter in this specification), as well as character strings, on paper sheets. In contrast to this, there have also been demands for a technique of printing patterns upon printing documents. Demands have therefore arisen for the development of a printing system which efficiently performs such processing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide a print data creating method and a printing system for the method, which can eliminate the conventional drawbacks, reduce the load imposed on a network by reducing the capacity of a storage area required to print print data including print data for information communication and print data for function display (overlap width or cut margin), and allows printing even without a necessary font and the like in a server.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a print data creating method and a printing system for the method, which can reduce the load imposed on a network by reducing the capacity of a storage area required to print print data including print data for information communication and print data for function display (stamp like “confidential”), and allows printing even without a necessary font and the like in a server.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The embodiments of the present invention will be described below by using specific examples. As preferred embodiments, two examples of poster printing and stamp printing are described below. However, the present invention is not limited within a scope of the examples, but can be adapted for any other systems for printing information combined with “pattern”. These systems are included in a scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example of Poster Printing in First Embodiment</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example of Arrangement of Printing System of First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a printing system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, modules associated with the implementation of the present invention, in particular, are a user interface driver <b>3</b> serving both as a pattern setting unit and a pattern page creating unit and a print processor <b>5</b> functioning as a pattern page combining unit. Note that although in this embodiment Windows is used as the operating system, the present invention is not limited to the Windows operating system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the printing system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, print data such as a document for information communication which is created by an application <b>1</b> in a personal computer or the like serving as a host is temporarily stored in an EMF spool file <b>4</b> through a GDI <b>2</b>, this data is converted into bitmap data, and the bitmap data is supplied to a printer <b>7</b> to be printed. In this case, “GDI” indicates a graphic device interface, i.e., a graphic engine for Windows, and “EMF” stands for Enhanced Meta File, which is a logical storage format for drawing data in Windows. In the EMF spool file <b>4</b>, print data is stored in the EMF form.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In general, the user interface driver <b>3</b> provides a function of setting a paper size, printing direction, and any other attributes which are used for printing. The user interface driver <b>3</b> in this embodiment also has a pattern setting unit for providing a function of setting attributes for the patterns of cut margins and margins to paste up for poster printing other than the attributes such as a paper size. When the attributes of a pattern are set, and the pattern uses an icon, the user interface driver <b>3</b> returns set values such as the name of a file in which an icon image is stored to the application <b>1</b>. In addition, when a crossmark for facilitating positioning operation in cutting or pasting a margin portion, a dashed line indicating a margin, or the like is to be used, the user interface driver <b>3</b> returns the corresponding set values to the application <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The application <b>1</b> creates an arbitrary document and notifies the printing system of the start of printing to print the document. The GDI <b>2</b> notifies the user interface driver <b>3</b> of a print event indicating the start of printing by the application <b>1</b>. Upon reception of the print event indicating the start of printing, the user interface driver <b>3</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, creates pages on which only patterns are drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The application <b>1</b> then supplies the page data of the arbitrary document to the GDI <b>2</b> and continues print processing. The print data which has gone through the GDI <b>2</b> is stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. The EMF spool file <b>4</b> stores the drawing data of the pattern pages created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> and the drawing data of the document pages created by the application <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The print processor <b>5</b>, in Windows, is a module for reading in print output information and print data from the EMF spool file <b>4</b> at the time of printing and supplies the print data to a printer graphics driver <b>6</b> page by page through the GDI <b>2</b>, thereby performing printing. The print processor <b>5</b> in this embodiment also has the function of a pattern page combining unit, reads out the document data of pages to be printed and the pattern pages created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> from the EMF spool file <b>4</b>, creates a new composite page by superimposing these pages, and supplies the resultant page to the GDI <b>2</b>. In order to divide one page of the document data from the application <b>1</b> into a plurality of pages and print them, the print processor <b>5</b> repeats the operation of creating a composite page by superimposing the drawing data, obtained by enlarging a document page, and a pattern page in the pattern page combining processing a plurality of number of times.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The printer graphics driver <b>6</b> having the function of an image creating unit is a module for creating bitmap data from the graphic drawing command generated by the GDI <b>2</b> on the basis of the print data of the composite page supplied from the print processor <b>5</b>. The printer graphics driver <b>6</b> supplies the created bitmap data to the printer <b>7</b> through a data transmitting unit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The printer <b>7</b> serving as an output device has a function of printing, on a paper sheet <b>8</b>, for example, the bitmap data obtained by superimposing a pattern page <b>9</b> and the image formed by enlarging a page <b>12</b> of the print data supplied from the printer graphics driver <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, a character string is set as an attribute of a pattern as follows. A pattern page on which a character string is drawn is created in advance by the user interface driver <b>3</b> and stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. The print processor <b>5</b> then creates the print data of the composite page by superimposing the print data of the pattern page and the print data of a document page from the application <b>1</b>, and supplies the print data to the printer graphics driver <b>6</b> to create bitmap data in which the document page to be printed and the pattern page are superimposed on each other. The print processor <b>5</b> supplies this bitmap data to the printer <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a case wherein a document page from the application <b>1</b> is divided into two pages (i.e., the print data is enlarged twice). The user interface driver <b>3</b> creates the pattern page <b>9</b> on which only the character string “cut here” is drawn and a pattern page <b>10</b> on which only the character string “overlap width” is drawn, as pattern pages, before printing by the application <b>1</b>. The print processor <b>5</b> creates a composite page by superimposing the drawing data, obtained by enlarging a document page from the application <b>1</b>, and the pattern page <b>9</b>. Likewise, the print processor <b>5</b> creates a composite page by superimposing the drawing data, obtained by enlarging a document page from the application <b>1</b>, and the pattern page <b>10</b>. The print processor <b>5</b> then supplies these composite pages to the printer graphics driver <b>6</b>. In this manner, two paper sheets <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are printed out from the printer <b>7</b> serving as an output device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of two-part poster printing. However, the same printing method is applied to printing with an arbitrary number of parts. As will be described below, the positions of “cut here” and “overlap width” are set in accordance with the number of parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example of Operation Procedure in Printing System According to First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation of the user interface driver <b>3</b> in the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing the operation of the print processor <b>5</b> in the first embodiment. The overall operation of the printing system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Pattern page creation processing will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The user interface driver <b>3</b> performs pattern page creation processing upon reception of a print event from the GDI <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>1</b>, it is checked whether the print event notified by the GDI <b>2</b> is one generated by the print processor <b>5</b> or application <b>1</b>. If the print event is one generated by the print processor <b>5</b>, the user interface driver <b>3</b> terminates the processing without performing any operation. If the print event is one generated by the application <b>1</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>2</b>. In step S<b>2</b>, the type of print event is checked. If the print event indicates the start of printing, the flow advances to step S<b>3</b>. Otherwise, the user interface driver <b>3</b> terminates processing without performing any operation. In step S<b>3</b>, it is checked whether pattern settings have been made as print settings. If pattern settings have been made, the flow advances to step S<b>4</b>. If no pattern setting has been made, the processing is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step S<b>4</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, the user interface driver <b>3</b> notifies the printing system of the start of printing of one page in order to draw/create a pattern page. Since the printing system handles this notification as a notification from the application <b>1</b>, the pattern page drawn by the user interface driver <b>3</b> afterward is handled like a document page drawn by the application <b>1</b>. In step S<b>5</b>, it is checked whether the set values of the attributes of the pattern set by the user are valid. If, for example, an icon is used as a pattern, it is checked whether a corresponding image file exists. If the set values are valid, the flow advances to step S<b>6</b>. If the set values are invalid, the flow advances to step S<b>7</b> without drawing any pattern, and a page having no pattern drawn is created.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In step S<b>6</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, the user interface driver <b>3</b> properly draws various patterns on a cut margin and margin to paste up, respectively, via the GDI <b>2</b> in accordance with the set values of the attributes of the patterns. If, for example, a character string is designated as a pattern, the character string is drawn in accordance with set values concerning a font. If an image is used as a pattern, the image is drawn after enlargement/reduction processing, density conversion, and the like. In step S<b>7</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, the user interface driver <b>3</b> notifies the printing system of the end of printing of one page. As a consequence, the pattern pages drawn and created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> are stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Pattern page combining processing will be described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. The print processor <b>5</b> performs pattern page combining processing for each print job.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In step S<b>21</b>, it is checked whether pattern settings have been made. If pattern settings have been made, the print data of a page stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> is checked. If no pattern setting has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>26</b> to start normal printing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Steps S<b>22</b> to S<b>25</b> constitute a loop for recording the page numbers in the spool file and the corresponding document page numbers from the application <b>1</b> on the basis of the setting differences between the respective pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. In step S<b>23</b>, the print settings of two consecutive page data are compared to check whether any print setting has been changed on the way. If no change has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>25</b>. If a change has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>24</b>. In step S<b>24</b>, the page number in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> is stored in the corresponding list of the application <b>1</b>, and the number of pattern pages in which spool page numbers to be checked next are inserted by the user interface driver <b>3</b> is skipped. When all the page data in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> are checked in step S<b>25</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>26</b>. If there is any page that is not checked, the flow returns to step S<b>22</b> to check whether the print settings for the next page have been changed, thus repeating the loop.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In step S<b>26</b>, the print processor <b>5</b> notifies the printing system of the start of printing to actually print the page created by the print processor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Steps S<b>27</b> to S<b>33</b> constitute a loop for printing each document page up to the final physical page to be printed. Print processing of each physical page is continued in step S<b>28</b>. After all the physical pages are printed, the flow advances to step S<b>34</b> to notify the printing system of the end of print processing.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Print processing of each physical page is started from step S<b>28</b>, in which the printing system is notified first of the start of printing of one page. In step S<b>29</b>, the document page number from the application <b>1</b> which corresponds to the number of the physical page to be printed is calculated, the page number in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> which corresponds to the document page number from the application <b>1</b> is acquired from the above page correspondence list, and the document page is read out from the EMF spool file <b>4</b> to be enlarged/drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In step S<b>30</b>, it is checked whether pattern settings have been made for the document page to be printed. If no pattern setting has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>32</b> to terminate physical page printing. If pattern settings have been made, the flow advances to step S<b>31</b>. In step S<b>31</b>, the pattern page number in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> which corresponds to the number of the document page from the application <b>1</b> which is to be printed is acquired from the page correspondence list, and the pattern page is read out from the EMF spool file <b>4</b> to be drawn. Thereafter, the flow advances to step S<b>32</b> to terminate physical page printing. In step S<b>32</b>, the printing system is notified of the end of printing of one page to terminate physical page printing.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">With the above operation, the pattern page combining processing is terminated. Every time the print processor <b>5</b> creates a composite page and notifies the end of a physical page in step S<b>32</b>, the printer graphics driver <b>6</b> converts the composite page into bitmap data, and the bitmap data is supplied to the printer <b>7</b> through predetermined data transmission processing (not shown) to print the composite page.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a conceptual view showing the relationship between the states of pattern and document pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> and physical pages printed on paper sheets. Assume that printing is performed under the conditions that the application <b>1</b> prints three document pages without changing any print settings in the process of printing, and character string patterns are designated in cut areas and overlap width areas of two-part posters are designated.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">(A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the order of pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. The first two pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> are the pattern pages created by the user interface driver <b>3</b>, and the document pages created by the application <b>1</b> are stored as the third to fifth pages in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. When the print processor <b>5</b> uses spool pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as optimal pattern pages for the respective document pages and enlarges/draws each document page, the print processor <b>5</b> superimposes/prints spool page <b>1</b> as a pattern page on the upper half of the document page, and also superimposes/draws spool page <b>2</b> as a pattern page on the lower half of the document page, thereby obtaining physical pages <b>1</b> to <b>6</b> as print results, as shown in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a conceptual view showing pattern page combining processing by the print processor <b>5</b> which superimposes/draws pattern pages on document pages.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First of all, the document page from the application <b>1</b> is enlarged/drawn.

In poster printing with more than two parts, both a cut area and an overlap width area may exist on one pattern page.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example of Hardware Configuration of Printing System According to First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A hardware block diagram of the printing system according to this embodiment will be described next.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram showing the hardware configuration of the printing system according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference numeral <b>61</b> denotes a CRT display device which shows a property setting window and the like provided by the user interface driver shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; <b>62</b>, a CRTC serving as a display device controller; <b>63</b>, a data input device such as a keyboard; <b>64</b>, a keyboard controller; <b>65</b>, a coordinate input device such as a pointing device; and <b>66</b>, a pointing device controller.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Reference numeral <b>67</b> denotes a CPU for controlling the overall system; <b>68</b>, a ROM storing a boot program and the like; and <b>69</b>, a RAM which is used to store an OS, various application programs, and a printer driver program associated with the system configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B and also used as a work area.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Reference numeral <b>70</b> denotes a hard disk unit storing an OS, various application programs, the printer driver program associated with the system configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B, font data, data files (images used as patterns), and the like; <b>71</b>, a hard disk controller; <b>72</b>, a floppy disk unit serving as a unit for driving a portable storage medium; <b>73</b>, a floppy disk controller; <b>74</b>, an interface which is connected to a printing apparatus <b>75</b> such as an ink-jet printer through an interface cable; and <b>76</b>, a bus for connecting the respective devices. Note that the portable storage medium is not limited to a floppy disk and may be a CD, MO, DVD, magnetic card, optical card, memory card, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When power is provided to this system, the CPU <b>67</b> is activated in accordance with the boot program stored in the ROM <b>68</b> to load the OS from the hard disk unit <b>70</b>, thus setting a standby state with respect to operation by an operator. Assume that the CPU <b>67</b> has received a print instruction or an instruction to change a print setting in the printer driver from the operator through the KB <b>63</b> or PD <b>65</b> and an application. In this case, the printer driver program stored in the hard disk unit <b>70</b> is loaded into the RAM <b>69</b> to execute processing in this embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Effects of First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, the print processor <b>5</b> superimposes the document page to be printed, created by the application <b>1</b>, and the pattern page created by the user interface driver <b>3</b>, and then supplies the resultant page to the printer graphics driver <b>6</b>. Therefore, the number of pattern pages is not dependent on the number of document pages, and the capacity of the storage area required by the EMF spool file <b>4</b> need not be large. Furthermore, under a network environment, the number of pattern pages remains unchanged even if the number of document pages increases, and hence the load imposed on the network can be reduced. In addition, since pattern pages are created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> on the client side, printing can be done even without a font and the like which are required to draw patterns in executing the printer graphics driver <b>6</b> on the server side.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">First Modification of First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Paper sheets on which documents should be printed may sometimes vary in size, and documents may be printed on paper sheets some of which differ in size from the rest. In such a case, if processing like that described in the first embodiment is performed, since the pattern page created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> first is always used without changing the size, the position of the pattern may shift or part of the pattern may protrude, producing an undesired print result. If, for example, the direction of a paper sheet is changed in the process of printing, part of the pattern may not be printed. This modification will exemplify the case wherein posters can be properly printed even with various paper sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A system according to the first modification of the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The first modification differs from the first embodiment in that the user interface driver <b>3</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, creates pattern pages when a print event indicating the start of printing is notified and a print event indicating a change in print setting is notified. The print processor <b>5</b> superimposes an optimal pattern page on a document created by the application <b>1</b> upon a change in print setting.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The operation of the user interface driver in the first modification will be described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The operation in step S<b>1</b> is the same as that in the first embodiment. In step S<b>2</b>, the type of a print event is determined. If the event is a print event indicating the start of printing or a print event indicating a change in print setting, the flow advances to step S<b>3</b>. Otherwise, the processing is terminated without any operation. In the case of a print setting change event, since pattern page insertion processing is performed immediately after a print setting is changed, the application <b>1</b> can draw pages by using the changed print settings. The remaining steps are the same as those in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a conceptual view showing the relationship between the states of pattern and document pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b> and the physical pages to be printed on paper sheets when print settings are changed in the process of printing. In this case, printing is performed under the conditions that the application <b>1</b> changes the print settings between document page <b>2</b> and document page <b>3</b> during printing, and prints document page <b>3</b> upon changing the direction of the paper sheet, and two-part poster printing and character string patterns are designed as print settings.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">(A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the order of pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>. The first two pages stored in the spool file are the pattern pages which are created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> and correspond to a print start event. Document pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> created by the application <b>1</b> are stored as spool pages <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> in the EMF spool file <b>4</b>, and the pattern pages which are created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> and correspond to a print setting change event are stored as spool pages <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Finally, document page <b>3</b> is stored as spool page <b>7</b>. In this case, since the application <b>1</b> changes the print settings between document page <b>2</b> and document page <b>3</b> to change the direction of a paper sheet, pattern pages corresponding to document page <b>3</b> are stored as spool pages <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. In this case, since the user interface driver <b>3</b> is notified that the direction of paper sheets is changed by the print setting change event, the character strings can be printed in a well-balanced state even if the paper size is changed. The print processor <b>5</b> uses spool pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> for document pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as optimal pattern pages for the respective document pages, and also uses spool pages <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> for document page <b>3</b>. The print processor <b>5</b> then superimposes/draws the pattern pages on the respective document pages to obtain physical pages <b>1</b> to <b>6</b> as the print results shown in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In addition, even when the paper size or the position of a pattern is changed, a pattern page can be created at a desired position, and a good output result can be obtained by making the user interface driver <b>3</b> properly draw the pattern in accordance with a print setting change event.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if, for example, each output paper sheet in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has a size twice as large as that of a document page stored from the application <b>1</b> into the EMF spool file <b>4</b>, the document can be output onto one paper sheet without “overlap width” and “cut here” in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Assume that an output paper sheet is half the size of a document page. In this case, even when poster printing is to be performed with a double size, one document page is printed by using four paper sheets, and the positions of “cut here” and “overlap width” differ from those in the case wherein paper sheets are equal in size to document pages. In addition, if a document page differs in size from a paper sheet, e.g., the document page and print sheet respectively have A and B sizes, paper sheets are laid out such that poster printing is done within a plurality of paper sheets. Even with such different sizes, “cut here” and “overlap width” can be properly arranged in accordance with the layout of paper sheets. These techniques are also incorporated in the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Effect of First Modification</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, the user interface driver <b>3</b> creates/processes pattern pages in accordance with paper sizes and a pattern layout setting. Even if, therefore, the paper size changes or various changes in state occur, patterns can be printed at proper positions in accordance with the changes.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Second Modification of First Embodiment</heading>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, since the user interface driver <b>3</b> creates pattern pages having patterns drawn in cut areas and overlap width areas on the four sides of the pages, only one pattern page is created at the time of the start of printing or the occurrence of a print setting change regardless of the number of parts in poster printing, thereby suppressing an increase in the size of an EMF spool file. In addition, according to this technique, even if the print processor <b>5</b> cannot perform clipping due to limitations on the printing system, an increase in the number of pattern pages can be suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">More specifically, the print processor <b>5</b> superimposes the document page which is to be printed and created by the application <b>1</b> and the pattern page created by the user interface driver <b>3</b>, and supplies the resultant page to the printer graphics driver <b>6</b>. With this operation, the number of pages does not depend on the number of document pages, and the capacity of the storage area which is required by the EMF spool file <b>4</b> need not be large. In addition, under a network environment, the number of pattern pages remains unchanged even if the number of document pages increases, and hence the load imposed on the network can be reduced. Furthermore, since pattern pages are created by the user interface driver <b>3</b> on the client side, printing can be done even without a font and the like which are required to draw patterns in executing the printer graphics driver <b>6</b> on the server side.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, the user interface driver <b>3</b> creates/processes pattern pages in accordance with paper sizes and a pattern layout setting.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram showing a printing system according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, modules associated with the present invention are a user interface driver <b>103</b> serving both as a pattern setting unit and a pattern page creating unit and a print processor <b>105</b> serving as a pattern page combining unit. Note that in this embodiment, Windows is used as an operating system. However, the present invention is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the printing system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, print data such as a document created by an application <b>101</b> in a personal computer or the like serving as a host is temporarily stored in an EMF spool file <b>104</b> through a GDI <b>102</b>, this data is converted into bitmap data, and the bitmap data is supplied to a printer <b>107</b> to be printed. In this case, “GDI” indicates a graphic device interface, i.e., a graphic engine for Windows, and “EMF” stands for Enhanced Meta File, which is a logical storage format for drawing data in Windows. In the EMF spool file <b>104</b>, print data is stored in the EMF form.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In general, the user interface driver <b>103</b> provides a function of setting a paper size, printing direction, and any other attributes which are used for printing. The user interface driver <b>103</b> in the present invention also has a pattern setting unit for providing a function of setting attributes of patterns such as a stamp, other than the attributes such as a paper size. When the attributes of a pattern are set and a character string is used, set values such as a font name, the number of points, the color of a frame line, a rotational angle, and a position are returned to the application <b>101</b>. If a pattern using an image is to be used, set values such as a file name, an enlargement ratio, a density, a position, and a layout method are returned to the application <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The application <b>101</b> creates an arbitrary document and notifies the printing system of the start of printing to print the document. The GDI <b>102</b> notifies the user interface driver <b>103</b> of a print event indicating the start of printing by the application <b>101</b>. Upon reception of the print event indicating the start of printing, the user interface driver <b>103</b>, in place of the application <b>1</b>, creates pages on which only patterns are drawn.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Ads, The application <b>101</b> then supplies the page data of the arbitrary document to the GDI <b>102</b> and continues print processing. The print data which has gone through the GDI <b>102</b> is stored in the EMF spool file <b>104</b>. The EMF spool file <b>104</b> stores the drawing data of the pattern pages created by the user interface driver <b>103</b> and the drawing data of the document pages created by the application <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The print processor <b>105</b>, in Windows, is a module for reading in print output information and print data from the EMF spool file <b>104</b> at the time of printing and supplies the print data to a printer graphics driver <b>106</b> page by page through the GDI <b>102</b>, thereby performing printing. The print processor <b>105</b> in this embodiment also serves as a pattern page combining unit, reads out the document data of pages to be printed and the pattern pages created by the user interface driver <b>103</b> from the EMF spool file <b>104</b>, creates a new composite page by superimposing these pages, and supplies the resultant page to the GDI <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The printer graphics driver <b>106</b> serving as an image creating unit is a module for creating bitmap data from the graphic drawing command generated by the GDI <b>102</b> on the basis of the print data of the composite page supplied from the print processor <b>105</b>. The printer graphics driver <b>106</b> supplies the created bitmap data to a printer <b>107</b> through a data transmitting unit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The printer <b>107</b> serving as an output device has a function of printing, on a paper sheet <b>108</b>, bitmap data obtained by superimposing a stamp <b>110</b> on a page <b>109</b> of print data transferred from the printer graphics driver <b>106</b>. The print result on the paper sheet <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> exemplifies the case wherein the print processor <b>105</b> superimposes a pattern page on a document page. This pattern will be called a foreground pattern. The print result on a paper sheet <b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> exemplifies the case wherein the print processor <b>105</b> superimposes a document page on a pattern page. This pattern will be called a background pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Although not shown, foreground and background patterns can be used together in the following manner. The attributes of foreground and background patterns are independently set, and the user interface driver <b>103</b> creates foreground and background pattern pages. The print processor <b>105</b> then superimposes the background pattern page, the document page from the application, and the foreground pattern page. Alternatively, the user interface driver <b>103</b> may create pluralities of foreground and background pattern pages instead of creating them one by one, and the print processor <b>105</b> may superimpose these pattern pages and a document page.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this embodiment, a character string is set as an attribute of a pattern as follows. A pattern page on which a character string is drawn is created in advance by the user interface driver <b>103</b> and stored in the EMF spool file <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Pattern page creation processing will be described first with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. The user interface driver <b>103</b> performs pattern page creation processing upon reception of a print event from the GDI <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In step S<b>111</b>, it is checked whether the print event notified by the GDI <b>102</b> is the one generated by the print processor <b>105</b> or application <b>101</b>. If the print event is the one generated by the print processor <b>105</b>, the user interface driver <b>103</b> terminates the processing without performing any operation. If the print event is the one from the application <b>101</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>112</b>. In step S<b>112</b>, the type of the print event is determined. If the event is a print event indicating the start of printing, the flow advances to step S<b>113</b>. Otherwise, the user interface driver <b>103</b> terminates processing without performing any operation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In step S<b>113</b>, it is checked whether print settings include a foreground pattern setting. If a foreground pattern setting has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>114</b>. If no foreground pattern setting has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>115</b>. In step S<b>114</b>, a pattern page on which only a foreground pattern is drawn is inserted. This pattern page insertion processing will be described later.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The pattern page insertion processing in steps S<b>114</b> and S<b>116</b> will be described in detail next.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In step S<b>117</b>, in place of the application <b>101</b>, the user interface driver <b>103</b> notifies the printing system of the start of printing of one page to draw/create a pattern page. Since the printing system handles this notification as a notification from the application <b>101</b>, the pattern page drawn by the user interface driver <b>103</b> afterward is handled like a document page drawn by the application <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In step S<b>118</b>, it is checked whether the set values of the attributes of the pattern set by the user are valid. If, for example, an image is used as a pattern, it is checked whether a corresponding image file exists. If the set values are valid, the flow advances to step S<b>119</b>. If the set values are invalid, the flow advances to step S<b>120</b> without drawing any pattern, and a page having no pattern drawn is created. In step S<b>119</b>, in place of the application <b>101</b>, the user interface driver <b>103</b> draws various patterns via the GDI <b>102</b> in accordance with the set values of the attributes of the patterns. If, for example, a character string is designated as a pattern, the character string is drawn in accordance with set values, e.g., a font, character color, rotational angle, and drawing position. If an image is used as a pattern, the image is drawn in accordance with set values, e.g., enlargement/reduction processing, density conversion, drawing position, and layout.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In step S<b>120</b>, in place of the application <b>101</b>, the user interface driver <b>103</b> notifies the printing system of the end of printing of one page.

In step S<b>123</b>, the print settings of two consecutive page data are compared to check whether any print setting has been changed on the way. If no change has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>125</b>. If a change has been made, the flow advances to step S<b>124</b>. In step S<b>124</b>, the page number in the EMF spool file <b>104</b> is stored in the corresponding list of the application <b>1</b>, and the number of pattern pages in which spool page numbers to be checked next are inserted by the user interface driver <b>103</b> is skipped.

In this case, printing is performed under the conditions that the application <b>101</b> changes the print settings between document page <b>2</b> and document page <b>3</b> during printing, and prints document page <b>3</b> upon changing the direction of the paper sheet, and a foreground pattern is designed as a print setting.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">(A) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the order of pages stored in the EMF spool file <b>104</b>. The first page stored in the spool file is the pattern page which is created by the user interface driver <b>103</b> and corresponds to a print start event. Document pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> created by the application <b>101</b> are stored as spool pages <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in the EMF spool file <b>104</b>, and the foreground pattern page which is created by the user interface driver <b>103</b> and corresponds to a print setting change event is stored as spool page <b>4</b>. Finally, document page <b>3</b> is stored as spool page <b>5</b>. In this case, since the application <b>101</b> changes the print settings between document page <b>2</b> and document page <b>3</b> to change the direction of a paper sheet, a pattern page corresponding to document page <b>3</b> is stored as spool page <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In this case, since the user interface driver <b>103</b> is notified that the direction of paper sheets is changed by the print setting change event, if, for example, the position of a character string is “upper left” on the paper sheet, the character string can be printed in a well-balanced state even if the paper size is changed. The print processor <b>105</b> uses spool page <b>1</b> for document pages <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as an optimal pattern page for the respective document pages, and also uses spool page <b>4</b> for document page <b>3</b>. The print processor <b>105</b> then superimposes/draws the pattern pages on the respective document pages to obtain physical pages <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> as the print results shown in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In addition, even when the paper size or the position of a pattern is changed, a pattern page can be created at a desired position, and a good output result can be obtained by making the user interface driver <b>103</b> properly draw the pattern in accordance with a print setting change event.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, if, for example, the size of an output paper sheet in (B) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is half that of a document page stored in the EMF spool file <b>104</b>, the pattern protrudes from the document page when the pattern is made to correspond to the document page. In this case, a small pattern is selected to be superimposed on the document page upon being repositioned as needed. In contrast to this, if the size of an output paper sheet is double that of a document page, the pattern is too small. In this case, a larger pattern is selected and superimposed on the document page upon being reposition as needed. In addition, if a document page differs in size from a paper sheet, e.g., the document page and print sheet respectively have A and B sizes, a pattern is so selected as to fall within the size of a paper sheet, and is repositioned as needed. With such various sizes, patterns can be properly selected and positioned. These techniques are also incorporated in the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Effect of First Modification</heading>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As described above, the user interface driver <b>103</b> creates/processes pattern pages in accordance with paper sizes and a pattern layout setting. Even if, therefore, the paper size changes or various changes in state occur, patterns can be printed at proper positions in accordance with the changes.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Effects of Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to this embodiment, there are provided a print data creating method and a printing system for the method, in which when print data including print data for information communication and print data for function display (e.g., a stamp like “confidential”) is to be printed, the required capacity of a storage area can be reduced, the load imposed on the network can be reduced, and printing can be done even without a font and the like on the server side.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">More specifically, the print processor <b>105</b> superimposes the document page which is to be printed and created by the application <b>101</b> and the pattern page created by the user interface driver <b>103</b>, and supplies the resultant page to the printer graphics driver <b>106</b>. With this operation, the number of pages does not depend on the number of document pages, and the capacity of the storage area which is required by the EMF spool file <b>104</b> need not be large. In addition, under a network environment, the number of pattern pages remains unchanged even if the number of document pages increases, and hence the load imposed on the network can be reduced. Furthermore, since pattern pages are created by the user interface driver <b>103</b> on the client side, printing can be done even without a font and the like which are required to draw patterns in executing the printer graphics driver <b>106</b> on the server side.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In addition, the user interface driver <b>103</b> creates/processes pattern pages in accordance with paper sizes and a pattern layout setting. Even if, therefore, the paper size changes or various changes in state occur, patterns can be printed at proper positions in accordance with the changes.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The present invention may be applied to a system constituted by a plurality of devices (e.g., a host computer, an interface device, a reader, a printer, and the like) or an apparatus comprising a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The object of the present invention is realized even by supplying a storage medium storing software program codes for realizing the functions of the above-described embodiments to a system or apparatus, and causing the computer (or a CPU or an MPU) of the system or apparatus to read out and execute the program codes stored in the storage medium. In this case, the program codes read out from the storage medium realize the functions of the above-described embodiments by themselves, and the storage medium storing the program codes constitutes the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As a storage medium for supplying the program codes, a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magnetooptical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory card, a ROM, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The functions of the above-described embodiments are realized not only when the readout program codes are executed by the computer but also when the OS (Operating System) running on the computer performs part or all of actual processing on the basis of the instructions of the program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The functions of the above-described embodiments are also realized when the program codes read out from the storage medium are written in the memory of a function expansion board inserted into the computer or a function expansion unit connected to the computer, and the CPU of the function expansion board or function expansion unit performs part or all of actual processing on the basis of the instructions of the program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">When the present invention is applied to the above storage medium, programs including program codes corresponding to the flow charts described above are stored in this storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.</p>
