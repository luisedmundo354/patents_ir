<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the technical field of amplifier and, more particularly, to an amplification system capable of reducing direct current (DC) offset of a baseband signal in a transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A zero-intermediate frequency (IF) receiver is also referred to as a direct conversion receiver to directly convert a radio frequency (RF) signal into a baseband signal. Recently, because of high integrity and low cost, the zero-IF receiver is widely used in a RF transceiver, even in a mobile chip. In the zero-IF receiver, an oscillating signal LO of a local oscillator is mixed with the RF signal because of leakage to an RF port of the receiver. When the receiver and mixer performs a conversion of down frequency, a leaked oscillating signal and the LO are self-mixing to result in an output baseband signal with a large DC offset so as to reduce the performance of the entire receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To overcome this problem, U.S. Pat. No. 6,697,611 discloses a low pass filter (LPF) to obtain the DC offset, and the system subtracts the DC offset obtained from the input signal, thereby reducing the DC offset in the signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the DC offset is obtained by passing the input signal through an LPF <b>16</b>. In addition, the output of the amplifier <b>2</b> is cross coupled to the output of the amplifier <b>1</b>, and the DC offset is reduced by the first differential output line <b>24</b> and the second differential output line <b>26</b> since the two amplifiers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> have the same gain. The input signal is sent to the amplifier <b>1</b> through the first differential lines <b>20</b> and the second differential line <b>22</b>. The amplifier <b>1</b> is a differential amplifier. The differential amplifier can have a problem of distortion showing in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when there exists a positive bias voltage between the input differential voltage Vip and the input differential voltage Vin, a bias current of the transistor Tr<b>1</b> is greater than that of the transistor Tr<b>2</b>. Then, the transconductance of the transistor Tr<b>1</b> is higher than that of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> such that an absolute gain between Vip and Von is higher than that between Vin and Vop. Accordingly, the amplifier distortion is presented and easily causes poor linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved method to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the invention is to provide an amplification system capable of reducing direct current (DC) offset of a signal, which can avoid the amplifier distortion caused by different DC offsets at positive and negative input terminals of an amplifier, and increase the linearity of the amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the aforementioned object, there is provided an amplification system capable of reducing direct current (DC) offset in a signal. The system includes a first differential input terminal, a second differential input terminal, first and second differential output terminals, a first low pass filter, a first amplifier, a second low pass filter and a second amplifier. The first and second differential input terminals receive a first input signal and a second input signal respectively. The first low pass filter is connected to the first differential input terminal to filter the first input signal to thus generate a first filtered signal. The first amplifier is coupled between the first differential input terminal, first low pass filter, the first differential output terminal and the second differential output terminal to amplify the first input signal and the first filtered signal to thus generate a first amplified signal at the first differential output terminal and the second differential output terminal. The second low pass filter is connected to the second differential input terminal to filter the second input signal to thus generate a second filtered signal. The second amplifier is coupled between the second differential input terminal and second low pass filter and the first and second differential output terminals to amplify the second input signal and the second filtered signal to thus generate a second amplified signal at the first differential output terminal and the second differential output terminal. The second amplifier is connected to the first differential output terminal and the second differential output terminal such that the first amplified signals is coupled to the second amplified signals at the first differential output terminal and the second differential output terminal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an amplification system capable of reducing direct current (DC) offset in a signal in accordance with the invention. As shown, the system includes a first differential input terminal <b>310</b>, a second differential input terminal <b>312</b>, a first differential output terminal <b>340</b>, a second differential output terminal <b>342</b>, a first low pass filter <b>320</b>, a first amplifier <b>330</b>, a second low pass filter <b>322</b> and a second amplifier <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first differential input terminal <b>310</b> and the second differential input terminal <b>312</b> receive a first input signal Vip and a second input signal Vin respectively. The first input signal Vip and the second input signal Vin are a pair of differential input signals that are analog signals with DC offset. The first low pass filter <b>320</b> is connected to the first differential input terminal <b>310</b> to filter the first input signal Vip to thus generate a first filtered signal <b>321</b>. The first low pass filter <b>320</b> filters out the high frequency component of the first input signal Vip, and thus the first filtered signal <b>321</b> is the DC component of the first input signal Vip. The first amplifier <b>330</b> has a first input and a second input coupled to the first differential input terminal <b>310</b> and the first low pass filter <b>320</b>, respectively, and a first output and a second output coupled to the first differential output terminals <b>340</b> and the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>, respectively, in order to amplify the first input signal Vip and the first filtered signal <b>321</b>, thereby generating a first amplified signal <b>331</b> at the first output and the second output. The first amplified signal <b>331</b> is an analog signal with DC offset.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second low pass filter <b>322</b> is connected to the second differential input terminal <b>312</b> to filter the second input signal Vin to thus generate a second filtered signal <b>323</b>. The first low pass filter <b>320</b> and the second low pass filter <b>322</b> filter out all signals whose frequencies outside a small band about DC. Accordingly, the first low pass filter <b>320</b> outputs the DC component of the first input signal Vip, and the second low pass filter <b>322</b> outputs the DC component of the second input signal Vin. Namely, the first filtered signal <b>321</b> is the DC component of the first input signal Vip, and the second filtered signal <b>323</b> is the DC component of the first input signal Vin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second amplifier <b>332</b> has a first input and a second input coupled to the second low pass filter <b>322</b> and the second differential input terminal <b>312</b>, respectively, and a first output and a second output coupled to the first differential output terminals <b>340</b> and the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>, respectively, in order to amplify the second input signal Vin and the second filtered signal <b>323</b>, thereby generating a second amplified signal <b>333</b> at the first and second output. The second amplified signal <b>333</b> is an analog signal with DC offset. Because the second amplifier <b>332</b> is connected to the first differential output terminals <b>340</b> and the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>, the first amplified signal <b>331</b> is cross coupled to the second amplifying signal <b>333</b> at the first differential output terminals <b>340</b> and the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first amplifier <b>330</b> and the second amplifier <b>332</b> match to each other and have the same gain. Both the first amplifier <b>330</b> and the second amplifier <b>332</b> have the first output and the second output, and the first output and the second output of the first amplifier <b>330</b> are cross coupled to first output and second output of the second amplifier <b>332</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and second differential output terminals <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> have the output signals Vop, Von represented by the following equations as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Vop=[Vip(DC)+Vip(AC)]*<i>A</i>1+Vin(DC)*<i>A</i>2  (1),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<br/>
where A1 and A2 are respective gains of the first and the second amplifiers <b>330</b> and <b>332</b>. Based on assuming that A1=A2=A, the first and second differential output terminals <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> have a differential voltage (Vop−Von) of:

As shown in equation (3), a differential voltage of the output terminals of the amplification system <b>300</b> is associated only with the alternating current (AC) component of the differential voltage of the input terminals. In this case, the amplification system <b>300</b> can effectively filter out the DC component of the input differential signal without regarding to the amplitude of the DC component.
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of a receiver in accordance with the invention. As shown, the receiver includes a radio frequency antenna <b>410</b>, a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>420</b>, a mixer <b>430</b>, a local oscillator (LO) <b>440</b>, a baseband amplifier <b>450</b> and a post-processing unit <b>460</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the baseband amplifier <b>450</b> uses the amplification system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus, even a baseband signal contains a DC offset, the amplification system <b>300</b> can effectively filter out the DC offset of the baseband signal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a detail circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in accordance with the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first low pass filter <b>320</b> includes a first resistor R<b>1</b> and a first capacitor C<b>1</b>. The first resistor R<b>1</b> has one end connected to the first differential input terminal <b>310</b>, and the other end connected to a gate of a transistor M<b>2</b> and one end of the first capacitor C<b>1</b>. The other end of the first capacitor C<b>1</b> is grounded. The first resistor R<b>1</b> can be a switch resistor bank, and the first capacitor C<b>1</b> can be a switch capacitor bank.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first amplifier <b>330</b> includes NMOS transistors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>. The transistor M<b>1</b> has a drain connected to the first differential output terminal <b>340</b>, a gate connected to the first differential input terminal <b>310</b>, and a source connected to a source of the transistor M<b>2</b> and a drain of transistor M<b>5</b>. The transistor M<b>5</b> is a current mirror. The transistor M<b>2</b> has a drain connected to the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second low pass filter <b>322</b> includes a second resistor R<b>2</b> and a second capacitor C<b>2</b>. The second R<b>2</b> has one end connected to the second differential input terminal <b>312</b>, and the other end connected to a gate of a transistor M<b>3</b> and one end of the second capacitor C<b>2</b>. The other end of the second capacitor C<b>2</b> is grounded. The second resistor R<b>2</b> can be a switch resistor bank, and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> can be a switch capacitor bank.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second amplifier <b>332</b> includes NMOS transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b>. The transistor M<b>3</b> has a drain connected to the first differential output terminal <b>340</b>, and a source connected to a source of the transistor M<b>4</b> and a drain of transistor M<b>6</b>. The transistor M<b>6</b> is a current mirror. The transistor M<b>4</b> has a drain connected to the second differential output terminal <b>342</b>, and a gate connected to the second differential input terminal <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As cited, due to the different DC offset between the positive and negative terminals of the conventional amplifier <b>1</b>, the multiplication at the positive and negative terminals of the conventional amplifier <b>1</b> is different, and thus it causes the amplifier distortion and poor linearity. Accordingly, the invention uses the first amplifier <b>330</b> and the second amplifier <b>332</b> to process the DC offset presented at the first differential input terminal <b>310</b> and the second differential input terminal <b>312</b> respectively, thereby reducing the DC offset of the first amplified signal <b>331</b> and second amplified signal <b>333</b> at the first differential output terminal <b>340</b> and second differential output terminal <b>342</b>. Further, compared to the prior art, the invention has the advantages of easy integration and low cost, in addition to avoiding the amplifier distortion caused by the different DC offsets presented at the positive and negative terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the present invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
