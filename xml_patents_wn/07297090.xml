<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to exercise devices, and in particular, to personal exercise devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">World records in endurance sports are not accomplished at age 55. This is because one of the unavoidable consequences of aging is a decline in the maximal capacity of the cardiovascular system to pump blood and deliver oxygen while removing metabolic waste products. The components of the cardiovascular pump performance are 1) the maximal heart rate that can be achieved, 2) the size and contractility of the heart muscle, and 3) the compliance (stiffness) of the arterial tree. It is known that aging affects each of these three variables.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Young children generally have a maximal heart rate that approaches 220 beats per minute. This maximal rate falls throughout life. By age 60, maximal heart rate in a group of 100 men will average about 160 beats per minute. This fall in heart rate seems to be a linear process so that maximal heart rate can be estimated by the formula: Max heart rate=220−age. This is an estimate, however. If the maximal heart rates of those same 100 men are measured during a maximal heart rate test, there would probably be a range of heart rates between 140 and 180 beats per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is no strong evidence to suggest that training influences the decline in maximal heart rate. The blood pumped out of the heart enters the systemic arterial system. For the youth, this system of arteries is quite flexible or compliant. This is important for the performance of the heart. Compliant vessel walls stretch when blood is pumped through them, lowering the resistance that the heart must overcome to eject it volume of each beat. As we age, these vessels loose their elasticity. Consequently, resting blood pressure and blood pressure during exercise slowly increase as we age. Continued training appears to reduce this aging effect, but does not eliminate it. Increased peripheral resistance results in a decrease in maximal blood flow to working muscles. However, at sub maximal exercise intensities, the 10%-15% decrease in blood flow is compensated for by the increase in oxygen extraction. This compensation is probably possible due to the increased transit time of the blood through the capillary tree.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the sedentary population, cardiovascular performance declines progressively. Much of this decline is due to 1) physical inactivity and 2) increased body weight (fat). Maximal oxygen consumption declines about 10% per decade after age 25. However, if body composition is maintained and physical activity levels are kept constant, the decline in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 Max) due to aging is only about 5% per decade. Prior to age 50, this decline may even be less, perhaps on 1%-2% per decade in hard training master athletes. Ultimately, cardiovascular capacity is reduced, however, due to the unavoidable decline in maximal heart rate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently in America approximately one in three or 58 million American Adults aged 20 through 74 are overweight. This is true even though more is now known than ever before about the harmful effects of being overweight and in poor physical condition. Every year as society is becoming more automated many manual labor jobs are being replaced by machines. There is less physical labor Americans must do. Also, for most people large amounts of food are easy to find and afford.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some people are able to successfully start and stay with a healthy exercise program that involves weight lifting and cardiovascular exercise. Many of these people join gyms to have access to expensive machines designed to help them exercise. However, many people find it difficult and expensive to exercise at a gym. There are also additional problems with gyms at a fitness studio and/or home gyms. For example, conventional design fitness machines are generally in fixed locations in a fitness studio or at the user's residence. Fitness machines typically provide only one direction of motion for training. Also, with fitness machines each individual muscle group (agonist) is trained individually, that is, without stressing its opposing muscle group (antagonist) with reversed movement sequences. In the prior art there are a few stationary machines that train only a small number of muscle groups. Hence, in order to train a large number of muscle groups, prior art fitness machines require high mechanical and equipment expense for multiple machines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With all the problems associated with prior art stationary gym equipment, some people decide to start walking or running for exercise. These exercises are good for cardiovascular exercise but they are not as effective as resistance training for muscular exercise and development.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a personal exercise device that combines cardiovascular training and resistance training.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a personal exercise device having a body mounted shaft housing for mounting a shaft at a position near the rear portion of a user's waist. A shaft is confined within the shaft housing. Two leg mounts are attached to each of two legs of the user near the user's knees. Each of two torque arms are attached pivotally at one end to one of the leg mounts and also attached pivotally at the other end to the shaft. A torque adjustment device is also included and is for adjusting the torque required to produce pivot motion of the torque arms about the shaft. Also, a preferred embodiment includes two handles are connected to the body mounted shaft housing unit via two flexible cords. The user preferably gains cardiovascular training utilizing the device while walking or running and gains additional resistance training by appropriately adjusting the torque and pulling the handles.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. At one end, torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are connected to leg mounts <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B, respectively. At their other ends, torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are pivotally attached to shaft <b>4</b> that extends through shaft housing unit <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Forward and backward motion of the legs (such as a walking or running motion) causes torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B to automatically pivot about shaft <b>4</b>. The user can turn knob <b>5</b>A or knob <b>5</b>B clockwise to increase the amount of torque required to pivot torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B around shaft <b>4</b>. In other words, as knob <b>5</b>A or knob <b>5</b>B is tightened greater resistance is produced. Therefore, it becomes increasingly more difficult for the user to overcome the resistance and for the user to move his legs forward and backward in a walking or running motion. By overcoming this increased resistance the user exercises a variety of muscles and improves his physical condition. Also in a preferred embodiment, handles <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B are connected to handle rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B via rubber cords <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D, and <b>3</b>A). By pulling handles <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, a user can further exercise muscles in his arms and upper body.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Torque Arms</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Torque arm <b>1</b>A preferably has three telescopic sections <b>1</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A<b>2</b> and <b>1</b>A<b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B) that connect to main torque arm section <b>1</b>A<b>4</b>. Likewise, torque arm <b>1</b>B preferably has three telescopic sections <b>1</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>B<b>2</b> and <b>1</b>B<b>3</b> that connect to main torque arm section <b>1</b>B<b>4</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the perpendicular distance from shaft <b>4</b> to the line formed by the telescopic sections is approximately 12 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show a simple side view of a portion of torque arm <b>1</b>A. In the preferred embodiment, telescopic section <b>1</b>A<b>1</b> slides easily inside telescopic section <b>1</b>A<b>2</b>. Telescopic section <b>1</b>A<b>2</b> slides easily inside telescopic section <b>1</b>A<b>2</b>. Telescopic section <b>1</b>A<b>3</b> slides easily inside main torque arm section <b>1</b>A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> torque arm <b>1</b>A is extended so that the overall length of torque arm has been increased. Telescopic sections <b>1</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A<b>2</b> and <b>1</b>A<b>3</b> each have slid rightward to their rightmost position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> torque arm <b>1</b>A has been compressed so that the overall length of torque arm <b>1</b>A has been decreased. Section <b>1</b>A<b>1</b> has slid to the left inside section <b>1</b>A<b>2</b>. Section <b>1</b>A<b>2</b> has slid to the left inside section <b>1</b>A<b>3</b>. Section <b>1</b>A<b>3</b> has slid to the left inside main torque arm section <b>1</b>A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that because torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are telescopic that they will lengthen and shorten according to the movement of the user allowing full range of motion. Also, telescopic torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B will adjust automatically to the user's height.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Body-Mounted Shaft Housing Unit</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C show a preferred tension-adjustable body-mounted shaft housing unit <b>3</b>. Shaft housing unit <b>3</b> includes casing <b>3</b>A and back support piece <b>3</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> shows a side view of casing <b>3</b>A. In a preferred embodiment, a hole is drilled through the side of shaft housing <b>3</b>. Spacer tube <b>10</b> is then welded into the hole. Shaft <b>4</b> is then extended through spacer tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, shaft housing unit <b>3</b> is sewn into adjustable belt <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Also, preferably, back support piece includes cushion pad <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Back support piece <b>3</b>B provides support for the user's upper and lower back.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, knob <b>5</b>B is locked to shaft <b>4</b> via a pin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Thrust bearing <b>1</b>B is adjacent knob <b>5</b>B. A plurality of Belleville disc springs are arranged in series adjacent thrust bearing <b>11</b>B to form Belleville disc spring column <b>12</b>B. Washer <b>13</b>B is adjacent Belleville disc spring column <b>12</b>B. Torque arm <b>1</b>B is adjacent washer <b>13</b>B. Washer <b>15</b>B is between torque arm <b>1</b>B and spacer tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the opposite side of spacer tube <b>10</b>, Washer <b>15</b>A is between torque arm <b>1</b>A and spacer tube <b>10</b>. Washer <b>13</b>A is between torque arm <b>1</b>A and Belleville disc spring column <b>12</b>A. Thrust bearing <b>11</b>A is between knob <b>5</b>A and Belleville disc spring column <b>12</b>A. Knob <b>5</b>A is threaded onto shaft <b>4</b>. Load indicator device <b>16</b> is locked to shaft <b>4</b> via pin <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) adjacent knob <b>5</b>A.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Leg Mounts</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Leg mounts <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B are preferably sewn into knee mounts <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, leg mounts <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B are preferably pivotally connected to torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, leg mounts <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B include hard surface sections <b>35</b>C and <b>35</b>D, respectively. Hard surface sections <b>35</b>C and <b>35</b>D act as a hard surface to stabilize torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B and to prevent connector sections <b>35</b>E and <b>35</b>F from digging into the user's legs.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Knee Mounts</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Knee mounts <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) each include two straps. One of the straps wraps around the knee below the knee cap and the other strap wraps around above the knee cap. The straps function to prevent knee mounts <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B and torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B from moving or sliding up or down the legs from moving or sliding sideways.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Load Indicator Device</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> show the operation of load indicator device <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows load indicator device <b>16</b> pinned to shaft <b>4</b> via pin <b>17</b>. Knob <b>5</b>A is threaded onto shaft <b>4</b> and has a cutout section to accommodate load indicator device <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a detailed side view of load indicator device <b>16</b>. Preferably, load indicator device <b>16</b> is color-coded to indicate the amount of compressive force exerted onto torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B as knob <b>5</b>A is adjusted. In a preferred embodiment, “GREEN” indicates light compressive force, “BLUE” indicates medium compressive force, “YELLOW” indicates high compressive force, and “RED” indicates very high compressive force. The greater the compressive force exerted onto torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B, the more difficult it is for the user to generate enough torque to overcome the compressive force and to move his legs forward and backward in a walking or running motion.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, knob <b>5</b>A has been turned counterclockwise so that load indicator <b>16</b> is covered by knob <b>5</b>A. This indicates to the user that knob <b>5</b>A is positioned so that there is essentially no compressive force being exerted onto torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. It is therefore very easy for the user to move his legs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the user has turned knob <b>5</b>A clockwise so that load indicating device <b>16</b> shows “RED” (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Belleville disc spring columns <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B have been compressed and very high compressive forces are being exerted on torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. It will therefore challenge the user's ability to a higher level.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Utilization of the First Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> describe a sequence of events showing the utilization of a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> the user is exercising while walking. The user is also gaining additional exercise by pulling handles <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B to stretch cords <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Prior to beginning his exercise, the user has tightened knob <b>5</b>A so that medium compressive forces are being exerted on torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B (see above discussion). Therefore, the user will have to generate an increased amount of torque to pivot torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B clockwise and counterclockwise around shaft <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the user has stepped forward with his right foot. This has caused torque arm <b>1</b>A to pivot counterclockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. The momentum of the user stepping forward with his right foot has caused the user's upper body to move forward in relation to his left foot. This motion has caused torque arm <b>1</b>B to pivot clockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> the user has raised his left hand and has pulled cord <b>7</b>B tight.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> the user has planted his right foot on the ground and has begun to step forward with his left foot. The user's upper body is positioned approximately over the user's right foot. Torque arm <b>1</b>A has pivoted clockwise about shaft <b>4</b> and torque arm <b>1</b>B has pivoted counterclockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. The user has lowered his left arm.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the user has stepped forward with his left foot. This has caused torque arm <b>1</b>B to pivot further counterclockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. The momentum of the user stepping forward with his right foot has caused the user's upper body to move forward in relation to his left foot. This motion has caused torque arm <b>1</b>A to pivot further clockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> the user has raised his right hand and has pulled cord <b>7</b>A tight.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> the user has planted his left foot on the ground and has begun to step forward with his right foot. The user's upper body is positioned approximately over the user's left foot. Torque arm <b>1</b>B has pivoted clockwise about shaft <b>4</b> and torque arm <b>1</b>A has pivoted counterclockwise about shaft <b>4</b>. The user has lowered his right arm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this fashion the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> is repeated. As explained above the user can tighten knob <b>5</b>A to increase the resistance or loosen knob <b>5</b>A to decrease the resistance.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Running</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> describe just one manner in which the present invention may be used. It can also be used in a variety of other manners. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a user running while utilizing the present invention. Because he is running the user's stride is greater than it is while he is walking (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>). Therefore, the amount torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B have pivoted is also greater. The difference can be seen by comparing the positions of torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to their positions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Preferred Handle Rods</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A top view of preferred handle rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, a hole is drilled into the side of shaft housing unit <b>3</b> to accommodate hollow support tube <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). Support tube <b>20</b> is then welded to shaft housing unit <b>3</b>. Support tube <b>20</b> preferably includes slots <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B for receiving spring loaded pins <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B of handle rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B, respectively. Rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B slide horizontally in and out of shaft housing unit <b>3</b> and automatically adjust according to the user's shoulder width.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> the user has slid handle rod <b>8</b>A to its leftmost position and has slid handle rod <b>8</b>B to its rightmost position. Spring loaded pins <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B prevent the user from sliding rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B completely out of support tube <b>20</b>. The positions of rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are preferable for a user with extremely broad shoulders.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the user has slid handle rod <b>8</b>A to its rightmost position and has slid handle rod <b>8</b>B to its leftmost position. Spring loaded pins <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B prevent the user from sliding rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B so far that they collide with each other. The positions of rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are preferable for a user with extremely narrow shoulders.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For a user with shoulders of medium width, the user can slide rods <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B so that they are positioned approximately halfway between the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Preferred Knob</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The above discussion described in detail how knob <b>5</b>A is adjusted to vary the compressive force applied to torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows another preferred knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b>. Knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> clicks as it is turned clockwise or counterclockwise by the user. The user can use the clicks to help precisely adjust the compressive force on torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B. For example, on Tuesday the user may have exercised for 30 minutes with knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> turned clockwise 9 clicks. On Thursday, the user wants to slightly increase the resistance. Therefore, he will turn knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> clockwise 10 clicks.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a perspective view of knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b>. Knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> includes multiple wedges <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> shows a side view of knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> threaded onto D-shaft <b>4</b>A. Washer <b>26</b> is slid onto D-shaft <b>4</b> adjacent to knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b>. D-shaft <b>4</b>A includes spring <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> the user has begun to turn knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> slightly clockwise. A wedge <b>25</b> has come into contact with spring <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> the user has turned knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> more so that spring <b>27</b> snaps back and collides into an adjacent wedge <b>25</b>. The snapping back and collision with the adjacent wedge creates an audible click that the user can rely upon to gage how much he has turned knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> load indicating device <b>16</b> has been threaded onto D-shaft <b>4</b>A. By utilizing the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> the user can both visually gage how far he has turned knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> by looking at load indicating device <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and he also audibly gage how far he has turned knob <b>5</b>A<b>1</b> by listening to clicks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Bent Torque Arms</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, torque arms <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B are bent at upper sections <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B, respectively. By utilizing bent torque arms, the user is able to achieve greater lateral movement with his legs. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> the user has raised his right leg. Because there is a bend at upper sections <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B, the user can raise his leg laterally and torque arms <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B will not bump into each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Benefits of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention provides numerous benefits. Some of these are listed below. For example, users of the invention will experience an increased oxygen consumption rate while utilizing the invention. The greater the amount of oxygen consumed during a cardio workout, the shorter the required duration of the workout. Also, the present invention will improve the user's cardio system, his muscle strength and his flexibility. The user will become more limber due to the large range of motion achievable. The adjustable knob will allow the user to control and vary the resistance workload. The present invention is easy to use, portable, lightweight, easy to store and affordable. A tall person, a short person, an overweight person or a slim person can all use and gain benefits from the present invention. The waist mount will support the upper and lower back. The adjustable belt will fit any waist size. The knee mounts will support the knees and provides an additional level of support.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention creates a fitness device which will stimulate the muscles while the user is engaged in an aerobic activity such as walking, running or jogging. The user can exercise indoors or outdoors. Also, the user can exercise a large number of muscle groups with a very low equipment expense and without wasting unnecessary time.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Swivel Belt</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18C</figref> show another preferred embodiment that utilizes swivel belt <b>140</b>. Swivel belt <b>140</b> is pivotally connected to buttons <b>142</b>. Buttons <b>142</b> are both rigidly connected to back support piece <b>3</b><i>b </i>of shaft housing unit <b>3</b>. Swivel belt <b>140</b> can pivot up or down depending on the wishes of the user. For example, if the user has a large stomach, he may want swivel belt <b>140</b> to pivot downwards as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>. Conversely, if he has an injury, he may want swivel belt <b>140</b> to pivot upwards as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the above-preferred embodiments have been described with specificity, persons skilled in this art will recognize that many changes to the specific embodiments disclosed above could be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, it was described above how torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B are preferably pivotally connected to leg mounts <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B. It should be recognized that there are a variety of ways in which to connect the torque arms to the leg mounts. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> show that torque arms <b>51</b>A can be connected to leg mounts <b>50</b> via a ball and socket joint. This manner of connection allows for greater mobility of the legs in various directions. Also, even though the above preferred embodiments described how Belleville springs were utilized to vary the compression on torque arms <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B, it should be understood that a variety of springs could be used in stead of Belleville springs. For example, a coil spring could be utilized as well. Also, although the above description given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> show the user pulling on handles <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B, it is possible to utilize the present invention without attaching handles. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a user running without holding handles. Therefore, the attached claims and their legal equivalents should determine the scope of the invention.</p>
