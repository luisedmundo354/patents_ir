<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns the use of an O/W emulsion, in particular a PIT emulsion, for the lubrication of conveyor belt systems in food processing plants and a lubricant concentrate based on wax esters.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the food industry, in particular in beverage plants, the containers that are to be filled in the filling plants are transported by means of conveyors in a wide variety of designs and materials, for example by means of apron conveyors or chain-type arrangements, which will be referred to in general terms below as conveyor chains. The conveyors link the various optional treatment stages of the filling process, such as e.g. unpacker, bottle washing machine, filler, sealer, labeler, packer, etc. The containers can come in a wide variety of forms, in particular glass and plastic bottles, cans, jars, casks, drinks containers (KEG), paper and cardboard containers. To ensure that the operation proceeds smoothly, the conveyor chains must be lubricated by suitable means such that excessive friction on the containers is avoided. Dilute aqueous solutions containing suitable antifriction agents are conventionally used for lubrication. The conveyor chains are brought into contact with the aqueous solutions by immersion or by spraying, for example, and this is then referred to as splash lubrication plant or automatic belt lubrication system or central chain lubrication system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The chain lubricants that have been used until now as lubricating agents are mostly based on fatty acids in the form of their water-soluble alkali or alkanolamine salts or on fatty amines, preferably in the form of their organic or inorganic salts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Whilst both classes of substances can be used without any problems in splash lubrication, they display a series of disadvantages in the central chain lubrication systems that are conventionally used today. Thus, DE-A-23 13 330 describes soap-based lubricants containing aqueous blends of C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty acid salts and surface-active substances. Such soap-based lubricants display the following disadvantages:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">1. A reaction occurs with the water hardness, in other words the alkaline earth ions and other water constituents, forming poorly soluble metal soaps know as primary alkaline earth soaps.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">2. A reaction occurs between these soap-based lubricants and carbon dioxide dissolved in water or in the product to be filled.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">3. The working solution thus formed is always promoting germ life.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">4. If hard water is used, ion exchangers are needed to soften the water, representing an additional source of germs (and therefore rarely encountered in practice), or the use of products having a high content of complexing agents is required, which in turn is ecologically critical.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0009">5. Increased foaming occurs, which can in particular cause problems at the bottle inspector (automatic bottle control) and leads to greater wetting of the transport containers.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0010">6. Most of these products contain solvents.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0011">7. The cleaning effect of these products is poor, which means that a separate cleaning stage is necessary.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0012">8. The performance of such soap-based lubricant formulations is dependent on their pH.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0013">9. Soap-based lubricant formulations also display a water temperature dependency.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0014">10. Soap-based lubricants have only a short storage life, particularly at low temperatures.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0015">11. EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate), which is contained in many products, is known to be only poorly biodegradable.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0016">12. Such soap-based lubricant formulations are not suitable for all transport items made of plastics, since in many cases the transport item can suffer stress corrosion cracking when these agents are used.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0017">In addition to soap-based lubricants, those based on fatty amines are principally used. Thus, DE-A-36 31 953 describes a process for the lubrication of chain-type bottle conveyor belts in beverage filling plants, particularly in breweries, and for cleaning the belts with a liquid cleaning agent, which process is characterized in that the chain-type bottle conveyor belts are lubricated with belt lubricants based on neutralized primary fatty amines, which preferably have 12 to 18 C atoms and include an unsaturated content of more than 10%.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0060">Polyhydroxy compounds selected from alkanediols or alkanetriols are cited as being particularly preferred, most particularly preferably glycerol, or polymers thereof and their esters and ethers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0061">From the point of view of the user, however, the chain lubricants used still present the problem that they either adhere too poorly to the chains or attach too strongly to the chains.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0062">Where chain lubricants adhere too poorly to the chains they drip onto the ground soon after application, with the result that the lubricating effect on the chains, which are several meters in length, is extremely dependent on the proximity to the metering point. The same problem occurs at places where there is a risk of the lubrication film rapidly being removed from the surface by spilled beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0063">The consequence is that very different qualities of lubrication can occur from one section to another. In critical sections this commonly leads to bottles falling over and even to interruption of the filling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0064">Where chain lubricants adhere very well to the chains, as is the case with fluoro-surfactants, for example, which have very good wetting properties, a firmly adhering film is formed on the conveyor chains, which cannot easily be removed by rinsing with water.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0065">Residues and abraded material can accumulate in this film and lead to hygiene problems and breakdowns in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0066">The object of the present invention was accordingly to provide chain lubricants which on the one hand have good adhesion to the chains, display good lubricating properties and form a film that can easily be removed again from the chains if necessary. Such chain lubricants should also be available in a formulation stable in storage. Surprisingly, the above object can be achieved with O/W emulsions stable in storage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0067">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the use of an O/W emulsion in concentrated form or after dilution with water for the lubrication of conveyor belts in food processing plants.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0068">It is known that oil-in-water emulsions, hereinafter referred to as O/W emulsions, that are produced and stabilized with nonionic emulsifiers undergo phase inversion when heated. This process of phase inversion means that at elevated temperatures the outer, aqueous phase becomes the inner phase. This process is generally reversible, which means that the original emulsion type reforms again on cooling. It is also known that the phase inversion temperature point depends on many factors, for example the type and phase volume of the oil component, the hydrophilicity and structure of the emulsifier or the composition of the emulsifier system, cf. for example K. Shinoda and H. Kunieda in Encyclopedia of Emulsion Technology, Volume I, P. Becher (ed.), Marcel Decker, New York 1983, page 337 ff. It is also known that O/W emulsions produced at or slightly above the phase inversion temperature are particularly finely dispersed and are characterized by long-term stability. By contrast, emulsions produced below the phase inversion temperature are less finely dispersed, cf. S. Friberg, C. Solans, J. Colloid Interface Science 1978 [66], p. 367 f.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0069">In “Progress in Colloid and Polymer Science” 1987 [73], p. 37, F. Schambil, F. Jost and M. J. Schwuger report on the properties of cosmetic emulsions containing fatty alcohols and fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers. They relate that emulsions that were produced above the phase inversion temperature display a low viscosity and high storage stability.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0070">However, only emulsions whose oil phase consists entirely or predominantly of non-polar hydrocarbons were investigated in the cited publications. By contrast, corresponding emulsions whose oil component consists entirely or predominantly of polar esters or triglyceride oils behave differently: either (a) coarsely dispersed white emulsions are formed instead of finely dispersed blue emulsions in spite of a phase inversion or (b) no phase inversion at all occurs in the temperature range up to 100° C.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0071">German patent application DE-OS-38 19 193 describes a process for the production of low-viscosity O/W emulsions of polar oil components, based on the phase inversion temperature method (PIT method). According to the teaching of this application, phase inversion temperatures below 100° C. are achieved by using additional co-emulsifiers together with nonionic emulsifiers. It was found, however, that only coarse dispersions are attainable with this method in the case of oils with a dipole moment above 1.96 D. This concurs with the publication by T. Förster, F. Schambil and H. Tesmann; who investigated emulsification by the PIT method with regard to self-emulsifying surfactants and the polarity of the oil to be emulsified (International Journal of Cosmetic Science 1990 [12], p. 217). On page 222 the authors state that the presence of a phase inversion is no guarantee that finely dispersed emulsions stable in storage are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0072">WO 93/11865 presents an improved process for the production of finely dispersed O/W emulsions displaying long-term stability and based on oil mixtures with a high proportion of polar oil components. In particular, a process was provided by means of which finely dispersed O/W emulsions stable in storage and based on oils with a dipole moment above 1.96 D can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0073">It was found that O/W emulsions based on polar oil materials and nonionic emulsifiers are particularly finely dispersed and stable over the long term if a mixture of polar oil, nonionic emulsifier and a special interfacial moderator are heated to a temperature within or above the phase inversion temperature range—or the emulsion is produced at this temperature—and then the emulsion is cooled to a temperature below the phase inversion temperature range and optionally further diluted with water.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0074">Furthermore, WO 93/11865 claims a process for the production of oil-in-water emulsions of polar oil materials (A) in which
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0075">(A) 10 to 90 wt.-% of a polar oil material is emulsified with</li>

    <li id="ul0009-0004" num="0078">(D) 0.01 to 50 wt.-% of an interfacial moderator selected from the group of tocopherols, Guerbet alcohols with 16 to 20 C atoms or a steroid with 1 to 3 OH groups
<br/>
are emulsified in the presence of 8 to 85 wt.-% water at a temperature above the melting point of the mixture comprising components (A) to (D), and the emulsion is heated to a temperature within or above the phase inversion temperature range—or the emulsion is produced at this temperature—and the emulsion is then cooled to a temperature below the phase inversion temperature range and optionally further diluted with water.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0079">This process has the advantage that particularly finely dispersed emulsions are obtained which display excellent storage stability. In comparison to the previously known prior art, e.g. DE-OS-38 19 193, the phase inversion temperature is also reduced, which is particularly favorable in practice because of the associated energy saving.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0080">Oil-in-water emulsions produced by the PIT method are used for example as skin and body-care products, as cooling lubricants or as fiber and textile auxiliaries. They are particularly preferred in processes for the production of emulsion-type preparations for skin and hair treatment.</p>

Particularly suitable zwitterionic surfactants are the so-called betaines such as N-alkyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example coconut-alkyldimethylammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example coconut-acylaminopropyldimethylammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethylimidazolines, each having 8 to 18 C atoms in the alkyl or acyl group, and coconut-acylaminoethyl-hydroxyethyl-carboxymethyl glycinate. The fatty acid amide derivative know under the CTFA designation cocamidopropylbetaine is particularly preferred. Other suitable emulsifiers are ampholytic surfactants. Ampholytic surfactants are understood to be surface-active compounds that in addition to a C<sub>8/18 </sub>alkyl or acyl group in the molecule also contain at least one free amino group and at least one —COOH or —SO<sub>3</sub>H group and are capable of forming internal salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants are N-alkylglycines, N-alkylpropionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamidopropylglycines, N-alkyltaurines, N-alkylsarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids, each having around 8 to 18 C atoms in the alkyl group. Particularly preferred ampholytic surfactants are N-coconut-alkylaminopropionate, coconut-acylaminoethylaminopropionate and C<sub>12/18 </sub>acylsarcosine.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0108">Also suitable in addition to ampholytic emulsifiers are quaternary emulsifiers, and those of the esterquat type, preferably methyl-quaternized difatty acid triethanolamine ester salts, are particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0109">Substances such as e.g. lanolin and lecithin and polyethoxylated or acylated lanolin and lecithin derivatives, polyol fatty acid esters, monoglycerides and fatty acid alkanolamides can be used as further additives, the latter simultaneously serving as foam stabilizers. Suitable examples of consistency modifiers, where required, are primarily fatty alcohols with 12 to 22 and preferably 16 to 18 carbon atoms, as well as partial glycerides. A combination of these substances with alkyloligoglucosides and/or fatty acid N-methylglucamides of the same chain length and/or polyglycerol poly-12-hydroxystearates is preferred. Suitable thickening agents, where required, are for example polysaccharides, in particular xanthan gum, guar-guar, agar-agar, alginates and tyloses, carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose, as well as higher-molecular weight polyethylene glycol mono- and diesters of fatty acids, polyacrylates (e.g. Carbopole® from Goodrich or Synthalene® from Sigma), polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone, surfactants such as ethoxylated fatty acid glycerides, esters of fatty acids with polyols such as pentaerythritol or trimethylolpropane, fatty alcohol ethoxylates with narrow homologue distribution or alkyloligoglucosides and electrolytes such as common salt and ammonium chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0110">Depending on the properties required of the O/W emulsion for use according to the invention, suitable cationic polymers can also be added. These are selected for example from cationic cellulose derivatives, such as e.g. quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose, which is available from Amerchol under the name Polymer JR 400®, cationic starch, copolymers of diallylammonium salts and acrylamides, quaternized vinylpyrrolidone/vinylimidazole polymers such as Luviquat® (BASF), condensation products of polyglycols and amines, quaternized collagen polypeptides such as lauryidimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen (Lamequat® L/Grünau), quaternized wheat polypeptides, polyethyleneimine, cationic silicone polymers such as amidomethicones, copolymers of adipic acid and dimethylaminohydroxypropyldiethylenetriamine (Cartaretine®/Sandoz), copolymers of acrylic acid with dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (Merquat® 550/Chemviron), polyaminopolyamides such as described e.g. in FR-A 22 52 840 and crosslinked water-soluble polymers thereof, cationic chitin derivatives such as e.g. quaternized chitosan, optionally with microcrystalline distribution, condensation products of dihaloalkyls such as e.g. dibromobutane with bisdialkylamines such as bisdimethylamino-1,3-propane, cationic guar gum such as Jaguar® CBS, Jaguar® C-17, Jaguar® C-16 from Celanese, quaternized ammonium salt polymers such as Mirapol® A-15, Mirapol® AD-1, Mirapol® AZ-1 from Miranol.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0111">Hydrotropes such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or polyols can also be used to improve the flow properties of the O/W emulsion for use according to the invention.

<p id="p-0082" num="0162">When evaluating the above test series, it should be noted, among other things, that combinations including alkoxypropylamine achieve outstanding lubrication values despite lower amount of cetyl palmitate active substance in such combinations. Another advantage in such combinations is that alkoxypropyleneamines contribute additional antimicrobial activity to the combination.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0163">These advantages were confirmed in several tests for the alkoxypropylamine types that are well-known in chain lubricants and have the general formula

</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0171">Also, very good lubrication values were achieved by combining the inventive lubricant concentrates with amines of formula (V) wherein A represents an —NH-group.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0172">Moreover, good results are obtained when combining the lubricant concentrates of the invention with chain lubricating agents according to the formulas (I), (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IVa) and/or (IVb) that are well-known from the literature and practice.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0173">In such combinations, the otherwise required active substance concentration of amines frequently regarded as critical from a toxicological and ecological point of view can be reduced at will.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0174">Accordingly, the present invention also widens the spectrum of formulation resources to the applications engineer.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0175">In general, the lubricant concentrates combined with amine-containing chain lubricant active substances have sufficiently good antimicrobial activity to prevent germ growth or even destroy germs in practice. In those cases where these combination active substances are absent or their concentration is not sufficiently high, it is of course possible to add further antimicrobially active substances.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0176">This is illustrated in the Examples E6, E7, E8 and E9 merely by way of example. In addition, there are many other options.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0177">The TNO method was performed to determine the material compatibility. To this end, formulation E1 was used without dilution and as a working solution with 1% dilution.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0178">According to the description of the test, PET bottles are filled with water and conditioned with carbon dioxide in such a way that the pressure inside the bottles is approximately 7 bar. The base cups of the bottles are then dipped in the formulation of the comparative example or the example for use according to the invention and stored in a Petri dish for a period of 24 hours. After 24 hours the bottles are opened, emptied and the base cups rinsed with water. A visual evaluation of the base cups reveals that in the test with the example for use according to the invention only a few shallow stress cracks, grade A, are present in the base area. Grading is performed in accordance with the reference pictures contained in chapter IV-22 of the book “CODE OF PRACTICE—Guidelines for an Industrial Code of Practice for Refillable PET Bottles”, Edition 1, 1993-1994.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0179">Accordingly, the performance in respect of PET bottles can likewise be rated as positive: little stress corrosion cracking, confined to the base cup, was determined for both tests. The stand ring displayed no stress corrosion cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0180">As already indicated, it was found that the persistence of the working solution of agent E1 according to the invention on the chains increases as the water hardness increases.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0181">An increase in the water hardness can accordingly also extend the intervals between metering times.</p>
