<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present technique relates generally to pumping systems and, more specifically, to systems and methods for assembling and disassembling a pump.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Existing pumps, such as polyester resin pumps, have a plurality of annular sections that are integrally coupled together, such that the individual sections are not individually accessible for servicing, maintenance, repair, and so forth. For example, one typical pump includes a plurality of tie rods extending along the length of the pump, such that the tie rods secure all annular sections of the pump together in an integral manner. Unfortunately, this integral assembly of the pump prevents independent release and access of the individual sections of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Similarly, another typical pump includes a plurality of threaded annular sections that are threaded together at different positions along the length of the pump, such that the individual sections of the pump are not independently releasable and accessible when installed in a particular pumping system. In other words, the individual sections must be rotated with respect to one another during assembly or disassembly. Unfortunately, this rotational movement between the individual sections cannot be performed while the pump is installed within a system, because various pipes and mounting structures are coupled to the body of the pump. As a result, the entire pump must be removed from the particular pumping system to gain access to the various sections of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The forgoing and other existing pumps are so integrally coupled together and integrally coupled within the particular pumping system that access and servicing requires complete removal of the pump and/or complete disassembly of the pump. Therefore, the existing pumps are not amenable to independent at release, access, servicing, and repair of individual sections of the respective pump.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For these reasons, a technique is needed for independently releasing various sections of a pump, such that these sections can be independently accessed, serviced, and repaired.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary pumping system <b>10</b> having a primary pump <b>12</b> coupled to a motor <b>14</b> via a transmission or drive section <b>16</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present technique. In addition, the illustrated pumping system <b>10</b> includes a secondary pump <b>18</b> coupled to the motor <b>14</b> via the transmission or drive section <b>16</b>. As discussed in further detail below, the primary pump <b>12</b> includes a plurality of sections, such as a midsection <b>20</b> and opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, which end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are independently releasable via respective bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are independent from one another and, also, enable the sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> to remain in a stationary position during assembly or disassembly. In other words, the midsection <b>20</b>, or the end section <b>22</b>, or the end section <b>24</b>, or a combination thereof may remain coupled together, or coupled to a chassis or fluid conduits, while the bolts <b>26</b> and/or bolts <b>28</b> are installed or removed from the primary pump <b>12</b>. For example, the end section <b>22</b> can be removed from the midsection <b>20</b> while the end section <b>24</b> remains coupled to the midsection <b>20</b> or, alternatively, the end section <b>24</b> can be removed from the midsection <b>20</b> while the end section <b>22</b> remains coupled to the midsection <b>20</b>. Accordingly, various wearable and replaceable components, such as seals, guides, valves, pistons, and rings, can be selectively accessed by independently removing either one of the end sections <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. For these reasons, a service technician does not need to completely remove the primary pump <b>12</b> from the pumping system <b>10</b>, nor does the technician need to completely disassemble the pump <b>12</b> when access is desired only in one end or the other of the pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pumping system <b>10</b> includes an enclosure or chassis <b>30</b> that supports the motor <b>14</b>, the primary and secondary pumps <b>12</b> and <b>18</b>, and the intermediate transmission or drive section <b>16</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the motor <b>14</b> is an air powered motor having an air inlet <b>32</b> that connects with an air outlet <b>34</b> of an air control assembly <b>36</b>. The illustrated air control assembly <b>36</b> includes an air inlet <b>38</b> that connects with a remote or independent air supply. The air control assembly <b>36</b> also includes a pressure regulator <b>40</b> and an air valve <b>42</b> disposed between the air outlet <b>34</b> and the air inlet <b>38</b> to control the pressure and flow of the air through the air control assembly <b>36</b>. The air control assembly <b>36</b> also includes a gauge <b>44</b> to indicate an air pressure flowing through the assembly <b>36</b> to the air inlet <b>32</b> of the motor <b>14</b>. However, the air control assembly <b>36</b> and the motor <b>14</b> may be replaced with a variety of other motors and control assemblies, such as a gas powered motor, a hydraulic motor, an electric motor, electronic control circuits, software-based control interfaces, computers, and various electromechanical drives and control assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The illustrated transmission or drive section <b>16</b> transfers and/or converts a reciprocating motion, e.g., a linear reciprocating motion, by the motor <b>14</b> to the primary and secondary pumps <b>12</b> and <b>18</b>. As illustrated, the enclosure or chassis <b>30</b> supports the primary pump <b>12</b> in a fixed position below the chassis <b>30</b> via a plurality of beams or support members <b>46</b>. In a region between the enclosure or chassis <b>30</b> and the primary pump <b>12</b>, the transmission or drive section <b>16</b> includes a pump drive rod <b>48</b>, which reciprocally moves in an upward and downward linear motion as driven by the adjacent motor <b>14</b>. This upward and downward reciprocal motion, in turn, drives internal pumping mechanisms within the primary pump <b>12</b>, as discussed in further detail below. At the top end of the primary pump <b>12</b>, the internal pumping mechanisms are coupled to the pump drive rod <b>48</b> via a nut <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the primary pump <b>12</b> includes a fluid cup <b>52</b> in the sealing region between the pump drive rod <b>48</b> and the internal pumping mechanisms. In certain embodiments, this fluid cup <b>52</b> retains a fluid, such as a solvent compatible with the fluid being pumped by the primary pump <b>12</b>, to maintain wetness and reliability of the seals in that region. In addition, the fluid cup <b>52</b> may function to capture fluids leaking from the primary pump <b>12</b> in the sealing region between the pump drive rod <b>48</b> and the internal pumping mechanisms of the primary pump <b>12</b>. In operation, the primary pump <b>12</b> intakes a fluid, such as a polyester resin, at a primary fluid inlet <b>54</b> and pumps the fluid outward through a primary fluid outlet <b>56</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Other working fluids may include gel coat, paint, oil or solvent, water, or abrasive slurries, or a variety of coating materials. Depending on the particular application and working fluid(s), the primary and second pumps <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> may comprise a variety of pumping types and configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of the pumping system <b>10</b> illustrating a primary reciprocating motion <b>58</b> of the pump drive rod <b>48</b>, which conveys a secondary reciprocating motion <b>60</b> to the secondary pump <b>18</b> via a slave arm <b>62</b> of the transmission or drive section <b>16</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present technique. As illustrated, the pump drive rod <b>48</b> directly transmits the primary reciprocation motion <b>58</b> in a generally linear manner from the motor <b>14</b> to the primary pump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In turn, the pump drive rod <b>48</b> moves the slave arm <b>62</b> in the primary reciprocating motion <b>58</b> at a first pivot joint <b>64</b>. In response to this movement at the first pivot joint <b>64</b>, the slave arm <b>62</b> also pivots about a second pivot joint <b>66</b> at an opposite end from the first pivot joint <b>64</b>. At an intermediate position between the first and second pivot joints <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, the slave arm <b>62</b> has a third pivot joint <b>68</b> coupled to a moveable drive member <b>70</b> of the secondary pump <b>18</b> via a retaining clip <b>72</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the slave arm <b>62</b> rotates about the first and second pivot joint <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> in a curved reciprocating motion, such that the slave arm <b>62</b> conveys only a portion (i.e., motion <b>60</b>) of the primary reciprocating motion <b>58</b> to the moveable drive member <b>70</b>. However, alternate embodiments of the transmission or drive section <b>18</b> and the slave arm <b>62</b> may convey equal or greater amounts (i.e., motion <b>60</b>) of the primary reciprocating motion <b>58</b> to the secondary pump <b>18</b>. At the opposite end from the slave arm <b>62</b>, the secondary pump <b>18</b> is coupled to a portion of the enclosure or chassis <b>30</b> via a fourth pivot joint <b>74</b> and associated clip retainer <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, the secondary reciprocating motion <b>60</b> drives the moveable drive member <b>70</b> inward and outward from the secondary pump <b>18</b>, thereby drawing fluid in through a secondary fluid inlet <b>78</b> and pumping the fluid outward from a secondary fluid outlet <b>80</b>. For example, in certain embodiments, the secondary pump <b>18</b> may transfer a catalyst for a polyester resin being pumped through the primary pump <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, the primary and secondary pumps <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> may convey other fluids that are mixed together for a particular application, such as paint and other desired materials.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the primary pump <b>12</b> illustrating various components of the end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> coupled to the midsection <b>20</b> via the bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively. In certain embodiments, these bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be replaced or supplemented with a variety of other fasteners, such as a latching member having a cam mechanism, a leveraging member, or another mechanism to compress the adjacent sections together without rotating the sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> with respect to one another. In other words, the bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> or various other fasteners may be used to assemble and disassemble the sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> by a motion oriented along the length or longitudinal axis of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Again, this lengthwise and/or axial motion of the fasteners, e.g., bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, enables the primary pump <b>12</b> and its various sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and/or <b>24</b> to remain in place (with respect to one another and/or with respect to the chassis <b>30</b>) during assembly and disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As mentioned above, the primary pump <b>12</b> may include a variety of pumping mechanisms, such as pistons, plungers, diaphragms, axial flow impellers, radial flow impellers, mixed radial/axial flow impellers, and so forth. These various pumping mechanisms can include single stage or multi-stage pumping devices and various components tailored to a particular application and working fluid. For example, working fluids having a relatively higher viscosity (e.g., polyester resin) or abrasive materials (e.g., abrasive slurries) benefit from certain types of displacement pumps, which can achieve high pressures with low pumping/drive velocities. In addition, embodiments of the primary pump <b>12</b> include a variety of wearable and replaceable components, such as o-rings and various seals, valves (e.g., ball valves), pistons and associated rings, guides, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the end section <b>22</b> of the primary pump <b>12</b> includes a first flange or inlet seal section <b>90</b> having the primary fluid inlet <b>54</b>. The illustrated end section <b>22</b> also includes an intake control or fluid valve section <b>92</b> between the first flange <b>90</b> and the midsection <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first flange <b>90</b> and the fluid valve section <b>92</b> of the end section <b>22</b> are coupled to the midsection <b>20</b> via a set of four bolts <b>26</b>, such that the end section <b>22</b> can be attached and released independently from components of the opposite end section <b>24</b>. In certain embodiments, the first flange <b>90</b> and the fluid valve section <b>92</b> are either an integral component or separate from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pump <b>12</b> has a geometry and configuration particularly well suited for coupling the end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to the midsection <b>20</b> in an independent manner. In certain embodiments, the first flange <b>90</b> and the fluid valve section <b>92</b> may have a variety of external shapes and internal mechanisms, as discussed in further detail below. However, the illustrated first flange <b>90</b> has a generally square or rectangular exterior structure, whereas the fluid valve section <b>92</b> has a generally annular or cylindrical shaped external structure. At an interface <b>94</b> between the first flange <b>90</b> and the fluid valve section <b>92</b>, the first flange <b>90</b> has four corner portions <b>96</b> extending beyond the annular shaped periphery of the fluid valve section <b>92</b>. In each of these corner portions <b>96</b>, one of the bolts <b>26</b> extends through a receptacle <b>98</b> in the first flange <b>90</b>, and then extends outside the annular shaped periphery of the fluid valve section <b>92</b> until the respective bolt <b>26</b> engages a threaded receptacle in the midsection <b>20</b> of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Similar to the first flange <b>90</b>, the illustrated midsection <b>20</b> has a generally square or rectangular external structure, such that the midsection <b>20</b> has corner portions extended outwardly from the annular shaped external structure of the fluid valve section <b>92</b>. As discussed in further detail below, an embodiment of the midsection <b>20</b> has a generally cylindrical shaped interior. Accordingly, these protruding corner portions <b>100</b> advantageously provide structure (e.g., greater wall thickness) between the cylindrical interior and the rectangular exterior. In view of this greater thickness, the protruding corner portions <b>100</b> enable each of the bolts <b>26</b> to thread into the midsection <b>20</b>, thereby securing the end section <b>22</b> to the midsection <b>20</b> independently from the opposite end section <b>24</b>. In alternative embodiments, the various sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> may have different externally shaped structures, which also provide sufficient wall thickness to receive bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> independently in the opposite ends of the primary pump <b>12</b>. For example, the midsection <b>20</b> may have a cylindrical shape to accommodate more or less than four bolts at each end, a triangular shape to accommodate three bolts at each end, or any other suitable geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a set of four bolts <b>28</b> secure components of the end section <b>24</b> into corner portions <b>102</b> of the midsection <b>20</b> in a similar manner as described above with reference to the opposite end section <b>22</b>. Specifically, the end section <b>24</b> includes an outlet seal section <b>104</b> having the primary fluid outlet <b>56</b>, a second flange <b>106</b>, a drive seal section <b>108</b>, and the fluid cup <b>52</b> (e.g., solvent cup) described in detail above. Similar to the fluid valve section <b>92</b>, the outlet seal section <b>104</b> has a generally annular or cylindrical shaped outer structure, whereas the midsection <b>20</b> has a generally rectangular or square shaped outer structure. At an interface <b>110</b> between the midsection <b>20</b> and the outlet seal section <b>104</b>, the corner portions <b>102</b> of the midsection <b>20</b> protrude or extend outwardly from the annular shaped exterior of outlet seal section <b>104</b>. In this manner, the midsection <b>20</b> has a relatively greater amount of structure (e.g., thicker wall) in the regions of these corner portions <b>102</b>, because of the different internal and external geometries (e.g., cylindrical interior and rectangular exterior). Accordingly, the set of four bolts <b>28</b> extending through receptacles in the second flange <b>106</b> extend lengthwise along the exterior of the outlet seal section <b>104</b> until they reach the corner portions <b>102</b> of the midsection <b>20</b>, where the bolts <b>28</b> thread into threaded receptacles <b>112</b> in each of the respective corner portions <b>102</b>. Again, the corner portions <b>102</b> enable the bolts <b>28</b> to fasten the components of the end section <b>24</b> to the midsection <b>20</b> independently from the components of the opposite end section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, this ability to independently release either one of the opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> from the midsection <b>20</b> enables a service technician to release, access, service, repair, and/or replace components from the perspective of either one of the opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the primary pump <b>12</b>. In addition, the use of separate bolts <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and respective corner portions <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> at opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> enables the technician to release and access one or both of the end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in place within the overall pumping system <b>10</b>. In other words, the primary pump <b>12</b> does not need to be removed from the pumping system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, because release of the bolts <b>26</b> and or <b>28</b> does not necessitate rotation of the sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> with respect to one another, i.e., typical of pumps having threaded annular structures as discussed in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of the primary pump <b>12</b> illustrating internal seals, wear components, moving components, and various other structures that may be accessed at one or both of the opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. As illustrated, the end section <b>22</b> comprises a first o-ring or seal <b>120</b> between the inlet seal section <b>90</b> and fluid valve section <b>92</b>, and a second o-ring or seal between the fluid valve section <b>92</b> and the midsection <b>20</b>. In addition, the end section <b>22</b> includes a fluid intake valve <b>124</b> having a ball member <b>126</b> that moves along a guide <b>128</b> in a path <b>130</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This ball member <b>126</b> seals against a third seal assembly <b>132</b>, which may include a variety of plastic, metal, rubber, hard metals, or hard materials (e.g., ceramic or carbide), or other suitable materials having an annular shape to seal against the ball member <b>126</b>. For example, the assembly <b>132</b> may include a set of four annular springs and/or seals, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. These o-rings, seals, and/or guides <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>132</b> and the fluid intake valve <b>124</b> are all wear components, which may be replaced at one or more time during the life of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Accordingly, if servicing or replacement of one of these components is desired, then a service technician can release the bolts <b>26</b> to gain access to the end section <b>22</b> independently from the end section <b>24</b> as discussed in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the end section <b>24</b> also includes a plurality of seals and other wear components, which can be replaced or serviced by releasing the bolts <b>28</b> independently from the bolts <b>26</b>. Specifically, the end section <b>24</b> includes a fourth o-ring or seal <b>134</b> between the midsection <b>20</b> and the outlet seal section <b>104</b>, and a fifth o-ring or seal <b>136</b> between the outlet seal section <b>104</b> and the drive seal section <b>108</b>. In addition, the end section <b>24</b> includes seals and/or guides <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> between the drive seal section <b>108</b> and inner pump rod or drive member <b>142</b>. Furthermore, an annular retainer (e.g., a threaded annular structure) is coupled to the drive seal section <b>108</b> over the seals and/or guides <b>138</b> and <b>140</b>, thereby retaining the seals and/or guides <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> between the drive seal section <b>108</b> and the drive member <b>142</b>. Again, servicing or replacement of these seals and/or guides <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, and <b>140</b> may be desirable over the life of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Accordingly, if servicing or placement is desired for these seals and/or guides <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>, or <b>140</b>, then a service technician can release the bolts <b>28</b> to facilitate removal of the outlet seal section <b>104</b>, the second flange <b>106</b>, the drive seal section <b>108</b>, and the fluid cup <b>52</b> independently from the components at the opposite end section <b>22</b>. As discussed in detail above, this independent access and release at the opposite end sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is advantageous for servicing and repair, because the primary pump <b>12</b> can remain mounted within the overall pumping system <b>10</b> and can remain completely assembled with the exception of the particular end section <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> being released for servicing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Inside the illustrated midsection <b>20</b>, the primary pump <b>12</b> includes a piston assembly <b>144</b> comprising a piston <b>146</b>, which is movably and sealingly disposed inside a cylinder or cylindrical interior <b>148</b> of the midsection <b>20</b>. The illustrated piston <b>146</b> is coupled to an end of the inner pump rod or drive member <b>142</b>. Specifically, the piston <b>146</b> has an annular shaped exterior, which moves reciprocally up and down along the cylindrical interior <b>148</b> of the midsection <b>20</b> in response to the primary reciprocating motion <b>58</b> of the inner pump rod or drive member <b>142</b>. At an interface <b>150</b> between the piston <b>146</b> and the cylindrical interior <b>148</b>, the piston assembly <b>144</b> includes one or more retainers <b>151</b> and <b>152</b>, guides <b>153</b>, and seals <b>154</b>, such as a c-clip, a u-guide and c-guide, an o-ring or u-shaped seal, and so forth. The illustrated piston assembly <b>144</b> also includes a fluid pump valve <b>156</b> having a ball member <b>158</b> that moves along a path <b>160</b>. As illustrated, the ball member <b>158</b> is seated against a disk, spring (e.g., a disk spring), and/or seal <b>160</b> of an annular assembly <b>162</b>, which in turn is sealed and retained against an outer annular portion <b>164</b> of the piston <b>146</b> via o-rings or seals <b>166</b> and <b>168</b> and retainer <b>169</b> (e.g., c-clip).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Again, all of these seals, guides, and valve members are wear items, which may be serviced or replaced during the life of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment, these components of the midsection <b>20</b> may be accessed, serviced, and/or replaced by removing the bolts <b>28</b> at the end section <b>24</b>, and then removing components of the end section <b>24</b> and subsequently removing the drive member <b>142</b> and the piston assembly <b>144</b>. Alternatively, the components of the midsection <b>20</b> may be accessed, serviced, and/or replaced by removing the bolts <b>26</b> at the end section <b>22</b>, and then removing components of the end section <b>22</b> and subsequently removing the drive member <b>142</b> and the piston assembly <b>144</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Again, the access and servicing of these components within the midsection <b>20</b> may be performed without disassembling the entire pump <b>12</b> and without removing the entire pump <b>12</b> from the overall pumping system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation, a downward stroke of the drive member <b>142</b> and the piston assembly <b>144</b> forces internal fluids to pressure the ball member <b>126</b> in the end section <b>22</b> against the seal <b>132</b>, thereby causing fluid pressure to build within the fluid valve section <b>92</b> such that the ball member <b>158</b> within the piston assembly <b>144</b> becomes unseated from the seal <b>160</b>. In turn, further downward movement of the drive member <b>142</b> and the piston assembly <b>144</b> causes fluid to flow from the fluid valve section <b>92</b> into the midsection <b>20</b> through the interior of the piston <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon reversing from a downward stroke to an upward stroke, the piston assembly <b>144</b> creates a lower pressure in the fluid valve section <b>92</b> relative to the midsection <b>20</b>, thereby forcing the ball member <b>158</b> to become reseated against the seal <b>160</b>. As a result, the upward stroke of the piston assembly <b>144</b> moves all fluid within the midsection <b>20</b> upwardly toward the outlet seal section <b>104</b>, where the fluid exits through the primary fluid outlet <b>56</b> as indicted by arrow <b>170</b>. Simultaneously with this upward stroke, the pressure differential between the fluid valve section <b>92</b> and the midsection <b>20</b> during the upward stoke of the piston assembly <b>144</b> creates a pressure differential between the fluid valve section <b>92</b> and the primary fluid inlet <b>54</b> of the end section <b>22</b>. More specifically, the fluid within the fluid valve section <b>92</b> is at a lower pressure than the fluid at the primary fluid inlet <b>54</b>, thereby forcing the ball member <b>126</b> to become unseated from the seal <b>132</b>. As a result, fluid enters through the primary fluid inlet <b>54</b> and fills the cavity between the piston assembly <b>144</b> and the first flange or inlet seal section <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the drive member <b>142</b> and the piston assembly <b>144</b> continue to reciprocate in upward and downward strokes, the primary pump <b>12</b> continues to draw fluid through the fluid valve section <b>92</b> and to pump the fluid outwardly through the outlet seal section <b>104</b>. Again, as discussed in detail above, many of these seals, rings, guides, valves, and other components become worn over time. Advantageously, the independent fastening mechanisms of the present technique enable the worn components to be serviced or replaced via access through one of the end sections <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> without completely disassembling the primary pump <b>12</b> or removing the primary pump <b>12</b> from the overall pumping system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the primary pump <b>12</b> illustrating the various components exploded from opposite ends of the primary pump <b>12</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present technique. If servicing is desired for the pump <b>12</b>, then the release of bolts <b>26</b> enables access and servicing of the inlet seal section <b>90</b>, o-ring <b>120</b>, various seals and guides of the assembly <b>132</b>, ball member <b>126</b>, fluid valve section <b>92</b>, o-ring <b>122</b> and various seals, guides, valves, and components of the piston assembly <b>144</b>. Alternatively, removal of the bolts <b>28</b> at the end section <b>24</b> enables access to the seal <b>140</b>, the guide <b>138</b>, the drive seal section <b>108</b>, the o-ring <b>136</b>, the outlet seal section <b>104</b>, and the o-ring <b>134</b>. In addition, the drive member <b>142</b>, piston <b>146</b>, and other components of the piston assembly <b>144</b> may be accessed and serviced after removing the fluid cup <b>52</b>, bolts <b>28</b>, flange <b>106</b>, drive seal section <b>108</b>, and outlet seal section <b>104</b>. Accordingly, a service technician can selectively gain access to the various components from either end of the primary pump <b>12</b>. Depending on the particular servicing or repair issues, it may be desirable to independently access these various components from the first end section <b>22</b> or the second end section <b>24</b>. Advantageously, the present technique allows such independent release, inspection, and servicing without disassembling the entire pump <b>12</b> or removing it from the overall pumping system <b>10</b>.</p>
