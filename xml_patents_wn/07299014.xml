<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mobile communication system and, more particularly, to a video call receiving service using a sub-address of the mobile communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a mobile communication system is a communication system featuring radio communication between a moving element, such as a ship, airplane, and car, and a fixed station. Types of mobile communication include land mobile radio communication, oversea mobile radio communication, and air mobile radio communication, according to the locations where the moving radio station moves. The mobile communication system may employ an Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) system protocol using an analog method, a Code Division Multiple Access protocol (CDMA), a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system protocol, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system protocol using a digital method, a Personal Communication System (PCS) protocol, and an International Mobile Telecommunication in the year 2000 (IMT-2000) system protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a background art mobile communication system structure. The mobile communication system comprises a terminal <b>10</b> that supports the AMPS system and the CDMA system, selectively or simultaneously, and allows a subscriber to communicate through the mobile communication network. A base station <b>20</b> performs the communication with the terminal <b>10</b> using an IS-95 protocol in a radio section. A control station <b>30</b> connected to the base station <b>20</b> controls a radio link and a wired link and also performs a hand-off function. An exchanger <b>40</b> connected to the control station <b>30</b> constructs a communication path of the subscriber and connects to another communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the terminal is able to perform a call through the base station <b>20</b>, the control station <b>30</b>, and the exchanger <b>40</b>. A numbering system of the CDMA mobile terminal is designed to make a call by allocating one number for one terminal <b>10</b>. However, the mobile terminal does not differentiate a video call and a voice call. Therefore, only one number is allocated to a video terminal without division between the video call and the voice call.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The IS-95 CDMA mobile terminal uses one of two numbering systems, such as an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) system and a Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) system. Presently, the CDMA terminal in Korea uses the DTMF system. However, the CDMA terminal transmits the telephone number using a message in a radio section, not using call processing in a band like in a wired telephone. Also, the CDMA method allocates only one telephone number to a Mobile Identification Number (MIN) applied to a terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If a video terminal method based on an ITU-T H.324 standard is applied to the mobile terminal, the subscriber cannot select to answer the call as a video call or a voice call, because the video terminal method is operated by recognizing a general physical layer as a device, such as a modem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the subscriber may pre-designate a setting for receiving either the voice call or the video call, in order to answer the call as the video call or the voice call. However, even in this case, the mobile terminal can only be used for the pre-designated use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, according to the method for video call receiving in a mobile communication system of the background art, there is no certain method for distinguishing the video call and the voice call. This is because a standard for receiving the video call of the CDMA video terminal is not designated, and the method in which call kinds of the mobile terminal are pre-designated, for solving the above problem, is able to receive only the pre-designated kinds of calls.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the invention is to solve at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A service application method for a present sub-address system is not defined by a standard related to a mobile communication system. However, the sub-address system applied to an Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) recognizes a plurality of terminals so as to be fit in with objects. Each terminal connected to one ISDN compares the transmitted sub-address with its own sub-addresses and recognizes that it is a destination terminal, if the compared sub-addresses coincide.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention selectively receives a destination call using a sub-address system, defined in North American CDMA standards higher than IS-95B. The mobile terminal has different characteristics from those of the ISDN, in which a plurality of terminals can be connected to a wired section. However, a plurality of numbers are allocated to a destination terminal and, therefore, the video call and the voice call can be distinguished.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the above method, sub-addresses corresponding to the video call and to the voice call are allocated in advance, and the corresponding answers (i.e., video call or voice call) made by the destination terminal are processed when the sub-addresses are terminated. If the sub-addresses are not terminated or another sub-address is terminated, the terminal does not receive the call.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a mobile communication system using a sub-address according to the present invention. When an origination terminal <b>11</b> transmits a voice call and a video call through an exchanger <b>40</b>, a destination terminal <b>12</b> recognizes the calls according to sub-addresses transmitted from the origination terminal <b>11</b>. The destination terminal <b>11</b> supports the sub-address system for the video call and the voice call.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The destination terminal <b>12</b> receives the call by distinguishing the video call and from the voice call only when the video call and the voice call distinguishing function is set (A). Otherwise the destination terminal <b>12</b> receives the call as a voice call, as it would in a voice exclusive terminal, if the distinguishing function is not selected (B).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are flow charts showing a method for a voice call receiving service in a mobile communication terminal according to the present invention. As shown therein, the method for video call receiving service according to the present invention comprises transmitting an originating message, including a sub-address, by the origination terminal <b>11</b> to the destination terminal <b>12</b>; and connecting as the video call or the voice call, corresponding to the sub-address, to the origination terminal <b>11</b> by the destination terminal <b>12</b> after receiving the originating message from the origination terminal <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the origination terminal <b>11</b> transmits an originating message, including a sub-address corresponding to a voice call or to a video call (S<b>11</b>), the destination terminal <b>12</b> receives the originating message (S<b>12</b>). The destination terminal <b>12</b> judges whether or not the originating message includes information for an origination continuation message (S<b>13</b>), and the destination message waits for the origination continuation message if this information is present (S<b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After waiting a certain period, the destination terminal <b>12</b> judges whether or not the origination continuation message is transmitted (S<b>15</b>). If so, the destination terminal <b>12</b> then judges whether or not a sub-address function, which is able to distinguish the call, is set in the destination terminal <b>12</b> (S<b>16</b>). If the sub-address function is set, the destination terminal <b>12</b> distinguishes the call as a video call or a voice call (S<b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The destination terminal <b>12</b> displays the result of distinguishing the video call and the voice call on a User Interface UI (S<b>18</b>). Then, a user decides whether to receive the video call or the voice call (<b>19</b>). In addition, if the user decides to receive the video call or the voice call, then the chosen call is connected to the origination terminal (S<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, if (1) the originating message does not include the origination continuation message, (2) the sub-address function is not set on the destination terminal <b>12</b>, or (3) the terminal could not distinguish the video call and the voice call, the termination state of the destination terminal <b>12</b> becomes the same as the termination state for a voice call (S<b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also, if the user of the destination terminal <b>12</b> selects not to receive the video call or the voice call, the destination terminal <b>12</b> notifies a UI, of the origination terminal <b>11</b>, of the refusal for a certain call (S<b>22</b>) and disconnects the call connected by the originating message (S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an ISDN numbering system based on an E.164 standard, which may be supported in a Network Service Access Point (NSAP) (ITU-T Access Point Recommendation X.213/ISO 8348 AD2). The numbering system comprises a National Destination Code (NDC) for relaying the call of the destination subscriber in a communication network; a Subscriber Number (SN), which is needed to discriminate a real termination subscriber; and a Sub-Address (SA), which is granted to distinguish a plurality of terminals having the same subscriber number but various media services. The NDC and the SN are generally called a principal number, and the SA is allowed to have a maximum of 20 octets (40 digits). The setting and granting of the SA may be applied freely, because there is no definition in the standard.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The system supporting the above numbering system recognizes the destination terminal <b>12</b> through the principal number, and the SA is transmitted to the corresponding destination terminal <b>12</b>. The destination terminal <b>12</b> distinguishes the video call and the voice call according to the transmitted SA and processes the call according to the type of call.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method for a video call receiving service in a mobile communication system according to the present invention will be described further with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An IS-95 call processing message, which is related to the SA system, is preferably used in the applied terminals <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and in the system to distinguish the video call and the voice call. In addition, numbering systems in a wired terminal and an exchanger preferably support the SA system, while otherwise operating normally.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The terminals <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, which are able to distinguish the video call and the voice call, preferably embody a UI and an additional button. Terminals <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> distinguish the video call and the voice call only in case that the video call/voice call distinguishing function is set. If the distinguishing function is not selected, the terminals are operated using the numbering system in the same manner as would a voice exclusive terminal and, therefore, the destination terminal receives the call as the voice call.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the video and the voice call distinguishing function is selected in the destination terminal <b>12</b>, the destination terminal <b>12</b> makes an inner call according to the transmitted principal number. In addition, the destination terminal <b>12</b> waits a certain period for the origination continuation message, after a traffic channel state between the origination terminal <b>11</b> and the destination terminal <b>12</b> becomes a conversation sub-state, according to a standard higher than IS-95B.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Two sub-addresses <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are granted for the video call and for the voice call, respectively, in the destination terminal to distinguish the two types of calls. If the origination terminal <b>11</b> and the destination terminal <b>12</b> are connected by the video call, the origination terminal <b>11</b> inputs the principal number of the corresponding destination terminal, <b>12</b>*<b>101</b>, and transmits it. The exchanger distinguishes the corresponding terminal through the principal number of the destination terminal <b>12</b>, and the corresponding destination terminal <b>12</b> waits for the origination continuation message. In the case that the origination terminal <b>11</b> and the destination terminal <b>12</b> are connected by the voice call, the origination terminal <b>11</b> transmits the principal number of the corresponding terminal, <b>12</b>*<b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the destination terminal <b>12</b> receives the origination continuation message including the SA information record, and the SA is <b>101</b>, the destination terminal <b>12</b> is maintained in the video call receive standby state. If the SA is <b>102</b>, the destination terminal <b>12</b> transitions to a voice call receive standby state. Also, if the origination continuation message is not transmitted, the destination terminal <b>12</b> notifies the origination terminal UI of the call refusal, according to the SA, and disconnects the inner call connect.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While processing the SA information record, the terminals <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> use the SA system of an NSAP, which is prescribed in International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT), Recommendation X.213/ISO 8348 AD2, or by a user definition according to the IS-95B standard. The SA system may be embodied differently by different service companies and may be embodied so as to communicate with a wired network, such as the ISDN, if the system is under a NSAP numbering system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the destination terminal <b>12</b> receives the SA <b>101</b> or <b>102</b>, it judges the video call or the voice call according to the transmitted SA. Thereafter, the destination terminal displays a message, through the UI, asking the user whether to receive the call. If the user selects to receive the call, the origination terminal <b>11</b> and the destination terminal <b>12</b> are connected to communicate the call using the appropriate video or voice media.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the user refuses to receive a certain call, the system informs the origination terminal <b>11</b> UI of reasons for the refusal, via a message.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, according to the method for video call receiving service in the mobile communication system of the present invention, the video call and the voice call are distinguished through the SA granted to the mobile communication terminal, and the user is able to receive the call selectively. In addition, the transmission/reception of the respective call can be automatically performed and applied to the video call media.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also, the process of recognizing and selectively processing the video call and the voice call can be performed in the terminal. Therefore, a processing load of the system can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the method for the video call receiving service in the mobile communication system according to the present invention can communicate with a wired video terminal through a wired exchanger, and the user is able to choose the video call or the voice call. Therefore, the system can immediately respond to a user's request.</p>
