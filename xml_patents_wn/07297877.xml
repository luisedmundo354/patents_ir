<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates in general to a substrate to which a laser technique is applied, and more particularly to a substrate applied to high frequency field.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Micro-via on a substrate can be categorized by blind via, buried via and through via. Conventionally, the micro-via, of which the bore diameter is larger than 200 Î¼m, is formed by mechanically drilling and others are formed by a laser technique.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional laser technique is using a laser with an optical system to work on a target workpiece. A pulsed laser beam can be focused on the target workpiece by a mirror or a prism, and the density of the laser power ranges from 105 to 1015 Watts per square centimeter (W/cm<sup>2</sup>). Such high laser power density can drill on any materials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because the heat inputted by the laser beams is highly more than the heat reflected, transmitted or spread by the materials, the materials are heating very fast and evaporating to form a micro-via. Several continuing micro-via form a cutting line with a narrow width by relatively moving the laser beams and the workpiece so that the substrate is cut. Further, a proper assisting gas can be added during the cutting process to help chemical reaction or remove the molten ashes in the cutting line.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, it is a lateral view of a conventional micro via structure to which a laser technique is applied. The integrated-layer substrate <b>100</b> includes a build-up layer <b>102</b> and a core layer <b>104</b>. The micro-via structure is disposed on the build-up layer <b>102</b>. The differential signal pair on the upper layer <b>110</b> is electrically connected to the differential signal pair on the lower layer <b>112</b> by a conductive layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a top view of a conventional micro via structure to which a laser technique is applied, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a three-dimensional view of a conventional micro via structure to which a laser technique is applied. A third dielectric layer <b>114</b> is formed in the micro-via structure <b>106</b> by a laser technique to separate the micro-via structure <b>106</b> into a first camber conductive layer <b>116</b> and a second cambered conductive layer <b>118</b>. The differential signal pair <b>110</b> includes a first trace <b>1101</b> and a second trace <b>1102</b>. The first trace <b>1101</b> is electrically connected to the right conductive column <b>116</b>, and the second trace <b>1102</b> is electrically connected to the left conductive column <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, the differential signal pair <b>110</b> is used to suppress the common mode noise as long as the distance between two traces of the differential signal pair <b>110</b> is constant and small. When the distance between two traces of the differential signal pair <b>110</b> is less, the coupling capacity is higher, and the common mode noise is easier to be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, as for the conventional micro-via structure <b>106</b>, the first camber conductive layer <b>116</b> and the second camber conductive layer <b>118</b> are curve-shapes structures so that the distance there between changes and is larger than the distance between the first trace <b>1101</b> and the second trace <b>1102</b>. As the result, the coupling capacity decreases due to the increasing of the distance, and the characteristic impedance of the differential signal pair <b>110</b> won't be kept in a constant. The reflection of high-speed signals and the noise interferences will be raised and may produce electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a substrate to which a laser technique is applied. The substrate with micro-via structure can keep the coupling capacity when the signals are transmitted and prevents the change of the transmit route, so that the reflection of high-speed signals and the noise interferences can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention achieves the above-identified object by providing a substrate to which a laser technique is applied includes a signal layer, a micro-via structure, and a differential signal pair. The micro-via structure includes a first conductive column, a second conductive column, and a third dielectric layer. The first conductive column includes a first flat conductive layer, a first dielectric layer, and a first cambered conductive layer, wherein the first dielectric layer is enclosed between the first flat conductive layer and the first cambered conductive layer. The second conductive column is opposite to the first conductive column and includes a second flat conductive layer, a second dielectric layer, and a second cambered conductive layer, wherein the second dielectric layer is enclosed between the second flat conductive layer and the second cambered conductive layer. The third dielectric layer is disposed between the first conductive column and the second conductive column, and is for electrically separating the first flat conductive layer and the second flat conductive layer. The differential signal pair is disposed on the signal layer, and includes a first trace and a second trace. The first trace is electrically connected to one end of the first flat conductive layer, and the second trace is electrically connected to one end of the second flat conductive layer. The distance between the first trace and the second trace is the same as the distance between the first flat conductive layer and the second flat conductive layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a top view of a substrate to which a laser technique is applied according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a three-dimensional view of a substrate to which a laser technique is applied according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. The substrate with a micro-via structure includes a substrate <b>200</b>, a micro-via structure <b>204</b>, and a differential signal pair <b>210</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> has a signal layer <b>202</b>, and the micro-via structure <b>204</b> disposed on the substrate <b>200</b> includes a first conductive column <b>206</b>, and a second conductive column <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first conductive column <b>206</b> includes a first cambered conductive layer <b>2061</b>, a first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b>, and a first dielectric layer <b>2063</b>. The first dielectric layer <b>2063</b> is enclosed between the first cambered conductive layer <b>2061</b> and the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> to form a structure like a sandwich.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second conductive column <b>208</b> is opposite to the first conductive column <b>206</b> and includes a second cambered conductive layer <b>2081</b>, a second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b>, and a second dielectric layer <b>2083</b>. Similar to the first conductive column <b>206</b>, the second dielectric layer <b>2083</b> is enclosed between the second cambered conductive layer <b>2081</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2083</b>. The second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b> is parallel to the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b>, and a third dielectric layer <b>212</b> is disposed there between.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The micro-via structure <b>204</b> is formed by applying a laser technique. For example, a micro-via is first formed on the substrate <b>200</b> by ultraviolet (UV) rays, and the inner surface of the micro-via is coated by a conductive layer to form a conductive column. Then, dielectric materials are filled in the conductive column to form a dielectric layer. The laser technique is applied again to cut the conductive column and the dielectric layer so as to form the first cambered conductive layer <b>2061</b>, the second cambered conductive layer <b>2081</b>, and two dielectric layers which are parallel to each other. Lastly, the two dielectric layers are coated with conductive layers respectively to for a first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> and a second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The differential signal pair <b>210</b> is formed by a semiconductor technique. For example, a copper layer is disposed on the signal layer <b>202</b>, and several required transmission lines are formed by mask, developing and etching. The differential signal pair is one of the transmission lines disposed on the signal layer <b>202</b> of the substrate <b>200</b> and includes a first trace <b>2101</b> and a second trace <b>2102</b>. The first trace <b>2101</b> is electrically connected to one end of the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b>, and the first trace <b>2101</b> and the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> are linear-arranged. The second trace <b>2102</b> is electrically connected to one end of the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b>, and the second trace <b>2102</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b> are linear-arranged. The distance between the first trace <b>2101</b> and the second trace <b>2102</b> is the same as the distance between the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is clear to see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> that the tops of the first trace <b>2101</b> and the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> are linear-arranged, and the tops of the second trace <b>2102</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b> are linear-arranged, too. As the result, the characteristic impedance of the differential signal pair <b>210</b> can keep constant. That is, the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b> can be considered as the extension of the first trace <b>2101</b> and the second trace <b>2102</b> and have same functions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The laser technique disclosed in the present invention includes using carbon dioxide lasers or ultraviolet (UV) rays. Taking the excimer lasers, one of the ultraviolet (UV) lasers, as the example, the drilling process can be divided by a direct writing process and a mask projection. The wavelength for the excimer lasers is chosen as 157 nm (F2), 193 nm (ArF), 308 nm (XeCl), or 351 nm (XeF). Conventionally, the shorter wavelength brings better result of the ablation for materials processing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, the first cambered conductive layer <b>2061</b>, the second cambered conductive layer <b>2062</b>, the first flat conductive layer <b>2062</b> and the second flat conductive layer <b>2082</b> are formed by a chemical electroplating technique. Besides, the sputtering technique and the electrolytic copper technique can be applied in forming above mentioned conductive layers. The material of the first dielectric layer <b>2063</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>2083</b> are insulating materials with low dielectric constant, such as epoxy, polyimide(PI), or polycarbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The micro-via structure formed on a substrate by a laser technique according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a first flat conductive layer and a second flat conductive layer in order to keep the constant distance between the first trace and the second trace of the differential signal pair and within the micro-via structure. As the result, the characteristic impedance is constant and the outside noise, such as common mode noise or cross talk, can be equivalently coupled into the first trace and the second trace of the differential signal pair. Also, the coupling capacity is still kept when the signals are transmitted through the micro-via structure. The reflective noise no longer is made due to the change of the characteristic impedance, and the phase of the signals won't be shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is noted that the laser technique is very suitable for cutting the micro-via because the less distance between two traces of the differential signal pair is the better. The reflection of high-speed signals and the noise interferences can be reduced more effective.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the micro-via formed by a laser technique is normally is blind via or through via, but the buried via is also obtained by pressing other interlayer with the blind via or through via. It is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
