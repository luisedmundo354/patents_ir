<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to improvements in the design of a window, and in particular to improvements in the design of a double-hung window to provide a uniform wood interior appearance to the double-hung window.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditionally, windows were constructed of wood because wood was readily available for construction. Wood windows are desirable in some applications for their aesthetic appearance. The exposed interior wood can be stained to expose the natural look of the grain of the wood or the interior wood can be painted repeatedly to match the interior of the building or home.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Constructing a window from wood is costly. First, the wood material is expensive. Second, because wood is a naturally occurring material with each piece having a unique structure, some of the wood has natural defects inherent with its structure making it unusable for construction. Additionally, during the manufacturing process the wood can be damaged rendering a piece unusable for construction, thereby increasing waste and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Developments in material science have produced materials like plastic, vinyl, and wood composite materials, which have desirable properties for use in constructing windows. Therefore, although many portions of a window may still be made of wood, like the frame of the sash, there are other portion of the window that are more easily and inexpensively constructed of materials other than wood. Plastics, vinyl, and wood composite materials are desirable because of durability, low cost, and consistency during manufacture, fabrication, and installation. Materials other than wood can give the window better performance by improving window mechanics (i.e., movement) and increasing the structural integrity of the window.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The side jambs, which contain the extension slots and balance tubes for raising and lowering the sashes, and the housing for the sash locks, are more easily constructed from a vinyl extruded material than from wood. However, when the window is closed, this vinyl extruded material is exposed on the interior portion of the window and diminishes the traditional all-wood appearance of the window. Generally, materials like plastics, vinyl, and wood composites cannot be as effectively painted or cannot have their color as easily changed as wood.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be desirable to construct some parts of the window from materials other than wood to obtain the advantages that plastic, vinyl, and wood composite materials produce, while constructing the parts of the window exposed to the interior of the building or home from wood to achieve an aesthetically pleasing window. Therefore, there is a need for a side jamb liner cover, which covers the vinyl exposed at the side jamb of the window and gives the window a uniform all-wood appearance. In particular, there is a need for an upper jamb liner cover that gives the interior of the double-hung window a uniform and traditional wood appearance while the window is in the closed position but still allows for slidable movement of the lower sash of the window.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Weatherstripping is often provided in a window to improve the energy efficiency of the window. The top rail of the upper sash often lacks weatherstrip because the weather strip would be exposed to the interior, thereby diminishing the wood interior appearance of the window. Placing the weatherstrip directly into the sash presents expensive and cumbersome assembly concerns. Providing alternative, non-wood, structures for holding the weatherstrip improves the ease of manufacturing but does not allow for a uniform wood interior appearance of the window. A locking mechanism is provided at the top rail of the upper sash to hold the upper sash in the window frame but still allows for disengagement in order to tilt the upper sash towards the interior of the building or home for maintenance and cleaning. Often this locking mechanism, normally constructed of a non-wood material, is exposed to the interior of the window, thereby diminishing the wood interior appearance of the window. Therefore, there is a need for a top rail weatherstrip and lock holder, which contains a sash locking mechanism and weatherstripping, but still provides a uniform wood interior appearance while the window is closed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a double-hung window having an upper sash with a wood frame, a lower sash with a wood frame, and a vinyl side jamb for securing the upper sash and the lower sash within the window. The vinyl side jamb has an interior extension slot, a lock slot, and an exterior extension slot. The present invention provides means for covering the interior extension slot and lock slot to provide a uniform wood interior to the double-hung window while the upper sash and the lower sash are in the closed position and allowing slidable movement of the lower sash.</p>

The first and second side jambs comprise slots for receiving the respective upper and lower sashes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the side jamb has an interior extension slot <b>119</b>, an exterior extension slot <b>123</b> and a lock pin slot <b>121</b>. The slots allow the sashes to vertically slide along the side jambs. These slots are not typically constructed of wood, so when the window is closed, the non-wood interior extension slot <b>119</b> and lock pin slot <b>121</b> (if not otherwise covered) would be exposed to the interior.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the double-hung window <b>100</b> in one of several possible open positions. In these open positions, there is either an upper gap <b>134</b> between the top rail <b>108</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b> and the head jamb <b>122</b> or a lower gap <b>136</b> between the bottom rail <b>113</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b> and the sill <b>124</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there can be both an upper gap <b>134</b> and a lower gap <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To conceal the side jambs, each of the upper side jambs have been covered with a concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> (See FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>9</b>) to give the interior of the double-hung window <b>100</b> a uniform wood appearance. Additionally, the lower side jambs, at the exterior of the window can be covered with an exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>) to give the exterior of the double-hung window <b>100</b> a uniform appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a front exterior side <b>142</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. The concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> covers the interior extension slot <b>119</b> and lock pin slot <b>121</b>, so a front side <b>142</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover is exposed as the upper first side jamb <b>126</b> and upper second side jamb <b>128</b> of the double-hung window <b>100</b>. The concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> has a contoured profile <b>146</b> of extruded plastic (e.g., vinyl) with a wood veneer <b>148</b> overlying the contoured profile <b>146</b>. The front side <b>142</b> of each concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> has a lock channel <b>150</b> and a flat portion <b>156</b> for engaging the respective side rail <b>111</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>. The lock channel <b>150</b> and flat portion <b>156</b> extend over the entire length of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In constructing the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>, the contoured profile <b>146</b> is extruded, and then an overlayer of wood veneer <b>148</b> is adhered to the contoured profile <b>146</b>. In one embodiment, a polyurethane reactive (PUR) hotmelt glue system is used to laminate the wood veneer <b>148</b> to the contoured profile <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a back interior side <b>144</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. Each concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> has aback side <b>144</b>, which faces its respective upper first side jamb <b>126</b> or upper second side jamb <b>128</b> of the double-hung window <b>100</b>. Extending from the back side <b>144</b> is interlock flange <b>152</b>, lock channel <b>150</b>, and snap-fit flanges <b>154</b>, all of which, in one embodiment, extend over the entire length of the back side <b>144</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. The interlock flange <b>152</b> and snap-fit flanges <b>154</b> allow for the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to be attached to the respective side jamb of the window. The lock channel <b>150</b> has an indentation for receiving the lock pins <b>158</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective sectional view taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the upper first side jamb <b>118</b> having a concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. The lower sash <b>104</b> is in the closed position so that the front side <b>142</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> is exposed to the interior of the double-hung window <b>100</b>. To attach the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to the upper side jambs (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the interlock flange <b>152</b> engages with receiving opening <b>153</b> and the snap-fit flanges <b>154</b> interconnect with the interior extension slot <b>119</b> to hold the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to the side jamb. The lock channel <b>150</b> is received in the lock slot <b>121</b>. Other types of attachment mechanisms are within the scope of this invention to allow the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to be secured to the upper first side jamb <b>126</b> and upper second side jamb <b>128</b>. The concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> can be removable or permanently attached to the side jamb.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> in place, the interior extension slot <b>119</b> and lock slot <b>121</b>, which may be constructed of plastic, vinyl, wood composite, or metal, are covered while the lower sash <b>104</b> is in the closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As can be seen, the wood veneer <b>148</b> gives the appearance of an entire wood finish, and the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> conceals plastic, vinyl and/or metal portions of the upper first side jamb <b>118</b> when the window is in the closed position. This wood veneer <b>148</b> surface can be stained or finished to give a natural wood appearance to the interior of the window or can be painted repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view through the upper sash <b>102</b> of the double-hung window <b>100</b> along line A-A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. The upper sash <b>102</b> has a pivot pin <b>161</b>, shown schematically to allow the upper sash to be released towards the interior. The upper sash pivot pin <b>161</b> travels in the exterior extension slot <b>123</b>. In this view, the lower sash <b>104</b> is in the closed position and is below the plane of the sectional view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> engaged with the upper first side jamb <b>126</b> to conceal the interior extension slot <b>119</b> and lock slot <b>121</b>. It is understood that there is also a concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> positioned at the upper second side jamb <b>128</b>, which would be a mirror image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> can be removable from the side jamb. The interlock flange <b>152</b> engages with receiving opening <b>153</b> and snap-fit flanges <b>154</b> lock with the interior extension slot <b>119</b> to hold the concealed jamb liner cover to the upper first side jamb <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lower sash <b>104</b> has a lock pin <b>158</b> positioned to extend outwardly (to the side) from each end of the top rail <b>109</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>. Each lock pin <b>158</b> slidably engages with lock channel <b>150</b> of its respective concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to hold the lower sash <b>104</b> in the double-hung window <b>100</b> during opening and closing of the lower sash <b>104</b>. Because the lock channel <b>150</b> extends the entire length of each concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b>, the lower sash <b>104</b> can travel vertically along the opposed concealed jamb liner covers <b>140</b> with the lock pins <b>158</b> sliding in the lock channels <b>150</b>. The flat portions <b>156</b> of the concealed jamb liner covers <b>140</b> allow for the side rails <b>111</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b> to slide vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> extends from the top of the upper first side jamb <b>126</b> or the top of the upper second side jamb <b>128</b> to just below the top of the lower sash <b>104</b> when the window is in the closed position. Thus, the front side <b>142</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> is entirely exposed to the interior of the window <b>100</b> while the lower sash <b>104</b> is in the closed position. The front side <b>142</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> contains the wood veneer <b>148</b> surface so that the interior of the window has a uniform wood appearance while the window <b>100</b> is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is understood that although the description was with respect to the upper first side jamb <b>126</b>, a similar design is applied to the upper second side jamb <b>128</b>. The design for the upper second side jamb <b>128</b> would be a mirror image of the description with respect to the upper first side jamb <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view through a lower sash <b>104</b> taken along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> only shows the first side jamb <b>118</b>, it is understood that there is a mirror image of the design in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> at the second side jamb <b>120</b>. Attached and laterally projecting from the bottom rail <b>112</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b> is a pivot pin <b>160</b>, shown schematically. Pivot pins are known in the art. The pivot pin <b>160</b> travels in the interior extension slot <b>119</b> of the first side jamb <b>118</b> and second side jamb <b>120</b>. The lock pin <b>158</b> on the lower sash <b>104</b> is selectively retractable so that the pivot pin <b>160</b> will allow for tilting of the double-hung window about its pivot pins <b>160</b>. Because the pivot pin <b>160</b> is located at the bottom rail <b>112</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>, there is no need to have an indented pivot pin channel <b>162</b> in the jamb liner cover <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to a concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> to cover the upper interior side jamb, an exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> can also be provided to cover the lower exterior side jamb (i.e., the exposed portion of the side jamb on the outside of the window <b>100</b> below the upper sash <b>102</b> when the upper sash <b>102</b> in fully closed as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> engaged with the first side jamb <b>118</b>. It is understood that an exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> would also be provided on the second side jamb <b>120</b> having a design that is a mirror image of that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> has as inner cover <b>226</b> to cover the lock channel <b>121</b> and an inner portion of the exterior extension slot <b>123</b>, and an outer cover <b>228</b> to cover an outer portion of the exterior extension slot <b>123</b>. The pivot pin <b>161</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is allowed to travel vertically in the area between the inner cover <b>226</b> and the outer cover <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> can be fixed to the side jamb or can be removable. To connect the outer cover <b>228</b>, one or more engagement legs <b>230</b>, having a low profile and extending from the exterior cover <b>228</b>, connect with one or more openings <b>232</b> in the side jamb <b>118</b>. To connect the inner cover <b>226</b>, a connector leg <b>234</b>, which extends from the lock channel cover <b>226</b>, securely engages with an opening or slot <b>236</b> in the side jamb <b>118</b>. The exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> extends from the bottom of the side jamb to just above the area where the upper sash <b>102</b> and lower sash <b>104</b> meet while in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> can be constructed of a durable, low-maintenance material like vinyl or aluminum to protect the exterior of the window <b>100</b> from weathering. Alternatively, the exterior jamb liner cover <b>225</b> can be constructed similar to the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> having a profile covered with a wood veneer to give the exterior a uniform wood appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view through an upper sash <b>102</b> and lower sash <b>104</b> where the upper sash <b>102</b> and lower sash <b>104</b> meet when in the closed position, as taken along line C-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A similar design is provided for the second side jamb <b>120</b>. The first side jamb <b>118</b> has an interior extension slot <b>119</b>, lock slot <b>121</b>, and exterior extension slot <b>123</b> that extend the length of the first side jamb <b>118</b>. This view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is just below the upper most portion of the top rail <b>109</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>, so that when the lower sash is closed, there is no need to have the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> at this part of the first side jamb <b>118</b>. The lock pin <b>160</b> of the lower sash can be fully extended outwardly at this portion of the side jamb because the lower sash <b>104</b> is in the closed position. Lock chamber <b>125</b> is affixed in the lock slot <b>121</b>, such as by one or more suitable fasteners <b>125</b><i>a </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) into the window frame <b>105</b> to receive the full outward extension of the lock pin <b>160</b>. Lock chamber <b>125</b> can be constructed of a metal or strong plastic to create added strength to the lock slot <b>121</b>. In the event of pressure fluctuations from exterior or interior conditions, the lock chamber <b>125</b> prevents the collapse of the lock slot <b>121</b> from pressure created from either the upper or lower sash at the interior extension slot <b>119</b> or exterior extension slot <b>123</b>. Further, the lock chamber <b>125</b> creates a reinforced area for the lock pin <b>160</b> to fully engage when the lock pin <b>160</b> is completely extended to secure the lower sash <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of an upper first side jamb <b>126</b> showing a dual channel system <b>164</b> with the lower sash <b>104</b> removed for clarity of illustration. A similar design is provided for the second side jamb <b>120</b>. Each jamb liner cover <b>140</b>, which extends from the top of the upper sash <b>102</b> to just below where the upper sash <b>102</b> and lower sash <b>104</b> meet, has an indented lock channel <b>150</b> for receiving its respective lock pin <b>158</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The lock channel <b>150</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> extends inward towards the lock slot <b>121</b>. Because the lock pin <b>158</b> is located at the top rail <b>108</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b>, there is no need to have a lock channel <b>150</b> extend below the jamb liner cover <b>140</b>. Instead, just below the jamb liner cover <b>140</b> is the lock chamber <b>125</b> for receiving the full extension of the lock pin <b>158</b>. As the lower sash <b>104</b> is moved relative to the side jambs <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>, the side rails <b>111</b> of the lower sash <b>104</b> slide adjacent to the flat portions <b>156</b> of the concealed jamb liner covers <b>140</b>. The pivot pins <b>160</b>, which allows the double-hung window to tilt towards the interior, slide vertically in interior extension slot <b>119</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The interior extension slot <b>119</b> and the lock channels <b>150</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover <b>140</b> extend vertically and parallel to one another. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows line A representing lock channel <b>150</b> and line B representing interior extension slot <b>119</b> extending the entire length of the first side jamb <b>118</b>, this is only to clearly depict that the lock channel <b>150</b> and interior extension slot <b>119</b> are not in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By placing the lock channel <b>150</b> of the concealed jamb liner cover in a plane other than the interior extension slot <b>119</b>, the lock chamber <b>125</b> can be added to the design without interfering with moving parts in the interior extension slot <b>119</b> or complicating the manufacturing of the side jamb. The lock chamber <b>125</b> adds to the strength of the double hung window from pressure fluctuations from exterior or interior forces.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective side view of the upper end of the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b>. Like the lower sash <b>104</b>, the upper sash <b>102</b> also has a lock <b>178</b> on each side of the upper sash <b>102</b> for securing the upper sash <b>102</b> within the double-hung window <b>100</b>, but the lock <b>178</b> also can be retracted so that the upper sash <b>102</b> can be pivoted towards the interior. To hold the lock <b>178</b> is an upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> attached to the top rail <b>108</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b>. The upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> has a vinyl frame <b>168</b> with a first side <b>172</b>, a second side <b>174</b>, and a bottom surface <b>176</b> for engaging with the top rail <b>108</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b>. The vinyl frame <b>168</b> defines a channel <b>170</b>. Disposed within the channel <b>170</b> is the lock <b>178</b> at each end. The lock <b>178</b> is biased to project laterally from each side of the upper sash <b>102</b> but is retractable with a retraction lever <b>192</b>, which is exposed through the vinyl frame <b>168</b>. Along the first side <b>172</b> of the vinyl frame <b>168</b> is a strip of interior weatherstrip <b>180</b>, and along the second side <b>174</b> of the vinyl frame <b>168</b> is a strip of exterior weatherstrip <b>182</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view of the upper sash <b>102</b> showing the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> taken along line D-D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First interlock <b>184</b> and second interlock <b>186</b> connect the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> to the top rail <b>108</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b>. First interlock <b>184</b> extends from the bottom surface <b>176</b> of the vinyl frame <b>168</b> to engage with a slot or opening <b>185</b> of the top rail <b>108</b>. Second interlock <b>186</b> extends from the bottom surface <b>176</b> of the vinyl frame <b>168</b> to engage with a slot or opening <b>187</b> of the top rail <b>108</b>. First and second interlock can be either a single projection or can extend along the entire length of the vinyl frame with a respective slot or opening to receive the interlocks. Alternatively, another mechanical connector or adhesive can be used to connect the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> to the top rail <b>108</b> of the upper sash <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the upper sash <b>102</b> is closed, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, interior weatherstrip <b>180</b> engages with wooden parting stop <b>188</b> and exterior weatherstrip <b>182</b> engages with exterior mounting <b>190</b> to provide a multiple full width seal for the top of the upper sash <b>102</b>, thereby achieving improved energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> is more easily constructed of a vinyl material, however exposing a vinyl housing to the interior diminishes from the wood appearance of the window. The upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> has been constructed with a low profile and when the upper sash <b>102</b> is in the closed position, wooden parting stop <b>188</b> entirely conceals the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b> from sight from the interior of the window <b>100</b>. Therefore, no vinyl or weatherstrip is visible from the interior and only the wood parting stop <b>188</b> and the upper sash <b>102</b> are visible. With the wood frame of the upper <b>102</b> and lower <b>104</b> sashes and the wood parting stop <b>188</b> concealing the upper sash lock housing <b>166</b>, the double-hung window <b>100</b> has a uniform wood interior when the window <b>100</b> is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The double-hung window of the present invention combines the ability to use plastic, vinyl, wood composite, or metal materials at the side jambs to create an efficient modern window while providing a jamb liner cover that gives the side jambs a uniform wood appearance. Such a design is suitable as a replacement window in older homes and building where a new window is desired having a traditional wood interior.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, the double-hung window provides an upper sash lock housing constructed of a plastic or vinyl material. The lock housing contains weatherstripping to improve the energy efficiency of the window and houses the lock so the window can be released and tilted towards the interior for cleaning. The lock housing has a low profile but also a wood upper parting stop is provided to conceal the lock housing while the window is closed. Additionally, this feature allows for modern features of a window to be provided while preserving the traditional look of a wood window interior. Additional thermal conduction features of a window are disclosure in co-pending application Ser. No. 10/760,102 titled, “Double-hung Window with Improved Thermal Efficiency,” filed on even date herewith, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
