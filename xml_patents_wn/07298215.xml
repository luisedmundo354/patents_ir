<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-352664 filed on Dec. 4, 2002 including specification, claims, drawings and summary is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an amplifying circuit for amplifying a high-frequency signal, and further to a gain-variable amplifying circuit including a plurality of the amplifying circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A gain-variable amplifying circuit is an important circuit in a wireless communication system. With popularization of a mobile phone and an increase in a data transmission rate in a wireless LAN system for adaptation to a multi-media system, such a gain-variable amplifying circuit is now required to be able to operate with smaller power and control a gain more precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a circuit diagram of an example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is comprised of a variable attenuator <b>91</b>, and an amplifier <b>92</b> electrically connected in series to the variable attenuator <b>91</b>. The illustrated gain-variable amplifying circuit controls an amplification rate by varying attenuation of the variable attenuator <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a circuit diagram of another example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is comprised of a variable attenuator <b>93</b>, an amplifier <b>94</b> electrically connected in parallel to the variable attenuator <b>93</b>, and switches <b>95</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>95</b><sub>2 </sub>through which one of the variable attenuator <b>93</b> and the amplifier <b>94</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the switches <b>95</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>95</b><sub>2 </sub>are electrically connected to terminals associated with the amplifier <b>94</b>, the amplifier <b>94</b> is selected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a condition where the amplifier <b>94</b> is selected). In contrast, when the switches <b>95</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>95</b><sub>2 </sub>are electrically connected to terminals associated with the variable attenuator <b>93</b>, the variable attenuator <b>93</b> is selected</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a circuit diagram of still another example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-345653.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is comprised of a plurality of amplifiers <b>96</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>96</b><sub>N</sub>, and a demodulator <b>97</b> electrically connected in series to each of the amplifiers <b>96</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>96</b><sub>N</sub>. Each of the amplifiers <b>96</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>96</b><sub>N </sub>is designed to have a gain different from gains of others.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the illustrated gain-variable amplifying circuit, only an amplifier suitable for providing a desired gain is turned on, and other amplifiers are turned off. As a result, the gain-variable amplifying circuit transmits an output having a high impedance, and the amplifiers turned off are electrically separated from the demodulator <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, since the variable attenuator <b>91</b> is arranged in a first stage, a loss of the variable attenuator <b>91</b> harmfully influences a noise index, and hence, it would not be possible to have a better noise index.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, since the amplifier <b>92</b> keeps carrying out amplification, power is consumed regardless of whether a desired amplification degree is high or low, power. For instance, even if an input is high and hence it is not necessary to have a high amplification degree, the amplifier <b>92</b> keeps carrying out amplification. Accordingly, in a device which operates with a battery having a limited lifetime, such as a mobile terminal, it would not be possible to extend a period of time during which the device is usable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes a plurality of switches (specifically, two switches), it is necessary to compensate for a loss caused by the switches by the amplifier <b>94</b> or an amplifier (not illustrated) arranged at a later stage in the gain-variable amplifying circuit. Thus, power consumption of the gain-variable amplifying circuit is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, a loss caused by the switches in a frequency band beyond a couple of GHz is quite high, and hence, power consumption necessary for having a desired gain would be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A frequency to which the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can be applied is equal to or smaller than a couple of tens of MHz, such as IF band. Each of the amplifiers <b>96</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>96</b><sub>N </sub>is designed to have a load resistance in the range of about 50 to about 200 ohms. However, since an impedance in an off-condition lowers because of parasitic capacity of a semiconductor device, when a frequency is over GHz, an amplifier(s) turned off cannot transmit an output having a sufficiently high impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to broaden a variable range of a gain or to narrow a variable step of a gain, it would be necessary to increase a number of amplifiers electrically connected in parallel to one another. However, a signal is not transmitted to a next stage due to an impedance of an amplifier(s) turned off, resulting in reduction in a gain.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In view of the above-mentioned problems in the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide an amplifying circuit capable of accomplishing high-impedance input/output, and providing a high gain in low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a gain-variable amplifying circuit including a plurality of the above-mentioned amplifying circuits, having superior noise characteristics, and providing a broad band in which a gain is variable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides an amplifying circuit including an amplifier amplifying a signal received through an input terminal, and outputting the signal through an output terminal, and a control circuit turning at least one of an input impedance and an output impedance of the amplifier into a high impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the amplifying circuit in accordance with the present invention, the control circuit turns at least one of an input impedance and an output impedance of the amplifier into a high impedance.

<p id="p-0050" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a gain-variable amplifying circuit <b>1000</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The gain-variable amplifying circuit <b>1000</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes N amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>(N indicates an integer equal to or greater than 2). The N amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>are electrically connected in parallel to one another between an input terminal IN and an output terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0086">Input terminals of the amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>are electrically connected to the input terminal N, and output terminals of the amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>are electrically connected to the output terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0087">The amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>are designed to have the same structure as one another, but have gains different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0088">Control voltages Vc<b>1</b> to VcN applied to the amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N</sub>, respectively, cause the amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>to have a high impedance. Furthermore, the control voltages Vc<b>1</b> to VcN make it possible to select whether the amplifying circuits <b>100</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>100</b><sub>N </sub>are electrically connected to the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT.

<p id="p-0066" num="0101">The capacitor <b>207</b> is electrically connected at the above-mentioned end thereof to the other end of the fourth inductor <b>205</b> and the output terminal OUT, and grounded at the other end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0102">The first inductor <b>201</b>, the fourth inductor <b>205</b>, the fifth inductor <b>206</b>, and the capacitor <b>207</b> define an input/output matching circuit. In addition, the fifth inductor <b>206</b> acts also as a choke inductor. The resistor <b>202</b> applies a gate bias to an input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0103">The first field effect transistor <b>208</b> acts as a main amplifying device in the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A. The control voltage Vc is used to turn on or off the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0104">The second and third field effect transistors <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> both acting as a switching device and the second and third inductors <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> both for making resonation define a control circuit. The amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is turned on or off by controlling the control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0105">For instance, if the control voltage Vc is set a high level (for instance, the power-source voltage Vdd), and the gate bias voltage Vgbias is set equal to 0V, the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is turned off.

<p id="p-0071" num="0106">When the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is on, the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is electrically connected to both the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT, and amplifies a signal received through the input terminal IN and transmits the amplified signal to the output terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0107">When the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is off, the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A has a high impedance in input and output thereof, and hence, the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is electrically separated from both the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a principle as to why the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a high impedance. Hereinbelow, the principle is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) is a circuit diagram of an equivalent circuit of an input of the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A in the case that the control signal Vc is set a high level to turn the second and third field effect transistors <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> are turned on, and the gate bias voltage Vgbias is set equal to 0V. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>) is a circuit diagram of an equivalent circuit of an output of the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A in the same case.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0110">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), an inductor <b>301</b> corresponds to the first inductor <b>201</b>, and an inductor <b>303</b> corresponds to the second inductor <b>203</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), an inductor <b>306</b>, an inductor <b>305</b>, a capacitor <b>307</b>, and an inductor <b>304</b> correspond to the fifth inductor <b>206</b>, the fourth inductor <b>205</b>, the capacitor <b>207</b>, and the third inductor <b>204</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0111">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>), since the gate bias voltage Vgbias is set equal to 0V, the first field effect transistor <b>208</b> is off. Hence, viewing from a gate of the first field effect transistor <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)) or viewing from a drain of the same (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>)), the circuits illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) have a capacity equal to a gate or drain capacity of an intrinsic semiconductor of a device, that is, the capacitor <b>320</b> or <b>321</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0112">In the circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), the inductor <b>303</b> is designed to have such an inductance that the inductor <b>303</b> and the capacitor <b>320</b> resonate with each other in parallel. Similarly, in the circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the inductor <b>304</b> is designed to have such an inductance that the inductor <b>304</b> and the capacitor <b>321</b> resonate with each other in parallel. Thus, it is possible to make input and output impedances high.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0113">The capacitors <b>320</b> and <b>321</b> have a capacity dependent on a generation of a process and a gate size. For instance, the capacitors <b>320</b> and <b>321</b> have about 300 fF in a field effect transistor having a gate width of 300 micrometers. If a capacity is equal to about 300 fF, the inductors <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> in an amplifying circuit which operates at a frequency of 5 GHz have an inductance of about 3 nH. Inductors having such an inductance can be readily fabricated on an IC by wire arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0114">When the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A is on and carries out normal amplification, the second and third field effect transistors <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> are off. Since the second and third field effect transistors <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> are not arranged in a signal path between the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT, a resistance during they are off is set high. Furthermore, a shunt parasitic capacity during they are off is set low, resulting in a high impedance. Accordingly, when the second and third field effect transistors <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> are off, the inductors <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> are in a floating condition.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0115">As having been explained above, it is possible in the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A to make an input/output impedance high in a high-frequency band beyond GHz order without arranging a switch into a signal path.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0116">Thus, in the gain-variable amplifying circuit <b>1000</b> including the amplifying circuits <b>1001</b> to <b>100</b>N having the same structure as that of the amplifying circuit <b>100</b>A and electrically connected in parallel with one another, even if a range in which a gain varies is set broad or even if a step by which a gain varies is set narrow, it would be possible to maintain a high gain and a low noise indication.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0117">Furthermore, since it is possible to maintain a high gain in the gain-variable amplifying circuit <b>1000</b>, even if a number of amplifying circuits electrically connected in parallel to one another is increased, it would be possible to avoid an increase in current consumption. In particular, the avoidance of an increase in current consumption is remarkable in a high-frequency band beyond GHz.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0176">In accordance with the present invention, the control circuit makes input and/or output impedances high.
