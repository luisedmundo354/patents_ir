<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to surveillance systems, and, more particularly, to surveillance systems for detecting an intrusion into a monitored area of space.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Surveillance systems including motion detectors are known for detecting intrusions of a moving object, such as a human, into a monitored zone of space. The motion detectors typically include infrared detectors that sense the presence of a source of infrared radiation, e.g., a warm body, anywhere along the line of sight of the infrared sensors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a typical motion detector <b>30</b> mounted on a wall <b>32</b> or a ceiling <b>34</b>. Motion detector <b>30</b> monitors a zone <b>36</b> within a room by imaging multiple areas of the room onto an infrared sensor <b>38</b> shown in the enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. The output of detector <b>30</b> is then amplified and processed for alarm output from the motion detector. Thus, the monitored zone <b>36</b> generally includes at least a majority of the space between motion detector <b>30</b> and some barrier, such as a wall <b>40</b> or a floor <b>42</b>, that blocks infrared radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The monitored space or zone is typically divided into a plurality of subzones, such as the illustrated subzones <b>44</b><i>a</i>-<i>i</i>, and the detector may detect movement from one of the subzones to another. Only the subzones extending through a central portion of the room are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>for clarity of illustration. A single fresnel lens array <b>46</b> may be used to focus subzones <b>44</b> onto sensor <b>38</b>. Although most of the space in the room may be monitored by this arrangement, a zone <b>48</b> may remain unprotected due to limits on the size of fresnel lens array <b>46</b>. Thus, an intruder may be able to pass through the room undetected by walking through only unprotected zone <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is possible to add another fresnel lens <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) for looking downward from the sensor. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, unprotected zones <b>52</b> still remain which allow a skilled intruder to pass through the room undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed in the art is an inexpensive intrusion detection system that can monitor the length of a room, including the space below the detector, to prevent an intruder from passing through the room undetected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an inexpensive infrared detecting apparatus that monitors zones that form a protected “curtain” area that images the room from the floor up and from one end of the room to the other. Thus, an intruder cannot pass through the room without going through the monitored curtain area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, an infrared detecting apparatus including at least one infrared-sensitive element. Focusing means focuses infrared energy from a first zone onto at least one infrared-sensitive element. An opaque element including a throughhole is positioned such that infrared energy may pass through the throughhole from a second zone to the at least one infrared-sensitive element. The second zone is closer than the first zone to the at least one infrared-sensitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another form, the invention comprises an infrared detecting apparatus including at least one infrared-sensitive element. A fresnel lens array is positioned to focus infrared energy from a first zone onto the at least one infrared-sensitive element. An infrared energy conduit carrier infrared energy from a second zone to the at least one infrared-sensitive element. The first zone extends farther than the second zone from the at least one infrared-sensitive element.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another form, the invention comprises an infrared detecting apparatus including at least one infrared-sensitive element. A fresnel lens array is positioned to focus infrared energy from a first zone onto the at least one infrared-sensitive element. An opaque element includes a throughslot defining a longitudinal direction. The opaque element is positioned such that infrared energy may pass through the throughslot from a second zone to the at least one infrared-sensitive element. The first zone extends farther than the second zone from the at least one infrared-sensitive element in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An advantage of the present invention is that the entire length of a room can be monitored to thereby prevent an intruder from passing through the room undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another advantage is that the throughholes or throughslots used to focus the infrared energy are simple and can be provided inexpensively.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, there is shown one embodiment of an infrared detecting apparatus <b>60</b> of the present invention monitoring a near space or zone <b>62</b> and a far space or zone <b>64</b>. Apparatus <b>60</b> includes an electrical signal processing circuit <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>), a fresnel lens array <b>68</b> and an infrared energy conduit in the form of an opaque element <b>70</b>. Apparatus <b>60</b> may be mounted on a wall <b>132</b> and/or a ceiling <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, apparatus <b>60</b> is mounted approximately 9.5 feet above a floor <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Circuit <b>66</b> includes an infrared (IR) sensor <b>72</b> mounted on a circuit board <b>74</b> along with various electronic components <b>76</b>. IR sensor <b>72</b> may be downwardly tilted at an angle θ relative to a vertically oriented board <b>74</b>. In one embodiment, angle θ is approximately between 20° and 30°.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">IR sensor <b>72</b> may include two side-by-side rectangular infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>, each capable of producing a respective electrical signal dependent upon an amount of IR energy that impinges upon the element <b>78</b>. Infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may be oppositely polarized, and their outputs may be summed together. Because of the opposite polarity, changes in the background temperature may have no net effect on the sum of the outputs of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>, and thus may be correctly ignored. Electronic components <b>76</b> may amplify and process the outputs of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>for generating an alarm output signal dependent upon the outputs of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Fresnel lens array <b>68</b> may be of conventional construction for focusing infrared energy from far zone <b>64</b> onto infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b. </i>However, another type of focusing means may be employed, such as one or more mirrors which may be curvilinearly-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Near zone <b>62</b> is generally closer than far zone <b>64</b> to infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. Moreover, far zone <b>64</b>, despite being limited by wall <b>140</b> and/or floor <b>142</b>, may extend farther than near zone <b>62</b> from infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>in a longitudinal direction <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Far zone <b>64</b> may be divided into a plurality of subzones, such as the illustrated subzones <b>144</b><i>a</i>-<i>i</i>, and apparatus <b>60</b> may detect movement of a warm body from one of the subzones to another. Only the subzones extending through a central portion of the room are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>for clarity of illustration. A single fresnel lens array <b>68</b> may be used to focus subzones <b>144</b> onto infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Opaque element <b>70</b> may be in the form of an opaque substrate <b>83</b> including a throughhole <b>80</b> having a width approximately between 0.03 inch and 0.12 inch. Opaque element <b>70</b> may be positioned such that infrared energy may pass through throughhole <b>80</b> from near zone <b>62</b> to infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment, substrate <b>83</b> holds or supports IR sensor <b>72</b> at angle θ relative to the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, throughhole <b>80</b> is in the form of an elongate throughslot defining longitudinal directions indicated by double arrow <b>82</b>. Throughslot <b>80</b> has a width <b>84</b> defined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and a length <b>86</b>. Width <b>84</b> may be approximately between 0.03 inch and 0.12 inch, and length <b>86</b> may be approximately between 0.25 inch and 3.0 inches. In one embodiment, width <b>84</b> is approximately 0.08 inch and length <b>86</b> is approximately 1.0 inch. Advantageously, the relatively small width <b>84</b> may provide an infinite depth of field. Moreover, the relatively small width <b>84</b> may provide images on infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>that have low levels of distortion. IR sensor <b>72</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as being oriented perpendicular to substrate <b>83</b> for ease of illustration. However, it is to be understood that IR sensor <b>72</b> may be tilted relative to substrate <b>83</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Throughslot <b>80</b> may be provided with a length such that a far edge <b>88</b> of near zone <b>62</b> is closely adjacent first subzone <b>144</b><i>a </i>of far zone <b>64</b>. Thus, near zone <b>62</b> and far zone <b>64</b> may conjointly form a “curtain” area that images the room from floor <b>142</b> and between walls <b>132</b>, <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may be generally rectangularly-shaped and generally vertically oriented, i.e., more particularly, infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may be downwardly tilted at a maximum of about 30° from vertical. The generally vertical orientation of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may advantageously increase the amount of infrared energy captured from a person <b>90</b> walking upright. Thus, the rectangular shape and generally vertical orientation of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may increase the sensitivity of elements <b>78</b> to an image moving horizontally past apparatus <b>60</b>. As such, image distortion in the vertical direction has little effect on the sensitivity of IR sensor <b>72</b>. In one embodiment, each of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>has a width of one millimeter and a height of two millimeters. Substrate <b>83</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>as being oriented substantially parallel to elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>for ease of illustration. However, it is to be understood that there may be an angle of approximately 65° between substrate <b>83</b> and elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Throughslot <b>80</b> may be oriented horizontal to floor <b>142</b>, which has the advantage that the shape of near zone <b>62</b> where it meets floor <b>142</b>, i.e., the “footprint” of near zone <b>62</b>, is rectangular rather than trapezoidal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>best illustrates the rectangular shape of footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, which are formed by respective infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>imaging through throughslot <b>80</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>is an enlarged overhead view of apparatus <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A distance <b>93</b> between one of footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>of near zone <b>62</b> and a closest footprint of far zone <b>64</b> may be less than 12 inches. Thus, near zone <b>62</b> and far zone <b>64</b> may form a “curtain” extending across the room that is difficult for an intruder to pass through undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rectangular shape of footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>may be advantageous in maintaining a fixed distance between footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, which may be beneficial for a couple of reasons. First, circuit <b>66</b> may be optimized for a one second period in the signals output by infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. A speed of approximately 30 inches per second may be used to represent the speed of an intruder passing through a room. Thus, the optimal spacing between the areas imaged by infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>, i.e., between the adjacent footprints, may be approximately 30 inches such that an intruder may pass from one footprint to an adjacent footprint in about one second and thereby produce a one second period between the output signals of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. For a fixed focal length system, such as a fresnel array, this spacing may be impossible to achieve because the areas imaged are reduced in size the closer they are to IR sensor <b>72</b>. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>wherein a distance <b>94</b> between the midpoints of subzones <b>144</b><i>g </i>and <b>144</b><i>h</i>, and between the midpoints of subzones <b>144</b><i>f </i>and <b>144</b><i>i</i>, may be approximately between 20 inches and 50 inches, such as about 30 inches, but the trapezoidal footprints of the subzones converge as they approach IR sensor <b>72</b>. Throughslot <b>80</b> does not have this convergence problem, however, as the focal length of throughslot <b>80</b> effectively changes with distance from infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b</i>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a distance <b>95</b> between the midpoints of rectangular footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>remains constant along the length of the footprints and thus may be set to a desired value, such as 30 inches. Thus, a one second period between the output signals of elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>may be achieved in the case of an intruder moving at an expected speed, such as 30 inches per second.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second reason that the fixed distance between footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>may be advantageous is that it may increase the probability that an intruder is sensed by only one of infrared-sensitive elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>at a time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, in the case of converging footprints or imaging zones of the prior art, an intruder <b>96</b> who is relatively close to the IR sensor may easily be disposed within both imaging zones at the same time. Because elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>are oppositely polarized and there is thus no change in the sum of the outputs of elements <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>when the intruder is in both imaging zones, the presence of the intruder may be wrongly interpreted as an increase in room temperature. This condition is sometimes referred to as “common mode”. However, when a proper distance is maintained between adjacent imaging zones, as is the case with parallel, rectangular footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, an intruder <b>96</b> is likely to be disposed in only one of footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>, intruder <b>96</b> is predominantly in footprint <b>92</b><i>a </i>and predominantly out of footprint <b>92</b><i>b</i>. Thus, intruder <b>96</b> will more likely be correctly interpreted by apparatus <b>60</b> as a human. Further, the spacing between footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>is small enough that an intruder <b>96</b> would not likely be able to walk between footprints <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>and thus escape detection.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), an IR detecting apparatus <b>160</b> includes an opaque element <b>170</b> having a slot lens <b>183</b> and a unitary sensor mount <b>98</b> for holding or mounting an IR sensor <b>172</b> at an angle a relative to a substantially vertically oriented circuit board <b>174</b>. In one embodiment, angle α is approximately between 20° and 30°. Slot lens <b>183</b> includes an open-ended throughslot <b>180</b>. Opaque element <b>170</b> may be unitarily molded or cast as a single piece of plastic or metal, for example. Such a one-piece slot lens and sensor mount has the advantage of facilitating the positioning of the opaque element relative to the IR sensor. That is, setting the relative positions of opaque element <b>170</b> and IR sensor <b>172</b> may be easier with the use of mount <b>98</b> to guide the positioning of IR sensor <b>172</b>. Other aspects of apparatus <b>160</b> may be substantially similar to those of apparatus <b>60</b>, and thus are not described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), an IR detecting apparatus <b>260</b> includes an opaque element <b>270</b> in the form of a fresnel lens array holder <b>198</b> for holding a fresnel lens array <b>268</b> in place relative to a circuit board <b>274</b> and relative to an IR sensor <b>272</b>. Fresnel lens array <b>268</b> has at least one opening <b>200</b> via which holder <b>198</b> and array <b>268</b> may be latched together. A bottom wall of holder <b>198</b> is in the form of a slot lens <b>283</b> having a throughslot <b>280</b>. Other aspects of apparatus <b>260</b> may be substantially similar to those of apparatus <b>60</b>, and thus are not described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a further embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), an IR detecting apparatus <b>360</b> includes an opaque enclosure <b>370</b> for an IR sensor <b>372</b> including at least one infrared-sensitive element. Enclosure <b>370</b> includes an opening <b>300</b> for a fresnel lens array <b>368</b>. A bottom wall of enclosure <b>370</b> includes an infrared energy conduit <b>383</b> having a throughslot <b>380</b>. Conduit <b>383</b> may be unitarily formed with enclosure <b>370</b>. Conduit <b>383</b> has an elongate channel <b>304</b> with a height that may be greater than 0.25 inch in the vertical direction. An upper end <b>302</b> of channel <b>304</b> may be oriented parallel to the floor when enclosure <b>370</b> is mounted on a vertical circuit board or wall. Upper end <b>302</b> may have a width of approximately between 0.03 inch and 0.12 inch. Other aspects of apparatus <b>360</b> may be substantially similar to those of apparatus <b>60</b>, and thus are not described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a still further embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>), an opaque element <b>470</b> is in the form of a substrate <b>483</b> having a circular throughhole or pinhole <b>480</b>. The vertical distortion of an image sensed through pinhole <b>480</b> may be less than the vertical distortion of an image sensed through a throughslot such as throughslot <b>80</b>. However, the relatively low level of infrared energy that may pass through pinhole <b>480</b> limits the range of an infrared detecting apparatus employing opaque element <b>470</b>. Thus, opaque element <b>470</b> may be advantageous for use in applications where range should be limited, such as a proximity detector for a keypad that is to detect a person within a three foot radius of the unit, but ignore a person disposed beyond the three foot radius. Other aspects of an apparatus utilizing opaque element <b>470</b> may be substantially similar to those of apparatus <b>60</b>, and thus are not described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An infrared detecting apparatus has been described herein as including an opaque element separate from the IR sensor. However, it is to be understood that it may also be possible to form the opaque element as part of the IR sensor. For example, the opaque element may be in the form of a mask having a slot wherein the mask may be applied to a transparent lens of the IR sensor. Alternatively, a horizontally oriented slot lens may be unitarily formed with the IR sensor. In this case, there would be no need to position the IR sensor relative to the slot lens during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although not explicitly disclosed above, it is to be understood that an infrared sensor used in the infrared detecting apparatus of the present invention may be disposed in an air-tight enclosure in order to protect the infrared sensor from the outside environment. An infrared sensor may be susceptible to false alarms if the enclosure has any opening to the ambient environment, as is well known. Thus, the infrared detecting apparatus of the present invention may include a polyethylene window that is transparent to infrared energy so as to allow infrared energy to reach the infrared-sensitive element through the throughhole or throughslot of the opaque element. The polyethylene window may be white or grey-colored, for example. The polyethylene window may be included in a bottom wall of an overall enclosure that encloses an IR detecting apparatus, such as apparatus <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>). Enclosure <b>370</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) may include a polyethylene window that covers throughslot <b>380</b>, that covers upper end <b>302</b> of channel <b>304</b>, or that is disposed within channel <b>304</b> somewhere between throughslot <b>380</b> and upper end <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles.</p>
