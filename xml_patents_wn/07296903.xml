<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Non-Provisional Utility Patent Application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/650,493, filed Feb. 7, 2005, entitled “EXTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR MECHANISM FOR A SKID LOADER,” which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Skid loaders are highly maneuverable vehicles and have proven useful in the construction, demolition, and landscaping fields due to their ease of control and ability to access cramped construction sites.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A skid loader is a vehicle having at least one pair of opposing tracks/wheels. The opposing tracks/wheels can be moved independently such that the skid loader can be turned through a very tight turning radius. For example, a skid loader can be turned on its lengthwise axis from a forward facing position to a rear facing position by moving one set of tracks in a rearward direction and the other opposing set of tracks in a forward direction. Thus, skid loaders are highly maneuverable and are said to have a “zero turning radius,” which is beneficial for working inside of buildings and on other sites that have limited working space.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The high degree of maneuverability permits skid loaders to “turn on a dime.” However, it is often difficult for a seated operator of a skid loader to adequately visualize the environment around the skid loader. Since skid loaders are often employed in developing neighborhoods and on congested construction sites, there is a risk that the skid loader might be turned/swung into an object (or even a person) on the site. Thus, while a skid loader is highly maneuverable, the operator must exercise care to prevent swinging the rear end of the skid loader into unseen objects or people on the construction site.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For these and other reasons, there is a need for the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “back,” “leading,” “trailing,” etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various embodiments of the present invention can be implemented on skid loaders. In general, a skid loader is a vehicle having at least one pair of opposing tracks/wheels. The opposing tracks/wheels can be moved independently such that the opposing tracks/wheels can be moved in opposing directions. As a result, skid loaders can be turned through a very tight turning radius and are said to “turn on a dime.” As a point of reference, when the opposing tracks/wheels are moved in opposing directions, the opposing tracks/wheels can skid or slide as the skid loader turns. In the following detailed description, the term skid loader refers to vehicles having the above characteristics and includes, for example, track loaders, all-wheel steer loaders, skid-steers, and ride on/walk behind mini-track loaders. To this end, a skid loader is very different from a tractor or a truck, and the tight turning radius of the skid loader presents unique operational challenges to operators and users.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With this terminology in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a side view of a skid loader <b>20</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Skid loader <b>20</b> includes movement means <b>22</b>, a housing <b>24</b>, a cab <b>26</b>, a bucket <b>28</b>, a lifting arm assembly <b>29</b> including opposing lifting arms <b>30</b> extending from the housing <b>24</b>, and an exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> coupled to and extending from at least one of the lifting arms <b>30</b>. Exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> is a safety device that enables an operator in skid loader <b>20</b> to visualize substantially an entirety of a tail swing path on either rear side of skid loader <b>20</b>, as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Movement means <b>22</b> is configured to move skid loader <b>20</b> in response to inputs from an operator (not shown) within cab <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, movement means <b>22</b> includes a first pair of wheels <b>40</b> and a second pair of wheels <b>42</b>. In an alternate embodiment, movement means <b>22</b> includes a pair of tracks coupled on either side of skid loader <b>20</b>. In any regard, movement means <b>22</b> is configured to translate and/or turn skid loader <b>20</b> in response to operator commands.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Housing <b>24</b> is positioned to the rear of cab <b>26</b> and in one embodiment encloses a motor (not shown) adapted for powering skid loader <b>20</b>. In a preferred embodiment, ballast <b>50</b> is coupled to housing <b>24</b> to counteract (i.e., balance) mass carried by bucket <b>28</b>. Ballast <b>50</b> is optional, and when included, is coupled to a rear portion of housing <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Cab <b>26</b> is disposed above movement means <b>22</b> and positioned between the opposing lifting arms <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, a door <b>60</b> is formed within a front <b>62</b> of cab <b>26</b> to permit an operator (not shown) to enter and exit skid loader <b>20</b> from the front <b>62</b>. In addition, cab <b>26</b> includes side windows <b>64</b> and a back window <b>66</b> positioned to afford the operator a view exterior cab <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, an exterior region of each of windows <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> is covered by a protective screen (not shown) that guards windows <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> against potential breakage caused by falling and/or shifting objects.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Bucket <b>28</b> is coupled to lifting arms <b>30</b> and includes a piston <b>70</b> adapted to actuate movement of bucket <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, bucket <b>28</b> is a scoop. However, it is to be understood that bucket <b>28</b> can generally include a dozer, a ram, a post-hole digger, or other implements attachable to lifting arms <b>30</b>. Bucket <b>28</b> is moved vertically via movement from lifting arms <b>30</b> and can be actuated to tilt, for example in a dumping motion, by a movement of piston <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Lifting arms <b>30</b> (one shown) include a lifting lug <b>80</b> configured for the attachment of lifting means (not shown, but would include, for example, hydraulic lines) contained within lifting arms <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> is coupled to an exterior surface of lifting lug <b>80</b> to enable an operator (not shown) situated within cab <b>26</b> to visualize a tail swing path on either rear side of skid loader <b>20</b>, as further described below. Lifting arms <b>30</b> are movable, and can, for example, move up (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in raising a load contained within bucket <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, lifting arms <b>30</b> are extensible and are configured to move a load and/or an implement attached to lifting arms <b>30</b> inward and/or outward relative to cab <b>26</b>. In any regard, it has been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that mounting exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> to movable lifting arms <b>30</b> enables an operator (not shown) situated within cab <b>26</b> to visualize a tail swing path on either rear side of skid loader <b>20</b> even as lifting arms <b>30</b> are moved through a variety of positions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an inclined side view of exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and according to one embodiment of the present invention. Exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> includes a support <b>100</b> and a mirror <b>102</b>. Support <b>100</b> includes an arm end <b>104</b> and a mirror end <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, mirror end <b>106</b> defines a bore (occupied) configured to receive a bolt <b>108</b> projecting from mirror <b>102</b>. In this regard, a nut <b>110</b> is shown fastened to bolt <b>108</b> to secure mirror <b>102</b> to mirror end <b>106</b> of support <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, support <b>100</b> is an annular tube defining a first pair of opposing sides <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and a second pair of opposing sides <b>112</b><i>c </i>and <b>112</b><i>d</i>. In one embodiment, one of the pair of opposing sides, for example opposing sides <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>is collapsed such that the other pair of opposing sides <b>112</b><i>c</i>, <b>112</b><i>d </i>buckles at mirror end <b>106</b> to form a flat plate <b>120</b>. Flat plate <b>120</b> is rigid and thin and configured to support mirror <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the pair of opposing sides <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>is collapsed and a bore is simultaneously formed in flat plate <b>120</b> on mirror end <b>106</b>. For example, in one example of this embodiment mirror end <b>106</b> of support <b>100</b> is inserted into a press, the press is actuated to collapse opposing sides of support <b>100</b> to form flat plate <b>120</b>, and a punch is subsequently actuated to form a bore hole in flat plate <b>120</b>. Support <b>100</b> can be formed of any malleable and rigid material. For example, in one embodiment support <b>100</b> is an annular metal tube made of soft steel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mirror <b>102</b> is attachable to mirror end <b>106</b> of support <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, mirror <b>102</b> preferably includes bolt <b>108</b> projecting from one side of mirror <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, mirror <b>102</b> is a convex mirror defining a convex surface <b>130</b> opposite aback side <b>131</b>, where back side <b>131</b> is a support frame for mirror <b>102</b> and is formed of plastic. In one embodiment, bolt <b>108</b> projects from back side <b>131</b> and is offset from a center of mirror <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an inclined view of a back of exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Mirror <b>102</b> defines a central axis <b>134</b> and bolt <b>108</b> is offset from central axis <b>134</b>. When mirror <b>102</b> is coupled to support <b>100</b>, mirror <b>102</b> can be rotated about bolt <b>108</b> relative to central axis <b>134</b>. In this manner, mirror <b>102</b> can be moved (i.e., canted) relative to support <b>100</b> in providing a variable field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Arm end <b>104</b> is shown as an annular tube in an uncollapsed state. In an alternate embodiment, arm end <b>104</b> is collapsed in a manner similar to the collapse described above for mirror end <b>106</b>. In any regard, in one embodiment arm end <b>104</b> is configured for attachment to lifting arm <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or, more specifically, directly to lifting lug <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of lifting arm <b>30</b>. Arm end <b>104</b> can be attached to lifting arm <b>30</b> or lifting lug <b>80</b> by, for example, welding, clamping, quick-release mechanisms, mechanical attachment by a bolt, magnetic attachment, and/or adhesive attachment. For example, in one embodiment arm end <b>104</b> includes a magnet <b>135</b> that enables arm end <b>104</b> to be magnetically attached directly to a metal surface of lifting arm <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an inclined side view of an exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>140</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>140</b> includes a support <b>142</b> and a mirror <b>144</b>. Support <b>142</b> defines an arm end <b>146</b>, a mirror end <b>148</b>, and a vibration dampener <b>150</b> disposed between arm end <b>146</b> and mirror end <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment support <b>142</b> is coupled to lifting lug <b>80</b> and extends from lifting arm <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, support <b>142</b> is coupled directly to lifting arm <b>30</b>. In this regard, support <b>142</b> can extend upward from lifting arm <b>30</b> (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or support <b>142</b> can extend generally downward from lifting arm <b>30</b>. In any regard, in one embodiment arm end <b>146</b> is a solid metal bar stock suitable for welding to lifting arm <b>30</b> or lifting lug <b>80</b>. Vibration dampener <b>150</b> is configured to dampen oscillatory vibrations transferred through lifting arm <b>30</b> in stabilizing an optical image in mirror <b>144</b>. For example, in one embodiment vibration dampener <b>150</b> is a spring integrally formed within support <b>142</b>. In an alternate embodiment, vibration dampener <b>150</b> is a separate mass movably coupled to support <b>142</b> and configured to be selectively fixed along a length of support <b>142</b>. In any regard, vibration dampener <b>150</b> minimizes distortion of the optical image formed within mirror <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Support <b>142</b> defines a bore <b>152</b> formed in mirror end <b>148</b> that is sized to accept a bolt <b>160</b> projecting from mirror <b>144</b>. In this regard, mirror <b>144</b> includes a mirror surface <b>162</b> and bolt <b>160</b> projects from a surface opposite of mirror surface <b>162</b>. Mirror surface <b>162</b> can be a planar mirror surface, a convex mirror surface, or a concave mirror surface. In one embodiment, mirror surface <b>162</b> is a planar mirror surface such that mirror <b>144</b> is a flat mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an inclined view of a back of the exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Mirror <b>144</b> includes bolt <b>160</b> that is preferably offset from a central axis <b>170</b> of mirror <b>144</b>. In this regard, bolt <b>160</b> is an offset bolt extending from a back surface <b>172</b> of mirror <b>144</b> and is displaced a distance from central axis <b>170</b>. A nut <b>174</b> is shown coupled to bolt <b>160</b> to fix mirror <b>144</b> to mirror end <b>148</b> of support <b>142</b>. When mirror <b>144</b> is coupled to support <b>142</b>, mirror <b>144</b> can be rotated about bolt <b>160</b> relative to central axis <b>170</b> such that mirror <b>144</b> can be canted relative to support <b>142</b> in providing a variable field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a top view of skid loader <b>20</b> including two exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> positioned to enable visualization of substantially an entirety of a tail swing path <b>190</b> on either rear side of skid loader <b>20</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a simplified, overhead view of skid loader <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Operation of skid loader <b>20</b> and use of exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> will be described with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An operator <b>180</b> is shown schematically positioned within cab <b>26</b> and is associated with a sight line <b>182</b> to mirror <b>102</b> of exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b>. A centerline <b>184</b> of skid loader <b>20</b> is shown bisecting bucket <b>28</b> and ballast <b>50</b>. In this regard, operator <b>180</b> is positioned along centerline <b>184</b>, although other positions for operator <b>180</b> within cab <b>26</b> are equally acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Movement means <b>22</b> of skid loader <b>20</b> are independently operable between forward and reverse movements. In this regard, skid loader <b>20</b> can be moved forward in the direction of bucket <b>28</b>, or reversed in the direction of ballast <b>50</b>. In addition, movement means <b>22</b> can be independently controlled to swing skid loader <b>20</b> about centerline <b>184</b>. As a point of reference, skid loader <b>20</b> can be turned tightly (i.e., in a zero turn radius) and spun about its centroid by driving wheels <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> on one side in a forward direction and wheels <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> on the opposite side in a rearward direction. A tail swing path <b>190</b> is illustrated to the rear of skid loader <b>20</b> representing a turning radius that skid loader <b>20</b> swings through when sharply turned about centerline <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Movement of skid loader <b>20</b> to the rear and/or along tail swing path <b>190</b> occurs behind operator <b>180</b>. Thus, rearward movement of skid loader <b>20</b> is not in the operator's natural line-of-sight. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, operator <b>180</b> has a sight line <b>182</b> to mirror <b>102</b> that provides a vision cone <b>192</b> projected to the rear of skid loader <b>20</b>. In this manner, exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> is a safety device, that when mounted to skid loader <b>20</b>, includes a mirror <b>102</b> that provides a vision cone <b>192</b> that enables a seated operator <b>180</b> to visualize substantially an entirety of tail swing path <b>190</b> to the rear of skid loader <b>20</b>. In contrast, some skid loaders have conventional mirrors mounted inside the cab of the skid loader that provide only a limited, shoulder height and above rear view of the skid loader, and provide almost no view of a periphery of the tail swing path of a rotating skid loader.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In at least one embodiment, a pair of exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> is mounted on either side of skid loader <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, supports <b>100</b> are mounted to lifting arms <b>30</b> and are configured to provide operator <b>180</b> with sight lines <b>182</b> to mirrors <b>102</b> even when lifting arms <b>30</b> are elevated. In this manner, each of exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> provide a vision cone <b>192</b> (only one shown to minimize complexity of the illustration) of substantially an entirety of tail swing path <b>190</b>, such that a combination of two vision cones <b>192</b> from two exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> result in a full rear-field view encompassing an entirety of the tail swing path <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During use, and in particular during rearward movement of skid loader <b>20</b>, operator <b>180</b> is able to view almost the entire tail swing path <b>190</b> in safely operating skid loader <b>20</b>, including the ground and the area adjacent to the wheels/tracks of loader <b>20</b>. In addition, exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> can be viewed even when lifting arms <b>30</b> are raised and bucket <b>28</b> is actuated. Exterior rearview mirror mechanisms <b>32</b> can be employed by the operator <b>180</b> to watch for children potentially attracted to the use of skid loader <b>20</b>, and to monitor other persons or objects positioned behind skid loader <b>20</b> at the project site.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a side view of a skid loader <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Skid loader <b>200</b> includes movement means <b>202</b>, a housing <b>204</b>, a cab <b>206</b>, a bucket <b>208</b>, a lifting arm assembly <b>210</b> extending from the housing <b>204</b>, and an exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>212</b> coupled to and extending from lifting arm assembly <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Movement means <b>202</b> is similar to movement means <b>22</b> described above. In this regard, in one embodiment, movement means <b>202</b> includes a first pair of wheels <b>220</b> and a second pair of wheels <b>222</b>. In an alternate embodiment, movement means <b>202</b> includes a pair of tracks coupled on either side of skid loader <b>200</b>. In any regard, movement means <b>202</b> is configured to translate and/or turn skid loader <b>200</b> in response to operator commands.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Housing <b>204</b> is positioned to the rear of cab <b>206</b> and in one embodiment encloses a motor (not shown) adapted for powering skid loader <b>200</b>.

Ballast <b>230</b> is optional, and when included, is coupled to a rear portion of housing <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Lifting arm assembly <b>210</b>, in one embodiment, includes a movable lifting arm <b>240</b> and a support structure <b>250</b>. In general, lifting arm <b>240</b> is movable and is configured to lift bucket <b>208</b> through a vertical lift path. In one embodiment, lifting arm <b>240</b> can raise bucket <b>208</b> above cab <b>206</b>. In general, support structure <b>250</b> moves in a piston-like manner and provides structural support to the movable lifting arm <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>212</b> is similar to exterior rearview mirror mechanism <b>32</b> described above, and in one embodiment includes a support <b>260</b> and a mirror <b>270</b>.
