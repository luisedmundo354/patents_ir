<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosures of these co-pending applications are incorporated herein by cross-reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the applicant's co-pending application PCT/AU98/00550, a series of ink jet printing arrangements were proposed for printing at high speeds across a page width employing novel ink ejection mechanisms. The disclosed arrangements utilized a thermal bend actuator built as part of a monolithic structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such arrangements, it is desirable to form larger arrays of ink ejection nozzles so as to provide for a page width drop on demand print head. Desirably, a very high resolution of droplet size is required. For example, common competitive printing systems such as offset printing allow for resolutions of one thousand six hundred dots per inch (1600 dpi). Hence, by way of example, for an A4 page print head which is eight inches wide, to print at that resolution would require the equivalent of around 12800 ink ejection nozzles for each colour. Assuming a standard four colour process, this equates to approximately fifty one thousand ink ejection nozzles. For a six colour process including the standard four colours plus a fixative and an IR ink this results in 76800 ink ejection nozzles. Unfortunately, it is impractical to make large monolithic print heads from a contiguous segment of substrate such as a silicon wafer substrate. This is primarily a result of the substantial reduction in yield with increasing size of construction. The problem of yield is a well studied problem in the semi-conductor industry and the manufacture of ink jet devices often utilizes semi-conductor or analogous semi-conductor processing techniques. In particular, the field is generally known as Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). A survey on the MEMS field is made in the December 1998 IEEE Spectrum article by S Tom Picraux and Paul J McWhorter entitled “The Broad Sweep of Integrated Micro Systems”.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One solution to the problem of maintaining high yields is to manufacture a lengthy print head in a number of segments and to abut or overlap the segments together. Unfortunately, the extremely high pitch of ink ejection nozzles required for a print head device means that the spacing between adjacent print head segments must be extremely accurately controlled even in the presence of thermal cycling under normal operational conditions. For example, to provide a resolution of one thousand six hundred dots per inch a nozzle to nozzle separation of about sixteen microns is required.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Ambient conditions and the operational environment of a print head may result in thermal cycling of the print head in the overlap region resulting in expansion and contraction of the overlap between adjacent print head segments which may in turn lead to the production of artifacts in the resultant output image. For example, the temperature of the print head may rise 25° C. above ambient when in operation. The assembly of the print head may also be made of materials having different thermal characteristics to the print head segments resulting in a differential thermal expansion between these components. The silicon substrate may be packaged in elastomer for which the respective thermal expansion coefficients are 2.6×10<sup>−6 </sup>and 20×10<sup>−6 </sup>microns per degree Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Artifacts are produced due to the limited resolution of the print head to represent a continuous tone image in a binary form and the ability of the human eye to detect 0.5% differences in colour of adjacent dots in an image.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a first embodiment, a method of compensation for the temperature varying relative displacement of adjacent print head segments is provided by the utilization of a digital processing mechanism which adjusts for the overlap between adjacent segments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a print head covering an A4 page width there may be 10 segments having 9 overlapping portions arranged in a repeating sequence of staggered pairs. Initial alignment of segments can be made within 10 microns using techniques well known in the art of monolithic fabrication techniques. The width of a segment for a 6 colour ink arrangement would be approximately 225 microns assuming the nozzles of a segment are arranged on 16 micron centres in a zig-zag pattern longitudinally.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, a temperature sensor is placed on each print head segment so as to provide for a measure of the current temperature characteristics of each print head segment. The current temperature measurement can then be utilized to determine the amount of overlap between adjacent print head segments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, only a single temperature sensor can be used if it can be assumed that the segments of the print head are sufficiently similar to one another in physical characteristics and performance and that the ambient milieu of each pair of overlapped segment is substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The degree of overlap is then used to provide a mechanism for controlling the half toning between adjacent print head segments. It is assumed that outputting of an image in the instant invention is by means of digital half toning employing any method or technique well known in the art. Many different half toning techniques can be utilized and reference is made to the text by Ulichney entitled “Digital Half Toning” published by MIT Press.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> adjacent print head segments <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> overlap in the respective regions <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>. The overlap region may extend approximately 40 thou (˜1 mm.) providing an overlap of 64 nozzles spaced at 16 microns for 1600 dpi resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A temperature sensor <b>16</b> is placed on each print head segment <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> so as to provide for a measure of the current temperature characteristics of each print head segment <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The current temperature measurement can then be utilized to determine the amount of overlap between adjacent print head segments. Alternatively, fiduciary strips <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> on each overlapped segment <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may be used to measure the degree of relative displacement of the segments <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> by an interferometric technique.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the region <b>10</b> of the segment <b>2</b> the nozzles of this segment are used exclusively for the ejection of ink. Similarly in the region <b>11</b> of the segment <b>3</b> the nozzles of this segment are used exclusively for the ejection of ink. In the overlapping regions <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> a “blend” is provided between the two print head segments <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> such that along the edge <b>14</b> of the print head segment <b>2</b> nozzles are used exclusively in the region <b>12</b> to print and similarly along the edge <b>15</b>, the nozzles of the segment <b>3</b> are used almost exclusively for printing. In between, an interpolation, which can be linear or otherwise, is provided between these two extreme positions. Hence, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when printing a full colour output on a page the area on the side <b>17</b> is printed exclusively by the print head segment <b>10</b> while the area <b>18</b> is printed exclusively by the print head segment <b>11</b> (as illustrated by the black dots) with the area <b>19</b> comprising a blend between the nozzles of the two segments. The printing process utilizes any well known half toning matrix such as disclosed in the aforementioned references. While a known half toning matrix is utilized, the actual print head segment utilized will depend upon the blending ratio provided by the measure of overlap between the overlapping segments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One such method is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where a linear interpolation within the overlapped regions is shown. In the region corresponding to the overlapped section <b>12</b> at the edge <b>14</b> there is 100% utilization of the nozzles of print head segment <b>2</b>, whereas in the equivalent region, edge <b>7</b>, of the print head segment <b>3</b> there is zero output. As the distance of the overlap region from the line 14 of the segment <b>2</b> is increased towards the line <b>15</b> of the segment <b>3</b> the proportion of utilization of the nozzles of the section <b>12</b> is gradually decreased (linearly), being zero at edge <b>9</b> while the utilization of the nozzles of the section <b>13</b> is progressively increased to unity by the time the edge <b>15</b> is reached. In a first embodiment, where there is an increased overlap between nozzles, the half toning thresholds utilized are increased in the overlap region. This reduces the number of dots printed in the blend region. Conversely, if there is a reduced overlap with the print head segments being spaced apart slightly more than normally acceptable, the dot frequency can be increased by reducing the half toning threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An overall general half toning arrangement can be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with a dither matrix <b>25</b> outputting a current dither value <b>26</b> to a summation means <b>27</b> with summation means <b>27</b> having another input <b>28</b>, an overlap signal, which varies in either a positive or a negative sense depending on the degree of overlap between the adjacent segments. The output value <b>29</b> of summation means or adder <b>27</b> is compared to the input continuous tone data <b>32</b> via a comparator <b>30</b> so as to output half tone data <b>31</b>. An alternative arrangement allows that the data value <b>28</b> can be subtracted from the continuous tone data <b>29</b> before dithering is applied producing similar results. This arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a halftone data output <b>52</b> can be generated by combining the output <b>42</b> of dither matrix <b>40</b> in an adder <b>46</b> with the overlap signal <b>44</b>, and then taking the difference of the output <b>54</b> of adder <b>46</b> and the continuous tone data <b>48</b> in subtracter <b>50</b>. This is an equivalent arrangement to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Through the utilization of an arrangement such as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a degree of control of the overlap blending can be provided so as to reduce the production of streak artifacts between adjacent print head segments.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As each overlap signal <b>28</b> can be multiplied by a calibration factor and added to a calibration offset factor, the degree of accuracy of placement of adjacent print head segments can also be dramatically reduced. Hence, adjacent print head segments can be roughly aligned during manufacture with one another. Test patterns can then be printed out at known temperatures to determine the degree of overlap between nozzles of adjacent segments. Once a degree of overlap has been determined for a particular temperature range a series of corresponding values can be written to a programmable ROM storage device so as to provide full offset values on demand which are individually factored to the print head segment overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further embodiment of the invention involves the use of a software solution for reducing the production of artifacts between overlapped segments of the print heads. A full software implementation of a dither matrix including the implementation of an algorithm for adjusting variable overlap between print head segments is attached as appendix A. The program is written in the programming language C. The algorithm may be written in some other code mutatis mutandis within the knowledge of a person skilled in the art. The basis of the algorithm is explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A dispersed dot stochastic dithering is used to reproduce the continuous tone pixel values using bi-level dots. Dispersed dot dithering reproduces high spatial frequency, that is, image detail, almost to the limits of the dot resolution, while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full intensity depth when spatially integrated by the eye. A stochastic dither matrix is designed to be free of objectionable low frequency patterns when tiled across the page.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Dot overlap can be modelled using dot gain techniques. Dot gain refers to any increase from the ideal intensity of a pattern of dots to the actual intensity produced when the pattern is printed. In ink jet printing, dot gain is caused mainly by ink bleed. Bleed is itself a function of the characteristics of the ink and the printing medium. Pigmented inks can bleed on the surface but do not diffuse far inside the medium. Dye based inks can diffuse along cellulose fibres inside the medium. Surface coatings can be used to reduce bleed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because the effect of dot overlap is sensitive to the distribution of the dots in the same way that dot gain is, it is useful to model the ideal dot as perfectly tiling the page with no overlap. While an actual ink jet dot is approximately round and overlaps its neighbours, the ideal dot can be modelled by a square. The ideal and actual dot shapes thus become dot gain parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Dot gain is an edge effect, that is it is an effect which manifests itself along edges between printed dots and adjacent unprinted areas. Dot gain is proportional to the ratio between the edge links of a dot pattern and the area of the dot pattern. Two techniques for dealing with dot gain are dispersed dot dithering and clustered dot dithering. In dispersed dot dithering the dot is distributed uniformly over an area, for example for a dot of 50% intensity a chequer board pattern is used. In clustered dot dithering the dot is represented with a single central “coloured” area and an “uncoloured” border with the ratio of the area of “coloured” to “uncoloured” equalling the intensity of the dot to be printed. Dispersed dot dithering is therefore more sensitive to dot gain than clustered dot dithering.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Two adjacent print head segments have a number of overlapping nozzles. In general, there will not be perfect registration between corresponding nozzles in adjacent segments. At a local level there can be a misregistration of plus or minus half the nozzle spacing, that is plus or minus about 8 microns at 1600 dpi. At a higher level, the number of overlapping nozzles can actually vary.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first approach to smoothly blending the output across the overlap bridge and from one segment to the next consists of blending the continuous tone input to the two segments from one to the other across the overlap region. As output proceeds across the overlap region, the second segment receives an increasing proportion of the input continuous tone value and the first segment receives a correspondingly decreasing proportion as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A linear or higher order interpolation can be used. The dither matrices used to dither the output through the two segments are then registered at the nozzle level.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first approach has two drawbacks. Firstly, if the dither threshold at a particular dot location is lower than both segments' interpolated continuous tone values then both segments will produce a dot for that location. Since the two dots will overlap, the intensities promised by the two dither matrices will be only partially reproduced, leading to a loss of overall intensity. This can be remedied by ensuring that corresponding nozzles never both produce a dot. This can also be achieved by using the inverse of the dither matrix for alternating segments, or dithering the continuous tone value through a single dither matrix and then assigning the output dot to one or the other nozzle stochastically, according to a probability given by the current interpolation factor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Secondly, adjacent dots printed by different segments will overlap again leading to a loss of overall intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the value for each overlapped segment is plotted along the horizontal axes <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> as V<sub>A </sub>and V<sub>B </sub>respectively between the values of 0.0 and 1.0. The calculated output <b>66</b> is plotted with respect to the vertical axis <b>64</b> as a function, I<sub>A+B</sub>, for values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A contour plane <b>68</b> shows the resultant values for I<sub>A+B</sub>=0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the qualitative shape of the three dimensional function linking the two segments' input continuous tone values V<sub>A </sub>and V<sub>B </sub>to the observed output intensity I<sub>A+B</sub>. For the first approach, an input continuous tone value V and an interpolation factor f together yield V<sub>A</sub>=(1−f) V and V<sub>B</sub>=fV. The closer the interpolation factor is to 0.5 the greater the difference between the input continuous tone value and the observed output intensity. For V=1.0, this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the curve <b>200</b> on the vertical V<sub>A</sub>+V<sub>B</sub>=1.0 plane. By definition this curve lies on the function surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> indicates that when any kind of mixing occurs, that is 0.0&lt;f&lt;1.0, the output intensity is attenuated, and to achieve the desired output intensity the sum of the two segments' input values must exceed the desired output value, that is V<sub>A</sub>+V<sub>B</sub>&gt;V. This forms the basis for the algorithm in appendix A.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The function shows a linear response when only one segment contributes to the output, that is f=0.0 or f=1.0. This assumes of course that the dither matrix includes the effects of dot gain.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications may be made to the invention, with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the invention. For example, it will be appreciated that the invention may be embodied in either hardware or software in a suitably programmed digital data processing system, both of which are readily accomplished by those of ordinary skill in the respective arts. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
