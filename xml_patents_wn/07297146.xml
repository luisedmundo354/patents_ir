<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Adjacent bony portions can require treatment to obtain the desired surgical result. For example, the adjacent bony portions may require the application and/or maintenance of distraction forces therebetween in order to provide proper positioning and alignment of the adjacent bony portions for the desired surgical correction and healing to occur. There remains a need for implants and techniques that facilitate surgical correction of adjacent bony portions with distraction forces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">To facilitate surgical correction of adjacent bony portions, an implant includes a body attachable to adjacent bony portions adapted to apply and/or maintain a distraction force between the adjacent bony portions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to one aspect, an implant for treating a bony segment includes a body attachable intravertebrally to each of the first and second bony portions and adapted to apply and/or maintain a distraction force between each of the first and second bony portions while allowing motion between each of the first and second bony portions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to another aspect, an implant for distracting adjacent bony portions includes a body with a first condition and a second condition. The body extends intravertebrally between the adjacent bony portions for attachment thereto in the second condition. When attached, the body returns toward the first condition to apply a distraction force to the adjacent bony portions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a further aspect, a system for distracting adjacent bony portions includes a first anchor and a second anchor engageable to respective ones of the adjacent bony portions. An implant body extends intravertebrally of the adjacent bony portions and is attached to the first and second anchors. The body applies a distraction force between the first and second anchors when attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, a method for correcting a curved portion of a spinal column segment includes attaching an implant on a concavely curved side of the spinal column segment; and applying a distraction load to the concave side with the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect, a method for correcting a curved portion of a spinal column segment includes providing an implant having a first condition wherein the ends of the implant are spaced a first distance, a second condition wherein the ends of the implant are spaced a second distance less than the first distance; attaching the implant to a concave side of the spine in the second condition; and biasing the implant from the second condition to the first condition to apply a distraction load.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a method for distracting adjacent vertebrae of a spinal column segment includes positioning an implant extradiscally along the adjacent vertebrae; attaching the implant to the adjacent vertebrae; and applying a distraction load to the adjacent vertebrae with the implant.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device, and any such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a treatment system <b>20</b> that includes a distraction implant <b>40</b>. Distraction implant <b>40</b> includes a body <b>41</b> with a length extending along a longitudinal axis <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) sized to extend between adjacent bony portions for attachment of body <b>41</b> thereto. Distraction implant <b>40</b> can be attached intravertebrally to adjacent bony portions with a first anchor <b>21</b> and a second anchor <b>30</b> engageable to respective ones of the adjacent bony portions. In the illustrated embodiment, first anchor <b>21</b> includes a distal bone engagement portion <b>22</b> and a proximal attachment portion <b>24</b>. Second anchor <b>30</b> also includes a distal bone engagement portion <b>32</b> and a proximal attachment portion <b>34</b>. Body <b>41</b> of distraction implant <b>40</b> extends between and is attached to attachment portions <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> of anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To facilitate attachment to anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>, distraction implant <b>40</b> can be provided with a first hole <b>42</b> adjacent a first end <b>43</b> of body <b>41</b> and a second hole <b>44</b> adjacent a second end <b>45</b> of body <b>41</b>. First and second holes <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> can be sized to receive proximal attachment portions <b>24</b>, <b>34</b> of anchors <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> therein. Other embodiments contemplate that distraction implant <b>40</b> could be configured at each end thereof for attachment to two or more anchors engaged to respective ones of the adjacent bony portions. Holes <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> can include a broad and deep configuration to maximize the surface area contact between distraction implant <b>40</b> and each of the anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>. It is also contemplated that anchors can be positioned by penetrating body <b>41</b> with the anchors.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is contemplated that body <b>41</b> can be made from a suitable material that allows body <b>41</b> to maintain the desired spatial relationship between the adjacent bony portions. Body <b>41</b> can continuously maintain and/or exert a distraction force between anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> without rigidly fixing the adjacent bony portions to one another. For example, body <b>41</b> can include a first condition in which its ends are spaced from one another a first distance. Body <b>41</b> is formable to a second condition in which its ends are moved toward one another and spaced a second distance that is less than the first distance. Body <b>41</b> can be formed by compression, deformation, un-expanding or other transformation to the second condition. Body <b>41</b> is released, reformed, expanded, or otherwise transformed from the second condition to the first condition to provide a distraction force between the vertebrae to which it is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, body <b>41</b> can be attached in its second conditions to anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>. After attachment, body <b>41</b> returns toward its first condition to exert and/or maintain a distraction force between anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>. It is also contemplated that a distraction force can be applied to anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> with a distraction instrument, and distraction implant <b>40</b> can be attached to the distracted anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> to at least partially maintain the distraction force applied thereto. It is further contemplated that a distraction force can be applied between anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> and distraction implant <b>40</b> can in its second condition be attached to the distracted anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>, and return toward its first condition after attachment to anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> to maintain or increase the distraction force between anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various materials are contemplated for body <b>41</b>, including gels, elastomers, visco-elastic gels or plastics, foams, fabrics, meshes, shape memory alloys, other suitable biocompatible materials, and combinations thereof. Anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> can be of the type configured to provide bony incorporation into the bony portion in which the anchor is engaged. Examples of such anchors are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/137,038, filed on May 2, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It is also contemplated that anchors <b>21</b>, <b>30</b> could be provided in the form of bone screws, including cannulated bone screws and multi-axial bone screws, staples, suture anchors, spikes, bolts, interbody fusion devices positioned between adjacent bony portions, interbody implants positioned between adjacent bony portions, and other devices suitable for engaging bony structure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Body <b>41</b> includes a length in the direction of longitudinal axis <b>49</b> and a width in the direction of medial axis <b>51</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the width of body <b>41</b> varies along longitudinal axis <b>49</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, body <b>41</b> includes a base portion <b>53</b> extending between first end <b>43</b> and second end <b>45</b>. A lower surface <b>57</b> of body <b>41</b> extends along base portion <b>53</b>, and is positionable adjacent the bony portions to which distraction implant <b>40</b> is to be attached. Base portion <b>53</b> can be provided with a substantially constant thickness along the length and width of body portion <b>41</b>. A variable stiffness portion of distraction implant <b>40</b> in the form of an enlarged mid-portion <b>48</b> extends opposite lower surface <b>57</b> from base portion <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Medial axis <b>51</b> separates body <b>41</b> into a first portion <b>46</b> and a second portion <b>47</b>. First portion <b>46</b> of body <b>41</b> includes a first upper surface <b>48</b> on one side of longitudinal axis <b>49</b>, and a second upper surface <b>54</b> on the opposite side of longitudinal axis <b>49</b>. On the other side of medial axis <b>51</b>, second portion <b>47</b> of body <b>41</b> includes a third upper surface <b>50</b> along one side of longitudinal axis <b>49</b>, and a fourth upper surface <b>52</b> along the other side of longitudinal axis <b>49</b>. The adjacent upper surfaces <b>48</b> and <b>54</b> can meet along or adjacent longitudinal axis <b>49</b>, and the adjacent upper surfaces <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can meet along or adjacent longitudinal axis <b>49</b>. The adjacent upper surfaces <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> can meet along or adjacent medial axis <b>51</b>, and the adjacent upper surfaces <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can meet along or adjacent medial axis <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each of the surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> can meet at an apex <b>55</b> formed at or adjacent the intersection of longitudinal axis <b>49</b> and medial axis <b>51</b>. It is contemplated apex <b>55</b> provides a region or point of maximum thickness for body <b>41</b> along mid-portion <b>48</b>. Surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> of body <b>41</b> can taper from apex <b>55</b> towards outer edges of body <b>41</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are planar and form a pyramidal shape. Also contemplated are fewer or additional upper surfaces forming other polygonal shapes, and that any one or all of the surfaces <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> can be provided with curvature such that body <b>41</b> includes a bulbous or rounded shape.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the upper surfaces of body <b>41</b> provide body <b>41</b> with a greatest thickness at or adjacent the intersection of longitudinal axis <b>49</b> and medial axis <b>51</b>. Accordingly, the resistance of body <b>41</b> to forces which tend to compressively deform body <b>41</b> increases from each of the ends <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> of body <b>41</b> toward apex <b>55</b>. Mid-portion <b>48</b> can be sized to prevent body <b>41</b> from buckling under the expected compressive loads. The amount of compressive deformation of body <b>41</b> can be limited under the expected compressive loads to maintain a minimum spacing between ends <b>43</b>, <b>45</b>, yet allow ends <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> to move relative to one another so that the adjacent bony portions are not rigidly fixed to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows distraction implant <b>40</b> with a compressive force dissipation pattern superimposed thereon as represented by force arrows <b>56</b>. Such compressive forces can be created by static and dynamic compressive loading on distraction implant <b>40</b> by the adjacent bony portions. The compressive force per unit of cross-sectional area will be highest immediately adjacent holes <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> wherein the material cross-sectional area is the least. The width and height of body <b>41</b> each increase from ends <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> toward apex <b>55</b>, providing variable stiffness properties to body <b>41</b> along its length. The compressive force per unit of cross-sectional area reduces from ends <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> toward apex <b>55</b>, thus reducing the deformation of body <b>41</b> due to compressive forces. Body <b>41</b> can function as a shock absorbing device that can be compressed to provide a second condition for attachment and sufficiently elastic to return toward its uncompressed, first condition to apply or maintain distraction loading between anchors <b>21</b> and <b>30</b>. The flexible body <b>41</b> also allows some movement of the adjacent bony portions relative to one another. The variable stiffness properties of body <b>41</b> limits this movement to maintain stabilization of the adjacent bony portions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specific embodiments of distraction implant <b>40</b> are configured for application in the spinal region to maintain and/or provide distraction between adjacent vertebral bodies while preserving, at least partially, segmental motion between the vertebral bodies. For such spinal applications, it is contemplated that body <b>41</b> can be provided with an overall length in the direction of longitudinal axis <b>49</b> in the range from 2 to 4 centimeters between adjacent sides of holes <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Holes <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> can be provided with a diameter ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters. Body <b>41</b> can be provided with a maximum width in the direction of medial axis <b>51</b> in the range from 2 to 4 centimeters. Body <b>41</b> can be provided with a maximum height from bottom surface <b>57</b> to apex <b>55</b> in the range from about 1 to 3 centimeters. It is to be understood that such dimensions can vary and other dimensions are contemplated based on, for example, patient anatomy, the region of the body of the patient in which distraction implant <b>40</b> is to be attached, the properties of the material comprising distraction implant <b>40</b>, and expected loading on the distraction implant <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another embodiment distraction implant <b>240</b> includes a body <b>241</b> and first and second holes <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> adjacent ends <b>243</b>, <b>245</b>, respectively. Body <b>241</b> can be provided as discussed above with respect to body <b>41</b> of distraction implant <b>40</b>. Body <b>241</b> extends along longitudinal axis <b>249</b>, and medial axis <b>251</b> divides body <b>241</b> into a first portion <b>246</b> and a second portion <b>247</b>. Body <b>241</b> can be provided with upper surface portions <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> that are positioned entirely or primarily in respective quadrants formed by the intersection of axes <b>249</b>, <b>251</b>. Surfaces <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> provide an enlarged mid-portion extending from apex <b>255</b> adjacent or at the intersection of the longitudinal and medial axes <b>249</b>, <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Distraction implant <b>240</b> can be provided with one or more reinforcing members in body <b>241</b> to assist in maintaining the structural integrity of body <b>241</b> and provide variable stiffness properties thereto. For example, reinforcing members <b>258</b> can be provided around one or more of the anchor holes through body <b>241</b>, such as shown with respect to hole <b>242</b>. Reinforcing members <b>258</b> can be provided medially of hole <b>242</b> to assist body <b>241</b> in resisting compressive forces. Reinforcing members <b>258</b> can be provided between hole <b>242</b> and end <b>243</b> to assist body <b>241</b> and reinforcing members <b>258</b> in resisting tensile forces.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>, there is shown another embodiment distraction implant <b>700</b>. Distraction implant <b>700</b> includes a body <b>702</b> extending from a first end <b>704</b> to an opposite second end <b>706</b>. First end <b>704</b> includes a hole <b>710</b> and second end <b>706</b> includes a hole <b>712</b> to facilitate intravertebral attachment to a vertebral body with, for example, a first anchor <b>21</b> and a second anchor <b>30</b> as discussed above with respect to system <b>20</b>. Ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> can each be enlarged relative to body <b>702</b> to form the respective holes <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> to receive an anchor therethrough. It is also contemplated that either of body <b>702</b> or holes <b>710</b>, <b>712</b> and the corresponding anchors can be sized so that ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> are not enlarged relative to body <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First hole <b>710</b> is spaced a distance <b>714</b> from second hole <b>712</b> along longitudinal axis <b>701</b>, and a gap is formed therebetween along longitudinal axis <b>701</b> to facilitate movement of first and second ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> toward and away from one another in response to compression, expansion, deformation or transformation of body <b>702</b>. Distance <b>714</b> can be of sufficient length to extend across at least one spinal disc space so the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> can be attached to respective ones of adjacent vertebral bodies. It is also contemplated that length <b>714</b> can be provided such that body <b>702</b> extends across one or more vertebrae, and ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> can be attached to provide multi-level distraction. Implant <b>700</b> further includes an overall width <b>718</b> between longitudinal axis <b>701</b> and an outer wall surface <b>705</b> of body <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is contemplated that implant <b>700</b> can be positioned along a concavely curved portion of the spine, such as the lateral or antero-lateral portion of a scoliotic spine, and is adapted to exert a distraction force between adjacent anchors to treat the concave curvature. Body <b>702</b> is curved along a semi-circular path between ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, and includes a concave first surface <b>703</b> and an opposite convex second, outer surface <b>705</b>. Body <b>702</b> includes a first width <b>708</b> between first and second surfaces <b>703</b>, <b>705</b>. Body <b>702</b> further includes opposite third and fourth surfaces <b>707</b>, <b>709</b> extending between first surface <b>703</b> and second surface <b>705</b>. Third and fourth surface <b>707</b>, <b>709</b> include a second width <b>711</b> extending therebetween. When secured to the spinal column, it is contemplated that one of the third and fourth surfaces <b>707</b>, <b>709</b> will be positioned adjacent the spinal column, and the other of third and fourth surface <b>707</b>, <b>709</b> will face away from the spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one application for distraction implant <b>700</b>, and the other distraction implant embodiments discussed herein, implant <b>700</b> includes a first condition and is formed to a second condition by moving ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> toward one another. In the second condition, ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> are attached to anchors engaged to vertebrae or other structures along the concavely curved portion of the spine. Distraction implant <b>700</b> then reforms toward its first condition to exert a distraction force between the anchors engaged thereto to correct and/or maintain the concavely curved portion of the spine in the desired alignment. The gap between ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> formed by laterally offsetting body <b>702</b> relative to longitudinal axis <b>701</b> facilitates movement of ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> toward one another to obtain the second condition. In addition, the gap between ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> facilitates flexing of body <b>702</b> in the first condition to permit a limited range of motion for the vertebral level(s) to which implant <b>700</b> is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Distraction implant <b>700</b> can be at least partially formed of a shape-memory material that exhibits pseudoelastic characteristics or behavior at about human body temperature. In one embodiment, the implant <b>700</b> is formed of the shape-memory material. However, it should be understood that only a portion between ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> may be at least partially formed of the shape-memory material, with the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> formed of any suitable biocompatible material, such as, for example, stainless steel or titanium.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">SMAs exhibit a “shape-memory” characteristic or behavior in which a particular component formed of a shape-memory alloy (“SMA”) is capable of being deformed from an initial “memorized” shape or configuration to a different shape or configuration, and then reformed back toward its initial shape or configuration. The ability to possess shape-memory is a result of the fact that the SMA undergoes a reversible transformation from an austenitic state to a martensitic state. If this transformation occurs due to a change in temperature, the shape-memory phenomena is commonly referred to as thermoelastic martensitic transformation. If the martensitic transformation occurs due to the imposition of stress, the shape-memory phenomena is commonly referred to as stress-induced martensitic transformation. Both types of transformations are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">SMAs are known to display a superelastic phenomena or rubber-like behavior in which a strain attained beyond the elastic limit of the SMA material during loading is recovered during unloading. This superelastic phenomena occurs when stress is applied to an SMA article at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature at which the SMA begins to transform into austenite (sometimes referred to as the transformation temperature). When stressed, the article first deforms elastically up to the yield point of the SMA material (sometimes referred to as the critical stress). However, upon the further imposition of stress, the SMA material begins to transform into stress-induced martensite or “SIM”. This transformation takes place at essentially constant stress, up to the point where the SMA material is completely transformed into martensite. When the stress is removed, the SMA material will reform back into austenite and the article will return to its original, pre-programmed or memorized shape. This phenomena is sometimes referred to as superelasticity or pseudoelasticity. It should be understood that this phenomena can occur without a corresponding change in temperature of the SMA material.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Shape-memory materials can also be pliable and can typically be readily reshaped at temperatures below their transformation temperature range. Such articles can be trained to have a pre-programmed shape (commonly referred to as a “memorized shape”) which the article will form into when the shape-memory material reaches a temperature above its transformation temperature range. After reaching such a temperature, the article will attempt to form to its pre-programmed, memorized shape. In so doing, the article converts heat energy into mechanical work.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">There is a wide variety of shape-memory materials suitable for use with the distraction implants, including shape-memory metal alloys (e.g., alloys of known metals, such as, for example, copper and zinc, nickel and titanium, and silver and cadmium) and shape-memory polymers. While there are many alloys which exhibit shape-memory characteristics, one of the more common SMAs is an alloy of nickel and titanium. One such alloy is nitinol, a bio-compatible SMA formed of nickel and titanium. Nitinol is well suited for the particular application of the distraction implants because it can be programmed to undergo a stress-induced martensitic transformation or thermoelastic martensitic transformation at about normal human body temperature (i.e., at about 35-40 degrees Celsius). Moreover, nitinol has a very low corrosion rate and excellent wear resistance, thereby providing an advantage when used as a support structure within the human body. Additionally, implant studies in animals have shown minimal elevations of nickel in the tissues in contact with the nitinol material. It should be understood, however, that other SMA materials that exhibit superelastic characteristics are contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Techniques are contemplated that are suited for distraction implant <b>700</b> made from shape memory material. It should be understood that such techniques are also applicable to the other distraction implant embodiments discussed herein. The distraction implant ends, such as ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> of implant <b>700</b>, are moved toward one another to bend body <b>702</b> and place shape memory material comprising at least a portion of body <b>702</b> in a SIM condition. Body <b>702</b> is maintained in this SIM condition, and the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> of implant <b>700</b> are attached to vertebrae or other structures along the concavely curved portion of the spine with anchors. The stress on body <b>702</b> is then removed, and the engaged distraction implant <b>700</b> reforms back into an austenitic state toward its original shape, exerting a distraction force between the anchors engaged thereto to correct and/or maintain the concavely curved portion of the spine in the desired alignment. The gap between ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> formed by laterally offsetting body <b>702</b> relative to longitudinal axis <b>701</b> facilitates movement of ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> toward one another to obtain the SIM state or condition, and facilitates flexing of body <b>702</b> in the austenetic state to permit a limited range of motion for the vertebral level(s) to which implant <b>700</b> is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In order to achieve additional distraction force and increased stiffness to reduce spinal motion, multiple distraction implants <b>700</b> can be stacked one upon the other, and engaged to the concavely curved portion of the spinal column with the same bone anchor at each end. The bodies <b>702</b> of the stacked implants <b>700</b> can be arranged to be laterally offset to the same side of longitudinal axis <b>701</b>, or arranged to be laterally offset to opposite sides of longitudinal axis <b>701</b>. Multiple distraction implants <b>700</b> can also be spaced longitudinally and engaged along the spinal column in order to provide distraction at multiple levels. Different levels of the spinal column can be distracted with one implant <b>700</b> or differing numbers of stacked implants <b>700</b> to provide differing distraction forces and stiffness properties for the implant system along the spinal column.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">One or both of the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> of implant <b>700</b> can be rigidly secured to the adjacent bone anchor, or allowed to rotate relative thereto. By allowing the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> to rotate, the distraction force will be directed primarily in the direction of movement of ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> away from one another as body <b>702</b> reforms to the firs condition. If one or both of the ends <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> is fixed to the bone anchor, compound forces on the anchor are generated. The compound forces will include a component extending transversely to the central axis of the spinal column, and can be employed to align or maintain alignment of adjacent vertebrae in a direction transverse to the central axis of the spinal column in the anterior-posterior direction, such as would be desirable to correct spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Other shapes for distraction implant <b>700</b> are also contemplated. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> show a distraction implant <b>720</b> similar to distraction implant <b>700</b>. Distraction implant <b>720</b> includes a body <b>722</b> extending between a first end <b>724</b> and an opposite second end <b>726</b>. Body <b>722</b> includes a semi-oval shape between first and second ends <b>724</b>, <b>726</b>. The semi-oval shape for body <b>722</b> provides, for implants of identical lengths <b>714</b>, <b>734</b>, a reduced overall width <b>738</b> for distraction implant <b>720</b> as compared to semi-circular distraction implant <b>700</b> having the same overall length.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Still other embodiments contemplate that the distraction implant include a second body portion extending between the opposite ends to provide additional support to maintain a distraction force. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, there is shown distraction implant <b>760</b> including a body <b>761</b> with a first body portion <b>762</b> and a second body portion <b>763</b>. Body portions <b>762</b>, <b>763</b> each extend between opposite ends <b>764</b>, <b>766</b>, where holes can be provided along longitudinal axis <b>769</b> to facilitate attachment to vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Body <b>761</b> forms a circular shape with an opening <b>768</b> therethrough, allowing ends <b>764</b>, <b>766</b> to flex or be moved toward one another or away from one another in response to a deformation or change in shape in body portions <b>762</b>, <b>763</b>. Body portions <b>762</b>, <b>763</b> are integrally formed with one another at each of the first and second ends <b>764</b>, <b>766</b> to provide a continuous body structure about opening <b>768</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> show a distraction implant <b>780</b> including a body <b>781</b> with a first body portion <b>782</b> and a second body portion <b>783</b>. Body portions <b>782</b>, <b>783</b> each extend between opposite ends <b>784</b>, <b>786</b>, where holes can be provided to facilitate attachment to vertebrae. Body <b>781</b> forms an oval shape with an opening <b>788</b> therethrough, allowing ends <b>784</b>, <b>786</b> to flex or be moved toward one another or away from one another in response to a deformation or change in shape in body portions <b>782</b>, <b>783</b>. Body portions <b>782</b>, <b>783</b> are integrally formed with one another at each of the first and second ends <b>784</b>, <b>786</b> to provide a continuous body structure about opening <b>768</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The oval shape of body <b>781</b> of distraction implant <b>780</b> includes an overall width <b>790</b> between the outer surfaces of body portions <b>782</b>, <b>783</b>. Body <b>781</b> includes a length <b>792</b> between ends <b>784</b>, <b>786</b>. Similarly, distraction implant <b>760</b> includes a width <b>770</b> for its circular shaped body and a length <b>772</b> along axis <b>769</b> that is substantially the same as width <b>770</b>. For distraction implant <b>780</b>, width <b>790</b> is less than width <b>770</b> of distraction implant <b>760</b> for implants having the same lengths <b>772</b>, <b>792</b>. Accordingly, distraction implant <b>780</b> can be employed if a greater length to width ratio is desired.</p>
