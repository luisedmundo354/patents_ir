<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is related to magnetofluidic acceleration sensors, and more particularly, to an acceleration sensor with a wide frequency response and a high dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Magnetofluidic accelerometers are described in, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/836,624, filed May 3, 2004, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/836,186, filed May 3, 2004, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/422,170, filed May 21, 2003, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/209,197, filed Aug. 1, 2002 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,731,268), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/511,831, filed Feb. 24, 2000 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,466,200), and Russian patent application No. 99122838, filed Nov. 3, 1999. These accelerometers utilize magnetofluidic principles and an inertial body suspended in a magnetic fluid, to measure acceleration. Such an accelerometer often includes a sensor casing (sensor housing, or “vessel”), which is filled with magnetic fluid. An inertial body (“inertial object”) is suspended in the magnetic fluid. The accelerometer usually includes a number of drive coils (power coils) generating a magnetic field in the magnetic fluid, and a number of measuring coils to detect changes in the magnetic field due to relative motion of the inertial body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the power coils are energized and generate a magnetic field, the magnetic fluid attempts to position itself as close to the power coils as possible. This, in effect, results in suspending the inertial body in the approximate geometric center of the housing. When a force is applied to the accelerometer (or to whatever device the accelerometer is mounted on), so as to cause angular or linear acceleration, the inertial body attempts to remain in place. The inertial body therefore “presses” against the magnetic fluid, disturbing it and changing the distribution of the magnetic fields inside the magnetic fluid. This change in the magnetic field distribution is sensed by the measuring coils, and is then converted electronically to values of linear and angular acceleration. Knowing linear and angular acceleration, it is then possible, through straightforward mathematical operations, to calculate linear and angular velocity, and, if necessary, linear and angular position. Phrased another way, the accelerometer provides information about six degrees of freedom—three linear degrees of freedom (x, y, z), and three angular (or rotational) degrees of freedom (α<sub>x</sub>, α<sub>y</sub>, α<sub>z</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are a number of applications where frequency response and dynamic range of the accelerometer are important. Dynamic range refers to the minimum and maximum acceleration (angular and/or linear) that the accelerometer can measure. Frequency response refers to the highest input vibration frequency that the accelerometer can measure (usually, in this context, frequency response to linear acceleration is more important than frequency response to angular acceleration, since linear vibration usually has a higher frequency than rotational vibration).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an accelerometer with a high dynamic range and a high frequency response.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to magnetofluidic accelerometers with active suspension that substantially obviates one or more of the disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">More particularly, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method of measuring acceleration includes suspending an inertial body using a magnetic fluid; generating a magnetic field within the magnetic fluid; modulating the magnetic field to counteract a change in position of the inertial body relative to sources of the magnetic field (e.g., drive coils) due to acceleration; and calculating the acceleration based on the modulation. The calculating step derives the acceleration based on an amount of current through drive coils required for the modulation. The acceleration includes linear acceleration and/or angular acceleration. The drive coils include permanent magnets, electromagnets, or a combination of the two. Sensing coils can be used for detecting the displacement of the inertial body. Each sensing coil can be positioned substantially within a corresponding drive coil. The inertial body can be non-magnetic, or weakly magnetic (i.e., substantially less magnetic than the magnetic fluid).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, a method for measuring acceleration includes suspending an inertial body in a magnetic fluid; measuring a position of the inertial body in response to a force applied to the inertial body; applying a counterbalancing force to the inertial body to counteract the applied force; and calculating acceleration based on the counterbalancing force.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, an accelerometer sensor includes an inertial body, a plurality of drops of magnetic fluid holding the inertial body in suspension, and a plurality of magnetic poles maintaining the drops of the magnetic fluid in contact with the inertial body. Displacement of the inertial body is measured. A circuit modulates magnetic fields generated by the magnetic poles to counteract the displacement due to acceleration, and values of acceleration are derived therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, a sensor includes an inertial body, a plurality of magnets located generally around the inertial body, magnetic fluid between the sources and the inertial body, and a circuit that modulates magnetic fields generated by the magnets to counteract a displacement of the inertial body due to acceleration. Acceleration can be derived based on an amount of current through the magnets required to counteract the change in position. The magnets can be located substantially inside the inertial body, or partially inside the inertial body. A ferromagnetic coating can be placed on portions of the inertial body. A housing can enclose the inertial body and the magnetic fluid. A plurality of casings can have corresponding magnets mounted therein, the casings being coupled to the housing and projecting into the housing. The sensing coils (or other position sensors) can also be mounted in the casings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a magnetofluidic acceleration sensor of the present invention. The general principles of operation of the magnetofluidic sensor are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,466,200, which is incorporated herein by reference. The sensor's behavior is generally described by a set of non-linear partial differential equations, see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/614,415, entitled METHOD OF CALCULATING LINEAR AND ANGULAR ACCELERATION IN A MAGNETOFLUIDIC ACCELEROMETER WITH AN INERTIAL BODY, Inventors: ROMANOV et al., Filed: Sep. 30, 2004, to which this application claims priority.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the accelerometer <b>102</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in assembled form, includes a housing <b>104</b>, a number of drive magnet assemblies <b>106</b>A-<b>106</b>E, each of which is connected to a power source using corresponding wires <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>E. Note that in this view, only five drive magnet assemblies <b>106</b> are shown, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where a sixth drive magnet assembly (designated <b>106</b>F) is also illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the sensor <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with one of the drive magnet assemblies removed. With the drive magnet assembly <b>106</b>C removed, an inertial body <b>202</b> is visible in an approximate geometric center of the housing <b>104</b>. The magnetic fluid <b>204</b> fills the remainder of the available volume within the housing. Note that the magnetic fluid itself is not actually drawn in the figure for clarity, although most such fluids are black in color and have an “oily” feel to them.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a partial cutaway view showing the arrangements of the drive magnet coils and the sensing coils. Only some of the components are labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for clarity. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are four drive coils (or drive magnets) <b>302</b>A, <b>302</b>B, <b>302</b>E and <b>302</b>D, collectively referred to as drive magnets <b>302</b> (the remaining two drive magnets are not shown in this figure). The drive magnets <b>302</b> are also sometimes referred to as suspension magnets, power magnets, or suspension coils (if electromagnets are used).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, each such drive magnet assembly <b>106</b> has two sensing coils, designated by <b>306</b> and <b>304</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <b>306</b>A, <b>304</b>A, <b>306</b>B, <b>304</b>B, <b>306</b>E, <b>304</b>E, <b>306</b>E, <b>304</b>E). The sensing coils <b>306</b>, <b>304</b> are also sometimes referred to as “sensing magnets,” or “measuring coils.” Note that in addition to coils (i.e., inductive sensors), Hall sensors, laser or LED sensors, electrostatic sensors, acoustic sensors, optical sensors, capacitive sensors, etc. can also be used to detect the position of the inertial body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note further that in order to measure both linear and angular acceleration, two sensing coils per side of the “cube” are necessary. If only a single sensing coil were to be positioned in a center of each side of the “cube,” measuring angular acceleration would be impossible. As a less preferred alternative, it is possible to use only one sensing coil per side of the cube, but to displace it off center. However, the mathematical analysis becomes considerably more complex in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate exploded views of the sensor <b>102</b>, showing the same structure from two different angles. In particular, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is an exploded view of one of the drive magnet assembly <b>106</b>D. As shown in the figures, the drive magnet assembly <b>106</b>D includes a casing <b>402</b>, a rear cap <b>404</b>, the drive coil <b>302</b>D, two sensing coils <b>306</b>D and <b>304</b>D, magnet cores <b>406</b> (one for each sensing coil <b>306</b>D and <b>304</b>D), and a drive magnet core <b>408</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the cores <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> can be manufactured as a single common piece (in essence, as a single “transformer core”).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment, the sensing coils <b>306</b>D and <b>304</b>D are located inside the drive coil <b>302</b>D, and the rear cap <b>404</b> holds the drive coil <b>302</b>D and the sensing coils <b>306</b>D and <b>304</b>D in place in the drive coil assembly <b>106</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The drive magnets <b>302</b> are used to keep the inertial body <b>202</b> suspended in place. The sensing coils <b>306</b>, <b>304</b> measure the changes in the magnetic flux within the housing <b>104</b>. The magnetic fluid <b>204</b> attempts to flow to locations where the magnetic field is strongest. This results in a repulsive force against the inertial body <b>202</b>, which is usually either non-magnetic, or partly (weakly) magnetic (e.g., substantially less magnetic than the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor <b>102</b> described and illustrated above thus works on the principle of repulsive magnetic forces. The magnetic fluid <b>203</b> is highly magnetic, and is attracted to the drive magnets <b>302</b>. Therefore, by trying to be as close to the drive magnets <b>302</b> as possible, the magnetic fluid in effect “pushes out,” or repels, the inertial body <b>202</b> away from the drive magnets <b>302</b>. In the case where all the drive magnets <b>302</b> are identical, or where all the drive magnets <b>302</b> exert an identical force, and the drive magnets <b>302</b> are arranged symmetrically about the inertial body <b>202</b>, the inertial body <b>202</b> will tend to be in the geometric center of the housing <b>104</b>. This effect may be thought of as a repulsive magnetic effect (even though, in reality, the inertial body <b>202</b> is not affected by the drive magnets <b>302</b> directly, but indirectly, through the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The frequency response of an accelerometer <b>102</b>, such as described above, depends on many factors, such as sensor geometry, strength of the magnetic field, amount and type of magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, inertial body <b>202</b> geometry and weight, and other parameters. It may be desirable to expand the dynamic range and the frequency response for certain applications, such as for applications where a vibration needs to be measured accurately. Typical dynamic range for one sensor <b>102</b>, such as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, if the device is approximately 1-2 cubic centimeters in volume and roughly as illustrated in those figures, it is approximately a few g. Typical frequency response is usually a few tens of hertz to perhaps a few hundred hertz.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Active suspension, illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is an alternative mechanism for generating the signal input necessary for calculating the acceleration. In active suspension, the inertial body <b>202</b> is maintained in place, while the force generated by the drive magnets <b>302</b> is controlled using a feedback loop, in order to counteract the movement of the inertial body <b>202</b>. In other words, rather than allow the inertial body <b>202</b> to move relative to the housing <b>104</b> (in response to an applied force) so as to change the distribution of the magnetic flux lines within the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, the magnetic field generated by the drive magnets <b>302</b> is controlled, using a feedback loop. The amount of current necessary to maintain the inertial body <b>202</b> in place is the variable that is actually measured, and from that current, linear and/or angular acceleration is derived.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of active suspension in a magneto-fluidic accelerometer. For illustration purposes, the “sides” of the cube have been labeled consistently with the labeling in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> (i.e., A, B, D, E).

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an inertial body <b>202</b> which is in contact with magnetic fluid <b>204</b>. Four drive magnets, labeled <b>302</b>D<b>1</b>, <b>302</b>D<b>2</b>, <b>302</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>302</b>B<b>2</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, although it will be understood that, in this case, each side of the “cube” has two such drive magnets <b>302</b>, for a total (in this case) of 12 drive magnets <b>302</b> for the entire accelerometer <b>102</b>. In an alternative embodiment, it is possible to use only a single drive magnet <b>302</b> per side of the “cube,” as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are four sensing coils <b>306</b>B, <b>304</b>B, <b>306</b>D, <b>304</b>B.

In an alternative embodiment, the entire available volume in the housing <b>104</b> is filled with the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit <b>602</b> for measuring the position vector X of the inertial body <b>202</b>. The coordinate vector X is derived from the output of the sensing coils <b>306</b>B, <b>304</b>B, <b>306</b>D, <b>304</b>B. A change in the coordinate vector X relative to where the inertial body <b>202</b> is located before the force F applied to the accelerometer is designated by ΔX. ω is the angular velocity, therefore, ω′ is the angular acceleration (a first derivative of angular velocity ω), with its individual components about the relevant axis represented as ω′<sub>x</sub>, ω′<sub>y</sub>, ω′<sub>z</sub>. a<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>y</sub>, a<sub>z </sub>are the linear acceleration components along the relevant axes, α is the set of angles of rotation of the inertial body <b>202</b> around the relevant axis (α<sub>x</sub>, α<sub>y</sub>, α<sub>z</sub>) and ΔX<sub>i </sub>is the change in the distance between the inertial body <b>202</b> and the i<sup>th </sup>sensing coil. The subscript “i” refers to the drive magnets, in other words, top left (<b>302</b>B<b>2</b>) labeled by the subscript <b>1</b>, top right (<b>302</b>D<b>1</b>) designated by the subscript <b>3</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The droplets of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> exert forces F<sub>i </sub>on the inertial body <b>202</b>. A force F (directed towards the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is applied to the inertial body <b>202</b> (causing acceleration, which results in the forces F<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>2 </sub>being weaker than the forces F<sub>3 </sub>and F<sub>4</sub>, as shown in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A circuit <b>604</b> is used to calculate the applied acceleration, both linear (a<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>y</sub>, a<sub>z</sub>) and angular (ω′<sub>x</sub>, ω′<sub>y</sub>, ω′<sub>z</sub>). The input to the circuit <b>604</b> is the measurement of the position of the inertial body <b>202</b> (using the sensing coils <b>306</b>B, <b>304</b>B, <b>306</b>D, <b>304</b>B) from the circuit <b>602</b> and the amount of force F<sub>i </sub>for each drive magnet <b>302</b> required to be applied by each drive magnet <b>302</b> to the inertial body <b>202</b>, so as to maintain the inertial body in place. A controller <b>606</b> runs in a feedback loop, calculating the amount of force F<sub>i </sub>needed to be applied to the drive magnets <b>302</b>. Inputs to the controller <b>606</b> are the coordinate vector X of the inertial body <b>202</b> and the displacement ΔX relative to the drive magnets <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A summer <b>608</b> is used to combine the values of X, α and ΔX, so as to enable calculation of the displacement of the inertial body <b>202</b>. A filter <b>610</b> can be used to reduce unwanted effects from zero bias and zero bias drift, and to filter out any unwanted high frequency components, if desired. An example of such a filter is described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/612,227, entitled METHOD OF SUPPRESSION OF ZERO BIAS DRIFT IN ACCELERATION SENSOR, Inventor: Yuri I. ROMANOV, Filed: Sep. 23, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A regulator <b>612</b> is used to form a signal for control of the suspension of the inertial body <b>202</b>, given the static and dynamic characteristics of the sensor <b>102</b>, so as to maintain ΔX at a constant value. To the extent that the sensor <b>102</b> is treated as being described by a set of non-linear partial differential equations (see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/614,415, entitled METHOD OF CALCULATING LINEAR AND ANGULAR ACCELERATION IN A MAGNETOFLUIDIC ACCELEROMETER WITH AN INERTIAL BODY, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), then a regulator <b>612</b> can be chosen that best fits the chosen model (usually, some approximation of a solution of the non-linear partial differential equations, which do not have a closed form solution and must be solved numerically). The acceleration components ω′<sub>x</sub>, ω′<sub>y</sub>, ω′<sub>z</sub>, a<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>y</sub>, a<sub>z </sub>can then be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A scaling circuit <b>614</b> is used to provide a set of scaling factors S for each F<sub>i </sub>corresponding to each drive magnet <b>302</b>. The scaling circuit <b>614</b>, in the simplest case, is essentially an amplifier (or a set of amplifiers) that converts the output of the regulator <b>612</b> to the necessary currents by using a set of scaling parameters S. A more complex scaler can also be used. The output of the active suspension controller <b>606</b> is used to control the current flowing through the drive magnets <b>302</b>, which in turn controls the magnetic fields, which in turn force the inertial body <b>202</b> to remain in place. The controller <b>606</b> can be implemented as a hybrid analog-digital circuit, or as a microprocessor with A/D and D/A inputs/outputs and a driver circuit for the magnets <b>302</b>, or in any other manner as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that knowing the acceleration components ω′<sub>x</sub>, ω′<sub>y</sub>, ω′<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>y</sub>, a<sub>z</sub>, linear and angular velocities can also be calculated in a straightforward manner (using integration), as well as linear and angular position (using one more integration).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, an active feedback loop (“active suspension”) is implemented, so as to force the inertial body <b>202</b> to remain virtually stationary. The drive magnets <b>302</b> exert forces on the inertial body <b>202</b> to counteract the applied force. Based on the amount of force (and therefore current) necessary to maintain the inertial body <b>202</b> in place, linear and angular accelerations can be then calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Phrased another way, the acceleration can be derived from the amount of “effort” needed to maintain the inertial body <b>202</b> in place. The “effort” is related to the current needed to generate the required magnetic field. Thus, the acceleration is related to the current needed to maintain the inertial body <b>202</b> in place. The inertial body <b>202</b> itself essentially remains nearly motionless. This is the principle behind active suspension.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another alternative embodiment of how active suspension can be implemented. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the inertial body <b>202</b> surrounded by magnetic fluid <b>204</b>. (The housing <b>104</b> is not shown in this figure.) Each single drive magnet <b>302</b> includes a coil winding, labeled <b>302</b>A, <b>302</b>B, <b>302</b>E, <b>302</b>D (similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the letters corresponding to the letters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>) and a permanent magnet <b>702</b> (four are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, labeled <b>702</b>A, <b>702</b>B, <b>702</b>C, <b>702</b>D), and an electromagnet <b>704</b>. The inertial body <b>202</b> includes ferromagnetic magnetic coating, selectively applied in various locations, designated by <b>710</b>A, <b>710</b>B, <b>710</b>C, <b>710</b>D and <b>712</b>A, <b>712</b>B, <b>712</b>C, <b>712</b>D. Position sensors <b>706</b>A, <b>706</b>B, <b>706</b>C, <b>706</b>D and <b>708</b>A, <b>708</b>B, <b>708</b>C, <b>708</b>D, corresponding to the ferromagnetic coatings <b>710</b>A, <b>710</b>B, <b>710</b>C, <b>710</b>D and <b>712</b>A, <b>712</b>B, <b>712</b>C, <b>712</b>D, are used to measure position of the inertial body <b>202</b>. The position sensors <b>706</b>A, <b>706</b>B, <b>706</b>C, <b>706</b>D and <b>708</b>A, <b>708</b>B, <b>708</b>C, <b>708</b>D can be, for example, Hall sensors or inductive sensors.</p>

To reduce the influence of the interfering forces on the output signal z(t) and on the error signal x(t), the transfer function K<sub>INTERF</sub>(S) should be minimized. To ensure that the output signal z(t) reflects the applied acceleration f<sub>APPLIED</sub>(t) most accurately, K<sub>APPLIED</sub>(S) should be as close to 1 as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">Such transfer functions K<sub>INTERF</sub>(S) and K<sub>APPLIED</sub>(S) can be achieved by varying the parameters of the controller <b>606</b>, in other words, by changing the transfer function W<sub>C</sub>(s) of the controller <b>606</b>, i.e., changing parameters of the various elements of the controller <b>606</b>. It follows from equations (2) and (3) that as W<sub>C</sub>(s) increases, the transfer function K<sub>INTERF</sub>(s) will decrease, asymptotically approaching zero, while the transfer function K<sub>APPLIED</sub>(s) will asymptotically approach 1.

<p id="p-0073" num="0073">Equation (8) means that the transfer function of the error due to both the applied force and the interfering force is zero for all values. If equation 8 is substituted into equations (2) and (5), it follows that the Z(s) is equal to the Laplace transform of the applied force, or Z(s)=F<sub>APPLIED</sub>(s), and the contribution of the error to the useful signal is zero, or X(s)=0, which corresponds to an ideal system with zero error. In other words, in such a system, the output signal z(t) will be determined solely by the applied force f<sub>APPLIED</sub>(t) (in this case, due to inertia of the inertial body <b>202</b>), and will not depend on the imperfections, noise, magnetic fluid instabilities and other non-idealities of the sensor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">In practice, achieving infinitely large values for such coefficients is impossible, therefore, there will be some error present, however, such error will be considerably less than a corresponding error in a sensor without active suspension. Thus, the use of active suspension permits improving stability of sensor parameters and reducing the effect of sensor non-linearities.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0078">An advantage of using active suspension is that frequency response and dynamic range of the sensor <b>202</b> is significantly improved. This is due to the fact that the magnetic flux lines within the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> are only minimally disturbed. Since the actual movement of the inertial body <b>202</b> is minimal (compared to the movement of the inertial body <b>202</b> without active suspension), the frequency response of the sensor <b>102</b> improves. Also, the likelihood of the magnetic flux lines becoming “jumbled up” due to inertial body <b>202</b> motion is reduced, since the dipoles in the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> do not lose their orientation due to the movement of the inertial body <b>202</b>, but are only shifted slightly, and then shift back into their normal position. In other words, the distribution of the magnetic flux lines within the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> does not change substantially. Only the magnetic flux density increases or decreases, under active feedback control.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">Consequently, the stability of the sensor <b>102</b> is improved, because the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is disturbed only minimally, and the distribution of magnetic flux lines within the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is forced to stay relatively constant. Note that a designer needs to be concerned with the maximum amount of magnetic flux per unit area that a given material (in this case, the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>) can carry. This also serves as one of the limits on the maximum acceleration that the sensor <b>102</b> can measure. It should also be noted that once the magnetic flux density in the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> reaches saturation (when active suspension is used), and if the acceleration experienced by the sensor <b>102</b> is high enough that the inertial body <b>202</b> cannot be maintained in position, there is still the possibility of the sensor <b>102</b> functioning, even though the inertial body <b>202</b> disturbs the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> (in other words, partly defaulting to the case of inactive suspension). However, this obviously has limits, since at some (high enough) acceleration, the inertial body <b>202</b> will simply hit the inside wall of the housing <b>104</b> or one of the drive magnet assemblies <b>106</b>. Nonetheless, as noted above, the stability of the sensor <b>102</b> is improved, since the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is left essentially undisturbed over a much wider range of accelerations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Another advantage of active suspension is that because the inertial body <b>202</b> stays in the center of the housing <b>104</b>, the effects of linear acceleration and angular acceleration on the inertial body <b>202</b> are independent of each other, allowing for more accurate measurement of both quantities. In other words, if the inertial body <b>202</b> (in the absence of active suspension) is displaced from the geometric center of the housing <b>104</b> and, in addition, is subject to angular acceleration, Coriolis forces act on the inertial body <b>202</b>. The Coriolis forces are perceived as linear acceleration. This introduces cross-dependence of the linear and angular accelerations on each other, which is undesirable. Active suspension addresses this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">The dynamic range is improved because the amount of magnetic force normally required to maintain the inertial body <b>202</b> at the center of the housing <b>104</b> is less than it otherwise would be. It will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant art that if no active suspension were used, it is necessary to prevent the inertial body <b>202</b> from striking the housing <b>104</b> wall, at a linear acceleration up to some specified value. With active suspension, the amount of magnetic force normally generated by the drive magnets <b>302</b> (whether permanent or electromagnets or both), when no acceleration is experienced needs to be less.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">Active suspension can also be used to reduce or eliminate any environmental effects due to stray magnetic fields, provided the stray magnetic fields are either known or measured in real time. Additionally, the sensor <b>102</b> can be shielded and/or the housing <b>104</b> can be coated with a ferromagnetic coating on the outside, to address such environmental effects.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">Active suspension allows for a much greater interchangeability of the sensors between various applications. For example, a sensor without active suspension, designed for use by a human, may only need to withstand up to 2 g of acceleration. On the other hand, a sensor designed for use on aircraft, or for some military applications, may need to be able to withstand an acceleration up to 50 g. With active suspension, the same basic sensor design can be used across a much wider spectrum of applications. It should be noted that such a change of application requires only a change in the control electronics, and can be accomplished, for example, using software.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">The sensor <b>102</b> essentially acts as a low-pass filter for vibration. This is due primarily to the damping effect of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> in which the inertial body <b>202</b> is immersed, and due to the interaction between the inertial body <b>202</b>, the magnetic flux lines within the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, and the drive magnets <b>302</b>. The exact frequency response depends heavily on the design details and the geometry of the sensor <b>102</b> itself. Also, the frequency response depends on the particular fluid used as the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, the magnetic flux densities in the fluid, the density of the dipoles in the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, whether or not active suspension is used, the weight and geometry of the inertial body <b>202</b>, etc. In some applications, it may be desirable to filter out high frequencies. Also, the less the inertial body <b>202</b> needs to move for a given applied acceleration, the higher the bandwidth. In other words, a sensor can be configured to measure high frequency components of linear and/or angular acceleration for certain applications.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">For example, in automotive applications, it may be desirable to reject (i.e., filter out) engine vibrations of a car, and only measure actual changes in the car's linear and/or angular acceleration. In other applications, measurement of high frequency components of linear and/or angular acceleration may be necessary, and a designer will readily appreciate that the sensor's form factor needs to be matched to the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">The sensor <b>102</b> can use either electromagnets or permanent magnets, as the drive magnets <b>302</b>, or a combination of the two. The use of permanent magnets as drive magnets <b>302</b> can substantially reduce the power consumption. For example, the amount of current consumed by electrical magnets can be in the tens of milliamps (although the number is heavily dependent on the geometric form factor, the mass of the inertial body <b>202</b>, the size of the housing <b>104</b>, and numerous other parameters, and may be much less in some implementations). With the use of permanent magnets, the amount of current drawn by the sensor <b>102</b> is minimal, and is primarily due to the control electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">However, it should be noted that with the use of only permanent magnets, active suspension is relatively difficult to achieve, since permanent magnets do not permit for feedback control of the inertial body <b>202</b>. One solution to this can be the use of a combination of two magnets for use as a drive magnet <b>302</b>, a permanent magnet, and an electromagnet. The permanent magnet is used to maintain the position of the inertial body <b>202</b> in the absence of external input, and the electromagnet is used for active suspension. In other words, the magnetic force acting on the inertial body <b>202</b> is a combination of magnetic forces generated by the permanent magnet and by the electromagnet.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">In the case of using a combination of a permanent magnet and an electromagnet as the drive magnet <b>302</b>, the ratio of magnetic force due to each of the magnets may be, for example, 80/20 or 70/30 (permanent/electromagnet). In other words, in this case, the inertial body <b>202</b> is suspended primarily by the force of the permanent magnet, with the electromagnet providing only auxiliary force when turned on. In other cases, a reverse ratio, e.g., 20/80 or 30/70, may be used. Note that this ensures that even with the electromagnets turned off, and the housing <b>104</b> being only partially filled with the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> will remain near the magnets, even when the sensor <b>102</b> is completely turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">Thus, the advantages of using a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets as the drive magnets are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">The amount of current used, particularly during “passive” periods, is reduced. It is possible to reduce the amount of required current if the sensor is only used during brief periods of time. During those brief periods, the electromagnets are turned on and then shut them off when the measurement is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Using the active control system and the electromagnets, it is possible to regulate the suspension characteristics of the inertial body <b>202</b> dynamically and control any instabilities of the inertial body <b>202</b> suspension that may arise due to time-dependence of the properties of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> and the drive magnets <b>302</b>. It is also possible to stabilize the properties of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> by intensively mixing and agitating it (“stirring it”), to force a movement of the inertial body <b>202</b>. This can be either done automatically (periodically, or, for example, when no acceleration has been detected for some long period of time), or in response to a user command.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">The use of a permanent magnet allows a reduction in magneto-diffusive properties of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, and therefore, a corresponding effect on the suspension of the inertial body <b>202</b>. The use of a permanent magnet allows the realization of the partial filling of the housing <b>104</b> with the fluid, which in turn permits better dynamic characteristics of the sensor and greater stability of the inertial body <b>102</b> suspension due to reduction in a volume of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> that is not used in the actual suspension of the inertial body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">Selection of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> can be a consideration. Generally, it may be desirable for the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> to have the following characteristics: minimum viscosity, maximum flux density before saturation, uniform size of the dipoles, no impurities, stability of its properties over time, stability of its properties over as wide a range of temperatures as possible, non-corrosivity, low coefficient of expansion, and, for applications where optical sensing of the movement of the inertial body <b>202</b> is used, optical transparency. As will be appreciated, many of these properties are difficult to achieve in combination. Therefore, the designer needs to carefully select the appropriate magnetic fluid <b>204</b> depending on the particular application and the desired sensor performance.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">One example of the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is kerosene with suspended iron oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) particles. The magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is therefore a colloidal suspension. Typical diameter of the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>particles is on the order of 10-20 nanometers (or smaller). The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>particles are generally spherical in shape, and act as the magnetic dipoles when the magnetic field is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">More generally, the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> can use other ferromagnetic metals, such as cobalt, gadolinium, nickel, dysprosium and iron, their oxides, e.g., Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, FeO<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as well as such magnetic compounds as manganese zinc ferrite (Zn<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), cobalt ferrites, or other ferromagnetic alloys, oxides and ferrites. Also, water or oil can be used as the base liquid, in addition to kerosene.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">In another embodiment, the magnetic fluid <b>204</b> may be a two-phase system that possesses both flowability and high sensitivity to an applied magnetic field. The particle size of the solid phase of the mixture in one embodiment may be on the order of 1×10<sup>−9 </sup>meters, up to a few tens of nanometers. One type of suitable magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is a low viscosity dispersion of magnetite or loadstone in kerosene, having a density between about 1.1 and about 1.5 grams/cubic centimeter. The kerosene dispersion has an effective viscosity between about 0.005 and about 0.1 PAs and has a magnetizability under a 250 kA/m magnetic field between about 30 and about 50 kA/m. Another suitable magnetic fluid <b>204</b> is a low viscosity dispersion of magnetite in liquid organic silicone having a density between about 1.1 and about 1.5 grams/cubic centimeter. The silicon dispersion has an effective viscosity below about 0.7 PAs and has a magnetizability under a 250 kA/m magnetic field of about 25 kA/m. Further, a magnetoreactic suspension of dispersed ferromagnetic matter in liquid organic silicone may serve as a suitable magnetic fluid <b>204</b>. The magnetoreactic suspension has a density between about 3.4 and about 4.0 grams/cubic centimeters, a friction factor of about 0.1 to about 0.2, and a wear rate between about 2×10<sup>−7 </sup>and about 8×10<sup>−7</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">When a magnetic field is applied to the magnetic fluid <b>204</b>, behaves somewhat as an elastic solid body, which resists deformation when the inertial body <b>202</b> “pushes” against it. In other words, it behaves somewhat in a manner of an object with elastic deformation, with a quasi-crystalline structure. This effect may need to be taken into account in some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">The present invention has numerous applications. For example, it is applicable to man-machine interfaces that require measurement of motion. It is applicable to active devices that respond to sudden acceleration/deceleration. It is applicable to measurement devices that monitor/adjust constant speed motion, and to monitoring systems that measure and control vibrations in linear or rotational motion. It is applicable to exact positioning for law-enforcement authorities and rescue services personnel, precise positioning and orientation for medical services and emergency vehicles. It is applicable to precise personal navigation tools for travelers. It is applicable to gaming (controllers, manipulators, Virtual Reality). It is applicable to sports, such as training programs, team games and individual games. It is applicable to the entertainment field, such as motion capture. It is applicable to computer input devices (e.g., 3-dimensional computer mice), and 3D CAD Measurement Devices.</p>

Another application involves video devices, such as video cameras, cell phones with video capture, etc. Jitter is a common problem in such devices. To counteract the jitter, it is necessary to know what exactly the jitter is at any given moment. The addition of a sensor of the present invention to such video devices allows the video device to know what is being done to it, so that it can electronically compensate for the jitter. In yet another application, devices that have video display screens can maintain a vertical orientation of the display, even while the display screen itself is being rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Industrial products applications include automotive airbag activators, vibration sensors, equipment stabilization platforms, seismic sensors (e.g. mining, petroleum), motion capture systems, navigation systems (e.g. dead reckoning in lieu of GPS), and asset/location tracking systems (e.g. cell phone e911 mandate). Seismic applications also include determining a direction of seismic movement. Medical applications include patient monitoring systems, and ergonomic &amp; kinesthetic data acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">Military applications include robotic vehicles (e.g. DARPA Robotic Vehicle Challenge), Predator/Drone remote control, Intelligent Battlefield (e.g. friend-or-foe tracking systems), and ordinance ballistic simulation. It is also applicable to precise positioning of soldiers and machinery in the field and in the air, coordination and guidance of missiles and projectiles (including cases where the GPS signal is either intermittent, unreliable or not available), precise positioning of vehicles, airplanes, helicopters, marine and river transports.</p>
