<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A volume circuit contains resistive ladder circuits, from which a desired fractional voltage output (Vs) is extracted and supplied to an amplifier to provide an output voltage (Vout). The resistive ladder circuits comprise multiple lines of series resistances, wherein each line contains a resistance portion ‘nR’ (where ‘n’ denotes a division index, and ‘R’ denotes an element resistance) that is connected in parallel with a next line, so that an overall resistance of following lines is ‘(n−1)×n’ times larger than the element resistance.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to volume circuits that use resistive ladder circuits for adjustments of audio signals in volume levels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the fields of audio devices and technologies, electronic volume circuits for fabricating electronic circuits are conventionally used for adjustments of volumes in audio signals. Japanese patent application No. 2000-28152 (i.e., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-217660; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/773,646) disclosed an example of an electronic volume circuit that is driven by a single power source and whose components are fabricated together as LSI circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the aforementioned electronic volume circuit, the gain (or attenuation) of an input signal is controlled by selecting a tap (or a voltage division point) from series resistance. In particular, when the gain is greatly narrowed down, resistance division points should be extremely reduced in resolutions when selected. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately and sufficiently narrow down the gain of an input signal in a conventional electronic volume circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide a volume circuit having a high resolution in controlling and narrowing down the gain of an input signal by introducing various improvements in circuit configurations. That is, the volume circuit uses a resistive voltage divider circuit, which can provide a desired tap voltage in a high resolution. In addition, a resistive current control circuit coupled with the resistive voltage divider circuit is designed to eliminate unwanted influences on the output line resistance of the resistive voltage divider circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect of the invention, a volume circuit comprises resistive ladder circuits (or resistive networks) and a switch circuit. The resistive ladder circuits provide parallel arrangements of lines of series resistances, which are arranged between terminals IN and OUT, wherein each line has a resistive element realizing a resistance that is ‘n’ (where ‘n’ is an integer not less than ‘2’) times larger than an element resistance ‘R’. Herein, one line having the resistance ‘nR’ is connected in parallel with another line having series resistance that is ‘(n−1)×n’ times greater than the element resistance ‘R’, so that the overall resistance of the following lines in view of one line having the resistance ‘nR’ is equal to ‘(n−1)×nR’. The switch circuit operates to extract a ‘desired’ fraction of the overall voltage applied to the resistive ladder circuits via a desired tap selected from among taps that are linearly arranged with respect to the resistive ladder circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, each line contains a first resistive element that is not at all connected in parallel with a next line, and a second resistive element that is connected in parallel with a certain resistive element of the next line. Various taps are arranged along the first resistive element of each line, so that numerous taps are linearly arranged along different lines of resistive ladder circuits. Therefore, the switch circuit selects a desired tap from among these taps so as to extract a desired fraction of the overall voltage applied to the resistive ladder circuits as a fractional voltage output. In addition, the second resistive element of each line is connected in parallel with a part of the next line in connection with the ‘common’ terminal OUT. As described above, numerous resistive elements are connected in series and parallel with each other within the resistive ladder circuits, wherein each of them is actualized by various units of the element resistance ‘R’.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An amplifier is used to amplify a fractional voltage output that is extracted from the resistive ladder circuits by the switch circuit. All the aforementioned components (i.e., the resistive elements, switch circuit, and amplifier) are fabricated together on the semiconductor substrate or board.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a second aspect of the invention, a volume circuit comprises combinations of resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers. That is, the first unit of resistive ladder circuits are actualized by multiple lines of series resistances arranged between terminals IN and OUT, wherein each line is connected in parallel with a part of the next line in connection with the ‘common’ terminal OUT. The fractional voltage output extracted from the resistive ladder circuits is supplied to the amplifier, which in turn provides an amplified output to the terminal OUT. In addition, an input terminal of a secondary amplifier is connected to the terminal OUT, and the second unit of resistive ladder circuits is inserted between the terminal OUT and the output terminal of the secondary amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second unit of resistive ladder circuits is actualized by multiple lines of resistive elements, wherein all or a part of resistive elements of one line is connected in parallel with the next line in connection with the ‘common’ terminal OUT. Specifically, the second unit of resistive ladder circuits provides substantially the symmetrical circuit configuration compared with the first unit of resistive ladder circuits with respect to the terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the resistive ladder circuits, each line has a resistance that is ‘n’ times larger than the element resistance ‘R’ and is connected in parallel with the next line. The total resistance of the following line(s) in view of one line having the resistance ‘nR’ is ‘(n−1)×n’ times greater than the element resistance ‘R’. All the aforementioned components (i.e., the resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers) are fabricated together on the semiconductor substrate or board.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">This invention will be described in further detail by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the overall configuration of an electronic volume circuit in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention. The volume circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> contains an LSI circuit ‘B1’ (encompassed by dotted lines), which provides a voltage divider realized by resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>, a switch circuit SW, an inversion-type operation amplifier A<b>1</b> that operates by a single source voltage +Vp<b>1</b>, a series of resistors R<b>31</b>, R<b>32</b>, and R<b>33</b> that are connected in series with a constant voltage source in order to gain a reference potential, and a series of resistors R<b>34</b> and R<b>35</b> that are used to output signals.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The LSI circuit B<b>1</b> has two input terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>, and four output terminals T<b>3</b> to T<b>6</b>. A capacitor C<b>1</b> for cutting out dc current flowing therethrough is connected to the input terminal T<b>1</b>; and a capacitor C<b>2</b> for stabilizing the input of the LSI circuit B<b>1</b> is connected to the input terminal T<b>2</b>. Hence, an input signal source Si is connected between the input terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> of the LSI circuit B<b>1</b> via the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, wherein it is grounded with one terminal of the capacitor C<b>2</b> (see the earth ‘E1’). A differential operational amplifier A<b>3</b> that operates by bidirectional source voltages +Vp<b>2</b> and −Vp<b>2</b> is arranged externally of the LSI circuit B<b>1</b>, wherein the inverting input (−) terminal is connected to the output terminal T<b>4</b>, and the noninverting input (+) terminal is connected to the output terminal T<b>5</b>. In addition, a load RL is connected between the output terminal of the differential operational amplifier A<b>3</b> and the output terminal T<b>6</b>, wherein the output terminal T<b>6</b> is grounded (see the earth ‘E2’).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The input signal source Si provides an input signal voltage Vi (corresponding to ac signal components only), which is applied between the input terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> of the LSI circuit B<b>1</b> via the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. In the LSI circuit B<b>1</b>, one terminal IN of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> is connected to the input terminal T<b>1</b>, and the other terminal OUT is connected with the output terminal of the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an equivalent circuit (i.e., series resistance) of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>. Actually, the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> comprise multiple lines of series resistances between the terminals IN and OUT. The switch circuit SW selects one of numerous taps (or voltage division points) that are linearly arranged along the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the relationships between the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> and the switch circuit SW, and it shows an equivalent circuit (i.e., series resistance) of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>. The resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> have numerous taps, the number of which is denoted by ‘M’. The switch circuit SW contains numerous switching elements ‘Sm’ (where ‘m’ denotes the tap or switch number, and m=1, 2, 3, . . . , M−1, M), which are inserted between the taps and the line used for the extraction of a fractional voltage output ‘s’. The switch circuit SW also has a decoder D for controlling the switching elements Sm respectively. Volume control data Sv given from the external circuit (not shown) are supplied to control terminals of the decoder D. That is, a specific switching element Sm is turned on in response to the value ‘m’ of the volume control data Sv, so that the voltage of the tap corresponding to the specific switching element Sm is output as the fractional voltage output ‘s’.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fractional voltage output ‘s’ that is provided from the tap selected by the switch circuit SW is supplied to the inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>. The resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> operate in such a way that a specific potential Vs corresponding to the fractional voltage output s is set to a value ranging between potentials Vin and Vout at the terminals IN and OUT when the specific switching element Sm is turned on in response to the volume control data Sv. Herein, a specific division ratio ‘ks’ for ‘Vs−Vout’ (i.e., a voltage difference measured between the fractional voltage output s and the terminal OUT) against ‘Vin−Vout’ (i.e., a voltage difference measured between the terminals IN and OUT) is given by the following equation (1).</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0066">In general, a sheet resistance ranging from several ohms to several hundreds ohms can be precisely obtained by using the polysilicon or polyside for the LSI circuit. However, it may be unrealistic to form the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> using serial connections of resistors.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">Next, the principle of the formation of a circuit configuration of a resistive ladder circuit will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. This invention employs resistive ladder circuits using parallel connections of resistances, thus realizing fine divisions of resistances for use in fine adjustment of the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">For convenience' sake, the same symbol ‘R’ is used to designate the resistance of an element resistor; and ‘n’ designates a division index that is a natural number not less than ‘2’. Hence, ‘nR’ denotes a resistance that is ‘n’ times larger than the resistance ‘R’ of the element resistor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a parallel circuit in which a resistance ‘nR’ is connected in parallel with series resistances realized by ‘n−1’ series of the resistance ‘nR’ (hereinafter, simply referred to as resistance series ‘(n−1)×nR’). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an equivalent circuit of the parallel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, which is a simple resistance circuit having a resistance ‘(n−1)R’.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">In other words, the comprehensive resistance (n−1)R that is assumed to be connected between terminals IN and OUT shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> can be expanded in the form of a parallel circuit consisting of the resistance nR and the series resistances ‘(n−1)×nR’ between terminals IN and OUT shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Due to such expansion of the circuit configuration, it is possible to realize the comprehensive resistance (n−1)R while providing ‘n’ fine divisions of the overall voltage by the series resistances (n−1)×nR between the terminals IN and OUT. That is, it is possible to provide ‘n’ times smaller voltages compared with the overall voltage of the simple resistance (n−1)R shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. It is possible to provide further fine divisions of resistances by further dividing resistances with respect to an arbitrary number (&lt;n) of series resistances ‘(n−1)R’ arranged in the side of the terminal OUT within the series resistances (n−1)×nR, wherein a certain number of resistances remain without being further divided in the side of the terminal IN. By repeatedly performing the aforementioned resistance dividing operations a certain number of times, the resistive ladder circuits can be further expanded in a complex circuit configuration, which may provide further smaller divisions of voltages in proximity to the terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Suppose that the division index n is set to ‘3’ while the comprehensive resistance is set to ‘2R’, so that an original resistance circuit whose resistance is ‘2R’ is subjected to expansion. The original resistance circuit is expanded by the aforementioned resistance dividing operation to produce a resistive ladder circuit in which a series of two resistances ‘3R’ (simply referred to as a series resistance ‘6R’) are connected in parallel with a resistance ‘3R’. Using the series resistance 6R, it is possible to provide three times smaller divisions of voltages compared with the overall voltage of the original resistance circuit having the resistance 2R. In the above, it is possible to provide a series of three resistances ‘2R’, which are substituted for the series of two resistances ‘3R’ in the resistive ladder circuit. In this case, two resistances 2R remain in the side of the terminal IN, while a resistance dividing operation is further performed with respect to one resistance 2R arranged in the side of the terminal OUT. By repeatedly performing this operation a certain number of times, it is possible to further expand the resistive ladder circuit in a complex circuit configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">Resistive ladder circuits are repeatedly expanded to ones, which will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Herein, the division index n is set to ‘4’, and an original resistance circuit having a resistance ‘3R’ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is subjected to expansion. That is, a first resistance dividing operation is performed to produce a parallel circuit in which a series of three resistances ‘4R’ (namely, a series resistance ‘12R’) are connected in parallel with a resistance ‘3R’, wherein the overall resistance of the parallel circuit is set to ‘3R’. The aforementioned series resistance 12R can be modified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, wherein a resistance ‘6R’ arranged in the side of the terminal IN is connected in series with two resistances ‘3R’ arranged in the side of the terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the resistance 6R remains without being expanded while a second resistance dividing operation is performed with respect to the two resistances 3R respectively. Thus, it is possible to produce a resistive ladder circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, wherein a resistance 3R is expanded in the form of a parallel circuit consisting of a resistance ‘4R’ and a resistance ‘12R’, while the other is expanded in the form of a parallel circuit in which a resistance ‘4R’ is connected in parallel with a series resistance consisting of a resistance ‘6R’ and two resistances ‘3R’. Then, a third resistance dividing operation is performed with respect to the two resistances 3R arranged in the side of the terminal OUT. Thus, it is possible to produce a ‘complex’ resistive ladder circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. By performing the aforementioned resistance dividing operation a certain number of times, it is possible to finally produce a ‘further complex’ resistive ladder circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In such a resistive ladder circuit, it is possible to use a relatively large value of resistance (which may range from one-hundred and several tens of ohms to several hundreds ohms) as each of resistances formed between adjoining taps. Therefore, it is possible to provide fine divisions of the volume gain with a sufficiently high precision.</p>

That is, it is possible to set the relationship of ‘i<b>2</b>=i<b>1</b>’.

<p id="p-0083" num="0095">In other words, the current i<b>1</b> flowing from the input terminal T<b>1</b> is forced to match with the current i<b>2</b> that may flow towards the output terminal of the operational amplifier A<b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to perform feed-forward current controls in such a way that most of the current flowing into the input terminal T<b>1</b> is substantially absorbed by the operational amplifier A<b>2</b>. This prevents unwanted currents from flowing into the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>; therefore, it is possible to realize high-precision volume level controls by using the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0096">Next, a description will be given with respect to wiring resistance cancellation functions of the LSI circuit B<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Suppose that the aforementioned resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> provide a fractional voltage output s that is specifically used for volume level controls. It may be understood from the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that relatively long lines should be wired between output terminals (t<b>1</b>-t<b>12</b>) of respective lines of resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> and the terminal OUT. This causes wiring resistances Rm that may not be negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0097">Next, a description will be given with respect to influences of wiring resistances Rm in the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) providing the fractional voltage output s. Herein, it is possible to provide a solution as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> in which the output terminal t<b>1</b> of the first line of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> is connected to the output terminal of the operational amplifier (A<b>2</b>) via a current absorption control resistance R<b>2</b>′. However, this solution may cause a problem in that potential differences occur between adjoining output terminals (i.e., t<b>1</b>-t<b>2</b>, t<b>2</b>-t<b>3</b>, t<b>3</b>-t<b>4</b>, . . . ) due to wiring resistances Rm therebetween. Potential differences may badly influence the gain of the operational amplifier A<b>1</b>. When the wiring resistance Rm is relatively large, the electronic volume circuit may be incapable of accurately limiting the gain thereof down to the ‘desired’ minimal gain (e.g., −143 dB).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0098">The second embodiment is characterized by reconstructing the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, wherein the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> can provide current control functions as well as wiring resistance cancellation functions. That is, the output terminals t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, . . . of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> that may provide the fractional voltage output s are respectively connected with cancellation resistors Rx, which are followed by other cancellation resistors Ry. These resistors Rx and Ry are adequately set in resistances to provide the same potential with respect to each of the output terminals t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, . . . of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>. The circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is partially modified using equivalent circuits compared with the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> in such a way that each parallel circuit consisting of resistances 4R and 12R is replaced by a resistance 3R.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0099">The details of the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> will be described under the condition where n=4. Due to the current control (or absorption) function of the operational amplifier A<b>2</b>, the current i<b>1</b> input from the input terminal T<b>1</b> is forced to match with the current i<b>2</b> that flows into the output terminal of the operational amplifier A<b>2</b>, wherein i<b>1</b>=i<b>2</b>. When each of the output terminals t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, . . . is set to the same potential, no current may flow through the wiring resistance Rm, which is established between adjoining terminals (i.e., t<b>1</b>-t<b>2</b>, t<b>2</b>-t<b>3</b>, t<b>3</b>-t<b>4</b>, . . . ). Hence, terminal currents ia<b>1</b>, ia<b>2</b>, ia<b>3</b>, . . . that flow through the output terminals t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, . . . directly flow through the cancellation resistors Rx, which are connected to the output terminals t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, t<b>3</b>, with respect to the respective lines of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0100">With respect to the second line, a series of resistances 6R and <b>9</b>R (i.e., series resistance ‘9R’ in total) derive from a connection point A in the first line. With respect to the third line, a series of resistances 6R and 3R (i.e., series resistance ‘9R’ in total) derive from a connection point B in the second line. Similarly, series resistance ‘9R’ in the fourth line (not shown) derives from a connection point E in the third line. That is, each of following lines contains series resistance ‘9R’ that derives from each of preceding lines. Shunt currents ib<b>1</b>, ib<b>2</b>, ib<b>3</b>, . . . are forced to flow through the series resistances ‘9R’ in the respective lines of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>, wherein they are identical to currents that flow through the cancellation resistors Ry in the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b>. Ratios between terminal currents and shunt currents, i.e., ia<b>1</b>/ib<b>1</b>, ia<b>2</b>/ib<b>2</b>, ia<b>3</b>/ib<b>3</b>, . . . , are all equal to ‘3’. Generally speaking, the ratio between the terminal current and shunt current is expressed as ‘n−1’ (where ‘n’ denotes the division index).</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of the overall layout of an LSI circuit representing the electronic volume circuit of the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example of the overall configuration of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> that are connected in series in accordance with the second embodiment. Herein, the configuration of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> is designed under the same conditions for use in the design of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0111">Next, the overall operation of the electronic volume circuit of the second embodiment will be briefly described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. That is, the input signal voltage Vi input to the terminal IN is converted to the voltage Vout having an amplitude that substantially matches the fractional voltage output s extracted from the prescribed tap of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> under the operation of the first amplifier (or attenuator) A<b>1</b>, so that the voltage Vout is output to the terminal OUT. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a resistance 4R is arranged in each of second to eleventh lines of resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> that lie between the terminals IN and OUT (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Herein, the resistance 4R in one line is connected in parallel with the resistance 12R in the next line. The equivalent resistance viewed from both ends of the resistance 4R in each line is made equal to 3R, which is the original resistance of the series circuit. Herein, resistance values are adjusted in such a way that they become larger as the number of line becomes larger. Hence, it is possible to provide the ‘desired’ fractional voltage output with a high resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0112">The secondary resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> are introduced to control the second amplifier A<b>2</b> that operates to absorb the current flowing into the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>, wherein the secondary resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> are constituted symmetrically with the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>. This provides the same potential with respect to all the output terminals t<b>1</b> to t<b>12</b> of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>; hence, it is possible to eliminate unwanted influences due to wiring resistances Rm, which are formed between adjoining output terminals within the output terminals t<b>1</b> to t<b>12</b>. That is, the second embodiment introduces the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> for use in the extraction of the fractional voltage output, and the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> for use in current controls. Thus, it is possible to provide an electronic volume circuit having a high resolution in fine adjustments of the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0113">As described heretofore, this invention provides a variety of effects and technical features, which will be described below.
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0114">(1) The volume circuit of this invention is designed such that the fractional voltage output Vs is extracted from the prescribed tap of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> by the switch circuit SW. The resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> are constituted by multiple lines of series resistances, wherein numerous element resistors are connected in series and in parallel between the terminals IN and OUT. Each line is connected in parallel with a series resistance that is ‘n’ times larger than the element resistance ‘R’, so that the comprehensive overall resistance of the following lines is increased ‘(n−1)×n’ times larger than the element resistance ‘R’.</li>
    <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0115">(2) The total equivalent resistance in view of the resistance ‘nR’ in one line becomes ‘(n−1)’ times larger than the element resistance ‘R’. Therefore, the second line of the resistive ladder circuits arranges taps among series resistances ‘n(n−1)R’ that are ‘n’ times larger than the original overall resistance ‘(n−1)R’. Thus, it is possible to provide ‘desired’ fractional voltage output with a very high precision, which is ‘n’ times greater than that of the first line. In addition, the third line arranges taps with a very high precision (or resolution), which is ‘n’ times greater than that of the second line. That is, this invention can increase the precision (or resolution) in providing the fractional voltage output (or in selecting the prescribed tap) exponentially as the number of lines of resistive ladder circuits becomes large.</li>
    <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0116">(3) The volume circuit of this invention can introduce combinations of resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers, wherein the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> are specifically used for providing the fractional voltage output, and the other resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> are used to control currents flowing in the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b>. The resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> have multiple lines of series resistances between the terminals IN and OUT, wherein one line is partially connected in parallel with the next line in connection with the ‘common’ terminal OUT. The fractional voltage Vs extracted from the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> is input to the first amplifier A<b>1</b>, the output terminal of which is connected to the terminal OUT. The input terminal ‘q’ of the second amplifier A<b>2</b> is connected to the terminal OUT. In addition, the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> are inserted between the terminal OUT and the output terminal ‘r’ of the second amplifier A<b>2</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0117">(4) Due to the provision of the second amplifier A<b>2</b> and the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b>, the current that flows from the terminal IN into the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> is absorbed by the output terminal of the second amplifier A<b>2</b>. In addition, the resistive ladder circuits R<b>2</b> perform current controls in such a way that the output terminals t<b>1</b>-t<b>12</b> of the resistive ladder circuits R<b>1</b> are all set to the same potential, which prevents the current from flowing between wires interconnecting the output terminals t<b>1</b>-t<b>12</b> together. Thus, it is possible to eliminate unwanted influences due to wiring resistances Rm, which emerge between adjoining output terminals.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p-0102" num="0118">As this invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, the present embodiments are therefore illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalents of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims.</p>
