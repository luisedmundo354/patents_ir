<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to the following co-pending and commonly assigned patent application: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/377,105, filed Mar. 16, 2006, entitled “Semiconductor Device with High-K Gate Dielectric,” which application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and more specifically to the gate formation of MOS devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">CMOS has been the basic logic building block in the digital-dominant world for decades. Device dimensions have been continuously shrunk in order to achieve higher performance as well as higher packing density. Technology advancement demands more and more functions to be integrated on a single chip, and thus one MOS design cannot fulfill all requirements in an integrated circuit. For example, in a traditional circuit that employs micron technology or earlier technologies, the operation voltage of the core circuit was typically in a range of about 2.5V to 3.3V. However, as the integrated circuit size continues to shrink, the core operation voltage is lowered. When the deep sub micron technology is employed, the size of a circuit is further reduced to about 0.25, 0.18 or even 0.13 micron, and the operation voltage drops to around 1V. It is expected that the core operation voltage will continue to fall when the integrated circuit size continues to shrink. While the core operation voltage falls, the operation voltage of the I/O circuit often stays at a higher value. As a result, the MOS devices in the I/O circuit and the core circuit are expected to work under different operation voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Scaling of the integrated circuit also causes other problems. In traditional IC processes, gate electrodes are typically formed of polysilicon. One of the reasons for polysilicon's wide use is that the work function of polysilicon gate electrodes can be changed easily by doping with different impurities. However, polysilicon has depletion problems, so metal gate electrodes were introduced, particularly for device formation in core regions, to avoid the poly depletion phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previously discussed issues demand customized manufacturing processes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,776 provides an integrated circuit having a core section and an I/O section. A device in the core section includes a metal gate and a thin oxide gate dielectric, while a device in the I/O section has a polysilicon gate and a thick oxide gate dielectric. U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,761 also discloses an integrated circuit having two regions. In a first region, a device comprises a pure metal gate and an oxide gate dielectric. In a second region, a device comprises a polysilicon gate and an oxide gate dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By using these prior art solutions, one part of a chip can have a device with a reliable, high-yield polysilicon gate, while the other part of the chip can have a high-performance MOS device with a metal gate. These integrated circuits and manufacturing processes, however, have a potential problem. Typically, metal gates are thinner than polysilicon gates to alleviate the difficulties associated with the metal etching process and to improve the gate stack profile control, thus there is a step height between the top surfaces of the metal gates and the polysilicon gates. Additionally, gate dielectrics in the core region are typically thinner than gate dielectrics in the I/O region, further increasing the step height. This step height adds complexity and cost for subsequent manufacturing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the removal of the gate oxide <b>4</b> from the region <b>100</b>. A photo resist <b>8</b> is formed in the region <b>200</b> as a mask. The gate oxide <b>4</b> in the region <b>100</b> is removed, preferably by wet etching using HF containing chemicals at temperatures lower than about 110° C., exposing the surface of substrate <b>2</b>. The photo resist <b>8</b> is then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b>, a metal layer <b>10</b> and a hard mask <b>12</b> are then deposited, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b> preferably has a k value of greater than about 4, more preferably greater than about 8, and even more preferably greater than about 10. The thickness is preferably less than about 150 Å, and more preferably between about 20 Å and about 70 Å. In the preferred embodiment, the high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b> is formed of HfO<sub>2</sub>.

In some embodiments, the high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b> may have a composite structure with more than one layer, and each layer may be formed of any of the previously discussed materials. The methods of forming the high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b> includes commonly used methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The metal layer <b>10</b> preferably has a high work function, more preferably of greater than about 4.8 eV. Preferably, high work function metals such as nickel, rhenium, platinum, ruthenium, etc., metal nitrides such as MoN, TaCN, TiAlN, and metal silicides such as MoSi<sub>2</sub>, HfSi, NiSi, etc., are used. The preferred thickness of the metal layer <b>10</b> is between about 20 Å and about 300 Å. The preferred methods for forming the metal layer <b>10</b> include CVD, PVD, sputter, etc. Appropriate impurities may be doped to adjust the work function. A hard mask <b>12</b>, preferably formed of tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS), is formed over the metal layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A photo resist <b>14</b> is formed in region <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The unprotected hard mask <b>12</b> in regions <b>110</b> and <b>200</b> is removed using the photo resist <b>14</b> as a mask, preferably by wet etching. The photo resist <b>14</b> is then removed. The remaining hard mask <b>12</b>, which protects region <b>120</b>, is used as a mask for subsequent metal removal, and the metal layer <b>10</b> is removed from regions <b>110</b> and <b>200</b>, preferably by wet etching using acids such as acetic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like. Hard mask <b>12</b> in the region <b>120</b> is then removed, and the resulting structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a second metal layer <b>16</b> formed in regions <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. The metal layer <b>16</b> preferably has a work function that is lower than the work function of the metal layer <b>10</b>. More preferably, the metal layer <b>16</b> has a work function of less than about 4.6 eV and may comprise metals such as aluminum, hafnium, tantalum, and titanium, etc. The metal layer <b>16</b> may also comprise metal nitrides such as TaN, TaPN, or metal silicides such as NbSi<sub>2</sub>, tantalum silicide, doped HfSi and NiSi, etc. The preferred thickness of the metal layer <b>16</b> is similar to the preferred thickness of the metal layer <b>10</b>, which is between about 20 Å and about 300 Å. The formation method includes CVD, PVD, sputter, etc. Impurities may be doped to change the work function of the metal layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a photo resist <b>18</b> is formed in region <b>100</b>. The metal layer <b>16</b> in region <b>200</b> is removed, preferably by wet etching using acids such as acetic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like. The high-k dielectric layer <b>9</b> in region <b>200</b> is also removed, preferably using a chlorine-based solvent, exposing the gate oxide layer <b>4</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the photo resist <b>18</b> covers both regions <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. In alternative embodiments, photo resist <b>18</b> only covers region <b>110</b>, so that the metal layer <b>16</b> in regions <b>120</b> and <b>200</b> can be removed by a selective etching that only attacks the metal layer <b>16</b>, not the metal layer <b>10</b>. Photo resist <b>18</b> is then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the formation of a silicon layer <b>20</b>. The silicon layer <b>20</b> preferably comprises polysilicon and has a preferred thickness of less than about 2500 Å, more preferably between about 500 Å and about 2000 Å, and even more preferably about 1000 Å. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the previously formed layers are patterned to form gate stacks <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, and <b>22</b>C in regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>200</b>, respectively. In the preferred embodiment, the gate stacks <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, and <b>22</b>C are patterned and etched using ion bombardment combined with chemical reaction. The silicon gate <b>20</b>C may be doped to have different work functions depending on whether a pMOS device or an nMOS device is to be formed. It may also be doped to have a mid-gap work function, which is between about 4.6 eV and about 4.8 eV, regardless of the type of device to be formed. In alternative embodiments, layer <b>20</b> comprises amorphous silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Source/drain regions <b>30</b>, inter-layer dielectric <b>32</b> and contact plugs <b>34</b> are then formed for each device in the regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the resulting structure. The formation of these components is well known in the art and thus is not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the preferred embodiments, a dual metal scheme, in which different metals are adopted for nMOS devices and pMOS devices in the core region <b>100</b>, is used in order to achieve symmetric and low threshold voltages (V<sub>th</sub>) for both nMOS and pMOS devices. This is particularly beneficial for very small-scale devices such as ultra-thin body MOS devices formed on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) or Fin field-effect transistors (FinFET), where channel implant has less effect on adjusting threshold voltages, and thus the low threshold voltages are preferably achieved by having work functions less than about 4.6 eV for nMOS devices and greater than about 4.8 eV for pMOS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the respective work functions of the gate stacks <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B are preferably tuned by using different combinations of metals and dopants. Typically, for a composite gate having more than one layer of materials, the work function of the gate is influenced mainly by the layer closest to the gate dielectric, and the other layers act as conductors. Therefore, for the nMOS device in region <b>110</b>, the work function of the metal gate electrode <b>16</b>A is preferably lower than 4.6 eV. The work function of the pMOS device in core region <b>120</b> is mainly determined by the work function of the metal gate electrode <b>10</b>B, and thus the metal gate electrode <b>10</b>B preferably has a higher work function, more preferably higher than 4.8 eV. With such a design, the balanced work functions improve the performance of the device in the (core) region <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The requirements for devices in the second region <b>200</b> are different from that of the first region due to different function requirements. For example, the gate oxide <b>4</b>C is typically formed of oxide with a greater thickness, and thus can operate with higher operation voltages. The gate electrode <b>20</b>C is formed of polysilicon or amorphous silicon and is doped to adjust the work function. Mid-gap materials with work functions between about 4.6 eV and about 4.8 eV may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A potential topographic problem arises when a MOS device in the first region <b>100</b> uses a metal gate only and a MOS device in the second region <b>200</b> uses a silicon gate only. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, since the silicon gate electrode <b>20</b>C in the I/O region (region <b>200</b>) is typically significantly thicker than the electrodes of the metal gates <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B, there exist step heights h<b>1</b> and h<b>2</b>, which have typical values of several hundred angstroms or greater, between the top surfaces of the silicon gate electrode <b>20</b>C and metal gates <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B, respectively. These step heights affect the subsequent processes and increase complexity and cost of manufacture. Therefore, it is advantageous to have silicon formed on the metal gates in the first region <b>100</b>. The step heights will be significantly lower because the step heights will be mainly caused by the thickness of the metal gates in the core region instead of by the thickness of the silicon gates, which is significantly greater.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">One skilled in the art will realize that the sequence of process steps described in the preferred embodiments can be altered. For example, the metal layer <b>16</b> can be formed before the formation of the metal layer <b>10</b>, and the high-k gate dielectric layer <b>9</b> can be formed and removed from the second region <b>200</b> before the formation of the gate oxide <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
