<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A communication remote control system allows a user to remotely configure call management functions across various phone networks using a client device. The communication remote control system centrally handles call management for the user's telephones. The communication remote control system may provide a centralized address book, call log, and voicemail. The user can specify various parameters including modes, filters, schedules, and the like, which are stored in the communication remote control system. The communication remote control system routes incoming calls made to the phone networks to the user's delivery device, which may be part of the client device. Incoming calls are routed to a specified telephone number, sent to voicemail, or otherwise disposed of or users can change modes manually or can specify automatic mode selection based on time of date, day of week, location, and/or other factors.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates generally to remote management of communications such as telephone calls, and more specifically to remote management of communications across multiple telecommunication service providers networks using a wireless device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many people (callees) have a multitude of telephone numbers (TNs) that they give out to potential callers. Typically this set of TNs includes home, office, and cell phone numbers, and are associated with different telecommunication service providers. Each telecommunication service provider has its own set of features that function in isolation with the other service providers. Even if the user has two TNs with the same telecommunication service provider, the set of features for one TN may function in isolation with the other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the caller knows more than one TN for the callee, the caller selects the most likely number to reach the callee and often leaves a voicemail message before trying another number. The caller is burdened with determining the most likely sequence of calls to reach the callee. This often results in one or more voicemail messages (home, office, cell) even if the caller ultimately reaches the callee. This situation slows the process of establishing a connection, increases costs, and reduces the probability of making a live connection, due to the effort and time required of the caller. In addition, multiple voicemail messages are a burden for the callee.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Call management is the selectable re-routing of phone calls from the called address, typically a telephone number, to a delivery device, typically a telephone or voicemail service. Rudimentary call management, in the form of Variable Call Forwarding, is widely available. Existing call management features only apply to calls placed to phone lines within the telecommunication service provider's network. For example, the two leading consumer voice-over-IP (VoIP) telecommunication service providers offer call redirection for calls placed to their telephone numbers. To configure this feature, the user must log on to the telecommunication service provider's website and enter forwarding numbers into the configuration web pages. Some Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems have a selectable forwarding feature that is configured from the PBX station (phone) or from a private corporate Intranet website. Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) typically provide a Variable Call Forwarding feature. To use this feature, the user must be at the location of the phone to be forwarded; the user must take the phone off-hook; and the user must enter an arcane sequence of digits followed by the telephone number of the phone line to which all calls will be forwarded. In all of these cases, the configuration is static. Once the configuration of a system is set up, the system works the same way until it is changed. Changing the configuration is often cumbersome, requiring the keypad entry of arcane numeric codes. To manage multiple phones, the user accesses disparate user interfaces from each of their telecommunication service providers, potentially from multiple physical locations.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some telecommunication features are isolated to a device attached to a telecommunication service provider's network. For example, a caller-ID box is connected to a phone line provided by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC). The caller-ID box can only display, and keep a record of, calls placed to that phone line. Similarly, most modern mobile phones store a log of incoming calls and dialed calls, but the log only applies to calls received and placed by that mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed is a system and method that automatically handles, routes, and manages telephone calls so that callers do not have to guess which number to call to reach a particular individual. What is further needed is a system and method that allows a callee to specify how incoming calls are handled for calls to different telephone numbers for different telecommunication service providers, and that responds dynamically to real-time conditions at the time a call is placed.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides techniques for allowing a callee to specify how incoming calls to multiple communication networks are handled using a central remote management system. The callee sets communication management directives based on activities for various user addresses or telephone numbers, which are stored in a database separate from the communication networks. The directives are retrieved in response to a communication to a user address, and are provided to the communication network associated with the user address for routing the communication.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present invention provides techniques and a system including a wireless device that allows for the remote configuration of a set of call management features working in concert across multiple telephone networks.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Terminology</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For purposes of the description herein, the term “callee” is used to refer to an individual or entity that is being called or that may be called at some point in the future. The term “user” is used interchangeably with “callee.”</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A “caller” is a person who places a call to a user, or attempts to place a call, or potentially could place a call.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A “dialed telephone number (dialed TN)” is a number dialed by a caller. It may or may not be associated with an actual telephone device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A “delivery telephone device” is a device that can be used to receive calls.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A “user profile” is a set of user configuration information specifying call management parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A “mode” is a callee's operational mode, such as “At Home,” “At Work,” etc. As described below, a mode can be selected explicitly by a user or implicitly according to the user's profile.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A “filter” is a defined scheme for identifying a subset of a user's potential callers and to treat calls from them in a distinctive way.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additional terminology is defined herein within the context of the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention is now described more fully with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which several embodiments of the invention are shown. The present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be complete and will fully convey the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For illustrative purposes, the following description sets forth the invention in terms of handling a call that is placed by dialing a telephone number (TN) such as a North American Numbering Plan (NANP) number. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the techniques set forth herein can be used for handling communications that are initiated in other ways. In particular, a caller can specify a callee using any type of caller identifier, whether a dialed TN, a text string, a non-NANP digit sequence, or the like. The term User Address (UA) is used herein to denote any such mechanism for identifying a callee.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following description the term Delivery Telephone Number (Delivery TN) refers to the telephone number (or UA) of the device or system that terminates a call for, or to, a user. Delivery TNs connect to delivery devices such as a telephone, a voicemail platform (traditional or e-mail delivery only), attendant Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, or the like. A Dialed TN (the TN that the caller dialed) may or may not have the same number as one of the callee's Delivery TNs; a call to the Dialed TN may or may not be connected to the device addressed by the identical Delivery TN. Thus, in some cases, a Dialed TN is virtual and is not the address of a physical delivery device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As will be described in more detail below, in one embodiment the present invention manages a callee's set of UAs and the real-time mapping of those UAs to delivery devices. Calls placed to a UA may be routed to one (or more) of the delivery devices corresponding to Delivery TNs. The system uses a combination of modes, filters, caller selection (attendant), busy state, and no-answer state to determine whether and how a call should be routed to an appropriate delivery TN.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention can be implemented in symmetric or asymmetric fashion. A symmetric implementation is one in which all delivery TNs are in the set of dialed TNs; otherwise the implementation is asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Call management systems handle the routing of telephone calls to various TNs of a user. A telephone service provider may route the telephone call directed to it based on user set call management directives or according to directives the provider determines based on user activity. A remote call management system may handle the routing of telephone calls directed to any of a user's service providers, including multiple providers. The remote call management system may store centrally call information and voicemail, and handle the routing of telephone calls directed to a plurality of user TNs. The user may configure the remote call management system using a wireless client device. Architectures for call management systems are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-20</figref>. An architecture for a remote call management system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a block diagram depicting an architecture for implementing the present invention according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Caller <b>101</b> places a call via a local phone switch <b>102</b> such as Central Office (CO), Mobile Switching Center (MSC), or Private Branch Exchange (PBX). The call goes through public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>103</b> to destination switch <b>104</b> such as CO <b>104</b>A, MSC <b>104</b>B, or PBX <b>104</b>C. The present invention may be implemented regardless of the particular type of switches <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> being used at the origin or destination. Destination switch <b>104</b> queries call management module <b>105</b> to determine where to route the call. Module <b>105</b> checks user profile database <b>105</b>A to obtain call management settings for users. In one embodiment, external input <b>120</b> (such as callee location, caller identifiers, and the like) is also used by module <b>105</b> to determine where to route the call.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Module <b>105</b> sends a response to switch <b>104</b> indicating the desired routing for the call. The appropriate delivery device <b>108</b> (including for example home telephone <b>108</b>A, wireless telephone <b>108</b>B, office telephone <b>108</b>C, voicemail platform <b>106</b>, and/or the like), is given the call, and the device handles the call as though it were received directly. Callee <b>109</b> then receives the call via the selected delivery device <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, when voicemail platform <b>106</b> handles a call, it can query module <b>105</b> to determine whether a voicemail message should be delivered as an email attachment <b>110</b> to email reader <b>111</b> for receipt by callee <b>109</b>. In another embodiment, when voicemail platform <b>106</b> handles a call, it can activate an alert (e.g. a flashing light, a tone, or an indicator on a display) on any or all of delivery devices <b>108</b>, according to callee preferences as indicated in module <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, each query from destination switch <b>104</b> includes, for example, the dialed TN and the caller TN (if known). One skilled in the art will recognize that other information may also be included in the query. In one embodiment, in response to receiving a query, module <b>105</b> returns a destination TN which may represent a delivery device <b>108</b> corresponding to the dialed number, or another device <b>108</b>, or voicemail platform <b>106</b>. Voicemail platform <b>106</b> can be in the same network as destination switch <b>104</b>, or it can be accessible over PSTN <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, voicemail platform e-mail delivery query <b>107</b> includes the dialed TN and the caller TN (if known). In response, module <b>105</b> provides a delivery flag (yes or no), and an e-mail address.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present invention can be implemented in connection with any type of telephone system, including home telephones, office telephones, and wireless telephones, regardless of telephone equipment and regardless of telephone service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, there is shown a block diagram depicting one architecture for implementing call management functionality according to the techniques of the present invention. When caller <b>101</b> places a call to callee <b>109</b>, the call is routed to callee <b>109</b> based on rules stored in service database <b>105</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Caller <b>202</b> may call a landline TN or wireless TN of callee <b>109</b>. In the landline case, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates “post-ring” management of the call. Landline phone <b>1420</b> is rung by connected CO switch <b>102</b>A<b>1</b> in LEC <b>1401</b>. When phone <b>1420</b> goes unanswered, the call is forwarded (using a pre-provisioned “Call Forward Busy/No Answer” switch feature) over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>103</b> to Wireless Carrier's Mobile Switch <b>104</b>B where it is then managed. Mobile Switch (MSC) <b>104</b>B sends a query over SS7 network <b>1403</b> through one or more Signaling Transfer Points (STP) <b>1404</b> through signaling gateway <b>1407</b> to Application Processor <b>105</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Application Processor <b>105</b>B queries database <b>105</b>A and returns a reply containing routing information that will be used by Mobile Switch <b>104</b>B to route the call. Possible routing destinations include callee's <b>109</b> wireless phone and carrier's voicemail platform <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some implementations, queries from Mobile Switch <b>104</b>B may pass through the Home Location Register (HLR) <b>1402</b>. In a similar fashion, when caller <b>101</b> places a call to the callee's <b>109</b> wireless phone, rather than callee's wireline phone <b>1420</b>, the call is routed from originating switch <b>102</b>A<b>2</b>, through PSTN <b>103</b> to MSC <b>104</b>B. MSC <b>104</b>B manages these calls “pre-ring,” before the mobile phone is rung. In some cases, caller <b>101</b> is connected to an automated attendant (Interactive Voice Response, or IVR; not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, if callee <b>109</b> shares landline <b>1420</b> with a family member, MSC <b>104</b>B can be instructed to temporarily connect caller <b>101</b> to voicemail platform <b>106</b> in a way that causes voicemail platform <b>106</b> to play prompts under the direction of an Application Processor (not shown) by way of Messaging gateway <b>1408</b>. Calls may also be managed in an Enterprise <b>1413</b>. In this case, PBX <b>1411</b> queries the service for routing information and voicemail <b>1412</b> may be used in the enterprise.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, signaling gateway <b>1407</b>, database <b>105</b>A, application processor <b>105</b>B, and messaging gateway <b>1408</b> communicate with one another via Local Area Network (LAN) <b>1406</b>. Similarly, components of enterprise <b>1413</b> communicate with one another via Local Area Network (LAN) <b>1409</b>. LANs <b>1406</b> and <b>1409</b> communicate with one another using Internet Protocol (IP)<b>1202</b>, and LAN <b>1406</b> communicates with VM <b>106</b> using IP <b>1202</b>. Gateway <b>1410</b> connects LAN <b>1409</b> to PSTN <b>103</b>. STP <b>1404</b> communicates with signaling gateway <b>1407</b> via SS7 <b>1405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, user profile database <b>105</b>A stores the following information in order to specify a callee's call management settings:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0062">Set of dialed TNs (logical or physical)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0063">Set of delivery TNs (addresses to delivery devices)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0064">Set of modes (At work, At home, etc.)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0065">Mapping of dialed TN to delivery TN for each dialed TN and mode combination. This mapping may include the creation and application of filters, which are sets of calling party TNs that control the mapping. Further description appears below.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0066">Authentication of dialed TNs and delivery TNs to confirm they are under the control of the callee. Further description appears below.

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">According to one embodiment of the present invention, call management settings described above are specified by the user via a user interface such as a website, via a cell phone or PDA, or by default initial setup. Configuration may be performed by a third-party using an API. Mode selection can also be made directly or through an API.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">The following is a description of a software-based call management system configurable by the callee to route incoming calls that are originally dialed to any of the callee's managed phone numbers, according to the callee's indicated preferences. For example, the callee can specify that different incoming calls should be routed to any of a number of different delivery devices, based on any combination of factors including, for example, the number the caller dialed, the identity of the caller, the location of the caller, environmental conditions at the callee's location, and real-time callee and/or callee input at the time the call is attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">In one embodiment, the callee specifies such configuration options via a web-based user interface that facilitates communication with call management module <b>105</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> and <b>9</b>-<b>10</b>, there are shown screen shots depicting an example of a web-based front-end that can be used for such call management configuration. One skilled in the art will recognize that these screen shots are merely exemplary, and that many different arrangements and user interface elements can be used without departing from the essential characteristics of the present invention. One skilled in the art will further recognize that the user interface need not be web-based, and that any other type of user interface for accepting callee configuration of the system can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a telephone setup screen <b>200</b>. For purposes of the following description it is assumed that the user interacting with the screens is the callee; however, the user could be another individual who is configuring call management parameters on behalf of a callee.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">The user enters a home phone number in field <b>201</b>A, mobile phone number in field <b>201</b>B, and office phone number in field <b>201</b>C. The user can enter any number of additional phone numbers in field <b>201</b>D, and can specify descriptions for additional phone numbers via pull-down menu <b>202</b>. Other options can also be entered, including:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0072">specifying, via check box <b>203</b>, that callers without caller ID should be blocked; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0073">enabling a VIP list via check box <b>204</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">Callers on the VIP list get special treatment. For example, the system can be configured to allow calls from VIP callers to get through even when normal calls would be routed to voice mail or screening. Calls from numbers (people) in the user's VIP list skip through any “Screen” settings as their calls are considered emergency calls in the context of screening. Such a technique is referred to herein as “filtering”.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">Link <b>205</b> provides access to a VIP list management screen for adding, editing, and deleting names and numbers in the VIP list.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a VIP list management screen <b>600</b> according to one embodiment. List <b>601</b> shows current VIP entries. The user can edit entries by clicking on an Edit link <b>602</b>, or delete entries by clicking on a Delete link <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">After clicking on an Edit link <b>602</b>, the user can specify a name in field <b>604</b>, and one or two telephone numbers in fields <b>605</b>A and <b>605</b>B. Apply button <b>606</b> applies the changes; cancel button <b>607</b> dismisses screen <b>606</b> without applying any changes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user can specify email addresses in fields <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> for call notification emails and for receiving voicemail, respectively. Buttons <b>208</b>, <b>209</b> facilitate navigation to other screens in the call management setup application.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> there are shown call manager setup screens <b>300</b> according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">The user can configure call routing for each mode (activity) the user defines. Modes in this example are “My Default”, “At Work,” “At Home,” and “Commuting”. The user can select which mode to define from activity menu <b>301</b>. In field <b>302</b>, he or she can specify the name for the mode (activity). Popup menus <b>303</b>A, <b>303</b>B, <b>303</b>C allow the user to specify how calls should be handled when they are received at the home number, mobile number, and office number, respectively. In one embodiment, each popup menu <b>303</b> allows the user to select among routing the call to a particular destination device <b>108</b>, to voicemail <b>106</b>, or to screen the call, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">Check box <b>304</b> allows the user to enable a preset schedule for the mode. If check box <b>304</b> is checked, the mode will automatically be activated at the times specified in popup menus <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">Check box <b>306</b> allows the user to select whether text notification should be sent to the mobile phone when a voicemail message is received.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">Check box <b>207</b> allows the user to select whether an email message should be sent when a voicemail message is received.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">Apply button <b>308</b> applies the changes indicated by the user. Delete activity button <b>401</b> deletes the mode (activity) from menu <b>301</b>. Navigation buttons <b>208</b>, <b>209</b> allow the user to navigate to other call setup screens.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">In the example shown, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user has configured the “My Default” activity so that calls to home, mobile, or office are routed to the respective delivery devices.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">In the example shown, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the user has configured the “At Work” activity so that calls to home are sent to voicemail and calls to both mobile and office are sent to the office. This mode is scheduled to be active from 9 am through 5 pm every workday. Check box <b>306</b> has been activated, so that text notification will be sent when voicemail is received.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">In the example shown, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the user has configured the “Commuting” activity so that calls to home are screened to the mobile phone and calls to mobile or office are connected to the mobile phone. A message is played to the caller; “The person you are trying to contact is currently unavailable, if this is an emergency press 1, otherwise press 2 to leave a message.” If the caller presses 1, he or she is connected to the mobile device. If he or she presses 2, he or she is connected to the voicemail platform.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">After setup is complete, the user can view a summary of his or her Call Management settings. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown an example of a call management summary screen <b>700</b> according to one embodiment. A summary <b>701</b> of settings is shown, with Edit buttons <b>702</b> allowing the user to return to a screen for changing settings. The user can select which mode is active by clicking on one of radio buttons <b>703</b>. Apply button <b>704</b> applies the changes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">In one embodiment, the user can select among modes by other means as well. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown an example of a user interface for selecting among modes via a mobile phone handset <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">In one embodiment, the system of the present invention activates different modes depending on any of: explicit selection, time of day (and/or day of week), location of the callee (detected, for example by GPS positioning, or by noting that the user has used a particular phone recently, or by explicit user indication of location). In one embodiment, scheduled modes are automatically active during scheduled times. In one embodiment, scheduling can be turned on or off from the handset or from the website.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">Based on the user-specified configuration options described above, a call routing matrix can be constructed. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, there is shown an example of a call routing matrix <b>1900</b> according to one embodiment. Matrix <b>1900</b> summarizes call handling preferences according to callee mode and caller identity. Each row in matrix <b>1900</b> represents a mode, and each column represents a filter option (a particular caller or caller group). Current mode <b>1904</b> is also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">In the example shown, matrix <b>1900</b> provides input fields for specifying additional call routing configuration options. For example, pull-down menus <b>1901</b> allow the user to schedule certain modes and/or to specify how mode activation can be automatically handled based on location or other factors. Pull-down menus <b>1902</b> allow the user to switch manually to a desired mode. Link <b>1903</b> allows the user to access additional edit options.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">In one embodiment, any or all of the summary information and input fields of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be shown in the context of other types of user interfaces, including for example an interface for a PDA or cell phone screen.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Call Handling</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">When a call is made to callee <b>109</b>, module <b>105</b> directs the call based on any combination of the following factors: call routing rules as specified above, currently active mode, caller identification (or lack thereof), called telephone number, mode, and caller or callee input as described above. In one embodiment, call routing may also be determined by the system based on routing decisions the user has made in the past. Thus, the present invention can use intelligent call management algorithms, including for example collaborative filtering based on the behavior of a set of users, to learn about users' preferences without requiring explicit selection.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">For example, if the system recognizes that, at a given location, calls to all users are almost never answered, it can automatically route calls to callees in that location to voicemail, while sending a SMS notification to the callee. Examples of locations where such a situation may occur are a movie theater and a lecture hall. The system can determine these location behaviors empirically, for example based on system usage. Alternatively, the system can use a database of location classifications to extrapolate a user's behavior (or set of user's collaborative behavior) from one location to another location of similar classification.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">In one embodiment, call handling is accomplished as follows. When a call is placed to one of a user's managed telephone numbers, a database query is made before the call is completed. The result of the database query causes the call to complete to the originally dialed device (device associated with the managed telephone number), to be redirected to another delivery device (which may, or may not, also be in the set of managed telephone numbers), or to be redirected to the system handling the user's voicemail. The call routing is thus performed in a manner that is seamless to both the caller and the callee.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Rule-Based Routing</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">In one embodiment, the system of the present invention implements rule-based routing based on the data stored in database <b>105</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">Rules are implemented in a manner that resembles operands. For any given call management situation, only one rule is executed, so as to definitively dispose of the call.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">The rules are created by program logic, on a web server and in database <b>105</b>A, when callee <b>109</b> configures his or her account. When a managed call is handled by the system of the present invention, a determination is made as to which single rule is to be executed by the switch. If more than one callee <b>109</b> shares the managed phone line (managed TN), a single rule is identified for each callee <b>109</b> and returned to the querying server (“telephone server,” Signaling Application Processor, etc.). That server causes the caller to be asked which user they are calling. (For example, “Press 1 for Joe; Press 2 for Jane”) After that selection is made by the caller, the appropriate call-routing rule is executed. If only a single user is associated with a managed TN, the rule for that user is executed without need for caller interaction. Accordingly, in one embodiment database <b>105</b>A stores a representation of a chart for a particular callee <b>109</b>; the chart sets forth a set of rules. Each rule is qualified by any or all of the following:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0100">Which mode is the callee in?</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0101">What TN was called by the caller?</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0102">What group (i.e., set of caller TNs) does the caller belong to?</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0103">Does the caller have caller ID?</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0104">Associated with each rule is an action (or more than one action), also referred to as op-codes. Examples include:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0105">Deliver the call to a TN;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0106">Route the call to VM;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0107">Try to deliver the call, then go to VM if no answer or busy;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0108">Screen (if no caller ID, require caller to enter telephone number);</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0109">Sequentially ring multiple delivery TN, stopping the sequence if the callee is reached;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0110">Simultaneously ring multiple delivery TN—if the callee is reached, stop ringing the other devices.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0111">In one embodiment, database <b>105</b>A includes a representation of a number of rules, each including any or all of the above.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0112">As discussed herein, callee <b>109</b> modes can be based on explicit selection, or on location, or by a schedule, or by other predetermined conditions. In one embodiment, certain modes may expire automatically after a defined period of time; then, the callee <b>109</b> returns to a default mode or previous mode.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Rule Selection and Application</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0113">In one embodiment, the schema and indexing of the table is designed to facilitate rapid lookup during call-handling operation. When the system of the present invention receives notification from a switch (LEC, MSC, PBX, etc.) that a call has been placed to an managed telephone number (managed TN), the system of the present invention does the following:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0114">1. Determine all callees <b>109</b> that are associated with that managed TN. This results in a set of user IDs.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0115">For each callee <b>109</b>:
        <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0116">2. Determine what group or groups the caller is a member of based on caller TN (Caller ID).</li>
            <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0117">3. Determine what mode callee <b>109</b> is in.</li>
            <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0118">4. Identify all the rules in the userRule table with a userID that matches callee's <b>109</b> ID, a userStatusID that matches callee's <b>109</b> status ID, a userManagedAddressID that matches the ID associated with the managed TN (1 in the table means “don't care”—the rule applies to any managed TN), and if filterType=FILTER the callerGroupID is in the set of groups the caller is a member of. If filterType=DON'T_CARE, the rule applies to all callers. If filterType=NO_CID, the rule applies to callers with blocked CallerID.</li>
            <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0119">5. Select the rule with the lowest ruleRank number.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0120">For each user associated with the managed TN, the “instruction” part of the selected rule is returned. This instruction part consists of an opcode and some operands. These are: opcodeID, deliveryDeviceID<b>1</b>, deliveryDeviceID<b>2</b> and 2 notification options: callNotifyEmailOption and callNotifySMSOption. The deliverDevicelDs reference telephone numbers stored elsewhere in the database. When the rule instruction is returned, by the database, to the querying server telephone numbers are returned instead of deliveryDeviceIDs.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0121">When the user is identified by the Platform (on caller selection in the case of multiple users on a managed TN), the associated rule instruction (or op-code) is executed.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<p id="p-0100" num="0122">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there is shown a table <b>1700</b> containing an example set of rules for a callee <b>109</b>, including a set of op-codes. callNotifyEmailOption and callNotifySMSOption are notification options which, if set to ‘Y’, cause the system of the present invention to send a call notification to callee <b>109</b> using an address stored elsewhere.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Op-Codes</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0123">The following is an example of a set of op-codes for use by the system of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that many other types of op-codes can also be used. The op-code “CONNECT_DIALED_DEVICE” is transformed to “CONNECT” by database logic before being returned to the querying server (“telephone server”) using information available at call time (specifically the called number). The opcode “CONNECT_INTERNAL_VM” is transformed to “VOICEMAIL” if the voicemail access number stored in the database is handled by the same telephone server that is making the database query; this direct internal connection saves the resources required to place an additional call.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0125">In one embodiment, voicemail platform <b>106</b> and other enhanced services can be provided by any provider and need not be associated with the provider of module <b>105</b>. A user can have any number of voicemail repositories, though many users will find it convenient to direct all voicemail calls to a single voicemail repository. Thus, the user may select a voicemail service and repository provided by one of the carriers that the user is using for telephone service. Alternatively, the user may select voicemail service from a third-party provider that is not associated with any of the user's phones.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0126">In one embodiment, when initially signing up for call management services such as those provided by the present invention, the user can select a voicemail service provider from a list of available providers.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0127">Then, when call management configuration specifies that a call should go to voicemail, module <b>105</b> directs the call to the appropriate voicemail access phone number. In one embodiment, unanswered calls (busy or no answer after four rings) are also routed to the appropriate voicemail access phone number.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0128">In one embodiment, other enhanced services, such as call notification (via email, SMS message, Stutter-Dial-Tone, and the like) or integrated call logging (one list of incoming calls across all of a user's managed phones) can be provided independently of the user's telecom carriers.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Real-Time Mapping</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0129">In one embodiment, the system of the present invention performs real-time mapping and rule selection on call-by-call basis. Thus, inputs are evaluated at the time the call comes in, so as to select the rule based on the most up-to-date information. Thus the present invention ensures that calls are correctly routed based on the most current sources of information and settings.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Identifying the Callee by Non-NANP Identifier</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0130">As described above, the call management system of the present invention allows a user (callee) to control how they are reached by phone. When one of the user's telephone numbers is dialed, the call is routed pursuant to the desire of the user. Thus, incoming calls may be routed, for example, to the phone at the callee's current location or to voicemail (if they consider themselves unavailable for phone calls).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0131">In one embodiment, a caller can identify a callee to be called by some identifier other than the telephone number (in other words, an identifier that is not in conformity with the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for telephone numbers). Thus, in essence the caller attempts to call a person rather than a telephone number; in fact, the callee may not even be aware of the callee's telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0132">For example, the caller may initiate a call via a web interface, PDA interface, cell phone interface or by some other means. The caller may select or enter the callee's name or email address, or may even click on a link on a web page to attempt to reach the callee. The caller's action causes module <b>105</b> to perform a database lookup and to initiate a telephone call to callee according to the current mode and callee preferences, as described above. Thus, in this embodiment, calls are routed in a similar manner as above but the caller has identified the callee by means other than the telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0133">In one embodiment, the callee can specify that calls initiated by identifying the callee by some mechanism other than telephone number are handled differently than calls initiated by dialing a telephone number. Thus, for example, a call initiated by selecting a name from a web page might go to voicemail, while calls initiated by dialing a telephone number might be routed to the callee's wireless phone. Such a mechanism can be implemented for example by providing one or more additional pull-down menus in the screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, allowing selection of actions to be taken if the callee is called using alternative identifying means.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0134">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is shown a block diagram depicting an architecture for implementing callee identification by means other than telephone numbers, according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0135">A caller places a call, for example via computer <b>1201</b> that is running a voice communication application. The caller identifies the callee by some means other than entering a NANP telephone number, for example by entering the callee's e-mail address. The application running on computer <b>1201</b> contacts call management configuration storage and routing module <b>105</b> to determine how to route the call. Based on callee preferences, routing module <b>105</b> causes the call to be routed to another computer <b>1204</b> or to a NANP device such as telephone <b>108</b>A connected to PSTN <b>103</b> via an IP/PSTN gateway <b>1203</b>. In one embodiment, the call is routed from computer <b>1201</b> to gateway <b>1203</b> or to computer <b>1204</b> via the Internet <b>1202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0136">In one embodiment, non-NANP calls can be placed using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). These calls can be initiated using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). To reroute a SIP call, call management module <b>105</b> can be registered (with a network SoftSwitch) to handle the callee's VoIP telephone calls. When a call is placed to the callee VoIP phone or computer acting as a VoIP phone <b>1204</b>, the SoftSwitch sends an “Invite” message to call management module <b>105</b>. Call management module <b>105</b> responds with a redirection message that causes the SoftSwitch to either complete the call as originally directed or to terminate the call on another device (VoIP/SIP phone, PSTN phone, or voicemail platform).</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Distinctive Ring Tones</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0137">In one embodiment, the present invention provides distinctive ring tones based on any of a number of factors, including which number was dialed, caller identification, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0138">Call management screen, as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can be enhanced in one embodiment by adding user interface elements that allow the user to specify different types of call notification depending on certain conditions. The notification can be, for example, a distinctive ring on the delivery device or a distinctive Instant Message notification on a computer. A user may specify that calls routed from his or her office phone ring to his or her home phone using an alternate short-ring-cycle distinctive ring, while other calls use the standard ring. In one implementation, the ring type can be controlled by routing the call to one of two phone numbers associated with the telephone line using a standard LEC (Local Exchange Carrier) “distinctive ring” feature.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0139">In one implementation, the ring type on a mobile phone may be modified in real time immediately before the system routes a call to that phone by sending a Short Message Service (SMS) message (or other data message) to a software application running on the phone. The software application changes the phone ring type according to instructions sent in the SMS message.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Informing Callee Who is Calling</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0140">In one embodiment, the present invention uses an alternative communications path, such as short message service (SMS), email, instant messaging, or the like, to let the callee know who is calling. The message to the callee can include additional information about the call, including how it was routed, where the caller is located, caller's telephone number, caller's name (from the user's directory or from other sources such as a CNAM database), number dialed by the caller, and the time of the call and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0141">In one embodiment, the callee can specify which incoming calls should include such notification, and what type of communications path/mechanism should be used. Email notification of calls may also be configured. The content of the notification may include the caller's telephone number, the caller's name (from the user's directory or from other sources such as a CNAM database), the number dialed by the caller, and the time of the call. In alternative embodiments, other types of information may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0142">In one embodiment, when Call management module <b>105</b> receives a query from a telecom switch <b>102</b> or PBX <b>104</b>C, it dips User profile database <b>105</b>B to determine how to respond to the query. Information returned from database <b>105</b>B includes a callee notification configuration. This information includes how to send notification to callee <b>109</b> and in what format to send it. In the case of e-mail notification, Call management module <b>105</b> formats an e-mail message and sends that message over the Internet through an mail (SMTP) server.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Calls Converted to other Types of Communication</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0143">In one embodiment, the present invention can convert telephone calls into email messages, SMS messages, instant messages, or other types of communications.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0144">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, call management screen <b>300</b> is enhanced in one embodiment by adding user interface elements that allow the user to specify that certain telephone calls (depending on any of the factors discussed above), should be converted to other types of communications. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, menu <b>303</b>A includes a “send to voicemail” option that allows the callee to specify that while at work, calls to his or her home number should be sent to voicemail. The system can further be configured to convert the voicemail to an email message or to attach it to an email message and send it to the callee's work email address. Content of the communication can include additional information about the call, including how it was routed, where the caller is located, caller's telephone number, caller's name (from the user's directory or from other sources such as a CNAM database), number dialed by the caller, and the time of the call and the like. In one embodiment, this information about the call and the caller is compiled from information passed in the query to the Call management module <b>105</b> combined with derived information (for example a directory lookup of the caller's name based on the calling telephone number) and independent information such as the time the call was processed by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0145">In one embodiment, voicemail platform <b>106</b> queries module <b>105</b> to determine whether to deliver a voicemail message using e-mail. Module <b>105</b> obtains profile information from database <b>105</b>A. This determination is made based on user preference as a function of any or all of mode, callee, and dialed telephone number.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Mapping Different Phone Numbers to Different Modes</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0146">In one embodiment, the present invention facilitates mapping of different phone numbers to different modes. For a single callee, several telephone numbers can be established; for example, one for important calls, one for business calls, one (or more) disposable numbers, and the like. Such an arrangement allows the callee to better manage his or her calls by giving out the appropriate number from the set of telephone numbers, depending on the situation. The various telephone numbers need not have any correlation to actual physical locations or telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0147">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, there is shown an example of call management screen <b>300</b> wherein calls to different phone numbers are handled differently. In this example, when the user has selected the “High Priority” mode, only calls to the mobile phone will ring through. Calls placed to home and office phones will be routed directly to voicemail. Thus, the user can give out the mobile phone number to those callers whom the user deems most important.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0148">In one embodiment, a disposable telephone number (valid for a limited time period) can be offered. Calls made to temporary (disposable) telephone numbers are routed to one of the user's delivery devices or to voicemail, depending on the user's stated preferences. The assignment of a temporary number can be made dynamically from a pool of available numbers. The number may remain valid for a single call, for a brief time period, or for a long time period.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0149">One example of the use of a temporary telephone number is as a contact number for people communicating using Internet Chat. A temporary number can be provided as a “public” number for a user allowing that user to give the telephone number to another person to make a single call. The user's actual delivery device telephone numbers remain private. After use, the telephone number is suspended for some period of time and then returned to the pool of available temporary telephone numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0150">In another embodiment, a temporary address number is given to the user along with a common access number. After calling a common access number (for example, a toll-free number), the caller enters the temporary address number (a sequence of digits). The call is then routed to the appropriate user's delivery device or voicemail. The system generates a temporary address number, for example a unique digit string that is valid for a limited time. During that time, when a caller calls the common access number, it is answered by a telephone server (not shown). The telephone server queries User profile database <b>105</b>A. Database <b>105</b>A treats the temporary address number as a managed address for purposes of determining the routing rule to pass to the telephone server. The telephone server executes the routing rule, which results in sending the call to a telephone, voicemail, or some other call handling device.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0151">In a shared line situation, where a subset of the members of a family have wireless phones, the present invention can split off calls for those with other phones (wireless or office) as defined in the configuration profile.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Callee Mode Information on Caller Device</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0152">In one embodiment, potential callers can see mode information for callees. In one embodiment, callees can choose whether or not to make such information available to potential callers. Additionally, callees can choose to make such information available only to some potential callers, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0153">In one embodiment, a potential caller can see mode information by keying in the phone number of the callee in a cell phone or other device, or by selecting the callee from a directory, or by some other means. In one embodiment, when appropriate, the calling device queries the system of the present invention to obtain a description of the callee's current mode. A representation of that mode is displayed the potential caller, who can then decide whether or not to attempt to complete the call.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0154">In this context, a callee's mode information is a label that reflects the callee's desire, ability, or propensity to accept any, or certain types of, phone calls. User B's mode can be presented to User A before and/or after User A places a call to User B.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0155">If mode information is presented to User A before a call is placed to User B, User A can use knowledge of User B's mode in deciding whether or not to initiate a call to User B. If mode information is presented to User A after a call is placed to User B. User A can use that knowledge as context for discussion with User B if the call is picked up by User B or for understanding why the call was not picked up by User B.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0156">The displayed mode may be set explicitly by that callee or it may be a function of the callee's mode; in other words, the callee may specify that the displayed mode not be the same as the actual mode. All inputs used to determine mode can also be used to algorithmically determine the user's mode. User A may learn of User B's mode by viewing an address book entry on a client device (mobile phone or other device), by selecting a “show mode” soft-key on a client device, or by some other means on the client device. User A may also learn of User B's mode after calling User B.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0157">Callee mode information can be determined when another user queries for it or it can be determined periodically by the system. If the mode is determined periodically, it can be stored and made available for query or it can be pushed to the client devices of all users who have access to the information.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0158">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is shown an example of a cell phone display wherein a current activity mode <b>1101</b> (Home) for a callee is displayed. This display would be shown, for example, after the user of the cell phone had keyed in the telephone number of the callee on keypad <b>1102</b> (or after he or she had selected the callee's name from an on-screen list or directory).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0159">In one embodiment, the display of the mode indicates whether the callee is at home, at work, on vacation, or the like. In another embodiment, additional information can be displayed, such as the callee's activity mode schedule, an indication of when the current mode will change and what the next mode will be, forwarding information (such as substitute telephone number), or any combination thereof. The callee can specify what kind of information is displayed, and can indicate that different kinds of information be made available to different callers or depending on other factors.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Overview of Operation of System</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0160">In one embodiment, the system of the present invention is implemented as follows. First a call being made is intercepted as follows:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0161">Calls to a residential line are intercepted using Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) at the destination switch in the LEC CO.</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0162">Calls to a wireless phone are intercepted using Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) or Customized Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) at the destination switch in the MSC.</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0165">Then, a database dip is performed to determine how to dispose of the call. Disposition options are: let it complete, forward it elsewhere, or send it to voicemail. The database dip is performed on a specialized database or mirror. Interfaces to the database include AIN/WIN/CAMEL to an SCP via SS7 or XML via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0166">Database dips may be made directly or through a partner that runs the SS7 network as a front-end to the database, either by contacting the database in real-time (pull) or hosting a mirror of the database (push).</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Overall Architecture and Operational Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0167">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there is shown an example of a detailed architecture for implementing the present invention according to one embodiment. For illustrative purposes, the wireless network shown is a GSM network. CDMA and other wireless protocols are also supported. For illustrative purposes, a redundant centralized configuration is shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can also be implemented using, for example, a geographically distributed architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0168">SS7 Network <b>1301</b> provides the SS7 connectivity between service platform <b>1304</b> and Wireless Carrier Network <b>1303</b>. Such a network may be provided, for example, by a wireless telephone company such as Verizon. One skilled in the art will recognize that other mechanisms for connecting components <b>1304</b> and <b>1303</b> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0169">Enterprise Network <b>1305</b> connects to the service platform <b>1304</b> using Internet protocol (IP). ILEC SS7 Network <b>1302</b> is used to turn message waiting on and off on landline phones. Elements in <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b> are optional components that need not be included in order to practice the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0170">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when a call addressed to a managed telephone number is received by MSC <b>1321</b>, MSC <b>1321</b> sends a query containing the called TN and calling TN to Application Processor-SCP <b>1330</b> using a TCAP message over the Signaling System 7 (SS7). This message travels over one or more Service Transfer Points (STP) <b>1315</b>, <b>1306</b> in SS7 network <b>1312</b> and through Signaling Gateway <b>1326</b>, where its format is converted to SCCP-User Adaptation Layer (SUA). Alternatively, the query can travel over Internet Protocol (IP) network <b>1325</b> from MSC <b>1321</b> through Edge SS7 Gateway <b>1316</b> to Application Processor—SCP <b>1330</b> using the SIGTRAN protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0171">The Application Processor acts as an Intelligent Networking Service Control Point (SCP) <b>1330</b>. SCP <b>1330</b> queries the Database <b>1329</b> to determine how to handle the call. In some cases, for example if the managed TN is shared among multiple users, caller <b>101</b> is prompted to enter a digit to select the desired callee (or to select the callee by other means). To do this, SCP <b>1330</b> establishes a session and responds to MSC <b>1321</b>, instructing it to temporarily connect the call to Application Processor—Intelligent Peripheral (IP) <b>1332</b> through VoiceXML gateway <b>1328</b> over PSTN or using VoIP.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0172">When Application Processor—IP <b>1332</b> receives a call, it communicates with Application Processor—SCP <b>1330</b> over Internet Protocol <b>1331</b> to determine which voice prompt to play to caller <b>101</b>. The response from SCP <b>1330</b> is used to select and retrieve the voice prompt from Prompt store <b>1333</b>. That prompt is played to caller <b>101</b>. Caller's <b>101</b> selection, made for example with the Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signal from a key press on a conventional telephone, is detected and forwarded to SCP <b>1330</b>. Application processor—SCP <b>1330</b> uses the caller's selection to determine how to dispose of the call. Instructions for call disposition are sent to MSC <b>1321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0173">MSC <b>1321</b> disconnects the call to Application processor—IP <b>1332</b> and forwards the call to the desired delivery TN. Callee <b>109</b> can be notified of unanswered call events by the system. Desired call event information is sent from database <b>1329</b> to Notification Server <b>1334</b>, which can notify callee <b>109</b> in various ways including sending an Short Message Service (SMS) message to callee's <b>109</b> mobile phone via SMS Gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0174">An enterprise telephone (station) attached to a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) <b>1336</b> can be managed by the system. When a call destined to a station is received by PBX <b>1336</b>, PBX <b>1336</b> sends a query to Application Processor—SCP <b>1330</b> over Application Programming Interface (API) <b>1337</b>. The response from the query instructs PBX <b>1336</b> as to how to dispose of the call.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0175">Voicemail messages may be interchanged between Wireless Carrier Voicemail platform <b>1320</b> and Enterprise Voicemail platform <b>1335</b> using VPIM Gateway <b>1340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0176">In one embodiment, call routing (also referred to as vectoring) is accomplished by forwarding from destination switches <b>104</b> (connected to the originally dialed TN in a Central Office (CO) <b>104</b>A or Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>104</b>B or by forwarding from Private Branch Exchanges (PBX) <b>104</b>C controlling dialed office telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0177">In one embodiment, Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) technology is used in CO<b>104</b>A. Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) is a telephone network architecture that separates service logic from switching equipment, allowing new services to be added without having to redesign switches to support new services.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0178">In another embodiment, Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN), Customized Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL), or other technology is used in MSC <b>104</b>B to implement the call management functionality described herein.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Implementation by Integrating with a Wireless Carrier Using WIN or CAMEL</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0179">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, there is shown an example of an architecture for implementing the present invention by integrating with a wireless carrier using WIN or CAMEL.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0180">The implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> manages landline, wireless, and office telephones using the wireless carrier Mobile Switching Center switch (MSC) <b>104</b>B. Calls placed to Home phone <b>108</b>A of callee <b>109</b> are initiated by any phone <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, <b>101</b>C and are routed over PSTN <b>103</b> to Central Office (CO) <b>104</b>A associated with called home phone <b>108</b>A. If Home phone <b>108</b>A is busy or not answered, the call is forwarded to MSC <b>104</b>B where the call is managed.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0181">Likewise, calls placed directly to the callee's Wireless phone <b>108</b>B are managed at MSC <b>104</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0182">Calls placed to the user's office phone <b>108</b>C are managed by MSC <b>104</b>B if the callee's public TN (published TN). is forwarded by PBX <b>104</b>C to MSC <b>104</b>B and Office phone <b>108</b>C is associated with a hidden TN. In this fashion, calls destined to the callee's Office phone <b>108</b>C arrive at MSC <b>104</b>B where they can be managed and potentially forwarded to the actual office phone using the private TN.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0183">Upon receipt of a call for a managed TN, MSC <b>104</b>B queries SCP <b>1501</b> inside Call Management Module <b>105</b> using a WIN or CAMEL trigger over SS7. SCP <b>1501</b> in this figure includes a service database and database logic <b>102</b>, which determines how the call should be handled by MSC <b>104</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0184">If the managed TN is shared by multiple users, a prompt is played to caller <b>101</b> so that caller <b>101</b> can select the callee he or she is trying to reach. The spoken name of each user is originally stored in the Master copy of prompts <b>1503</b> and periodically copied to a mirror data-store at MSC <b>104</b>B. MSC <b>104</b>B uses the local copy of the prompts to ask caller <b>101</b> to select a callee <b>109</b> (for example, “Press 1 for Joe. Press 2 for Mary,” and the like). The selection is sent to SCP <b>1501</b>, which replies to MSC <b>104</b>B with instructions for completing the call. Depending on the instructions, MSC <b>104</b>B may forward the call to the callee's Wireless phone <b>108</b>B, Office phone <b>108</b>C, or to a voicemail platform (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), or the like. In this example, the call would not be forwarded to Home phone <b>108</b>A because phone <b>108</b>A is already known to be busy or not answered. The service database can be configured with a computer <b>1506</b> through a Website <b>1504</b> or through telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system <b>1505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0185">The architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is set up to provide the functionality of the present invention using one or more of the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0186">Home phone <b>108</b>A is provisioned to forward to cell phone TN on Busy or No-Answer. Alternatively, one or both of the following techniques can be used:
<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0187">The wireless carrier can port, using wireline-to-wireless Local Number Portability (LNP), the existing home phone TN to itself, acting as a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), and then re-number the existing home phone line with a hidden physical TN. This allows Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>102</b>B to intercept a call before it rings and to present an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu to the caller allowing the caller to select the household member (user) he or she is trying to reach. An option of “anyone” rings the home phone.</li>
        <li id="ul0015-0002" num="0188">The wireless carrier can provide a new, virtual, TN on its network to be assigned as a proxy home TN for the callee's family. This TN works as in #1 above. Callees are then encouraged to give it out as their “home number.”</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0189">Office phone <b>108</b>C is provisioned in PBX <b>104</b>C to forward to cell phone TN on Busy or No-Answer, or office phone forwarding (variable or BNA) can be dynamically configured based upon mode and/or filter.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0190">Once the setup has occurred, calls are handled as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Case 1—Caller Dials Cell Phone TN</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0191">A switch in MSC <b>104</b>B connects to cell phone <b>108</b>B or redirects to another phone <b>108</b>C, <b>108</b>A or voicemail <b>106</b> based upon mode and filters.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Case 2—Caller Dials Home TN</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0192">If the call is unanswered, it is forwarded to the cell phone switch. In the case of fixed forwarding or ported home number, all calls go to MSC <b>102</b>B before ringing home phone <b>108</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0193">If home phone <b>108</b>A is shared, a switch in MSC <b>102</b>B can play attendant prompts to allow caller to select one of multiple users via IVR.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0194">The switch in MSC <b>104</b>B can connect to cell phone <b>108</b>B or redirect to another phone <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>C or voicemail <b>106</b> based upon mode and filters.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Case 3—Caller Dials Office TN</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0195">If the call is unanswered, it is forwarded to the cell phone switch.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0196">A switch in MSC <b>104</b>B connects to cell phone <b>108</b>B or redirect to another phone <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>C or voicemail <b>106</b> based upon mode and filters.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0197">Attendant prompts <b>1503</b>, especially personalized greetings and names, may be recorded at a central site and distributed to each of the MSCs <b>102</b>B through data mirroring. An SSP <b>1705</b> at MSC <b>104</b>B can use an Intelligent Peripheral, located at MSC <b>104</b>B or centrally, to play attendant prompts.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Integration with LEC Using AIN</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0198">In one embodiment, Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) functionality at destination switch <b>104</b> can be used to perform filtering and/or play attendant prompts before ringing home phone <b>108</b>A. When caller <b>101</b> selects the callee <b>109</b> he or she is trying to reach, the call can be forwarded to home phone <b>108</b>A (possibly using distinctive ringing to identify the desired user), the call can be sent to another phone (including a cell phone <b>108</b>B or office phone <b>108</b>C), the call can be routed to a voicemail platform <b>106</b>, or the call can be routed to another service. In one embodiment, callee <b>109</b> can specify filters that allow certain callers <b>101</b> skip the attendant or to be handled differently than other callers. Adding a caller <b>101</b> to a filter list can take place at any time, including after a call is completed, or before or during a conversation, or at any time using a configuration tool such as described above. In one embodiment, the web-based user interface displays a log of incoming callers, call times, the user the caller selected, along with the controls necessary to add/remove callers to/from filters.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Implementation Using Dynamic Number Portability</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0199">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the functionality described above is implemented using Dynamic Number Portability (DNP), substituting the Alternate TN at the Origin and/or Gateway switch.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0200">Caller <b>101</b> places a call on any of the following: a residential, inter-company or inter-carrier wireless phone <b>101</b>A; an Intra-carrier wireless phone <b>101</b>B; or an intra-company phone <b>101</b>C is Central office (CO) switch <b>102</b>A is associated with phone <b>101</b>A. Mobile switching center switch <b>102</b>B is associated with phone <b>101</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0201">Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>103</b> carries calls among CO switch <b>102</b>A, Voicemail (VM) platform <b>106</b>, and CO switch <b>104</b>A. SS7 network <b>1405</b> carries Non Call path Associated Signaling (NCAS) between switch <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B and call management module <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0202">Voicemail (VM) platform <b>106</b> is a potential destination for calls that is capable of recording caller's <b>101</b> voice message. CO switch <b>104</b>A is a land-line central office switch associated with home (residential) telephone delivery device <b>108</b>A. Mobile switching center (MSC) switch <b>104</b>B is connected to wireless (mobile) telephone delivery device <b>108</b>B. Private branch exchange (PBX) <b>104</b>C is connected to an office telephone (station) <b>108</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0203">In one embodiment, callee <b>109</b> configures the service of the present invention, for example using a computer or wireless phone software application <b>1506</b>. Examples of screen shots of such an application <b>1506</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> and <b>9</b>-<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0204">In one embodiment, Call Management Module <b>105</b> includes Service Control Point (SCP) <b>1501</b> that accepts queries from switches <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>104</b>A, and PBX <b>104</b>C, and returns call routing information. PCM Mode, Filter and Redirect logic <b>1502</b> and PCM Attendant logic <b>1502</b>A are software programs associated with SCP <b>1501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0205">Data store <b>1503</b> contains master copies of user spoken names for use in prompting caller <b>101</b> to select from multiple users who share a managed home telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0206">In one embodiment, web configuration interface <b>1504</b> generates the website with which callee <b>109</b> configures the service.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0207">In one embodiment, callee <b>109</b> can use telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) server <b>1505</b> to configure services.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0208">In one embodiment, call management is performed by doing a lookup at origin switch <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B (associated with caller's <b>101</b> telephone line <b>101</b>A or <b>101</b>B) or PBX <b>104</b>C, for example using Dynamic Number Portability (DNP). Thus, the call is redirected before it leaves originating switch <b>102</b>. An advantage of such an implementation is that it reduces system-wide telecom costs and eliminates potential calling loops that may take place if different systems (such as PBXs) control redirection for overlapping subsets of a user's phones.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0209">DNP need not be implemented in all networks to be effective at reducing costs associated with re-routing calls to alternate telephone numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0210">In one embodiment, DNP is implemented using universal switch (CO and MSC) participation and/or PBX participation to redirect intra-company calls to a user's office phone. In one embodiment, DNP is also implemented at international gateway switches so that calls can be routed (vectored) when entering a particular service area.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0211">In another embodiment, DNP is implemented at the call-originating device, for example when calls are transported without going thought telecom switches. Such a technique can also be used for devices that use PSTN <b>103</b>. Such devices include a computer that places calls using IP telephony, a wireless carrier's cell phone, or a peer-to-peer switch-less cell phone. The call-originating device performs a DNP database dip to receive the substitute TN and other call control information, such as TN to call if the substitute TN is not answered.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0212">When caller <b>101</b> dials a TN, switch <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B determines the dialed TN is a user TN (optional step). If so, then a DNP dip is performed passing Dialed TN and Calling Party TN, Calling Party Blocked CID Flag, and a switch identifier (for location determination used in some cases for substitute TN selection). Returned from the dip is Substitute Telephone Number (STN), Busy Telephone Number (BTN) No Answer Telephone Number (NATN), No-Answer Ring Count (or time delay), and billing entity number (which may be a switch ID of user).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0213">Switch <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B calls the STN. If it is busy, the call is connected to BTN. If it is not answered after “No-Answer Ring Count” rings, the call is connected to NATN. The STN can be a delivery device (wireline or wireless phone) or another device such as an attendant IVR service.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0214">In addition, destination switch <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B, or another destination switch for the delivery device may act as an attendant service. An attendant service can redirect the call, present caller <b>101</b> with options (such as attempt connection or go to voicemail, or allow caller <b>101</b> to select which callee he or she is calling from a list of options), or provide screening choices to callee <b>109</b>. For example an attendant can call callee <b>109</b> and let him or her know who is on the phone, and present callee <b>109</b> with call completion options.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0215">The use of BTN and NATN also allows LECs to pull back a call destined to a wireless carrier. In this way, they can allow their customers to have a single voicemail box, possibly on the LEC network. This scheme enables a “leave a message for a person, not for each of their places” service. DNP also enables a wireline carrier to allow its customer to hide a wireless TN behind a wireline TN.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0216">Inclusion of BTN and NATN in the returned DNP information also allows the owner of origin switch <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B to provide a voice messaging option to their customers, the callers. Such a service could be implemented, for example, by dialing *11 or other prefix code or access TN before a 10-digit number. If callee <b>109</b> is a DNP user and has a BTN and NATN, then caller <b>101</b> is connected to voicemail directly. If BTN and NATN is not present, then the *11 service can connect the call directly or inform caller <b>101</b> that the voice messaging option is not available. This scheme enables a “leave a message for a person, without the risk of talking to them” service.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0217">In one embodiment, a BTN and NATN returned in a DNP dip may differ depending on the switch making the dip. The DNP dip includes switch ID that can be mapped to location inside the DNP system. DNP can dynamically substitute local access numbers. This can be done, for example, to minimize the access charges in a voicemail network. In one embodiment, the BTN and NATN are not typically configured directly by the user. Instead, the user selects a third-party VM provider, and that provider supplies access numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0218">In one embodiment, attendant greetings are a function of filters and modes. For example, when caller <b>101</b> dials callee's <b>109</b> home TN, caller <b>101</b> might receive a different personalized greeting based upon callee's <b>109</b> current mode: “I'm commuting right now, please leave a message and I'll return your call when I reach my destination,” or “I'm at work today, please press 1 to connect to my office phone.”</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0219">Also, in one embodiment, modes and/or filters can be used to select ringing modes (loud, soft, vibrate, etc.) and/or ring tones (“Ring-ring, ‘you have a call’, etc.) on a cell phone or other phone, as described in more detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0220">The following is a set of operational steps that are used to implement the functionality of the present invention using DNP, according to one embodiment:</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Case 1—Caller Dials a PSTN TN from Landline Phone (Connected to CO Switch) or Wireless Phone (Connected to MSC Switch)</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0221">Origin switch, optionally, determines if the TN is managed by DNP. In one embodiment, this information is pushed from a database (not shown) within SCP <b>1501</b> to the carrier periodically. In one embodiment, if this data is pushed to the carrier, the carrier uses an in-network SCP with an affiliated database (mirror of the data within SCP <b>1501</b>) to query for call routing information. This step minimizes out-of-network SS7 traffic. This check to see if a user has DNP can be performed on an in-network LEC or wireless carrier database that is anticipated periodically, for example every 15 minutes. In one embodiment, if the user has DNP service, a DNP dip to a DNP database is done to get current data.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0222">If the TN is managed by DNP, or if previous step was not performed, a DNP dip is performed, typically using Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) messaging carried on Signaling System 7 (SS7) <b>1405</b>.

<p id="p-0198" num="0243">In one embodiment, DNP is implemented with a master database and a distributed network of mirrored databases in multiple geographically disparate locations. When a DNP dip is performed over SS7 network <b>1405</b>, Global Title Translation (GTT) is used to find the active or best database (SCP <b>1501</b>) to query. SS7 network <b>1405</b> may be provided by a third party.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0244">In one embodiment, DNP dips are only performed for dialed TNs of users of the DNP service. A pre-qualification database may be hosted by the LEC within its own network. Such an implementation causes DNP dip traffic to grow gracefully over time. In the event of a system failure, the default action is to complete the call to the original dialed number, if possible. The pre-qualification database may be updated at a frequency much lower than the update of the active DNP databases.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">In-Network and Out-of-Network Routing</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0245">The present invention can be implemented in many different architectures, and can operate regardless of whether call routing takes place at the origin switch or the destination switch, or at a gateway switch. Thus, in one embodiment, call routing takes place at an origin switch. Alternatively, call routing can take place at any other switch along the call path. In one embodiment, multiple routings can take place at different points along the call path. A DNP dip can be made at any point in order to obtain information for the call routing operation. In one embodiment, multiple DNP dips may occur, as requested by multiple switches. In another embodiment, a flag may be set to indicate that a DNP dip has already occurred for the call, so that additional unnecessary dips can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0246">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, there is shown an example of an architecture for in-network and out-of-network call routing using an implementation of the present invention. Two cases are contrasted:</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0247">Case 1—In Network Caller. When caller <b>101</b>A belonging to network <b>2002</b> dials callee <b>109</b> at dialed TN <b>108</b>A (handled by switch <b>104</b>AB), origin switch <b>102</b>AA re-routes the call to Alternate TN <b>108</b>B via switch <b>104</b>AC.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0248">Case 2a—Out of Network Caller. When caller <b>101</b>B not belonging to network <b>2002</b> dials callee <b>109</b> at dialed TN <b>108</b>A, gateway switch <b>2001</b> re-routes the call to Alternate TN <b>108</b>B via switch <b>104</b>AC.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0249">Case 2b—Out of Network Caller. When caller <b>101</b>B not belonging to network <b>2002</b> dials callee <b>109</b> at dialed TN <b>108</b>A, if gateway switch <b>2001</b>, or any other switch, does not re-route the call, callee's destination switch <b>104</b>AC can e-route the call to the Alternate TN <b>108</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">DNP Billing</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0250">With DNP, origin switch <b>102</b> forwards calls on behalf of caller <b>101</b>. Callee <b>109</b> is not necessarily a customer of the owner of origin switch <b>102</b>. Thus, in one embodiment the present invention uses DNP and includes a charge transfer sub-system.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0251">According to this embodiment, billing records are moved from origin switch <b>102</b> to an entity, which can bill the customer. The billing record can be forwarded to the switch of the dialed number. Callee should be charged the cost as if the call was forwarded from the switch associated with the originally dialed TN to the forwarded number.</p>

Emergency/Disaster Number Redirection
</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0254">In one embodiment, the present invention provides automatic and/or preconfigured redirection of telephone calls in case of emergency or disaster.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0255">In the event a disaster, such as an earthquake, destroys one or more of the user's delivery devices or makes them unavailable to the user, the user may use screen <b>300</b> to cause their calls to be routed to an out-of-area delivery device (telephone). If desired, an “Emergency” mode may be predefined for this purpose. In one embodiment, the “Emergency” mode is automatically selected if the system of the present invention detects, or is informed, that a set of telephone numbers is no longer reachable.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0256">If damage to a telephone switch causes the system to be unable to route calls destined for managed telephone numbers handled by the switch, in one embodiment queries are performed by the origin switch, rather than the destination switch. In one embodiment, origin switch—based redirection is performed at all times, rather than just during unusual situations. In one embodiment, the system detects switch failure for a set of managed telephone numbers attached to a switch by monitoring the health of the switch, for example by querying the switch on a regular basis. If there is no response, the switch is presumed to be unavailable and all users with managed telephone numbers attached to that switch are automatically placed into the “Emergency” mode.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0257">DNP can be used to creating a disaster resilient phone network. In the event phone service is lost in a region (from one phone line, to a building, to a city), calls destined into that region can be rapidly rerouted to alternate locations. A disaster recovery service can be pre-configured according to the techniques of the present invention that when the customer signals that a disaster occurred (or when such a condition is detected by other means), all managed TNs are routed (vectored) to the corresponding substitute TNs.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0258">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, there is shown a block diagram depicting an architecture for implementing a disaster-resilient DNP architecture according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0259">Mirror copies <b>1801</b> of Master DNP Database <b>1802</b> are provided. A backup set <b>1806</b> of Call Management servers are located at a geographically dispersed location. Switches <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B can either contain a mirror copy <b>1801</b> of DNP database <b>1802</b> to be dipped locally, or they can dip a DNP database outside the carrier's network using TCAP messages over SS7 network <b>1405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0260">These queries and the responses typically travel through one or more Service Transfer Points <b>1807</b>. In one embodiment, STPs <b>1807</b> are implemented in cross-connected pairs for high reliability paired with SS7 Interfaces <b>1804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0261">Service Control Point <b>1501</b> (also implemented in redundant pairs) dips locally mirrored copy <b>1803</b> of DNP database <b>1802</b>. This database dip can be performed on primary Call Management module <b>105</b> or on a backup set of Call Management servers, referred to as mirror <b>1806</b>. Any number of mirrors <b>1806</b> can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0262">PBX <b>104</b>C dips DNP database <b>1802</b>, or mirror database <b>1803</b>, using HTTP over IP through HTTP Interface <b>1805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0263">Traffic analyzer <b>1808</b> collects usage information from each DNP database <b>1802</b>, <b>1803</b> for traffic pattern analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0264">Configuration Interface Server <b>1504</b> is implemented, for example, as a web server that hosts a website that allows callee <b>109</b> to configure his or her service using computer <b>1506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0265">In addition, DNP can be used to facilitate traffic analysis in order to identify terrorist human-networks through calling patterns of known or suspected terrorist or other enemies of the state. With the addition of location information on a per-call basis (or periodic update) coordinated attacks can be detected in real-time by looking for suspicious, predefined usage pattern. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a traffic analysis component <b>1808</b> could look for suspicious patterns of telephone usage. For example, component <b>1808</b> could look for multiple calls to multiple airport gates (2 linked calls from 3 airport gates) within a given time period. If this event is detected, an alert can be forwarded to the appropriate governmental agency.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Shared Phone Lines</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0266">In many households, the home TN is shared among multiple residents. In one embodiment, if caller <b>101</b> calls a callee's <b>109</b> shared home phone <b>108</b>A, caller <b>101</b> is presented with a choice of which resident they would like to contact. This choice may be given before the phone rings or alternatively, only if the phone is unanswered.(busy or no-answer). The call may be redirected (per filters, profile parameters, settings, and mode) after caller <b>101</b> makes a selection.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0267">In another implementation, each user who shares a home phone line has his or her own personal telephone number (PTN). This PTN may be a permanent TN given to a callee <b>109</b>, or it can be temporary. A set of such PTNs is configured to all point to the same home phone line <b>108</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0268">Without DNP, each of these aliased TNs rings the same phone line. Such a personal TN can be used by a person wherever they reside, within the DNP service area.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0269">With DNP, callee <b>109</b> can decide if calls to his or her personal TN ring the common home line <b>108</b>A or another phone line (cell phone <b>108</b>B, office phone <b>108</b>C, dorm phone, vacation home phone, or the like). In this implementation, callee <b>109</b> may have a lifetime TN that will always reach them as long as they are within the area served by DNP (for example, the area served by the North American Numbering Plan). An additional TN may be dedicated to the location of a phone line. For example, caller <b>101</b> could dial PTN-1 for a user X, PTN-2 for user Y, or TN-3 for the residential phone line (home) of X and Y. This location TN would typically be given out for location-based services such as pizza delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0270">Information for filters based on calling TN can be extracted (batch or real-time) from the callee's <b>109</b> address book. This address book may be stored on the user's computer, a different server (such as a Microsoft Exchange server), or a web-based address book.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Further DNP Notes</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0271">DNP allows third-party companies to offer application services to customers involving the control of common-carrier voice devices.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Security</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0272">In one embodiment, Substitute TNs (STN) (Delivery TNs) are authenticated before they can be selected for use, so as to minimize the risk of someone hijacking the calls of a user <b>109</b>. In one embodiment, this authentication process consists of the user logging in using web browser or phone IVR and entering the new number to be added to his or her palette of substitute telephone numbers (STN). The user is given an authentication key (such as a numeric sequence); the user then calls a special access number (such as a toll-free number). In one embodiment, the user must make this call from the STN to be added, so that the user's ownership of (or access to) the STN can be verified via caller ID. The user keys in the authentication key. Once a number is authenticated, the user can change his or her personal configuration to redirect to it at will. This process is used to populate a palette of delivery TNs available as destinations for call routing.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">ENUM</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0273">In one embodiment, the STN or BTN or NATN returned from a DNP dip can be in turn used to dip an Electronic Numbering (ENUM) database to determine further user contact options including e-mail address for voicemail/voice message delivery.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">Notification</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0274">In one embodiment, a Dialed TN is dipped through the DNP database, a notification message may be sent to the owner of the TN. This message can be delivered via SMS, e-mail, Instant Message (IM), or the like. This message can contain any or all of: the number called (Dialed TN), the caller's TN, the caller's name [using Caller Name (CNAM) service], location from which the call was placed or other caller mode information, and the like. In one embodiment, a notification can be sent even if the call is not completed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0275">Notification may be sent to any device, even if it is not associated with the call management system of the present invention. Notification may also be sent to a Delivery Device, whether or not the Dialed TN or STN addresses the Delivery Device. If the “Calling Party Blocked CID Flag” indicates the Calling Party TN is blocked, in one embodiment it is not sent in the notification (pursuant to applicable regulation).</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">Prioritization Based on Filters</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0276">As described above, in the present invention calls are routed based on various types of information, parameters, and preferences. One such parameter is “filters”; in other words, calls from some callers are allowed through, while calls from other callers are routed to voicemail (or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0277">In one embodiment, such filters are also used for prioritization of calls. For example, while in a commuting mode, a filter that determines a caller is “Friends and Family” might cause the call to connect to the user's cell phone; other calls might be routed to voicemail. A “Telemarketer” filter may cause calls to be terminated with a polite, personalized, “no thank you” message.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0278">In such a case the “Telemarketer” filter would be looking for calls with masked caller ID or with suppressed Automatic Number Identification (ANI). In an implementation that can distinguish between suppressed ANI and blocked caller ID, a blocked caller ID call may be from a caller the user desires to talk to. That call can be marked, ex post facto, as being in an “allowed” filter even if the caller ID is never revealed to the user. In other words, the system knows the Calling Party TN and can match it up with user characterizations without revealing the Calling Party TN to the User.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0279">In some states, the storage of called party number for a caller with blocked caller ID may be prohibited. One technique of allowing filtering in such cases is to use a trap-door encryption algorithm as a hash function for matching. In this way, any information stored could not be converted back to the TN of a caller with a blocked caller ID and would therefore comply with legal restrictions. Only one-way encrypted data would be stored and matched. An alternate “Telemarketer” filter would filter out callers with caller IDs of toll free TN (800, 866, etc), which are commonly used by telemarketers.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0280">The system may also determine if a call is a telemarketing call by looking at the pattern of calls placed by the caller. If the caller has placed a large number of calls to other users (or non-users) within a short period of time, especially if the calls are to sequential TN, that caller could be deemed a telemarketer. Another way to classify a caller as a telemarketer is by accepting input from users. If multiple users report telemarketing calls from a caller, then the system would record that fact to maintain a blacklist. Input from users could be received from a cell phone. A cumulative database of telemarketers' TN or names can be used as a blacklist or “spam list.”</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0281">DNP facilitates a personal, long-term TN that a user can point to any delivery TN. This TN can be retained as a user moves his or her residence throughout the numbering plan region. Thus DNP obviates the need for LNP.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Additional Variations and Features</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Voicemail in a Client-Based App with Message Stores in the Network</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0282">In one embodiment, when a client device, such as cell phone, detects a busy or no-answer condition while attempting to place a call, the device records the voicemail message and forwards it to the callee's voicemail platform or directly to the callee's client device.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0283">Voicemail messages can be sent peer-to-peer and eliminate-any (or most) voicemail infrastructure in the network. When a client device detects a busy or no-answer condition, a voicemail-control-exchange database can be queried for the spoken name and greeting of the callee and for the store-and-forward addressing information necessary to deliver the message to the callee's client. When the callee's client device is no longer busy (call terminates or device is turned on), it registers with the same database so the store-and-forward network can deliver the voicemail message. Voicemail messages recorded by the client can optionally be delivered to the user via email, IM, or MMS. Voicemail stores can be distributed in the network in a fashion similar to architecture conventionally used for e-mail message stores.</p>

<p id="p-0239" num="0284">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, there is shown a block diagram depicting an architecture for a communication system <b>2100</b> according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0285">A communication remote control (CRC) system <b>2102</b> controls and coordinates telecommunication service features across multiple telecommunication service providers' networks, including destination switches <b>104</b>, such as CO <b>104</b>A, MSC <b>104</b>B, and PBX <b>104</b>C. In one embodiment, the CRC system <b>2102</b> may be implemented in the call management systems described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-20</figref> to provide additional features, such as, remote configuration of call management, operation across multiple telecommunication service provider networks, dynamic configuration, and notification. (For clarity, elements of these systems are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.) A callee <b>2109</b> uses a client device <b>2104</b> for remotely configuring a set of call management features across the multiple telephone networks using the CRC system <b>2102</b>. The client device <b>2104</b> may be a wireless device. The user interface on the client device <b>2104</b> may be similar to the interfaces described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-11</figref>. The CRC system <b>2102</b> makes telecommunication service features available to the callee <b>2109</b> using data from the multiple switches <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the callee <b>2109</b> differs from the callee <b>109</b> because the callee <b>2109</b> is a subscriber or member of the CRC system <b>2102</b> service. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may include a server <b>2115</b> for executing a call management module <b>2105</b>. The client device <b>2104</b> communicates with the server <b>2115</b>, for example, over a wireless, bandwidth-limited, channel (although other communication channels or mechanisms may be used).</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0286">In other embodiments, the client device <b>2104</b> may be, a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant, or a portable computer. In one embodiment, the client device <b>2104</b> is a mobile phone that is also used by the CRC system <b>2102</b> as one of the user's delivery devices <b>108</b>B. The client device <b>2104</b> may be included in or integral with a delivery device <b>108</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, or may be separate from the delivery device <b>108</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Managed Addresses</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0287">A Managed Address may be a telephone number of a delivery device <b>108</b>, or a telephone number not directly associated with any device or phone line. The Managed Address may be an alphanumeric string unrelated to a telephone number. A user, or the CRC system <b>2102</b>, may assign a Managed Address for dedicated use. For example, a Managed Address could be designated for emergency calls only. A Managed Address can be assigned to a user for a term longer than their subscriber-relationship with any of their telecommunication service providers, or assigned as a temporary number only valid for a limited period of time or a limited number of phone calls. A managed address may include the user address, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0288">The call management module <b>2105</b> handles the control and redirection of calls across the destination networks <b>104</b>. The call management module <b>2105</b> may cause a Managed Address to be redirected from:
<ul id="ul0024" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0024-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0289">1. A Wireline carrier's Local Exchange Carrier switch, using Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) or other call routing control techniques.</li>
        <li id="ul0025-0002" num="0290">2. A Wireless carrier's Mobile Switching Center switch, using Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) or Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) or other call routing control techniques.</li>
        <li id="ul0025-0003" num="0291">3. A Private Branch Exchange (PBX), using Telephone Application Programining Interface (TAPI) or other call routing control techniques.</li>
        <li id="ul0025-0004" num="0292">4. A Voice Over IP (VoIP) soft-switch, using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or other call routing control techniques.</li>
        <li id="ul0025-0005" num="0293">5. Other voice-call switching devices using standard or custom call routing techniques.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0294">The call management module <b>2105</b> may manage a call (e.g., routed to delivery devices <b>104</b>, to Voicemail platforms <b>106</b>, or to other call-terminating equipment) based on combination of user configuration data, user state, and system state.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0295">The call management module <b>2105</b> may manage calls pre-ring or post ring. During pre-ring management, a switch <b>104</b> typically queries the call management module <b>2105</b> for call routing information before any delivery device <b>108</b> rings. During post-ring management, the switch <b>104</b> queries the call management module <b>2105</b> for call routing information after a delivery device <b>108</b> first rings, and has gone unanswered (rings without being answered or is busy).</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0296">A Managed Address associated with a switch <b>104</b> on one network (Owning Switch) may be managed by a switch <b>104</b> on another network (Controlling Switch) by provisioning the Owning Switch to forward unanswered calls to the Controlling Switch. This provisioning may be a one-time set-up event and not require ongoing interaction with the Owning Switch.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0297">Calls to a Managed Address may be intercepted and managed by switches “upstream” in the topology of the call route. For a PBX <b>104</b>C, Direct Inward Dialing (DID) telephone numbers associated with desk telephones, can be routed by the PBX <b>104</b>C, or these telephone numbers may be managed “upstream” of the PBX <b>104</b>C by the CRC system <b>2102</b>. The DID telephone numbers are directly controlled by the LEC or VoIP carrier's switch which is providing PSTN <b>103</b> connectivity to the PBX <b>104</b>C. (These DID telephone numbers are typically leased to the enterprise hosting the PBX <b>104</b>C.) In this situation, a DID telephone number may be a Managed Address controlled by the LEC or VoIP switch serving the enterprise. In the case when a call to a Managed Address will be routed to a non-PBX delivery device, this configuration allows for efficiency by avoiding the use of PBX resources (voice-ports, processing power, and the like).</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">CRC System Management Directives</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0298">The callee <b>2109</b> sets call management directives for ordering, activating, and configuring call management services with the CRC system <b>2102</b>, which stores the directives in a directive database <b>2106</b>. The client device <b>2104</b> may provide location information to the CRC system <b>2102</b> independently of input by the callee <b>2109</b>. Based on the call management directives and the location information, the CRC system <b>2102</b> sends routing and processing information to the destination switches <b>104</b> in response to calls to the user through the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0299">The call management directives include directives described above, such as call routing (based on user location, user presence, explicit user selection, and time of day), call screening, emergency-only call receipt, telemarketer call blocking or filtering, call notification, voicemail notification, mobile caller id, notification routing, voicemail routing, and voicemail forwarding.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0300">In addition, the call management directives may include: call routing (based on activity at user location, omni-network call log, omni-network address book, cross-network voicemail, and consolidated caller id. When a call is placed to a Managed Address, the CRC system <b>2102</b> may cause zero, one, or more delivery devices <b>108</b> to signal (ring or in some other way notify) that a call is available for the user on the delivery device <b>108</b> or that a call has been placed to one of the user's Managed Addresses (notification without the ability to “pick up” the call). The CRC system <b>2102</b> selects dynamically, in real-time, a set of delivery devices <b>108</b> that ring from an equal or larger set of the user's potential delivery devices.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0301">The CRC system <b>2102</b> may address the delivery device <b>108</b>B using a standard TN or other network-unique identifier. In one embodiment, a single Managed Address can be routed to one of a plurality of user mobile phones <b>108</b>B. The user may have a large full-featured mobile phone for use during working hours and a compact mobile phone for use during personal time. The Managed Address can be published as the user's only mobile phone number. The user may command the CRC system <b>2102</b> to treat the mobile phone they are carrying as the active mobile phone delivery device <b>108</b>B and the user's other mobile phone delivery devices as non-active. The mobile phone may be automatically selected for the user based on mobile phone motion (change in location), vibration, power-on, or other conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0302">The client device <b>2104</b> may inform the user of the availability of the CRC system <b>2102</b> proactively (e.g., via SMS message) or reactively (e.g., by the existence of a service information/ordering link available in the user Interface of the client device). The CRC system <b>2102</b> may be ordered, activated, and set up (initially configured) directly on the client device <b>2104</b>. The multi-network provisioning of services is then performed by the CRC system <b>2102</b> through electronic interfaces with each of the user's telecommunication service providers. For each call placed to one of a user's Managed Addresses, the CRC system <b>2102</b> accepts the call-handling signaling queries from the telecommunication service provider and responds to affect the desired handling of the call. The call may be allowed to connect to the dialed device; it may be re-routed to another delivery device; it may be re-routed to a voicemail platform; it may be connected to an automated attendant that accepts caller input used by the CRC system <b>2102</b> to determine how to further handle the call; or it may be handled in some other way. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may cause multiple delivery devices to ring, or in some other way announce the call. The delivery devices may ring simultaneously or sequentially. One or more of the delivery devices may ring differently, or “distinctively,” when it is the only delivery device set to ring verses when it is ringing in conjunction with another delivery device. The distinctive ringing informs the user that all ringing delivery devices are ringing as a result of the same call. For example:</p>

<p id="p-0254" num="0304">The Managed Address in column <b>3</b> can be expressed as “Home,” “Office,” “Commuting” and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0305">The Name of the Caller may come from the user's Phone Book or from Calling Name Database Services (CNAM).</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0306">If multiple users share a delivery device <b>108</b>B, the CRC system <b>2102</b> may cause the delivery device to ring differently when a call is destined for a particular user, or some sub-set of users.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0307">The CRC system <b>2102</b> may send a notification message informing the user of a call handled by the CRC system <b>2102</b> to a device that may or may not be one of the user's delivery devices. If it is a delivery device <b>108</b>, it may or may not handle the call. For example, an SMS message may be sent to a mobile phone client device informing the user of a call routed to the user's home phone.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0308">Ongoing configuration of the CRC Service may be performed using the client device as a wireless interface to the CRC system <b>2102</b>. The CRC Service user interface of the client device <b>2104</b> may be driven by text, iconic, voice recognition, Interactive Voice Response (WVR), or other display and input techniques. Such configuration changes may reside within the CRC system <b>2102</b> and may not need further provisioning through the user's telecommunication service providers. Each of a user's telecommunication service providers queries the CRC system <b>2102</b> whenever a call is received for one of the user's telephone numbers (Managed Addresses). The response from the CRC system <b>2102</b> informs the telecommunication service provider how to proceed with the call. Typical options are “Connect” or “Forward to a supplied number.” (Supplied number may be a delivery device, a Voicemail platform, or other call-terminating system.)</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0309">The rules associated with CRC call handling are divided into groups. Each group of rules is associated with a user activity. A list of named activities may be created by the user and/or they may be given to the user upon service initiation. Some example Activities are “At Home, accepting calls”, “At Home, not accepting calls”, “Commuting”, etc. At any time, exactly one activity is active; this is the current activity. The group of rules associated with an activity are only active when that activity is the current activity. Activities can be created using the client device <b>2104</b>, a website (e.g., via a web configuration <b>1506</b>-see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), or other user interface to the CRC system <b>2102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0310">A user may choose to publish their current activity for viewing by a set of people analogous to a “buddy list” in Instant Messaging. The status of the user being engaged in a phone conversation, along with the name and/or telephone number of the other party, can also be published. Any user-related information available to the CRC system <b>2102</b> may be published to be viewed by a set of people. This information may also be used, with or without being viewed, by other CRC users. This information includes all the factors used in determining current activity. The set of people may include people (other CRC system users or non-users) who place a call to the user. Current activity may be selected by the user on the client device or current activity may be calculated from multiple inputs including: user location, client device location, user selection on client device (using button pushes, voice commands, or other input), user selection through non-client device UI, client device status (in-use, on, off, ringer loud/ringer vibrate, phone setting [“in meeting,” “at office”], etc.), call placed or received on any Managed Address, Instant Messaging (IM) presence state, non-IM presence state, Push To Talk presence state, day of week, time of day, schedule stored in scheduling application (on client device, personal computer, or scheduling server), and others. The Activity, along with any of the above inputs to the calculation of Activity, can be published to a global presence directory for use by other services.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0311">Auto-enacting activities are activities that are selected without any explicit user input. Using auto-enacting activities allows for a very simple user experience that does not require user interaction. The CRC system <b>2102</b> can detect behavior inconsistent with the current activity and report the inconsistency to the user, allowing them to make appropriate changes. For example, when the current activity is “At Home” and a call is placed from the user's mobile phone, the user may be prompted via the client device <b>2104</b> to change their activity to “On The Go.” As another example, when the current activity is causing calls to be delivered to a delivery device and if some number of calls are not answered, the user can be notified (via SMS or other mechanism) and asked for confirmation that the delivery device is set for the desired activity.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">User Location</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0312">The CRC system <b>2102</b> may include the location of the client device <b>2104</b> as a proxy for user location for determining how to handle a call made to one of the user's Managed Addresses. The client device <b>2104</b> or the telecommunication service provider network may determine the client device location and provide the location to the CRC system <b>2102</b>. The client device <b>2104</b> may determine its location using Global Positioning system (GPS), antenna tower triangulation, WiFi (or other) Wireless-LAN proximity, or other techniques. The telecommunication service provider network may determine the client device location using antenna tower triangulation or other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0313">The CRC system <b>2102</b> may determine user location from other sources such as an access-card swipe at the user's place of work, use of a credit card at a specific location, the placing of a call from a particular location (wireline or wireless), registration with a WiFi or other wireless network, entry into a location (home, office, or other) using an electronic key system, entry of personal identification number into an alarm system, unlocking or starting the user's car, low-orbit satellite-based head-top identification, or other sources. For example, if a user's mobile phone transitions from using a CDMA network to using WiFi in the user's home, the CRC system <b>2102</b> can set the user's Current Activity to “At Home.”</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0314">The CRC <b>2102</b> system may use user location information in conjunction with a road map database to match against the user's known home and office addresses, determine when the user is at home or at their office, and then select the corresponding “At Home” Activity or “At Work” Activity to be the Current Activity. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may determine if the user is traveling (monotonic progression of locations) along a likely route between home and office addresses and combine this with work schedule or calendar to determine when the user is likely to be commuting and then activate the “Commuting” Activity. The user can cause the CRC system <b>2102</b> to record their current location as a Place of Interest (POL). A POL may be the user's home, office, or any other location of interest. The recording of a POL can be initiated from a client device <b>2104</b>, from the web, or from another input device. A POL can be named by the user. The CRC system <b>2102</b> compares the user's current location to all the user's POLs and uses the result to determine the Current Activity. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may use the user's speed or velocity or the user's scheduling program/service location information to determine the Current Activity.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0315">The CRC system <b>2102</b> may calculate user Activity based on the hierarchical classification of their current location. For example, the CRC system <b>2102</b> finds the taxonomy of the user's location in a mapping database (e.g., Recreation−&gt;Sports−&gt;Golf−&gt;Golf Courses). Specific branches in this taxonomy may be associated with User Activities. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may recommend a new Activity be created when the user arrives (or spends a threshold amount of time) at a specific location (e.g., a golf course). The CRC system <b>2102</b> may recommend an Activity (new or existing) by prompting the user for a response through the client device <b>2104</b>. The user may enact the Activity or adjust call management directives. Due to the imprecision of location information, or due to other factors, there may be ambiguity in the location classification (e.g., a movie theater next to a restaurant). The CRC system <b>2102</b> may prompt the user to make a selection that resolves this ambiguity.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">Call Logs</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0316">The CRC system <b>2102</b> stores multi-network incoming and outgoing call logs <b>2120</b> for all Managed Addresses. The call log <b>2120</b> stores in a central location incoming and outgoing call logs for all of the Managed Addresses, and delivery devices <b>108</b> for a user. The call logs <b>2120</b> may be displayed on the client device <b>2104</b>. Telephone numbers and names in this call log may be integrated into the address book on the client device <b>2104</b>. They may also be transferred into lists that control the CRC system <b>2102</b>. For example, the telephone number from a particular call can be placed on the “VIP list” so subsequent calls from that telephone number are always be routed to the user (instead of being routed to voicemail when the user has designated themselves as “unavailable”). This information is collected by using network based triggers (signaling information) from the telephone switches <b>104</b> servicing the user's telephone numbers (Managed Addresses) and/or a delivery device resident application that detects, records, and uploads information about inbound and outbound calls. Call logs can be published to be viewed by a set of people.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">Other Management Directives of CRC System</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0317">Other client device <b>2104</b> or telecommunication service provider network parameters may be set by the CRC system <b>2102</b>, including ringer amplitude, ringer type, ring tone selection, ringback (what the caller hears when the phone is ringing), voicemail greeting, Caller ID (Number and/or Name) transmitted and others. The CRC system <b>2102</b> may use program logic executing on servers and/or on the client device to control these parameters; The CRC system <b>2102</b> may use the Current Activity, user location, or other system inputs to determine parameter values. For example, the client device ring type could be set to vibrate when the user is in a movie theater.</p>
<heading id="h-0046" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0268" num="0318">In the above description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0319">Reference in the specification to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0320">Some portions of the detailed description are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0321">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “processing” or “computing” or “calculating” or “determining” or “displaying” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0322">The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0323">The algorithms and modules presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatuses to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art, the modules, features, attributes, methodologies, and other aspects of the invention can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of the three. Of course, wherever a component of the present invention is implemented as software, the component can be implemented as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver, and/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of skill in the art of computer programming.
