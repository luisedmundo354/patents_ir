<heading id="h-0003" level="1">REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates to training devices and, more particularly, to an athlete training device for improving athlete hand-eye coordination during exercise regimens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Today there is a great emphasis on physical fitness. Popular with many people are boxing, kick boxing, karate and other martial arts which offer the practitioners both physical fitness and self-protection. Students of such self-defense arts often use pads that are struck with their hands and/or feet to improve hand-eye coordination and to improve their strength. These pads are usually held by the instructor or another student in the class.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are a number of drawbacks to this practice of having a second party hold the strike bag for another person. First and foremost, there is a possibility that the person striking the bag may do so with such force that they actually injure the person holding the bag, or they can accidentally misjudge the location of the bag and strike the bag holder. Another disadvantage, especially when the instructor is holding the bag, is that it is hard for the instructor to evaluate the striker's performance and form from behind the strike bag.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a need remains for an athlete training device in order to overcome the above-noted shortcomings. The present invention satisfies such a need by providing a training device that is convenient and easy to use, is portable in design, is safe to use and is versatile in its uses. Such a device allows the user to enhance their hand-eye coordination, strike speed, reflex responses, and their punching or kicking power. This advantageously helps the person to build their self confidence in preparation for athletic competitions and/or self-defense situations. The athlete training device helps a trainee to increase their ability to deliver accurate punches to a desired strike zone, which can conserve a lot of their energy over extended periods of time. Such a training device is also portable, conveniently allowing same to be used for training and recreational activities at a variety of locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an athlete training device. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention are provided by a rotatable training device for improving athlete hand-eye coordination during exercise regimens.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The rotatable training device includes a stationary base member that has a central aperture formed therein and is positioned directly on a ground surface. An elongated and stationary support member has a bottom end directly nested within the aperture and extends vertically upward therefrom. Such a support member has an axial bore formed therein. The axial bore extends through an entire longitudinal length of the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A mobile rectilinear rod has a fixed longitudinal length telescopically seated within the bore. Such a rod is centrally disposed above the base member and has a top end terminating at a location above and to an exterior of the support member. The rod includes a spring-loaded stop member that is directly connected to a bottom end thereof for effectively providing resilient support to the arm during exercise procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A circular dial is removably and rotatably positioned about the top end of the rod. Such a circular dial is seated directly on a top surface of the support member. The dial may have a diameter smaller than a diameter of the support member such that the dial effectively remains supported at equilibrium and along a horizontal plane while the arm rotates thereon. Such a dial preferably remains stationary when the arm rotates about a fulcrum axis defined along the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An arm is telescopically positioned directly about the rod in such a manner that the arm rests on the dial and remains spaced from the support member. Such an arm is selectively rotatable in clockwise and counter clockwise directions. The arm is rotatable along a 360 degree arcuate path. Such an arm has a flange portion radially extending from the rod and situated at a position beyond an outer perimeter of the base member such that the athlete can advantageously readily access the arm while remaining spaced from the base member. The flange portion of the arm preferably has an oval shape for effectively simulating a trainer hand during exercising procedures. Such an arm and the rod may be telescopically detachable from the support member so that the athlete can advantageously quickly disassemble the device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The arm preferably includes a stabilizing portion and a vertical portion monolithically formed therewith. Such a vertical portion has a bore formed therein that is arranged in such a manner that the vertical portion is telescopically and rotatably seated about the rod. The stabilizing portion is oppositely positioned from the flange so that the arm is advantageously and effectively prohibited from undesirably disconnecting from the rod when an upward force is exerted onto the punching pillow.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A plurality of padded punching pillows are directly affixed to front and rear sides of the flange portion. A plurality of protective covers are directly affixed to the punching pillows respectively. Each of the protective covers is detachable from corresponding ones of the punching pillows.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is noted the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiment set forth herein. Rather, this embodiment is provided so that this application will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the true scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The device of this invention is referred to generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref> by the reference numeral <b>10</b> and is intended to provide a rotatable athlete training device. It should be understood that the device <b>10</b> may be used to train for many different types of sports and activities, and should not be limited in use to only training martial arts type sports.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Initially referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>10</b> includes a stationary base member <b>20</b> that has a central aperture <b>21</b> formed therein and is positioned directly on a ground surface. An elongated and stationary support member <b>22</b> has a bottom end <b>23</b>A directly nested, without the use of intervening elements, within the aperture <b>21</b> and extends vertically upward therefrom. Such a support member <b>22</b> has an axial bore <b>24</b> formed therein. The axial bore <b>24</b> extends through an entire longitudinal length of the support member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, a mobile rectilinear rod <b>25</b> has a fixed longitudinal length telescopically seated within the bore <b>24</b>. Such a rod <b>25</b> is centrally disposed above the base member <b>20</b> and has a top end <b>26</b>A terminating at a location above and to an exterior of the support member <b>22</b>, as is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The rod <b>25</b> includes a spring-loaded stop member <b>27</b> that is directly connected, without the use of intervening elements, to a bottom end <b>26</b>B thereof and is essential for effectively providing resilient support to the arm <b>30</b> (described herein below) during exercise procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, a circular dial <b>28</b> is removably and rotatably positioned about the top end <b>26</b>A of the rod <b>25</b>. Such a circular dial <b>28</b> is seated directly, without the use of intervening elements, on a top surface <b>23</b>B of the support member <b>22</b>. The dial <b>28</b> has a diameter smaller than a diameter of the support member <b>22</b>, which is important such that the dial <b>28</b> effectively remains supported at equilibrium and along a horizontal plane while the arm <b>30</b> rotates thereon. Such a dial <b>28</b> remains stationary when the arm <b>30</b> rotates about a fulcrum axis defined along the rod <b>25</b>. The dial <b>28</b> has a central aperture <b>29</b> that is important for allowing the rod <b>25</b> to pass therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, an arm <b>30</b> is telescopically positioned directly, without the use of intervening elements, about the rod <b>25</b> in such a manner that the arm <b>30</b> rests on the dial <b>28</b> and remains spaced from the support member <b>22</b>. Such an arm <b>30</b> is selectively rotatable in clockwise and counter clockwise directions. The arm is rotatable along a 360 degree arcuate path, as is best indicated by the arrow <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This is a crucial feature for allowing a user to conveniently strike the padded punching pillows <b>40</b> (described herein below) from either side thereof. Such an arm <b>30</b> has a flange portion <b>31</b> radially extending from the rod <b>25</b> and situated at a position beyond an outer perimeter of the base member <b>20</b>, which is vital such that the athlete can advantageously readily access the arm <b>30</b> while remaining spaced from the base member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The flange portion <b>31</b> of the arm <b>30</b> has an oval shape that is critical for effectively simulating a trainer hand during exercising procedures. Of course, the flange portion <b>31</b> may be produced in a variety of alternate shapes for simulating other strike zones, like a torso or head to name a few, as is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Such an arm <b>30</b> and the rod <b>25</b> are telescopically detachable from the support member <b>22</b>, which is essential so that the athlete can advantageously quickly disassemble the device <b>10</b> for quick and easy storage or transport thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the arm <b>30</b> includes a stabilizing portion <b>32</b> and a vertical portion <b>33</b> monolithically formed therewith. Such a vertical portion <b>33</b> has a bore <b>34</b> formed therein that is arranged in such a manner that the vertical portion <b>34</b> is telescopically and rotatably seated about the rod <b>25</b>, as is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The stabilizing portion <b>32</b> is oppositely positioned from the flange <b>31</b>, which is crucial so that the arm <b>30</b> is advantageously and effectively prohibited from undesirably disconnecting from the rod <b>25</b> when an upward force is exerted onto the punching pillow <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, a plurality of padded punching pillows <b>40</b> are directly affixed, without the use of intervening elements, to front <b>35</b>A and rear <b>35</b>B sides of the flange portion <b>31</b>. A plurality of protective covers <b>41</b> are directly affixed, without the use of intervening elements, to the punching pillows <b>40</b> respectively. Each of the protective covers <b>41</b> is detachable from corresponding ones of the punching pillows <b>40</b>. Of course, the punching pillows <b>40</b> and the protective covers <b>41</b> may be produced in a variety of alternate shapes and sizes for effectively accommodating any alternately shaped flange members <b>31</b>, as is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the invention has been described with respect to a certain specific embodiment, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, with respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the present invention may include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation. The assembly and use of the present invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>
