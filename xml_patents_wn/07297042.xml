<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention which is the subject of this application is an improved and effective use of magnetic means within a toy, said toy being adapted, and shaped, to be attractive to a specific target audience within the general heading of “children”. It should therefore be appreciated that the invention as herein described will have a number of different applications and purposes in relation to toys and therefore, although the invention is described with regard to a number of different forms of toys, these in themselves should not be interpreted as being a limiting factor in the interpretation of the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The use of magnets and/or magnetically attractive material within toys to provide a particular effect in that the toy is well known and indeed, the applicant has a number of granted and pending applications which relate to inventive and novel uses of magnetic material. In the current application, the applicant provides a yet further inventive and novel application of use of magnets and/or magnetic material in the manner as will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, when providing a drive force to a particular item in a toy, there is a need to provide a power source and a motor. The motor, typically provides rotational movement, and is linked either directly to the portion of the toy to be moved or linked via a gear mechanism and/or other drive translation means.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically therefore the drive means for a movable portion is provided within the article itself and so, if there is required to be provided a number of articles which can be used in conjunction to form the toy, each of the articles is provided with a drive means assembly. While there have been significant improvements to drive motors, and power sources for the same, the provision of a drive means assembly is still relatively expensive in comparison to the cost of the remainder of the toy and therefore, while it may be desired to provide drive to all or the majority of the articles in a toy, it is frequently the case that the number of articles which have moving portions is limited or restricted due to the cost implications of providing drive means in each of said articles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The aim of the present invention is to provide a drive force for a number of articles of a toy which means that when the articles are used in conjunction, movement can be imparted from one drive means assembly provided in one of said articles. By achieving this, so the number of drive means which are required to be provided does not need to match the number of articles in which movement is required thereby allowing a reduction in the cost of the article and the toy as a whole while ensuring that the movement is provided as required. This arrangement can also be utilised to provide an unusual and unexpected affect for the child playing with the toy as the article or articles may appear to be moving without any visible or discernible drive source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a toy, said toy including at least two articles, a first article including a drive means assembly therein, said drive means assembly connected to move at least one magnet or a portion of magnetically attractive material at said article, the second article including at least one or magnetically attractive material positioned to allow magnetic attraction between the magnet and magnetically attractive material in the two articles when the articles are brought within a given range characterised in that when there is magnetic attraction, movement of the magnet or magnetically attractive material in one article, causes a change in condition of the said other articles via the movement of the magnet or magnetically attractive material in the other article.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The change in condition can, for example, be a movement of a portion of the article or the completion of a power circuit to cause a power supply to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, the drive means assembly includes a motor and a power source which can be electronic, or a clockwork mechanism for example. The drive means assembly may be provided to generate movement of the magnet or magnetically attractive material directly or via a gear mechanism of at least one portion in said first article.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment the magnet or magnetically attractive material in the said other article, is provided in connection, either directly or via a gearing mechanism with a portion which is movable in said other article.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an alternative arrangement, the drive means assembly of the first article does not move or change condition of any portion of the said first article but rather acts only as a drive means for said other article(s) via movement of the magnetically attracted magnet or magnetically attractive material in the respective articles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the drive means assembly can be provided to provide a moving magnet or magnetically attractive material at a number of locations on said article via linkages at a number of locations such that, when another article or articles is/are positioned in proximity of any of said locations, the movement force can be transferred to said other article.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the gear mechanism between the drive assembly and the magnet or magnetically attractive material on the first article and/or the gear assembly between the magnet or magnetically attractive material and a movable portion on said other article, can be such so as to alter the torque and/or extent of movement created.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A significant improvement of this application is that the magnetic field between the first and second magnets or magnetic material is transferred at a relatively high speed which means that the torque required for the transfer to be achieved is relatively low. It also means that with suitable gearing at the recipient article of the magnetic transfer the torque can be increased and the speed of rotation slowed down so as to provide the required movement effect at the required movement speed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the article within which the drive means assembly is provided is designated as a power source and a range of said other articles can be provided, each of said other articles being provided with a movable portion and/or other change of condition component and a magnet or magnetically attractive material to allow the movement from the power source article to be imparted to the particular selected further article which is brought into proximity with the same. Typically, each of said other articles includes a movable portion but the movable portions differ from article to article thereby allowing a range of different movements to be imparted and allowing the opportunity for selection to be made by the child playing with the toy.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the drive means assembly in the first article is linked to a number of locations at which there is supplied a magnet or magnetically attractive material which is provided to move under the influence of the drive means and a number of other articles are provided to be selectively positioned with respect to said first article at said locations thereby allowing, firstly, the user the option to choose and position said other articles as and when they require and also for said movement to be transferred to said other article.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, a movement effect is provided which is linked to the appearance of said first or further article and/or the location of said further article with respect to the first article.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment drive means assembly includes a drive control means which is movable between engaged and disengaged positions, at least the movement in one in one of the directions typically caused by the influence of the magnetic attraction between the two articles.</p>

As will be seen, located under the skateboard base <b>32</b> is a further magnet <b>34</b> also provided for rotation. This magnet is then connected via the gear arrangement <b>36</b> to the rear wheels <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> of the skateboard.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, when the drive means assembly is operated the magnet <b>12</b> in the first article <b>2</b> is rotated, and when the article feet <b>28</b> are placed onto the skateboard <b>20</b> location <b>26</b>, the magnets <b>12</b>, <b>34</b> in the respective articles are sufficiently close together so as to be attracted by magnetic force. As the magnet <b>12</b> in the article <b>2</b> is rotating and driven to do so, so the movement is transferred to rotate the magnet <b>34</b> in the skateboard. As a result, the wheels <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, linked by the gear arrangement <b>36</b> are moved. This therefore gives the impression to a child and an onlooker that the skateboard is moving under its own influence as the child knows that they have not switched on any power source or drive means on the skateboard itself.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning now to the other articles <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, they are both provided with attachment means <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and are both provided with magnetic material <b>46</b> or a magnet <b>48</b>. These two articles can be selectively positioned at the location <b>50</b> on the first article <b>2</b> which is provided with the magnet at that location. Thus, if the article <b>22</b> is positioned by the child on the article <b>2</b>, the magnet <b>14</b> is sufficiently close to the magnetically attractive material <b>46</b> on the article <b>22</b> so as to operate the magnetic switch. The completion of the switch allows, in this embodiment, the completion of an electric circuit <b>52</b> which includes power cells <b>54</b> as shown. Thus, although in this case power cells are provided in this particular article, they are not provided to cause movement and it is the magnetic attraction between the magnet <b>14</b> and the magnetically alternative material <b>46</b> which causes the completion of this switch and hence the illumination of the LED <b>56</b> within the article to give the impression of a light being switched on when the article is placed on the article <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the article <b>24</b> is positioned on the first article <b>2</b>, then the rotation of the magnet <b>46</b> provided on the article <b>24</b>, via the gear arrangement <b>58</b>, causes rotation of the barrels <b>60</b> of the gun thereby giving a more realistic feature to the same.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The article <b>2</b> is also provided with a switch <b>62</b> to allow the actuation of the drive means. This switch can be operated in a normal manner. It is obviously important that the orientation of the magnets or magnetically attractive material in the respective articles is correct to allow the required movement to occur and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one arrangement between the magnet of the first article <b>2</b> and the skate board.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a variation on the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in this case the article <b>150</b> is provided with a drive means assembly <b>152</b> and a second article <b>154</b> is provided to be attached to the first article via the hand <b>156</b>. The drive means assembly in this case has a power source in the form of a clockwork mechanism which comprises an external winder <b>158</b> connected to a winder mechanism <b>160</b> with gear <b>162</b> which meshes with a gear wheel <b>164</b> mounted on a shaft <b>166</b> for rotation. The shaft <b>166</b> also has mounted on the same a magnet or magnetically attractive material <b>168</b> adjacent the surface <b>170</b> of the article <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation there is provided a drive control means <b>172</b> in the form of a tab which is mounted on the shaft and which, when in an engaged position, contacts with a fixed tab <b>174</b> mounted on the winding mechanism housing <b>160</b>. This contact prevents rotation of the shaft and hence rotation of the magnet thus preventing winding down of charged clockwise mechanism of the drive means assembly. However, when the magnet or magnetically attractive material <b>176</b> of the article <b>154</b> is brought close to the article i.e. when positioned in the hand <b>156</b>, the attraction between the magnet and/or magnetically attractive materials <b>168</b>, <b>176</b> overcomes the biasing of the drive control means to the engaged position and causes the same to disengage from the fixed tab <b>174</b> and face the shaft and allow rotation of the shaft by the winding mechanism. The movement is indicated by arrow <b>177</b> and the rotational movement is transferred via the magnetic attraction of the other article such that the clockwork mechanism only rotates and hence can wind down when the other article is in proximity. In this cast the movement created is of the rotatable blade <b>180</b> via the linkage from the magnet <b>176</b>, gearwheels <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>, axle <b>186</b>, and gearwheels <b>188</b>, <b>190</b>, all of which only rotate under the influence of the rotation of magnet <b>168</b> when magnet attraction is created between the magnets <b>168</b> and <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>illustrate a further embodiment of the invention wherein there is shown the components of a toy excavator in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. The toy excavator includes outer housing components <b>64</b>, wheels <b>66</b> and a series of members <b>68</b> which are connected to a shovel or bucket <b>70</b>. The members are linked to a gear mechanism <b>72</b> which is provided within the housing and the gear mechanism in turn, is connected to a rotatable spindle <b>74</b> within which first and second magnets <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> are mounted. In this case, the first article is in fact a playbase <b>80</b> with the drive means assembly provided under the surface in a manner depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>where the drive assembly comprises a motor <b>82</b> connected to a power source <b>84</b> and with a rotating housing <b>86</b> in which first and second magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are provided. Typically the first and second magnets provide sufficient strength such that the magnetic field passes through the play base <b>80</b> and on which the other article, in this case in the form of the mechanical excavator, is positioned. Also shown is how the housing with the magnets <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> under the surface can be movable about the underside of the surface thereby causing the other article to move across the top side of said surface and the rotational movement of the housing is also attractive to the magnets <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> on the said other article thereby causing movement of the gear mechanism <b>72</b> in said article and hence causes the raising and lowering of the shovel or bucket <b>70</b> as the article moves across the surface. Thus, in this embodiment, the system provides a first movement component across the surface and then a second movement component of a portion of said article as it moves along the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A further embodiment of the invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>. There are provided a series of blocks, each of said blocks being cuboid in shape. Within the first block <b>100</b>, there is provided a drive means assembly (not shown) comprising a power source, a drive motor, an activation switch <b>102</b> and the drive motor is connected to first and second magnets <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> positioned adjacent the inside face of the side walls <b>108</b>, <b>100</b> respectively. In each of the other blocks <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, as sown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, there is provided a portion, the condition of which changes when an indicated part of said article is brought into proximity with either of the side walls. In block <b>112</b> there is provided a light source <b>116</b> which is normally off but can be switched on, said light source <b>116</b> connected to an electrical circuit <b>118</b> and having power cells <b>120</b> therein and a magnetically actuated switch <b>122</b> and in the other block <b>114</b> there is mounted, within a cavity in the same, an article, in this case a butterfly <b>124</b>, whose wings <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> move when actuated. The wings are connected via a gearing mechanism to a magnet <b>130</b> which is mounted for movement in a rotational manner adjacent a side wall of the same. Typically each of said further blocks <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> includes on the outer face of a side wall <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> at which the magnet or magnetically attractive material is mounted, some form of indication which is recognisable by the child so that the child knows to place that particular portion adjacent to the side walls in the said first article. Thus, in one use of the same, the drive means assembly is activated by the actuation by the child of the switch. This causes movement of the magnets at the said side walls and the first further block <b>112</b> with a light source <b>116</b> therein, is positioned by the child adjacent one of the side walls <b>108</b> so that the magnetic switch is put on and the electrical circuit to the power cells completed such that the light source illuminates either continuously, if the magnetic field is sufficient or, if the movement of the magnet within the said first block is over a sufficient distance, the magnetic switch may be placed on and off repeatedly thereby causing the light to flash on and off. At the same time or subsequently, the further block <b>114</b>, with the butterfly <b>124</b>, can also be positioned against the other side wall <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of the said first block in which the further magnet <b>106</b> is provided and the movement of that magnet is imparted to the magnet within the block and in turn the movement imparted via the gear mechanism to move the wings <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of the butterfly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although not shown, it is a yet further possibility in any embodiment that sufficient drive can be provided from the article with the drive means assembly to allow movement of a portion of a further article which is placed adjacent thereto and, for movement from said further article to be transferred to a yet further article to allow a further portion to be moved or conditions changed on said article and therefore it will be appreciated that a combination of said articles can be provided to have portions moved and/or conditions changed from a single drive means assembly.</p>
